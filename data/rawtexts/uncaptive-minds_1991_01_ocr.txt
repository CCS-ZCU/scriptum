He is currently affiliated with the Harriman Institute at Columbia University. The following interview appeared in the fall 1990 issue of the Polish quarterly Obóz and was conducted by Andrzej Ananicz. THE COUNTRY WITHOUT FRIENDS OB Recent coverage of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict has made it clear that although there are many specialists available to present the Armenian point of view, there are far fewer authorities to give an Azeri perspective. You are one of a small group of foreign scholars studying modern Azerbaijan. How did you come to be interested in this field? ŠWl^TOCHOWSKI At the University of Warsaw, I specialized in Turkish studies, which also covered Azerbaijan. I've also been interested in Sovietology for over twenty years. It is true that Azeri studies are virtually nonexistent when compared to Armenian studies. There are several reasons for this disparity. Above all, you have to keep in mind the very large Armenian diaspora. Far more Armenians live abroad than in Armenia itself. The Armenian diaspora — with a large middle class and intelligentsia — has developed a rich cultural and intellectual life and has thus been able to influence public perceptions in the West. With the Azeris, we have a totally different situation. Like the majority of the Moslem peoples in the Soviet Union, Azeris do not tend to emigrate. If an Azeri does leave Azerbaijan, he's more [pageend4]THE COUNTRY WITHOUT FRIENDS 3 likely to settle in Turkey, Iran, or another Soviet republic. There is no significant Azeri presence in the West. Most Westerners, in turn, have never heard of Azerbaijan. Another reason for the prominence of the Armenians in the West is their immense suffering during the last years of the Ottoman Empire. The rest of the world feels a certain culpability for having stood by as massacres took place, the same sense of culpability that the Holocaust arouses. Many people are therefore inclined towards a pro-Armenian view. And since the massacres of the Armenians were committed by Turks, and the Azeris are a Turkic people, mistrust of the Turks has been transferred to the Azeris. OB In your published works, two topics stand out: the social context of the Azeri-Armenian conflict, and the development of political thought in Azerbaijan. ŠWlIjTOCHOWSKI I think it would be more accurate to say that my work focuses on the ethnic conflict as a dimension of the process of social stratification over the course of the past century. As is the case with many ethnic conflicts, social problems are the underlying cause. Economic, cultural, religious, and linguistic differentiation often accompany social problems as well. The Azeri-Armenian conflict has its origins in a period of rapid economic growth tied to oil production in the Baku region. For a brief period, the Baku oil fields were the most important in the world. The Armenians took advantage of the new economic opportunities to a much greater extent than the Azeris did. The Armenians also had a well-established nationalist movement that forcefully expressed their goals — and that also stood as a de facto challenge to the Azeris. In 1905, conflict broke out and it continues to this day. But it would be misleading to talk about continuous conflict; there have been long periods of peace between these two groups over the years. OB How would you explain the outbreak of violence in 1905? ŠWlIjTOCHOWSKI Social and economic differences played the most important role. The Armenians were wealthier on the whole, better educated, and in every respect more influential than the Azeris. They had incomparably better contacts with Petersburg and, as Christians, they were more closely linked to the West in general. But in Baku they were a minority, having arrived only about a generation earlier. [pageend5]4 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRING 1991 Some suspect that the czarist government had a hand in provoking the events of 1905. Whether or not this is true, the fact is that, during the 20th century, trouble between the Azeris and Armenians has always occurred when the Russian state is embroiled in crisis and can't play policeman in the region. First there was the Azeri-Armenian clash of 1905 during the revolutionary upheavals of that year. Then came the wave of violence in 1918. And since February 1988 there have been repeated confrontations. OB Many in the West would like to see Moscow clamp down in the Transcaucasus to protect the Armenians. They argue that, without Russian control in the region, the Azeris would take advantage of their numerical superiority and invade Armenia. ŠWIffTOCHOWSKI I have no idea where people have gotten the idea that the Azeris are so aggressive. The Azeris have never launched a war, and as for the massacres, they were two-sided affairs. Would they try to crush the Armenians? I doubt it. Despite the Azeris' numerical superiority, it wouldn't be in their interest to attack. It's difficult to say precisely how many Azeris there actually are. Official statistics indicate that between 6 and 6.5 million live in the Soviet Union. Estimates of the number of Azeris living in Iran range between 9 and 15 million, but in some areas of Iran assimilation has gone so far that many people have no clear idea of their ethnicity. Whatever the number, there are substantially more Azeris than Armenians, and this simple fact can be seen as a threat to the Armenians. But one cannot say that the Armenians have been docile lambs while the Azeris are savage wolves. In recent clashes, the Armenians have been much better prepared militarily. Today, the national militia in Armenia numbers 100,000 people; it has no counterpart in Azerbaijan. OB How were relations between the two countries in 1918-1920? Could this period serve as an example for fiiture relations? ŠWlIjTOCHOWSKI The relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia were wholly normal. Though there was no talk of neighborly love — the memory of the pogroms was still very fresh — there were no serious problems or conflicts. Both countries were independent states guided by political common sense. Left to their own devices, they had to come to terms with geographic, economic, and historical realities; [pageend6]T hi E COUNTRY WITHOUT FRIENDS 5 one could almost say the two states complemented one another. The periods of peaceful coexistence and friendship have been significantly longer than the times of conflict. OB In recent years, the main issue dividing the Azeris and Armenians has been the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. The Armenians point to their numerical superiority in the region and to the fact that Nagorno-Karabakh was a part of ‘ ‘historical Armenia' ’for centuries. Does Armenia have a legitimate claim to Nagorno-Karabakh ? ŠWlIjTOCHOWSKI The first point is beyond dispute: for as long as we've had population statistics we know that the Armenians have been in the majority there. The second point is more problematic. I do not know how to define “historical Armenia,” particularly if we are talking about a geographic entity. Until 1918, neither Azerbaijan nor Armenia existed on the map. Nagorno-Karabakh belonged to a czar- ist administrative unit known as the Yelizavietpol Gubernia, which today is Gandzha. In 1918, Azerbaijan was created by combining the provinces of Yelizavietpol and Baku, so Nagorno-Karabakh became a part of Azerbaijan. Why was this region made part of Azerbaijan? Well, from a geographic and economic point of view Karabakh is connected with Azerbaijan, and its Armenian population is cut off from Armenia by the mountains. The leaders of a British expeditionary force that arrived in the Transcaucasus in 1919 also recognized that common sense dictated that Nagorno-Karabakh should remain a part of Azerbaijan — despite strong Armenian influence in Great Britain. OB Has the hostility between Azeris and Armenians served any constructive purpose? ŠWlIjTOCHOWSKI I think it has. On both sides, the conflict has mobilized society around national goals. In Azerbaijan, the Armenian threat became a symbol that has united the nation. Strong intra-Azeri religious and regional differences have been overcome in the face of this threat. At the beginning of the century, most Azeris didn't look any further than their village or town and had no sense of belonging to an Azeri nation. National consciousness was spurred in 1905 in response to the danger posed by the Armenians. However, when the Azeris started to organize around common goals, the Armenian threat became secondary. The development [pageend7]6 UNCAPTIVF MINDS SPRING 1991 of the nation, and the creation of an indigenous leadership and indigenous parties, became ends in themselves. The new leaders immediately tried to ease ethnic tensions. Talks with the Armenians took place and the two sides decided to cooperate; there were even plans for a Transcaucasian Federation. That idea has yet to be realized, but I'm sure it will surface again someday. OB Have the events of the past two years had a similar impact? ŠWlIjTOCHOWSKI Armenian claims to Nagorno-Karabakh have been the driving force behind the creation of a mass national movement in Azerbaijan, wholly unlike anything that has previously existed. A popular front took the lead of the movement after the local communists proved themselves incapable of guiding the nation in a time of crisis. There is now a new leadership and a new institutional framework developing outside the communist party. The similarities to 1905 are remarkable. Most importantly, the new leadership has sought to defuse the conflict with Armenia. One point should be kept in mind. The number of people killed since 1988 is much lower than in either of the two previous Azeri- Armenian conflicts, but the number of people who have suffered this time is incomparably larger. Huge numbers of both Azeris and Armenians have been expelled from their homes and forced to leave all their belongings behind. Some 250,000 refugees are living in unimaginably squalid camps in Azerbaijan, and 1 assume there is a similar number of Armenian refugees. OB If the struggle with the Armenians is no longer the principal issue uniting the Azeri national movement, what issue has taken its place? ŠWlIjTOCHOWSKI The Azeri Popular Front's program does not once mention the problems with the Armenians. It does, however, devote a great deal of attention to Azeris on the other side of the border with Iran. This alone indicates a substantial change in political outlook. More importantly, shortly after the massacre of Armenians and the subsequent occupation of Baku by Soviet troops in January 1990, a meeting took place between representatives of Armenian and Azeri independent organizations. The meeting did not produce any substantial results, but just the fact that a meeting was held is important. [pageend8]THE COUNTRY WITHOUT FRIENDS 7 OB What is happening within the Azeri Popular Front? ŠWI^TOCHOWSKI At the moment, the Azeri Popular Front is going through a crisis, though nothing out of the ordinary for such a movement. The Front brought together people of all shades of opinion, including communists, and some of its positions were rather contradictory. After the initial burst of excitement and passion, these differences became increasingly pronounced, and some sort of regrouping had to take place. Several groups have left the Front; my impression is that they have been able to function more effectively on their own. OB What sorts of debates are taking place among the Front's members? ŠWI^TOCHOWSKI The most important topic of discussion right now is the question of Azerbaijan's future: should it remain a part of the Soviet Union? If so, what should its status be? If not, what course will it take? There are those who favor some sort of tie to the Soviet Union in order to avoid having to choose between Turkey and Iran. The Sunnis do not want to join Iran. Intellectuals, who tend to have a secular outlook, are not eager to join Iran either, because they don't much like the idea of living under a religious dictatorship. There is wide support for joining Turkey, but Armenia stands between Azerbaijan and Turkey. About two-thirds of the Azeri population is Shiite, and many Shiites would like to join with southern Azerbaijan, which is part of Iran. Iran, however, is not likely to give up that territory to the Azeris. Even if the Azeris were to get southern Azerbaijan, living standards there are significantly lower, and there would be all sorts of problems. OB The Azeris are said to be deeply embittered by the critical view many in the Soviet Union and the West hold of them. Did you encounter evidence of this during your recent trip to Baku? ŠWlijTOCHOWSKI Yes, very distinctly. Unfortunately, this has contributed to the growth of religious fundamentalism in Azerbaijan. I have to emphasize again that public opinion in the Soviet Union and the West is the result of ignorance. It is therefore crucial to inform the public of what's really going on in the Transcaucasus, as well as explain the origins of the conflict. [pageend9]LITHUANIA interview with FRANCOISE THOM Francoise Thom is a journalist and sovietologist. She was invited to Vilnius in early January 1991 by the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Lithuanian Parliament to help plan a training institute for legislative representatives from countries emerging from communism. She was interviewed for Uncaptive Minds by Józef Darski upon her return from Lithuania on January 16, three days after Soviet troops occupied several key sites in Vilnius, including the television tower, killing at least 14 people. MOSCOW'S GAME PLAN HAS FAILED UM How were relations between the government of Prime Minister Kazi- miera Prunskiene, who resigned on January 8, 1991, and the group around Lithuanian Supreme Soviet President Vytautas Landsbergis? THOM Relations between parliament and the government had been strained for some time, and the situation was getting worse. Parliament was becoming more radical, while the government, composed mainly of communists and ex-communists, remained conciliatory towards Moscow. Thus, the position of the Lithuanian Freedom League, which denounced Ms. Prunskiene's government practically from the start, was gaining ground in parliament. The attack on the television tower and the events that preceded it were an acid test of the true loyalties of Lithuanian politicians.

Photo: Tomasz Kizny/Dementi [pageend11]10 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRING 1991 The issue of price increases — the so-called “price reform’ ’ — touched off a sharp debate at the end of December. On December 29, the parliament decided against the price hikes because of the extreme tensions that had gripped the republic. It was clear that Moscow was orchestrating these tensions. Parliament was not against the price reform per se, but, because the reform was poorly designed and it was not part of a coherent overall strategy, it decided to postpone a decision. On January 7, however, the people of Lithuania awoke to find that prices had quadrupled. It was a sort of government putsch, because parliament knew nothing about it. The price hikes were simply a communist maneuver intended to alienate the population from Lithuania's legitimate authorities, in preparation for the real coup that Moscow had planned for later. This interpretation was confirmed by a Soviet officer, Colonel Alksnis, whom I interviewed a few days before the crackdown. When I asked him what role the army was to play in stabilizing the political situation in the Baltic countries, he told me, “The army will have nothing to do. The people themselves will sweep away the governments and the parliaments.” Moscow's game plan was plainly visible behind Colonel Alksnis's frank words: to engineer the overthrow of the supposedly bourgeois-nationalist government by means of a workers' and peasants' rebellion. UM Prunskiene's predominantly communist government refused to resign despite increasingly frequent demands for it to do so. In the face of pro-Moscow, communist-organized Interfront demonstrations, it suddenly resigned on January 8, leaving the stage bare for the entrance of the Committee of National Salvation. THOM Moscow's game plan was to make people believe, as Gorbachev said, that the Baltic governments were no longer capable of governing, and that they needed Moscow's “brotherly help” to restore order. Hence, the obviously KGB-perpetrated attacks in Latvia and all the other provocations instigated by Moscow. People say it was Gorbachev who gave Prunskiene the order to resign during a conversation on the eve of the Interfront demonstration. UM So the “good” communists pretending to be Lithuanian nationalists and the “bad” communists who remained loyal to Moscow joined forces. Is it safe to say that the communist members of the Lithuanian government, who, by the way, were selected for their posts by the noncommunist majority in parliament by virtue of their [pageend12]MOSCOW'S GAME PLAN HAS FAILED 11 patriotic and anti-Moscow declarations, have played their assigned roles and can now depart? THOM The government's resignation was part of Moscow's game plan. The idea was to show that Lithuania had no government and was plunging into anarchy, and that it was necessary to impose direct presidential rule to maintain order. But beginning on January 8, Moscow's game plan went awry. First, the parliament immediately voted to abrogate the price increases. Later that day, the people of Vilnius responded to President Landsbergis's call to disperse an Interfront mob that had surrounded the parliament building and broken a window and a door. I think Moscow underestimated Landsbergis's popularity; it had been deceived by the numerous polls that ranked Ms. Prunskiene and Lithuanian Communist Party First Secretary Algirdas Brazauskas ahead of Landsbergis in popularity. When I interviewed Brazauskas's deputy Vladislav Shved, I understood that the Committee for National Salvation was not intended to take over, but to serve as a political bogeyman that would make direct presidential rule appear a moderate alternative — a typical communist maneuver. Placing Gorbachev between two extremes made him appear a conciliatory force intent on avoiding bloodshed and civil war. The communists portrayed events as a confrontation between nationalities, when in fact it was a confrontation between, on the one hand, all the peoples of Lithuania, and on the other, the communists. Russians, Poles, and Jews stopped me on the street to tell me they were on the Lithuanians' side. Thus the initial game plan failed, though Gorbachev continues to speak as if he succeeded. The entire episode would be comical were it not for the violence. One effect of this operation has been the cleansing of Lithuanian political life, because the traitors, those who worked for Moscow in nationalist guise, came out into the open. UM Are any members of the Committee of National Salvation known? THOM Only the spokesman, Juozas Jermalavicius, a CPSU historian. In my opinion, the Committee only exists on paper. UM So the communists lost control of the Lithuanian government... [pageend13]12 Photo: ELTA A Soviet tank on the streets of Vilnius, January 13, 1991. Onlookers try to save a man trapped beneath a Soviet tank during the attack on the TV tower in Vilnius, January 13,1991. Photo: ELTA [pageend14]MOSCOW'S CAME PLAN HAS FAILED 13 THOM Everything went wrong for Moscow. The Kremlin's actions vastly increased President Landsbergis's popularity in Lithuania and throughout the world. His prestige within the Soviet Union also grew. UM How did the minister of internal affairs, Marijonas Misiukonis, an ex-KGB man in whom the Lands berg is group put so much faith, behave? THOM Misiukonis put his services at the disposal of the Committee of National Salvation. UM How did people respond to the attack on the TV tower? Were they prepared to resist, or was resistance considered pointless? THOM Over the last several weeks, during which the Lithuanian people have been subjected to terrible psychological pressure, expecting tanks and paratroopers to appear at any moment, the spirit of the original anticommunist resistance has returned. Those who guarded the parliament day and night sang the songs of the partisans who fought the occupiers for years after World War II. Many people told me that they would rather die than see Bolshevism restored. UM Are the Lithuanians ready to wage an armed struggle? THOM I believe part of the population would be, if it had the weapons. UM No one is willing to compromise with “moderate” communists? THOM There is a pronounced wariness of communists, including those claiming to be socialists and nationalists. The population supports President Landsbergis, and is even pushing him further in his “nonconstructive attitude,” as Moscow would put it. UM What was President Landsbergis's role in the events? Can we say he passed the test? [pageend15]14 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRING 1991 THOM During these difficult days, Vytautas Landsbergis has been the soul of the resistance in Lithuania. People cried when they listened to him on Kaunas radio. He was equal to the historic moment. UM Sajudis was often paralyzed because it was made up of both “nationalist” communists and anticommunists. Attempts to create an anticommunist faction within Sajudis or to prohibit communist membership failed. Nor have the anticommunist political parties succeeded in firmly establishing themselves; on the contrary, they have grown weaker of late. Is the Lithuanian nationalist movement failing to keep up with events? THOM There is a political crisis in Lithuania, as in all countries emerging from communism. Sajudis is transforming itself. It is becoming more radical because most of the cryptocommunists are leaving it. The anticommunists are taking control. This process began with the formation of the Prunskiene government, which was composed mainly of communists who had infiltrated Sajudis. As soon as they left to form the government, Sajudis became more radical. UM Who really held power during the events? THOM President Landsbergis, of course. The communist-imposed curfew came to nothing. It was not like in Baku. Most people had the impression that the military wasn't really trying; the country continued to function as before, except there was no radio or TV. In Kaunas, a tank crushed a car with a woman and two children inside. The woman died. However, the army did not take the Kaunas radio station, although they could have. In all the cities, the embryonic Lithuanian army, the Territorial Protection Squadrons, were surrounded by Soviet paratroopers. UM Why didn 't the Soviets use the means at their disposal to crush the independent Lithuanian state? THOM Either the whole thing was dreadfully mismanaged, like everything Gorbachev does, or there were other interests involved. [pageend16]MOSCOW'S GAME PLAN HAS FAILED 15 UM It seems that it was in someone's interest that Lithuania not be completely isolated, that the outside world know what was happening in Vilnius. The communists do not normally operate this way. THOM That's right, they don't. I cannot help thinking of the Timisoara scenario, of what happened at the end of Ceausescu's reign. The whole affair smacks of provocation. We will have to see what happens. If Gorbachev falls, we will see who was pulling the strings. UM That wouldn't make Gorbachev any less responsible for the massacre. THOM Of course not. No one should believe the official explanations. The whole game plan was probably formulated in advance by Gorbachev. The edicts he has published since last September — on the protection of party property and monuments to Lenin, for example — are part of this plan. Minister of Defense Yazov's speech, in which he proclaimed the military's right to defend itself, made the intent behind Gorbachev's words unmistakable. UM Why did Gorbachev attack Lithuania first, when Latvia, with its enormous Russian minority, would seem a more inviting target? THOM I believe that Gorbachev has a personal dislike for Landsbergis. In an interview, Gorbachev said that it was possible to come to an agreement with anyone but Landsbergis. Gorbachev's hatred for the Lithuanian people may also play a part, due to the reception he received when he visited the country back in January 1990. UM Why did Moscow take action before the Gulf War began? THOM The game plan called for the forces involved to wait a fortnight between the price increases and the fall of the government, but the failure of the price maneuver forced Moscow to intervene earlier. UM What is your assessment of the West's reaction? [pageend17]16 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRING 1991 THOM For Lithuanians, it has been much too weak, but it was in fact stronger than anticipated. The US reaction leaves something to be desired, but the Scandinavians have been remarkably firm. France and Germany, as usual, have behaved pitifully. UM Do you think the reactions of the postcommunist countries, which have also left much to be desired, are indicative of how independent they are of Moscow? THOM Of course. The events in Lithuania were a test for them, too. UM Now that it's clear the thaw has ended in the Soviet Union, should all aid — including humanitarian aid — be stopped? THOM Yes, it's the only way to influence the communists. Mere declarations have no effect whatsoever. [pageend18]UKRAINE interview with VYACHESLAV CHORNOVIL Vyacheslav Chornovil is chairman of the Lvov District Council and a delegate to the Ukrainian parliament. Monika Agopsowicz interviewed him for Uncaptive Minds in Kiev in October 1990. THE UKRAINIAN PIEDMONT UM Has communist control over the flow of information been loosened? CZORNOVIL I think it's first necessary to point out that Ukraine is not homogeneous. There are three distinct regions. In western Ukraine, national consciousness is well developed and there is a high degree of political independence. Central Ukraine is moving in that direction. Eastern Ukraine, on the other hand, is highly sovietized and politically indifferent for the most part. I'm from western Ukraine, so I'm best informed about the situation there. Information flows freely in western Ukraine. We have several independent publications that are published legally, including For a Free Ukraine, a Lvov daily that has been published since July 1990. It advertises all the smaller independent publications that are published unofficially. Until very recently, all of our publications were printed in the Baltic states. Now they're printed here, and with luck we'll have our own printing shop soon. Censorship was lifted in August 1990. Many publications are thoroughly anticommunist, including a few official ones. Besides For a Free Ukraine, the independent publications include the Lvov evening newspaper City Hall and the journal of the National Movement of Ukraine, The National Paper. The book market, on the [pageend19]18 THE UKRAINIAN PIEDMONT other hand, is more problematic. Democrats have yet to gain a foothold in the state publishing houses. I should point out that where democrats control the press, state censorship has not been replaced with ideological censorship from our side. I'm constantly criticized in our papers. That's the way an independent press should function. Anyway, when independent candidates won the elections to the Lvov District Council, the obstacles to publishing an independent newspaper suddenly disappeared. We now have the capacity to print 200,000 copies of our papers, and soon we'll be turning out 500,000 copies. UM You founded the first independent information service in Ukraine. What has happened with it? CZORNOVIL I started the Independent Ukrainian Publishing and Information Cooperative in 1989. My idea was to circulate information in the same way the press does in free-market economies, and that included getting paid for my services. We have held discussions with Radio Liberty and the London-based Ukrainian Press Agency on exchanging information. There is also another independent information agency in Ukraine, called Respublika, which is run by Sergei Naboka. UM Do independent activists in western Ukraine have access to other media ? CZORNOVIL We are in control of television. I make one call, and I get air time. Other opposition activists can do the same. Recently, Yaroslava Stechko, the president of an emigré group called the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, made a fifteen minute appearance on Lvov television; it was unprecedented. Television broadcasts are becoming increasingly diverse, and the people in cities besides Lvov — in Tamopol and Ivano-Frankivsk, for example — are seeing them. Our access to radio, however, is much more restricted. All in all, western Ukraine has achieved a degree of independence and democracy comparable to that in Poland, Hungary, Czecho-Slovakia, and the Baltic states. We are a free people. The extremely difficult living conditions at the moment are a burden, but, I repeat, our part of Ukraine is completely free. It is the Ukrainian Piedmont. [pageend20]UKRAINE interview With YEVHEN PRONIUK Yevhen Proniuk is president of the All- Ukrainian Society of Persecuted People and a member of the presidium of the Kiev city council. The following interview was conducted for Uncaptive Minds by Monika Agopsowicz in Kiev in October 1990. HISTORY IS WORKING TO OUR ADVANTAGE, BUT VERY SLOWLY UM What are the aims of the Ukrainian Society of Persecuted People? PRONIUK The Society is dedicated above all to protecting the rights and interests of the victims of the totalitarian communist system: men and women who were imprisoned, exiled, deprived of their homes, or denied jobs. Our members have spent years in prisons, labor camps, and psychiatric hospitals. Some of them were among the first victims of the Bolsheviks, others were only recently released. Many have yet to be rehabilitated. We are working for the recognition of their civil rights and, as far as possible, to provide them with material support. Rehabilitation is a form of moral compensation, but financial compensation is needed too. Victims of repression receive monthly payments of 50 rubles [$2]. Many lost all their property and their homes. Unfortunately, the communist authorities have been very reluctant to rehabilitate political prisoners, so we have made little progress in this area. UM Does the Society have more general political aims? [pageend21]20 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRING 1991 PRONIUK So far as possible, our members are participating in the struggle for an independent and democratic Ukraine. We are delighted that the people of Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany were able to free themselves from communist rule, and our most fervent wish is for the same changes to take place in Ukraine. But we haven't achieved this goal yet, and it isn't likely we will be able to do so any time soon. Those countries were better prepared for democracy than we are. Sovietization has gone much further in Ukraine, except maybe in the western part, Galicia, which wasn't incorporated into the Soviet Union until 1939. Anything that wasn't ruined or corrupted after 250 years of czarist rule has since been finished off by 70 years of communism. UM Yet change has been taking place in the Soviet Union... PRONIUK But power is still in the communists' hands. The communists might not be as omnipotent or as openly aggressive as they used to be, but they still rule. Take the allegedly democratic elections in Ukraine: the communist party contrived to guarantee itself a majority in the Ukrainian parliament. As a result, the resolutions of the independent minority are either ignored or sabotaged. The executive branch is also controlled by the communists and is just as obstinate. My own experience as a member of the Kiev city council is another case in point. There are three members of the city council who were political prisoners: Mykola Horbal, Zinovy Antoniuk, and myself. That we're members of the council is itself a sign of change; nonetheless, the transformation of our political system is taking place extremely slowly. Recently, for instance, we protested during a city council meeting against holding a military parade to celebrate the October Revolution. We argued that the parade was part of Moscow's imperialistic policies and would give Moscow an opportunity to intimidate the Ukrainians. Our proposal to ban the parade was rejected. People in the West have to understand that the situation in Ukraine is very complex. It seems that many Westerners think that democracy has already arrived here. But that's just not the case. UM How, then, would you assess the prospects for the democratic movement? [pageend22]HISTORY IS WORKING TO OUR ADVANTAGE 21 PRONIUK There are a number of restrictions on the democratic movement. We do not have mass-circulation papers: independent newspapers have print-runs of only ten to twenty thousand, a wholly inadequate number when you consider that Ukraine has a population of 52 million. (In this respect, the situation is far better in western Ukraine.) The democrats have reasonable access to radio, but it's virtually impossible to get air time on television. The other day, a group of independent MPs had to storm the studios to get on the air. History is working to our advantage, but very slowly. The communists are well aware that the tide has turned against them, but they are trying hard to shore up their hold on power; if necessary, they'll try martial law or even a military coup. I'm afraid that if the situation becomes critical, they won't hesitate to use all the means at their disposal to crush the democratic movement. The apparatchiks throughout the Soviet Union, all 18 or 19 million of them, are fighting instinctively to preserve the empire. They're now trying to keep the empire together with a new union treaty between the Kremlin and the republics. And they want to impose this so- called treaty on us. The situation is becoming tenser all the time. In the meantime, we will continue to use peaceful parliamentary means to work for independence. We know that this will be a long, slow process. But as the struggle goes on, we will be able to raise national consciousness in eastern and central Ukraine, where it is not as strongly developed as in western Ukraine. UM There have been rumors that Bohdan Klymchak, one of the last of the Ukrainian political prisoners, has been released. Has he? PRONIUK A member of our Society, Henryk Altunian, announced at the second congress of Rukh [the Ukrainian Popular Front], which was held a few days ago here in Kiev, that Klymchak had just been released. So I sent a telegram on behalf of the Society to the commander of the Svyesvyatskoye camp asking about Klymchak's health and whereabouts. In response we were informed that he was in the camp and in good health. This was not quite true, since we know that during the past five months Klymchak has been held in a cell at a hard-labor prison camp. An official confirmed that Klymchak was being held in camp 35 of the Perm district — I served a sentence at the same camp. We received another telegram more recently that simply read: “Prisoner's state of health satisfactory. [pageend23]22 Photo: Bohdan Chmielnicki A demonstrator in Kiev holds a sign that reads “Ukraine, Wait! A New Union Treaty?” [pageend24]HISTORY IS WORKING TO OUR ADVANTAGE 23 Klymchak was imprisoned under Brezhnev. He had written some works critical of the regime and he had copies of these works with him when he illegally crossed the border into Iran. That was back in 1978; the Shah was in trouble, but still in power. Under the terms of the Soviet-Iranian extradition treaty, Klymchak was returned to the Soviet Union. For illegally crossing the border he could have been sentenced to three years. Since he had his writings in his possession when he was caught, he was charged with crossing the border with ‘ ‘intent to subvert the government’ ’and sentenced to fifteen years in a prison camp and five years of internal exile for “betraying the fatherland.” [The Warsaw office of the Ukrainian Press Agency announced on November 12, 1990 that “a member of the Committee for the Defense of Bohdan Klymchak, Volodymyr Yavorsky, informs the public that a telegram addressed to the Committee has arrived in which Bohdan Klymchak confirms his release from the Perm prison camp and expresses his thanks to all who helped his cause. In the near future, Klymchak will visit Kiev and Lvov.”] UM You, too, spent some time in prison camp. What was your ‘ ‘crime ’ ’ ? PRONIUK I was arrested on January 14, 1972. There was a massive roundup in Ukraine that day. At the time, I was employed at the Institute of Philosophy of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. Several colleagues and I were brought in for “Anti-Soviet propaganda and agitation.” I was sentenced to seven years in a camp and five years of internal exile. Fortunately, I wasn't exiled to Siberia with the others, but to Uzbekistan instead. The climate there is warmer: I prefer 100-degree heat to 50-below cold. I also had good relations with the locals, the Karakalpaks, Kazakhs, and Tatars. In 1978, our group in zone 35 began publishing the “Chronicle of Current Events.” It's now considered an historical document. UM What has the Society of Persecuted People accomplished? PRONIUK I think we can be proud of our role in helping free a number of Baptists and Seventh-Day Adventists. We also helped a Jewish man who had been unjustly charged with murder. One of our major activities has been our “expeditions” to preserve and protect the sites where the remains of Ukrainian political prisoners are buried. In late August 1990, members of the Society [pageend25]24 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRING 1991 visited three places where mass executions had been carried out: Vorkuta, Pechora, and Inta. The purpose of this trip was to locate the graves and to determine, so far as possible, who was buried in them. We succeeded in exhuming some remains. The body of Vasyl Stus, whose poetry is extremely popular in Ukraine, was brought back to Kiev; he died in the Kuchimo-Perm district in 1985. Many of the graves are completely unprotected. Some are being covered by roads or houses. During the August expedition, we erected crosses at twelve sites. Each has a plaque in Ukrainian that reads “Here lies a victim of the communist regime. Fallen for the freedom of Ukraine.” A film about the trip was made and first shown in September. UM How is the Society organized? How large is its membership? PRONIUK We meet every six months, as stipulated by our statutes. So far, three general assemblies have been held. Four hundred people, young and old, participated in the most recent general assembly, which issued an “Appeal to the Ukrainian Nation.” The appeal reads, in part, “Do not allow the communist dictatorship to crush our renewal. Join with the democratic organizations calling for an independent Ukrainian state. We call on all democratic forces and all believers belonging to all Ukrainian churches to unite. Protest against the new union treaty — an attempt to prolong the yoke of bondage in a refashioned empire.” The Society has about 600 members, but since millions of Ukrainians suffered repression at one time or another, the potential membership is enormous. At an open meeting we conducted in December 1989, for instance, 10,000 people showed up despite freezing weather. The Society operates on a volunteer basis. We can't always make use of everyone, though, and there's a limit to just what we can accomplish. UM Does the Society have its own publications? PRONIUK One of our most important goals is to make the public aware of the unique experiences of the political prisoners. We have assembled an enormous body of documentation, mostly memoirs of former prisoners. We intend to use this material as the basis for a series of books on individual prisoners as well as the general topic of [pageend26]HISTORY IS WORKING TO OUR ADVANTAGE 25 political repression. We also put out a monthly journal entitled “Zone.” UM What's the significance of that title? PRONIUK The camps were referred to as “zones.” The way we see it, the camps are the small zones and the country as a whole is the big zone. Our hope is that Ukraine and the other nations subjugated by the Soviet empire will be able to move beyond this zone. UM Are your members active in other independent organizations? PRONIUK Some of the most active members of our Society have long participated in independent organizations and political groups. They include Levko Lukyanenko, leader of the Ukrainian Republican Party, and other activists such as Mikhaylo and Bohdan Horyn, Vyacheslav Chomovil, Oles Shevchenko, and many others. UM Are you or the other members of the Society still persecuted by the authorities ? PRONIUK My safety is by no means guaranteed even though I'm a member of the city council. A “guardian angel” has been coming to public meetings with me. I know that the authorities are still keeping files on all of us, and I wouldn't be at all surprised if the KGB has us under surveillance. Two members of our Society — Maria Olets and Volodymyr Aleshchenko — reported on the current situation in Ukraine at the International Human Rights Conference in Leningrad. Though mass repression is no longer practiced, human rights are by no means respected. Many people still lose their jobs or are refused employment for criticizing those in power. We refer to these people as the “second echelon of political prisoners.” Back in Camp 35 during the 1970s, some of us discussed the idea of holding something along the lines of the Nuremberg trials. We thought — and I still believe — that Bolshevism must be brought to justice, that those who perpetrated crimes in its name must come to trial. But such a trial can only take place after Bolshevism has been vanquished, and that hasn't happened yet. [pageend27]YUGOSLAVIA NOTHING MORE IN COMMON by Christine von Kohl Christine von Kohl, a Vienna- based journalist, wrote the following article for Uncaptive Minds in January 1991. What was Yugoslavia? A misunderstanding, as far as their participation is concerned, say the Slovenes; a deception, maintain the Croats, referring to the Serbs; the continuation of our tragic history of losing victorious battles, argue the Serbs, with both 1918 and 1945 in mind. No one knows today what kind of “third” Yugoslavia will arise, or whether this country will simply disappear and be replaced by a colorful palette of small states. Just as uncertain as the final outcome is whether the process itself will occur in a bloody or peaceful fashion. All possibilities are still open, including the prospect of a Balkan war. From the moment of its birth in December 1918, Yugoslavia was a miscarriage. The “state of the south Slavs” encompassed not only non-Slavs such as Albanians, Germans, Romanians, Hungarians, Gypsies, and others, but also Slavs belonging to three different religions: Serbian Orthodoxy, Roman Catholicism, and Islam. The Orthodox used the Cyrillic alphabet, the Roman Catholics the Latin alphabet, while the Muslims were taught Arabic in their Koranic schools, which in many cases were their only educational institutions. The Serbs had risen again and again through the centuries against the “Turkish yoke,” finally winning their independence in the first half of the 19th century. The Croats and Slovenes had reconciled themselves to Austrian rule until the middle of the 19th century, when German romanticism swept through the intellectual circles in the eastern regions of the monarchy, giving rise to visions of Illyrian, South Slavic, or pan-Slavic territorial greatness. With the creation of the dual monarchy in 1867 and the subsequent subordination of Croatia to Hungary, the old Hungarian-Croatian rivalry received new nourishment, a [pageend28]NOTHING MORE IN COMMON 77 development that strengthened Croatian nationalism. This nationalism was still strong in 1918, at the birth of the “first” Yugoslavia; continued to dominate Croatian politics in 1941, when a separate Croatian state was established with Hitler's and Mussolini's help; and is the reason why the newly elected president of the Croatian Republic, Franjo Tudjman, is leading Croatia to independence. When the Western powers acted as midwives to Yugoslavia's birth between 1917 and 1919, they still believed they were dealing with the offspring of loving parents. Serbian, Croatian, and Slovenian politicians, mainly emigrants, including King Peter I Karadjordjevic, had cooperated to bring about the union. Unfortunately, it soon became apparent that the infant suffered from birth defects. The Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, Yugoslavia's name at the time, was dominated from the start by the Serbian military, the Serbian police, and the Serbian army. Only an understanding of the workings of political democracy and a readiness to put them into practice could have compensated for the prejudices, ambitions, fears, and emotions of the newly united peoples. Such understanding, however, was in short supply. In July 1921, a communist murdered the Serbian interior minister; in 1928, three Croatian representatives were shot in parliament; in 1929, King Alexander — the son of Peter, who had died in 1921 — proclaimed the establishment of the “Kingdom of Yugoslavia” and soon thereafter introduced dictatorship. Political parties were banned, opposition politicians were imprisoned, and newspapers were censored. In 1934, Alexander was assassinated. The perpetrator was a Macedonian, and the instigator was the Croatian Ustashi movement, which had been founded in 1929 under Italian and Hungarian influence by Ante Pavelic. The Ustashis would later commit heinous crimes against Serbs, Jews, and Gypsies during their short stay in power from 1941 to 1944. Croats and Serbs still remember the horrifying events of the war years. The Croatian Catholic and Serbian Orthodox Churches, for example, remain irreconcilable. The “second” Yugoslavia was the work of the victorious partisans commanded by Tito, who imposed communist rule on the country. Exploiting the revulsion felt for the horrors of the civil war, which had taken place simultaneously with the war of liberation against the troops of the Axis powers, the communists rode to power on slogans of “brotherhood and unity” for the new state. Tito's partisans seemed to embody this ideal, for their members belonged to all the nations and national minorities of Yugoslavia. Tito and his comrades, however, failed to create a common Yugoslav national identity. Instead, they created a patchwork state of national republics separated by borders that had never existed in the past, thereby sowing the seeds of future conflicts. Tito's enormous personal authority, together with the power of the secret police, kept these conflicts below the surface. But as soon as he died, they reasserted themselves, and it was not long before the [pageend29]28 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRING 1991 whole structure of “self-governing socialism” began to unravel. The divisions were — and are — numerous: between the republics, between groups affiliated with prominent individuals, between regional economic interests and extensive mafias, and, last but not least, between the various nationalities and national minorities. One must admire the degree to which Tito and his talented diplomatic emissaries succeeded in portraying Yugoslavia in a favorable light. Beginning with his break with Stalin in 1948, Tito was a favorite of Western politicians, who treated him almost like an ally. For the West, Yugoslavia was indispensable, both as an intermediary between NATO and the Warsaw Pact within the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, and between North and South in the non-aligned movement. Edvard Kardelj's concept of self-governing socialism — i.e. joint decision-making not only in the factories but also in the country's entire socio-political system — excited the Left in the West. The Right found Tito useful because it could demonstrate its liberalism by supporting him. No one made the effort to look behind the facade. Tito's friends looked the other way when he imprisoned tens of thousands of Yugoslavs, many of them former partisans. The Yugoslavs themselves closed their eyes and above all held their tongues. When, in the early 1960s, Tito became the first communist ruler to normalize travel across his borders, the West heaped further praise upon him. Tito's motives, of course, were very pragmatic. He had to create a safety valve for millions of unemployed. No one in the West seemed to notice that Yugoslavs working abroad had to report all of their contacts with foreigners, that letters were censored and telephones tapped, that the law on “verbal offenses” led to numerous convictions, that cynically arranged political trials were commonplace, and that the Church and professional groups were intimidated. The outside world also failed to take notice of Tito's irrational economic policies. The state invested fantastic sums in prestige projects that to this day are practically useless and that will never become profitable. In Bosnia, Macedonia, and Kosovo, on the other hand, peasants continue to practice archaic methods of farming and animal husbandry. Illiteracy has not been eliminated, nor has electrification been extended throughout the country. The young have no prospects for the future. However, largely because young people have long had access to such things as jeans, American cigarettes, all kinds of Western literature, and travel abroad, the opposition never developed into a significant threat to the regime. The regime also sought to win the favor of intellectuals by employing classic Soviet methods. It even courted intellectuals from other communist countries, during a period when Tito strove to become a model within the socialist camp with his non-Stalinist self-governing variant of communism. For this reason, the party gave the Praxis philosophers free rein in the late 1960s. This [pageend30]NOTHING MORE IN COMMON 29 group organized an international summer school that accepted Marxist and non- Marxist philosophers. Discussions on new interpretations of Marxism incorporating ontology, Christianity, and Trotskyism created an aura of intellectual freedom in Yugoslavia. When the Praxis group became more critical of the government, the regime unleashed an infamous smear campaign against the scholars. Professors were hounded from their teaching positions — but it was too late. Students of these professors quickly became much more critical than their mentors. Many of today's well-known opposition politicians have come from their ranks. What happened after Tito's death? Initially, nothing. It was the Slovene communists who were the first to comprehend that the country could no longer be governed without the cooperation of the people, above all young people. They slowly began to permit the expression of unorthodox opinions in student and youth publications, which like all other publications were firmly in the hands of communist-controlled organizations. First came criticism of the Tito cult, then discussion of the right to conscientious objection to military service. Other taboo subjects were broached. Whoever believed that such views might fall on fertile ground in the other republics was not familiar with the walls that had been erected between the republics, even between good neighbors like the Slovenes and the Croats. Eventually, Slovenia was the first Yugoslav republic to declare its independence and sovereignty despite the Serbian economic boycott and military threat. In Croatia, the communists stubbornly stuck by the party line. The high point of the post-Tito orthodoxy was probably the publication of the “white book” against Serbian intellectuals, which accused them of Western decadence and betrayal of the socialist revolution, and admonished the Serbian communist party to take corrective actions. The author of these recommendations, the university professor Stipe Suvar, was regarded as especially progressive by the Western left. Among other things, he became Croatia's representative in Yugoslavia's collective state presidency. Suvar wanted to overcome the alienation between the Croatian communist party and Croatian intellectuals. But his opportunism made them think. Today, almost all of the new political parties in Croatia were founded by former prisoners. For example, the president of the republic and leader of the Croatian Democratic Movement, Franjo Tudjman, was put on trial twice and sentenced to many years of imprisonment. Croatia has inherited a special problem from the Tito era: some 600,000 Serbs live in the republic. The problem became urgent a few months ago, when the Serbs in the town of Knin in Dalmatia, an area where 90% of the population is Serbian, demanded and then proclaimed their autonomy. As justification for their behavior, the Serbs contended that they felt threatened by the fanatical nationalism they claimed had been awakened by the new Croatian leadership. Some Serbs compare the Tudjman government to the Ustashi regime [pageend31]30 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRING 1991 and accuse it of planning another genocide of the Serbian nation. The Serbian- dominated Yugoslav army and the president of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, publicly support this position. The Knin affair is symptomatic. First of all, the region is urgently in need of aid and planning, which are not being provided. It is difficult to tell whether the lack of support from republican authorities is the result of anti-Serbian sentiment, as the Serbs contend, or if it is the result of the republic's economic problems. Second, the Serbians of Knin remember the massacres committed by the Ustashis. Third, the Serbs have resided in Knin since the middle of the 16th century, when the Austrian Emperor Ferdinand I moved them into the region along with other refugees fleeing from the Turks to shore up the Habsburg Empire against the Ottoman Empire. These “bordermen,” as they were called, were famous for their bravery, and received special privileges. The Serbs also had privileges in Tito's Yugoslavia. The communists in Croatia could depend on them, and they were thus given the most important tasks; although they only make up 15% of the republic's population, they constitute 60% of the Croatian police force, and they dominated in the judicial system, the economy, and also in the Croatian communist party. That the Croats are now taking advantage of the opportunity to take positions away from the Serbs is regrettable, but it is quite understandable. Some Serbian families are now in a difficult situation, but they are not facing “genocide,” as is so frequently claimed. After initially overreacting, the Croatian government has repeatedly signaled its willingness to talk. It has also established an investigative commission composed mainly of Serbs. The Knin Serbs, however, have refused to take part either in the commission or in discussions, although one should point out that not all of the Serbs in this region agree with the radical and provocative behavior that has been forced upon them by Belgrade. The problem is that Slobodan Milosevic needs conflict to achieve his goals. He has stated: “For us Serbs a confederation cannot be considered. A confederation is not a state. It is unthinkable that Serbs would live in other states. All Serbs should live together in one state, in Serbia.” The case of Knin makes Milosevic's goals clear: here a Serbian territory was created in the midst of the Croatian state. In the name of consistency, the same type of approach will have to be used in Bosnia-Herzegovina. There, Serbs, Croats, and Muslims live together as component nationalities. The latter are classified as a distinct ethnic group, an invention of the Tito era that actually makes some sense. All three of these groups realize how precarious their existence is as a result of the current chaos in Yugoslavia. Following the first free elections, which took place in the winter of 1990, they decided to rule in a three-party coalition. The Muslim lawyer Alija Izetbegovic (who was a victim of the political trials in Sarajevo in the early 1980s) became the president of Bosnia-Herzegovina. If Milosevic had his way, about half of this republic's territory (mainly Bosnia) would be [pageend32]NOTHING MORE IN COMMON 31 incorporated into Serbia. The Croatians could then lay claim to most of Herzegovina, and the Muslims would be deprived of a homeland. Serbian nationalist circles claim, however, that the Bosnian Muslims are in fact Serbs who converted to Islam under duress during the Turkish occupation. Historically, this was more or less the case, but it doesn't make any difference today: there are no indications that the Muslims wish to live within Serbia as Serbs. Macedonia has already been put in a precarious situation by the Serbs. On the one hand, no one there has forgotten the brutality with which the Serbs in the interwar period Serbianized the Bulgars and Macedonians of this region. (The Serbians' attitude is manifested, among other ways, by the refusal of the Serbian Orthodox Church to recognize the Autocephalic Macedonian Orthodox Church.) At the same time, however, Macedonian nationalists are also worried about the rapid growth of the Albanian population in Macedonia, which is demanding political equality. Recent elections resulted in a clear Albanian majority in some regions, and Albanians now occupy important positions at the local level. For some time, the Macedonian communist party appeared to vacillate as to whether it should accept Serbian offers to help it solve the Albanian problem. In December 1990, however, it unexpectedly proclaimed Macedonian sovereignty. Immediately thereafter, Slovenia and Macedonia agreed to establish close economic ties — a move which seems to be a serious defeat for Milosevic and his group. Alarm signals are also emanating from the formerly autonomous province of Vojvodina, where the arrogance of Milosevic's recently established puppet government has upset the ethnic harmony of this miniature multinational state. Vojvodina's Romanians and Hungarians were told publicly: “Go home where you belong if you don't like it here. We don't need you....” Extensive minority rights in the areas of language policy, education, and the media have been restricted. Only the government of Montenegro, Yugoslavia's smallest and most underdeveloped republic, declares itself to be in complete agreement with Milosevic's pan-Serbian ambitions. So far, I have listed the factors that have brought Yugoslavia to the brink of civil war. There are factors, however, that make civil war unlikely: hardly anyone in the republican leaderships would be willing to accept responsibility for it, and if the Yugoslav army intervened in one of the republics, it would not be able to claim that it was doing so for the common good of Yugoslavia. Nonetheless, as the most recent crisis meetings of the state presidency have demonstrated, the republics of Yugoslavia have increasingly fewer interests in common. Not a single federal institution has any authority any more. Not a single republic is adhering to its constitutional obligations. Even the fate of the dinar as the all-Yugoslav currency is in jeopardy. The most dangerous situation is in the formerly autonomous province of Kosovo. Slobodan Milosevic captured the emotions of his countrymen by por[pageend33]32 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRING 1991 traying the Albanians of Kosovo as the enemy. The government-controlled Serbian media have reported extensively on the brutal evictions of Serbian families by Albanians, on the rape of Serbian women and girls by Albanian men, and on other acts of terror and violence perpetrated by Albanians. The Serbian media claim that Albanians want an ethnically pure Kosovo, and that they are working towards unification of Kosovo with Albania. Serbs regard Kosovo as the cradle of Serbdom. In the Middle Ages, Kosovo was the center of a great Serbian empire that lasted nearly a hundred years. Few Serbs, however, found it necessary to visit this “holy place.” The anti-Albanian campaign has been far-reaching and completely unjustified. Step by step, the Albanian population, which in 1974 was guaranteed autonomy, has been denied nearly all of its national rights. Factories, the university, hospitals, schools, and local governments have had their Albanian leaders and managers replaced by Serbs. In the schools, Serbian and Albanian children have been segregated and in some villages Albanian children have even been denied entrance to school buildings and have had to be taught outside. The Albanian daily newspaper, the Albanian radio station, and the Albanian television station have been suspended. The Albanians of Kosovo, in contrast to the Serbs of Croatia, are hardly exaggerating when they speak of “cultural genocide.” Moreover, Serbian policemen in Kosovo have been forcing their way into houses, restaurants, and schools; many Albanians have been beaten or detained for no good reason. More than 50,000 Albanians have lost their jobs during the last year and receive no unemployment benefits. Many of the Albanian unemployed are being evicted from their apartments without warning; Serbs move in after they're gone. One need look no further than official government statistics to see that the reported wave of violent crimes against Serbs in Kosovo is a total fabrication. These statistics prove that, quite to the contrary, the Albanian population is displaying admirable discipline in the face of numerous provocations. The political leadership of Kosovo, which up to now has enjoyed the confidence of its population, has succeeded in preventing the Albanians' pent-up hatreds from exploding. But this hatred is building, and no one knows how long it will remain in check. Albanian emissaries in Europe and the United States have sought to win sympathy for the Albanians' plight and support for a peaceful solution of the conflict. They have received nothing more than statements of intent from a few governments. The Serbs, on the other hand, are exploiting the world's preoccupation with the crises in the Persian Gulf and the Soviet Union to ruthlessly pursue their policies. The Croats and Slovenes are offering asylum to fleeing Albanians, but they are not giving them any meaningful political support. The Kosovo Albanians are encouraged by the process of reform that has begun in Albania itself — a process that may even lead to democracy. A democratic Albania, however, may be more sensitive to the fate of Albanians across the border in Kosovo, and that could mean war with Serbia. Is that what Europe is waiting for?

Published by the Foreign Policy Research Institute 3615 Chestnut Street Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104 [pageend35]BULGARIA THE SYSTEM REMAINS UNCHANGED by Sergei Baruh Sergei Baruh is a free-lance journalist based in Sofia. He wrote the following article for Uncaptive Minds in January 1991. It is little more than a year since the 35-year reign of the Bulgarian dictator Todor Zhivkov came to an end. The same cannot be said of 45 years of communist rule. In June 1990, the first free elections in four decades did not bring the fledgling opposition to power. The Bulgarian communists, who hastily renamed themselves “socialists,” secured a majority in parliament. They failed, however, to win the two-thirds majority required to force through legislation on important matters. Two successive communist cabinets have had to step down; currently, Bulgaria is being ruled by a virtual coalition government. Yet the democratic forces have failed to gain a commanding position in either the executive or the legislative branches of government. The previous, allcommunist cabinet was forced to resign not because of pressure from the parliament, but as a result of a general strike. As for the judiciary, it was in thrall to the party-state and will have to be rebuilt practically from scratch. The steps taken towards privatization and a market economy have been negligible, while the drop in production is so great (about 30%) that the word “crisis” understates the situation, which would more aptly be called an “economic collapse.” In short, Bulgaria's political and economic system remains essentially unchanged. Why is this so? Before we answer this question, it should be pointed out that Europe's interest in the problems of Bulgaria is not merely academic. The Soviet empire is approaching its end, and the grim consequences of its disintegration could affect all of Europe. Thus, Western Europe will need a cordon sanitaire — a role that history has assigned to Eastern Europe. [pageend36]THE SYSTEM REMAINS UNCHANGED 35 The Balkans are perhaps the most important link in this cordon. Standing at the threshold of Asia, the Balkan peninsula has been the target not only of communism, but of the empires and fanatical movements of the East as well. The standards of European civilization can serve as an antidote to both, but these standards require the establishment of at least a minimal level of prosperity. Each of the four communist states in the Balkans faces a different situation. Romania and Albania are at the very beginning stages of the evolution from totalitarianism. Yugoslavia was the first to introduce some elements of a market economy, but may soon cease to exist as a peacefully unified state. This instability may cause the whole of Europe a great deal of trouble. The pro-Soviet regime has picked Bulgaria clean, reducing it to the level of an underdeveloped Asian nation. If the general pauperization continues, there will be dangerous political consequences: a despotic regime perhaps even more tyrannical than the previous one could come to power. The chain of states in the Balkans forming the cordon sanitaire will lose a crucial link. But let us return to the question of why the communists won the first free elections in 45 years. First of all, political change was not brought about through the efforts of a large part of society — much as in 1878, when the troops of the Russian Emperor freed Bulgaria from Ottoman rule, or in 1944, when the Red Army annexed Bulgaria to Stalin's empire. Zhivkov was deposed by a group of senior communist officials whose only goal was to preserve their own power and privileges, and who were prepared to introduce nothing more than cosmetic Soviet-style reforms. However, they misjudged the intensity of popular hatred for the old regime. An opposition, the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), was promptly formed. To the surprise of those behind the coup, the UDF refused to become their puppet. The demise of Zhivkov's regime awakened part of the nation, but not all of it. Intellectuals make up the nucleus of the opposition, people who simply refused to put up with communist oppression any longer. This opposition chose a strategy that could have succeeded in Hungary, Czecho-Slovakia, or Poland, but not in Bulgaria. (Those countries, whose attempts to rebel against communism in 1956, 1968, and 1980 were violently suppressed, had already been thoroughly disillusioned by socialism.) The Bulgarian opposition organized loud public rallies, called for an immediate U-turn in every sphere of life, and obsessively cited the West as an example to follow. Yet, many Bulgarians were wary of ideas they deemed “imported.” The opposition's other mistake was to underestimate the problem of the Turkish minority. In the regions of the country where ethnic Turks constitute a significant proportion of the population, the local Bulgars tended to vote for the party that in their eyes personified Bulgarian authority, that is, the communist party. The communists set great store by the inertia and fear of the man in the street. Here are some figures from the June 1990 elections: more than 50% of the electorate with no more than a primary-school education voted for the [pageend37]36 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRING 1991 Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), while 25% voted for the UDF; a third of high- school graduates voted for the BSP and nearly half for the UDF; of university graduates, 36% cast their ballots for the BSP and 55% for the UDF. A poll taken after the elections showed that 22% of those under 25 voted for the BSP; 69% of all voters under 45 voted for the opposition, while 55% of those over 45 voted communist. The opposition is slowly but surely gaining ground in parliament. This process has not been at all smooth, which is only natural: for one thing, the members of the opposition have no political experience, and for another, the UDF is a conglomerate of various political parties and movements whose interests often do not coincide. Moreover, the BSP, which is still essentially a totalitarian force, has not yet been dismantled and continues to take advantage of every error committed by the democratic opposition. The communists are doing everything in their power to delay the adoption of legislation designed to launch Bulgaria on the road to a market economy, though they realize they cannot use delaying tactics forever. This is why they are trying to dominate the privatization process and take over as much state property as possible: they want to ensure their economic supremacy after they have lost political power. The local authorities, who until recently had not been affected by the changes, are contributing to the efforts of the central apparat. These local holdovers from the old regime are beginning to be replaced by provisional executive bodies. This is a considerable success for the opposition. However, further progress at this level of government is essential. In this regard, the municipal elections, scheduled for the spring of 1991, will require the opposition's full attention. The people of Bulgaria are only now awakening and beginning to build a civil society. Surveys of political sympathies conducted after the parliamentary elections do not tally with the distribution of seats in the National Assembly. This is not only because the BSP did not fulfill its election promises for a smooth transition to democracy and a market economy, but also because the BSP led the country into an economic catastrophe. Shortages of basic foodstuffs are so severe that even rationing no longer guarantees enough to eat. State-owned shops are empty, while free-market prices have skyrocketed: since last year, the price of onions has risen twentyfold, and meat is four to six times more expensive. The prices of other foodstuffs, consumer goods, and basic services have also risen dramatically. Gasoline queues stretching for miles were a familiar sight over the last few months until the beginning of January, when most filling stations shut down for lack of gas. And a tankful of gasoline purchased on the black market costs as much or more than the average monthly salary. The gasoline shortage has dealt a severe blow to an important part of the economy. Bulgaria is home to a flourishing home-canning subculture, which far surpasses its equivalents in Western countries. Every autumn the cellars of the country's dreary prefabricated apartment blocks are chock-full of canned [pageend38]THE SYSTEM REMAINS UNCHANGED 37 fruit, vegetables, and meat. The produce comes from the small plots that were left to the peasants after their land was forcibly collectivized in the late 1940s. These tiny plots supply more than a quarter of the country's agricultural output. For those who had no relatives in the rural districts, there were the relatively cheap peasant markets. But the present gas shortage has virtually severed the traditional supply lines between the town and the countryside. As a result, the canning subculture has all but collapsed, depriving people of an important source of food. These shortages have alienated the population from the communists but have not yet made them embrace the UDF. The rule of law, a market economy, human rights — these concepts seem much too abstract to most people. The strata of the population whose social and moral degradation have been carefully nurtured by the communists easily fall prey to the most vulgar and vicious brands of populism. Political life has long been usurped by compromised government institutions, and now people are instinctively wary of any officially established organizations. The BSP has taken advantage of this situation — and of its exclusive access to interior ministry files — by dragging out the skeletons from the closets of some of the opposition leaders, not all of whom managed to avoid being in some way compromised during the long years of totalitarian rule. [For example, UDF chairman Petar Beron resigned on December 4, 1990 after he was accused of having been an informant.] Furthermore, while the opposition's supporters are not prepared to follow their leaders blindly, the communists' supporters have been conditioned to act as a united and disciplined “iron cohort.” In Bulgaria, links to the time when a normal economy existed have not been completely severed, as they were in Russia. The Bulgarian peasant — though he may now live in an urban ghetto — remembers his bams, his fields, the trees that grew on them, and what life was like when he made a living as an independent farmer, and he's fond of telling his children about these things. He has never reconciled himself to the violence committed against him and his land. He wants his land back despite communist propaganda that claims he does not. The regime points out that only 30% of the peasants are in favor of unconditional privatization, but fails to mention that another 41% would like to own land while remaining members of a collective farm. The desire to have it both ways can be attributed to typical peasant caution: Is it prudent, after all, to reject out of hand the easy life of the collective farm with its many opportunities for unsanctioned enrichment? The enactment of a fair land-reform law is the most important task of this parliament, and its members are well aware of this: the bill under consideration was compiled from fourteen different drafts, and has been referred to various parliamentary committees, often more than once, for further revision. The future of other vital pieces of legislation, such as the property, privatization, and trade laws will largely depend on the principles underlying the [pageend39]38 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRING 1991 land-reform act. These laws will in turn influence the way the nation votes in the next parliamentary elections, which are scheduled to take place soon after the municipal elections in the spring. Bulgaria will be able to rejoin the family of civilized nations only if it restores its economy, especially the agricultural sector. This cannot be achieved without radical restructuring — as well as Western assistance. The key word here is assistance. We don't need charity. Clearly, Western assistance will depend on political guarantees and, above all, on our bidding farewell to the communist oligarchy. That is, in fact, the main problem that the coming elections should solve. [pageend40]ROMANIA interview with GEORGE SERBAN George Serban is a writer and the chairman of the Timisora Society. Irena Lasota interviewed him in January. TIMISOARA IS DIFFERENT UM Why is Timisoara so different from other Romanian cities? You started the revolution and came out with the Timisoara Proclamation (see the May-June-July 1990 issue o/Uncaptive Minds,). More than any other city you keep up the fight for democratization. You also have the best-organized opposition, clean streets, a good local leadership, and meat in the stores. SERBAN It all began on December 16, 1989, when we went out on the streets and started the revolution. What the people of Timisoara have in common is one week of fighting during which we were all together: workers, intellectuals, men, women, Romanians, Hungarians, Germans. We all saw the tanks, the bullets, the dead and mutilated bodies. After what happened, we couldn't be afraid any more. This, perhaps, is the secret of our strength and our solidarity. UM But why did the revolution start in Timisoara? SERBAN Because it was the only place psychologically ready for a revolution. Because here we all had a sense of history. We always knew we belonged to Europe — that we were once at its center — and we resented being cut off from it. [pageend41]40 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRINC 1991 In other cities, only the elites had the feeling of having been deprived of something. In Timisoara, workers didn't want just to eat and sleep. You said yourself we had better living conditions than in the rest of Romania. And still we started the revolution. Because we needed more than that to live. UM Were the majority of Timisoara's residents bom here ? SERBAN No, that is another mystery of Timisoara. People who come here are taken by the city. They stay here and become true Timisoarans. I am from Ploesti, but I am a Timisoaran. Also, Timisoara is far away from Bucharest, thus it was far from the Central Committee, from Ceausescu. Their policies were implemented here, but with more difficulty, against silent resistance. UM In Bucharest, people talk about the last years before the revolution as if they had been living in an emotional and political desert. They stopped talking to each other, reacting, protesting. Had all the civic links been broken here as well? SERBAN No, even in the last, darkest years of Ceausescu's rule it was different here. People couldn't take it anymore, and they said so. An army officer angrily told me that the revolution started in Timisoara because the party was the weakest here and the local party secretaries did not properly explain the theses of the Fourteenth Party Congress to the rank and file. It's a funny explanation, but the truth is that ideology was never that deeply rooted here. UM There are cities that have experienced great historical events that create a special atmosphere. Like Budapest in 1956 and Gdansk in 1980. SERBAN Yes, we compare ourselves to Gdansk, although none of us would like to become Walesa. Perhaps Timisoara also suffered from the greatest contrast between hope and reality. In many other cities, people had lost hope for a better life. Timisoarans also had a different concept of freedom, political life, and even everyday life. [pageend42]41 “We take pride in organizing the demonstrations well...

Photo: Ladislau Gagyi Photo: Ladislau Gagyi [pageend43]42 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRING 1991 UM In Bucharest you do not get the same feeling ofpurposefid activism that you get when you walk into the offices of the Timisoara Society. The Society squeezes into two small rooms that are usually filled with more than a dozen people. But there is no chaos, no sense of wasted energy. People seem to be working on concrete tasks. If it wasn 't for the antiquated office equipment, you would think you were in the United States and not in Eastern Europe. In many other places in Romania, including the offices of the opposition, you feel the legacy of a system where everything was ordered from above. If you ask a secretary to collate documents, she will do so, but if you don't explicitly tell her to do it, she will sit in front of a heap of papers, doing nothing, waiting for somebody to give her orders. In the Timisoara Society's offices, this is not the case. It's as if the people of Timisoara have the sense that by doing even small things on your own, you can change the situation, or at least your own life. The streets of Timisoara give much the same impression as the Timisoara Society's offices. They’re cleaner, nicer, looked after. You do not feel the same passivity here as in Bucharest. SERBAN Again, I would say this is because in Timisoara there are no strong intellectual elites that explain the meaning of everything and tell people what to do — and complain that there ate not enough people to realize their bright ideas. We believe that there is no time for lecturing: we are all learning by doing things. If you want another indication of the difference between Timisoara and the rest of the country, note that the results of the May 20th elections were the opposite in Timisoara of what they were in the rest of the country. The National Salvation Front (FSN) got only 32% of the vote in Timisoara as opposed to over 60% in the country as a whole. Our city supports the continuation of political change in Romania as well as disclosing the names of and punishing those guilty of crimes. As a punishment for our political stand and especially for formulating the Timisoara Proclamation, the authorities are squeezing our city by pressuring other Romanian enterprises to break their contracts with enterprises in our city. Our factories are often idle because of the lack of raw materials or spare parts. UM When and why was the Timisoara Society founded? SERBAN The Timisoara Society was created in January 1990 by journalists and writers, but now its main strength lies in its worker membership. [pageend44]TIMISOARA IS DIFFERENT 43 By February 1990, political life had largely disintegrated, the National Salvation Front was engaged in a disinformation campaign, and the political parties were weak — so we came out with the Timisoara Proclamation, which became a kind of revolutionary program. Revolutionary but peaceful. Many people assumed that the revolution culminated on December 22 with the fall of Ceausescu. But the Timisoara Society launched the idea that the revolution must be taken further in order to transform Romania. The Proclamation gave structure, a program, even a goal to the opposition in Romania, and advocated the creation of an alliance of opposition groups. This became known as the Timisoara Alliance. I think that the Timisoara Society embodies the spirit of Timisoara; this is why people support us more than the political parties. UM One of the important activities of the Timisoara Society is the publication of Timisoara, which has now become a daily. SERBAN Our journalists publish a genuinely free and independent paper. They go on the streets and to the factories to speak with ordinary people about their everyday problems. These people feel protected by the paper. When a strike begins, the strikers call Timisoara first. We act not only as a paper, but also as a public service bureau. UM How is the Timisoara Society organized? SERBAN We have different commissions. For example, there is one devoted to human rights. When someone suffers an injustice, he can come to us. We provide lawyers — free of charge if the victim can't afford the legal fees. The human rights commission also organized the first Romanian conference on human rights. We also have a public health commission in which very good doctors participate. The commission organized the first shelter for the homeless. We also organized soup kitchens for the poor. We appealed to workers' cafeterias to give leftover food to people who need it. In the public health commission we are also working on providing homes for the elderly and the handicapped. The commission that gets the most publicity is called the Citizens' Forum. It deals with the security police, the Securitate and its successor, the SRI (Romanian Intelligence Service). The Citizens' Forum started when 47 labor leaders, armed with about [pageend45]44 Photo: Ladislau Gagyi “What the people of Timisoara have in common is one week of fighting... We all saw the tanks, the bullets, the dead and mutilated bodies.” A corpse disinterred from a mass grave at the Saracilor cemetary in Timisoara, December 22, 1989. [pageend46]TIMISOARA IS DIFFERENT 45 20,000 signatures, came to the Timisoara Society demanding to know the truth about the Securitate and demanding to be given access to the files the Securitate kept on them. The Securitate refused to open the files and said that they had been moved to Bucharest. So, we started to produce our own documentation. This commission has had a lot of work to do. Twelve people work at it full time. They compile testimonies of people who suffered at the hands of the Securitate before, during, and after the revolution. As a result, we have come to a better understanding of the structures and the work of the Securitate, and we have uncovered the names of many of those responsible for the brutality and repression. We are keeping files on these people. We have learned that many moved from the Securitate to the SRI. The work of the Citizens' Forum is part of the reason why a smear campaign was launched against the Timisoara Society. We are accused on radio, television, and in FSN newspapers of being paid agents, mainly of the Hungarians, but also of other countries. Nobody in Timisoara believes this because people here know the truth, but this is not the case in the rest of the country. UM Are people afraid to talk about the repression they suffered? SERBAN The fear comes in waves. Right after the December revolution, people opened up; many wanted to speak out, to give testimony. But later, when the government reasserted itself, people became scared again, and their fear grew worse after the June events [when armed miners directed by the Securitate attacked students and other oppositionists]. So in September, the Timisoara Society decided that it was time to help people to show more courage. We held a mass meeting on the subject of overcoming fear. I, for my part, wrote an article entitled “We Are Not Scared,” which appeared in the one hundredth issue of Timisoara. At the meeting, there was a huge poster that read ‘ ‘There is no liberty without courage. ” Right after that meeting, people started to speak out again. Even witnesses at the trial of people accused of starting the killing in Timisoara in December 1989 started to testify with more courage. It is really a pity that only Timisoara has an organization like the Citizens' Forum. Every city needs such an organization to fight the security police, which is still a threat. In other East European countries, the security police survived the revolutions and in many cases continues to exist. We believe the same thing is happening in Romania. [pageend47]46 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRING 1991 \ UM What do you do with the files you are collecting on members of the security police? SERBAN We are planning to publish a white book based on the documents we have. We have partial documentation of the December 1989 events in which we have tried to establish who gave the orders to shoot, how many people were killed, and who organized the display of the corpses from the morgue [the same corpses were shown repeatedly to make it appear that more people were killed than was actually the case]. It has been very difficult to gather this evidence, but many courageous people work with us. What people need most is truth. UM The Timisoara Society also has a reputation for being the best organizer of public meetings and rallies. SERBAN We take pride in organizing the demonstrations well. The first meeting was held in defense of Smaranda Enache, a woman from Tirgu Mure§ who fights for Romanian-Hungarian dialogue and who was in real danger. The second meeting was against the miners' invasion of Bucharest in February 1990. The third one was in support of the Movement for the Democratization of the Army, and the fourth on the release of the Timisoara Proclamation. The University Square demonstrations in Bucharest held last April were initiated in solidarity with Timisoara. Our street rallies have attracted tens of thousands of participants. They are usually held on Opera Square, the symbol of the revolution. We do not prepare leaflets because we have no photocopiers or duplicating machines. These meetings are always very orderly. We have our own security guards, who at the beginning were soldiers. We have also established a tradition whereby workers come to our meetings together, carrying banners with the name of their enterprises, so the authorities cannot claim, as they did in Bucharest, that people who attend opposition rallies are golani (hooligans). These banners also embarrass the authorities, who still profess an ideology in which the workers are a superior species and are supposed to support the regime. UM Tell me more about the events of recent weeks. [pageend48]TIMISOARA IS DIFFERENT 47 SERBAN On December 11, 1990 a national congress of students was held in Timisoara, at which a strike was declared. Three days later, the Elba factory joined the strike. Elba was also the first factory to go on strike the year before. The main demands were economic, but there were political ones as well. The strikers demanded the truth about the December 1989 and June 1990 events, the resignation of President Diescu for his part in them, and publication of all their demands. The students went to the factories, persuading workers to go on strike. On December 14, several other factories went on strike, and within a few days there were 14 enterprises on strike. On December 16 there was a large meeting in Timisoara at which representatives of all political groups and organizations spoke. As always in Timisoara, the meeting was not friendly to the FSN and Iliescu. Television showed only the most radical and the least sophisticated speakers. Then on December 17, the parliament held an Orwellian hate session directed against Timisoara. One after another, the deputies launched into violent attacks against us. It was like a grotesque cabaret, directed against the spirit of Timisoara. That session of the parliament was broadcast on what was a day of mourning in Timisoara. It was a silent, terrible day; people cried on the streets remembering last year's dead. When we saw the hate session in parliament, it produced a rebellious frame of mind together with feelings of community solidarity. Even the FSN members from Timisoara sided with us. On top of that, televsion coverage of the events of December 16 in Timisoara made believe that they had actually happened on the 17th. This so incensed people that the entire city joined in the strike. The national media said nothing about the strike in Timisoara at first. Finally, after a few weeks, when the city was already exhausted, two journalists from Romania Libera, an independent paper, came to Timisoara and wrote about the strike. One cannot really blame the independent press. The national airline was on strike and the train from Bucharest takes about ten hours; moreover, there were many events at that time, including the anniversary of the revolution, the arrival and the expulsion of the King, and Christmas and New Year's celebrations. When the two journalists from Romania Libera wrote about what was happening in Timisoara, the rest of the country started to support us. But by that time, four weeks after the strike had begun, the workers and the entire city were so weakened that the labor leaders decided to go on a hunger strike, while telling their members to go back to work. [pageend49]ROMANIA THE DECLARATION OF THE CIVIC ALLIANCE The following text was released by the Civic Alliance on November 15, 1990. As of early March, the Civic Alliance has opened branch offices in 28 Romanian cities, and its founding declaration has been signed by about 200,000 people. Wc are founding the Civic Alliance at a •time when Romania appears in the eyes of the world to be a profoundly disillusioned country. The Civic Alliance intends to struggle steadfastly and patiently so that every citizen feels responsible for the country's future, whatever his or her personal interests might be. The Civic Alliance struggles for genuine reforms whose implementation does not discredit the very idea of reform. I. The current price liberalization is a false economic reform because it was not preceded by essential measures such as: genuine privatization of the means of production and the creation of new jobs; the restitution to the peasants of land taken from them, which should have been accomplished through the immediate passage of a law on land ownership; the passage of legislation guaranteeing the security of foreign investment; the reform of wages and of mechanisms protecting citizens' rights. To create the conditions for a genuine and credible debate on the economic situation, the Civic Alliance demands that all data on the current state of the [pageend50]THE DECLARATION OF THE CIVIC ALLIANCE 49 national economy be made public, including the state budget, foreign debt, the status of property rights, the value of productive enterprises, and the state of the money supply and resources. The whole nation should also be informed about important economic transactions and the reasons for conducting them. The Civic Alliance demands that parliament publicly debate all mechanisms of economic reform, not just those put forward by the government. Furthermore, the reform program must not be adopted without being negotiated with the unions. II. The Civic Alliance demands the formation of mixed parliamentary and civic commissions to clean up the Directorate of Public Prosecution, the legal system, the police, the gendarmerie, and the Romanian Information Service. III. The Civic Alliance supports the process of democratization of the army in the spirit of the ideas articulated by the Action Committee for the Democratization of the Army. IV. The Civic Alliance demands the immediate publication of the report of the Commission of Enquiry into the Tirgu Mures Events. V. The Civic Alliance demands the publication of the report of the Commission of Enquiry into the Events of June 13-15, so that those who ransacked the premises of the metropolitan police, the television company, the university, certain political parties, certain publications, and other public institutions, and who are guilty of pillage, vandalism, and attempted murder, are brought to justice. Those who incited or explained away this violence should also be brought to account. VI. The Civic Alliance demands that the free circulation of information be ensured; that an independent television service be set up; that public access to culture be insured; and that culture be supported without interference by the state so as to prevent a return to spiritual darkness. VII. Only when all demands are fully met and public control over the use of funds is guaranteed will the Civic Alliance call upon the European Economic Community, the European Parliament, the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Congress of the United States, and the parliaments of all developed countries to supply technological and financial aid along with human resources, and also request the United States to grant Romania Most Favored Nation trading status. [pageend51]so UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRING 1991 VIII. The Civic Alliance demands that parliament fulfil its role as a constituent assembly by accelerating the drafting of a new constitution and by ensuring that it is submitted to broad public debate before being adopted. It also requests that parliament withdraw the special powers granted to the government. IX. Given that through its actions the government has led the country to a profound economic, social, and political crisis, and fostered a climate of division, confusion, and insecurity that compromises the very idea of economic reform, the Civic Alliance considers it imperative that the authorities open serious discussions with all responsible forces. Now is the last moment! [pageend52]HUNGARY KADARISM WITHOUT COMMUNISTS by János Csillag János Csillag is a freelance journalist. He wrote the following article for Uncaptive Minds in January. Hungarians set four world records during January 1991. Three were won by swimmers at the world championships in Australia. The other was set by the Hungarian nation as a whole, at least according to a Gallup poll: when asked how they foresaw their country's future, 82% of those surveyed responded “hopeless,” proving that Hungarians are more pessimistic than anyone else in Eastern Europe. Another survey, taken half a year after the first free elections, found that 80% of Hungarians are not satisfied with how democratic institutions are working. The economic downturn is certainly a factor in public pessimism, but it's not the sole explanation. It appears that the “happiest barrack,” the land of “goulash communism,” is having a tough time giving up its relative prosperity. The elections last spring were won by the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], the party that had called for the least sacrifices from the population. After the government's early procrastination and indecision, it became clear that more sacrifice would be necessary than anyone had imagined during the euphoric campaign. Fundamental reforms have been late in coming; in the eyes of the public, there is little difference between the current government's policies and Kádár's. Privatization, liberalization of wages, and anti-inflationary measures all remain elements of official rhetoric and have yet to become part of official policy. Because of a lack of qualified experts and of clear economic ideas, the government continues to rely upon Kadarist methods. Prices are raised to reduce the deficit, the forint is devalued to increase exports, and the legal measures needed to create a market economy have yet to be implemented. There is no substantial difference [pageend53]52 KADARISM WITHOUT COMMUNISTS between the state budgets of the Kádár era and of the current government; the budget adopted at the last minute (December 30, 1990) allots unreasonably large amounts of money to defense and the bureaucracy. The new government's methods of dealing with the press are also reminiscent of the Kádár era. From the start, relations between the MDF and the press have been poor, due in no small part to the MDF's persistent, but unsuccessful, efforts at controlling the press. By making the public aware of these efforts, the press was able to preserve its independence. Today, as in the Kádár era, the government would like to control information and culture. Following a rise in gasoline prices last October, for instance, a spontaneous blockade of roads and bridges throughout the country took place to protest the government's decision. For the duration of the blockade, MDF officials sat in the newsrooms of television stations to make sure coverage of this protest was “objective.” Just like in the bad old days. The crisis provoked by the blockade has passed, the minister of internal affairs and several other government officials have been replaced, and a financial expert is finally in charge of the treasury. Still, the question remains: To what extent will the government break with Kadarist practices? One of the first actions of the new minister of internal affairs provides little cause for optimism. The government had announced that it would not raise gasoline prices, but then went ahead and raised them anyway. The minister of internal affairs placed the police on a state of alert in order to prevent another blockade. Budapest looked just like it did on “opposition holidays,” like March 15, under Kádár. Of course, we must bear in mind that the minister is not an expert in the field of law enforcement and knows no other methods than those the Kádár regime considered effective. Adding to the current uncertainty is Prime Minister József Antall's health. Who might replace him if his condition worsens? Though he is far from charismatic, he appears to be the only person able to hold the ruling coalition together. He is the only figure trusted by both the Christian Democrats and the Smallholders' Party. It is unlikely that his successor, whoever that may be, will enjoy any comparable prestige. The future of the coalition is thus questionable. [pageend54]CZECHO-SLOVAKIA CIVIC FORUM: THE END OF THE BEGINNING by Martin Weiss Martin Weiss works for the weekly Respekt in Prague. He wrote the following article for Uncaptive Minds in January. Civic Forum is on the verge of breaking apart [it in fact broke into two organizations on February 10]. Yet members of the faction known as the Liberal Club say there are no substantial ideological differences within the movement. That's not exactly true; the problem is that no differences in outlook have been clearly formulated by anyone. The reluctance of people in Czechoslovak politics to differentiate themselves is understandable. Giving priority to anything other than radical economic reform is understood today as camouflaged opposition to reform and is tantamount to committing political suicide. Nonetheless, differences of opinion do indeed exist, despite liberal arguments to the contrary. In the matter of what constitutes the Right and the Left, these arguments smack of sophistry. The Right, according to the liberals, is loathe to change the status quo, whereas the Left is always ready to embark on bold changes. According to these criteria, Margaret Thatcher is a leftist. True, the concepts of Right and Left are hazy at this point in our country, but with time they will become increasingly sharper; roughly speaking, the Right will emphasize freedom and the Left will stress social justice. There is muddled thinking if not hypocrisy in the reasons given for supporting economic reform. Yes, the liberals say, we need a strong private sector so that we have the resources for decent health care, social security, education, culture, the environment, etc. Yet the government is already trying to solve everything by itself, with state funds. Rather than being looked upon as normal, free human activity, business is still regarded as a necessary evil. While [pageend55]54 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRING 199) the Right sees inflation as the greatest danger, the liberals emphasize the social upheavals that reform will cause. Not that it's not prudent to worry about the consequences of economic reform, it's just that it's better to concentrate our efforts on attacking our major economic problems rather than to focus on the consequences of what we do without really attacking the problems to begin with. The latter approach would end up doing more damage to the economy. Is there not behind this approach the conviction that an economic crisis is inevitable because that is the nature of capitalism? Other confused arguments are the product of efforts to preserve Civic Forum as a unified movement, and of a mistrust of political parties. Some people, in fact, have vowed never to sign any application for membership in any party. They no doubt arrived at this conviction on the basis of painful experiences with political parties under communism. But it is strange that in some cases this disgust only extends to applications for party membership; it does not extend to the signing of laws and the approval of government decisions. The whole problem with the movement to democracy was fortuitously revealed by a television moderator when she asked Václav Klaus who was representing her on the council of Civic Forum. He replied that as long as she doesn't actively participate in Civic Forum, nobody represents her. Which is how it should be. Instant democracy is a utopian concept; it is insufficient for a political organization that wants to govern. People who want to have input into a political organization's decisions have to participate in a serious and responsible manner. They can't decide from time to time according to their mood that they want to be represented in it. Such an arrangement leads to the formation of a closed ruling clique that decides everything by itself. That someone like Václav Klaus came along and bypassed the ruling clique of Civic Forum with appeals to the movement's rank-and-file is the best viable solution to the problem. There certainly are worse: for example, a member of the leadership of Civic Forum has allegedly threatened certain groups of delegates with exclusion from the next elections. The expansion of the Liberal Club into government when it is clear that it is Klaus who has support from below was unbelievable enough. When Civic Forum breaks up, the public will almost certainly saddle the liberals with responsibility for the split. It seems the established political professionals are just beginning to learn what politics is all about. Judging from the recent petition of the Interparliamentary Civic Society, the Liberal Club is still in the habit of talking about respect for democracy. It would appear that the liberals consider a threat to their positions to be a threat to democracy as such. But that depends on how one envisions democracy: whether one believes that democracy takes root in a society because of the admonitions of morally superior intellectuals, or because democratic institutions are built up and candidates compete for mandates in the context of agreed-upon rules. The first approach betrays a mistrust of democracy. Václav [pageend56]CIVIC FORUM: THE END OF THE BEGINNING 55 Klaus is closer to the second approach. Those who would like to portray him as the Czech Walesa forget that Klaus is an intellectual. It's just that he doesn't read the sorts of authors — Friedrich A. Hayek, Milton Friedman, and Adam Smith, for example — that Czech intellectuals usually read. The impatient energy that has enabled the chairman of Civic Forum to win many district branches of the movement over to his side also has its negative aspects: the incredible ease with which he needlessly makes enemies, little understanding for people whom he doesn't consider his equals, and a kind of blindness in the face of problems that don't interest him. For example, it's not clear whether he understands the significance of his unpopularity in Slovakia, where a recent opinion poll ranked him as the least-trusted politician in the republic. Also, Civic Forum has rightly been faulted for failing to nurture the rise of politicians from the district organizations. It is not yet clear how the chairman, who depends on support from the districts, intends to address this matter. He doesn't seem inclined to surround himself with strong, independent personalities. When the smoke clears from the breakup of Civic Forum, what will remain? Most likely, a strengthened Václav Klaus. So far, he has gotten what he wanted, and his invectives against intellectuals, political experiments, and citizens' initiatives have been allowed to pass. Thus it looks like the end of dissident- style politics in Bohemia. And it is the dissidents themselves who must learn the lessons of their fiasco. [pageend57]CZECH O-SLOVAKIA interview with STANISLAV DEVÁTÝ Stanislav Devátý, an oft-imprisoned oppositionist before 1989 and currently a member of the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly, serves on the commission investigating the events that precipitated the collapse of the communist government in the fall of 1989. The commission is attempting to determine why the security police provoked the November 17,1989 demonstration and whose interests the brutal police action that followed served. The commission obtained the register of the files of secret operatives and informants of the security police in mid-December, and is still sifting through them. This interview was conducted by Jana Smidova and appeared in the January 3, 1991 issue of Lidové noviny. THE FILES WEREN'T DESTROYED LN What period does the register of files cover, and is it complete? DEVÁTÝ The register of files was set up in 1952 and was administered by district departments of the security police (STB). With a few exceptions, we have obtained a complete register from every district. LN Why weren't these files destroyed along with the other files of the security police? [pageend58]THE FILES WEREN'T DESTROYED 57 DEVÁTÝ There were attempts to destroy them, in Pilsen, for instance. But these attempts were unsuccessful. In my opinion, the people in control of the security police, as well as other high officials of the old regime, did not expect the changes in the system to be so thoroughgoing. They thought they would survive the first surge of reform, and after things settled down, return to using their old tools. These files were among their most effective tools. LN And now this tool is at the disposal of your commission. Why was this commission given the right to look at the files? DEVÁTÝ Actually, we have had access to them for some time, but the process of examining them was cumbersome and inefficient. We had to travel to the district offices of the security police. We had to figure out their complicated filing system by ourselves, because the police functionaries didn't lift a finger to help us. Moreover, the files were being abused; we know of one officer who attempted to blackmail an operative under his charge. For these reasons, the files were moved to Prague to be at our disposal. LN What methods are being used to examine the files? DEVÁTÝ All members of the commission have access to the files, but we decided that each of us can look at them only in the company of at least one other commission member. In a short time, we have been able to uncover previously unknown connections that are directly or indirectly linked to the events of November 17. We have also been able to corroborate information that was already in our possession. We discovered the files of operatives under known pseudonyms, so now not only can we identify these people, but we have grounds to bring them in and question them. Before, when we wanted to identify a specific operative, we entered a name and date of birth into the computer. We would then check the information thus obtained against data stored on microfiche in the records and statistics department of the interior ministry. But it soon became apparent that this method was inadequate. We discovered that the computer data contained errors that were probably planted on purpose, and that certain names had been deleted. In these cases, the only reliable source was the register of files itself. However, finding information in the register is rather [pageend59]58 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRING 1991 difficult, because it contains about a half-million items, though not a half-million names, because many of them are listed more than once in connection with different matters. LN The chairman of the commission, Jiti Ruml, said that some surprising names have turned up in the course of the investigation. Will any of them be made public? DEVÁTÝ Parliament will decide whether or not to publish the results of our investigation. We will give parliament a partial report at the end of January and a comprehensive report sometime in the spring. There is a consensus within the commission in support of revealing the truth to the public. One thing we have discovered since obtaining the register of files is that the security police's network of operatives is still functioning. We have proof that many operatives are still meeting with their case officers. It is safe to conclude that those in charge of this system had prepared contingency plans. Part of the network has gone underground. The security police collected compromising material for many years with which it tried, and continues to try, to influence and destabilize the political situation. It is going to be very difficult to put a stop to this activity. In my opinion, however, we have made a significant step in the right direction with the acquisition of this register.

The following article appeared in the October 1990 issue of the Polish monthly Czas Kultury. Among both the main forces and the lesser groupings on the Polish political scene there are no supporters of democracy in sight. I don't want to deal here with accusations of populism or of protecting the nomenklatura. Of course, we should listen to what the politicians have to say, but let us also examine their actions. Despite their loudly proclaimed differences, the Center Alliance (with Walesa) and the Citizens' Movement/Democratic Action, or ROAD (with Michnik and others) — the two most important political forces — share the conviction that Polish society is politically immature, and that, therefore, the politically conscious groups that arose in the course of the struggle with communism have the right to govern for an extended period of time. These groups now call themselves society's elites. Yet the most important characteristic of the current situation in Poland is the complete absence of elites. All the political groups are playing politics in a social vacuum, including the Mazowiecki government. The existence of this vacuum was borne out by the creation of ROAD and the Alliance for Democracy. Political preferences and antipathies are focused for the most part on individuals. Considering the magnitude of the current socio-economic transformation, one could hardly expect the crystallization of political groups or even social classes held together by common political or economic interests. Thus, the attempt to create a social base for Mazowiecki's government out of a narrow group of politically active intellectuals has been something of a farce. After all, these intellectuals advocate nothing but their private, fairly [pageend62]NO DEMOCRACY WITHOUT PROVEN ELITES 61 abstract opinions about the future of our country. Walesa's followers have also been unable to decide which social groups to court. Their attempts to win over the workers were combined with calls for the acceleration of change — in other words, the rapid implementation of measures that will reduce the working class's standard of living. The activists of the Center Alliance, however, have superior political instincts, which explains why they chose Lech Walesa. The leaders of the Center Alliance and ROAD think and act as if they had all the answers, and as if the people were a politically benighted rabble. In fact, amid their rhetoric, one can sometimes detect disappointment at the lack of appreciation for their superhuman sacrifices on behalf of others. It is worrisome that narrow groups of self-proclaimed elites who act as if they possessed an eternal mandate from society attribute low voter turnout to the apathy of that society. Many observers have rightly concluded that these artificial elites are mainly concerned with power. In larger organizations such as the Center Alliance, ROAD, or the peasants' party (PSL), it is narrow groups that want power for themselves; in smaller groups such as the Confederation for an Independent Poland or the Freedom Party, it is simply individuals. Is there an antidote to this style of acting and thinking, to this political shamelessness? It is probably impossible to change anything now or in the near future, because all the political players are doing everything they can to appear by the side of the Pope on May 3, 1991 [the 200th anniversary of Poland's first democratic constitution, and a date long celebrated as a national holiday] and thus to go down in history as saviors of the fatherland. They would probably even be willing to join forces before taking any political risks that might result in their losing the opportunity to stand on that pedestal. Building democracy without genuine elites is impossible. At the very least, those in power should endeavor to better represent the interests of those who elected them to office. What stake, after all, do the people of Western Pomerania or Sandomierz have in Senator Lech Kaczynski's denunciations of his opponents? Or in representative Adam Michnik's attacks on his? The development of local government is an important element in the building of democracy, but it is not enough by itself. The construction of democracy in Poland also requires regional sejmiks [small parliaments]. Each should cover an area larger than a voivodeship [about the size of an American county], along the lines of a German Land. The idea would be to create a strong, intermediate link between local governments and the Sejm and Senate — a link that would separate local government and local interests from abstract and frequently personal disputes, from prejudices and bad policies, at the national level. Why should the bureaucratic mess in Warsaw or the central government's fears of foreign capital limit Western investment in any given region of the country? Regional sejmiks would have two important virtues to recommend them. First, in the course of getting elected, meeting local political challenges, and making local policies, new elites would emerge in a natural manner, especially in the area of finances. Second, regional [pageend63]62 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRING 1991 governments would nip ambitions for regional political autonomy in the bud. We'll return to this point later. Politics in Poland currently revolves around its chief participants, leaders of former opposition groups who represent narrow interests and who mainly defend their own positions. The general good and local interests in particular have been given short shrift. People are unhappy with the way the state apparatus has been set up at the local level; they resent the deadening effect of the central bureaucracy. The way the state's press monopoly was dismantled is a case in point: it was kept alive as long as possible, thereby making it impossible for the former underground papers to become legitimate operations. Perhaps our leaders thought Gazeta Wyborcza and Tygodnik Solidarnošč could divide the role of the independent press between them. The problems of the ministry of agriculture, and the deep tensions in the agricultural sector in general, illustrate the paralysis caused by the centralist mentality and mode of decision-making. After all, it is impossible to make the right decisions for farms along Poland's eastern and western borders simultaneously. And it is unlikely that the peasants will continue to sit by quietly while bureaucrats and union activists in Warsaw quash the few successful initiatives in agriculture, such as the Agricultural Market Agency. In fact, Woytek Pawlak, a French expert and one of the Agency's co-founders, left Poland because he was frustrated by the ease with which bureaucratic incompetence had destroyed the results of his work. The inept policies of the current government, the widespread incomprehension of the political struggle within narrow circles of Solidarity, and most importantly, the feeling that time and unique opportunities are being wasted have given rise to separatist feelings. At the village, town, and regional levels, people believe that they can go it alone. These feelings are only natural: those who don't care about cliquish power struggles clearly see that the effects of these struggles are hurting the country, and that they are particularly damaging to the provinces. When you hear nothing but squabbles and insults coming from the capital, it's time to pack up or take matters into your own hands. Who, in a country bereft of elites, is qualified to debate and decide upon matters that in “only” a couple years could become sources of serious trouble? Our government strategists don't see any reason to bother with problems such as the German character of part of Silesia, or the desire for autonomy in Wielkopolska. They're wrong. A modem state must be able to respond quickly to the changes that take place within its complex structure. The creation of regional sejmiks and regional governments that represent provinces and not voivodeships (the current voivodeship structure, which consists of too many units, should be liquidated) would make the Polish state much more efficient and help prevent separatism. Among other things, economic matters that absorb so much of the central government's time could be passed down to the regional governments. At this level, the private efforts of individuals would [pageend64]NO DEMOCRACY WITHOUT PROVEN ELITES 63 not be so easily frittered away. The creation of “little homelands” would also help to capture the energy of local patriotism, and would channel development according to the specific circumstances and traditions of a given region. National minorities, of course, would benefit. And most importantly, it would be the fastest way to produce and confirm the elites that Poland so desperately needs. On September 18, yet another “historic” meeting of political leaders was held at the behest of the primate of Poland, Cardinal Józef Glemp. A few weeks earlier, during celebrations marking the tenth anniversary of Solidarity, Lech Walesa and Tadeusz Mazowiecki met only because the bishop of Gdansk had invited them. It won't be long before the only place Polish politicians can meet is the shrine of the Black Madonna in Czestochowa, to which they will be required to come whenever the Church invites them, on pain of excommunication. The fact is that many phenomena in Polish public life are being devalued. The Church, which was an irreplaceable mediator between the totalitarian government and society and, later, between the retreating communist authorities and the organized opposition, now tries to reconcile differences, or at least moderate between factions, within the same political camp. The Church is playing the role of a mediator, but without clear motives or a well-defined political position. Observers are unable to determine whether the Church's current involvement can be attributed to Christian imperative or to a desire to pursue its own worldly interests. The Church's motives are also ill-defined because it is unclear what divides the opposing factions that have emerged from Solidarity. Furthermore, considering the way religious instruction was introduced in public schools, it would be hard to count the Church among the sincere friends of democracy in Poland. [Owing to pressure from the Church, religious education was introduced in public schools by the ministry of education without prior debate in parliament or consultation with social groups.] As the political struggle intensifies, the Church's situation will more than likely grow uncomfortably complicated. This would not be advantageous for the Church or for Polish political life in general. Clearly, the Church should stop participating in day-to-day politics. But there is one more change it should make for the good of everyone: it should move the primate's seat, the “headquarters” of the Roman Catholic Church in Poland, from Warsaw back to Gniezno. The nation's political capital is an inappropriate place for the head of an institution devoted to spiritual concerns. If such a move were made in conjunction with the Pope's visit this spring, it would constitute a clear signal that the Church intends to change its ways. Another change taking place in Poland and in other East European countries is, to quote Jacques Rupnik, the “end of the rule of the word” — that is, the end of the rule of intellectuals. Two opposing views on the role of intellectuals in the transformations underway in Eastern Europe appeared this summer in Res Publica: “Right, Left, Anti-Semitism,” by Pawel Špiewak, and “Roads to Freedom: Democratization and Its Problems in East-Central Europe,” by Ralf Dahrendorf. [See the March-April 1990 issue of Uncaptive [pageend65]64 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRING 1991 Minds]. Špiewak, who correctly identifies the Mazowiecki administration as a government of intellectuals, is alarmed by the growing wave of antigovernment rhetoric, which he considers a result of an anti-intellectual, anti-Warsaw, anti-Semitic campaign. But ispiewak's article only points to effects; it doesn't delve into underlying causes — a typical shortcoming of Polish journalism. Unfortunately, this article is also indicative of another, more recent problem in Polish journalism: the lack of genuinely independent journalists. All of them have taken sides, consciously or unconsciously. Even Czeslaw Bielecki, who has a strong reputation for independent thinking, recently published an article (concerning, among other things, the political exploitation of the charge of anti-Semitism) in Tygodnik Solidarnošč, a newspaper clearly identified with one side in the current political struggle. The venue of the article greatly detracted from its significance. In fact, it is doubtful whether any newspapers at the moment would publish critical articles on all the political forces active in the central arena. By contrast, Ralf Dahrendorf writes In order to work, a free country needs critics who are not tied into the structures of power. During the period of transition, intellectuals may have to hold office; but only when they can return to their desks are we able to conclude that the institutions of civil society have been safely established. This warning should be taken seriously. Most intellectuals should withdraw from direct participation in the formulation of government policy. It's no exaggeration to say there are no elites in Poland. We have got to realize this! And it's all the more important to understand this fact because the relatively small group of independent intellectuals has forsaken its independence, and in so doing has deprived the country of the only source of talent that could at least partially make up for the lack of elites. How could we possibly build democracy without the continual criticism of independent intellectuals? What's more, the exaggeration of anti-intellectual feeling by followers of “the philosophy of the Mazowiecki government” could well contribute to a genuine distrust and hatred of intellectuals if the current political configuration breaks down. Governing in a centralized manner is likely to have many deleterious effects, and the attempt to strengthen this form of governance by holding presidential elections will make matters worse. First, because the elections are being held too late. Second, with the exception of bringing in new faces, the elections will only re-create the current state of affairs. We need innovative ideas to fill in gaps in the democratic structures we are building. Power should be decentralized. We need to set up new provinces and provincial governments. And we must appeal to intellectuals to withdraw from the political fray, or at least to stay out of politics as interested participants. [pageend66]POLAND interview With EDMUND KRASOWSKI and CZESLAW NOWAK Edmund Krasowski and Czeslaw Nowak are representatives to the Polish Sejm and members of the Committee on Foreign Economic Relations. The following interview appeared in the January 11, 1991 issue of Tygodnik Solidarnošč and was conducted by Edward Klimczak. TRADE WITH THE SOVIETS: VEILED EXPLOITATION? TS Why did you gentlemen choose economic relations with the Soviet Union as your specialization within the Committee on Foreign Economic Relations in the Sejm? KRASOWSKI Because this is where the key to solving Poland's economic problems lies. As much as one third of Poland's foreign trade is with the Soviet Union, an enormous percentage. NOWAK The trick in the past was that, at the end of every year and every five-year plan, accounts were artificially balanced or even made to look as if they favored us, as if the Soviet Union were helping us out in our economic problems. But that wasn't the case. TS Marian Rajski has described how Polish shipbuilders sold ships outfitted with engines bought in the West to the Soviets for rubles... NOWAK The same thing went on in the export of Polish electric machine [pageend67]66 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRING 1991 this new currency, the so-called transferable ruble, and thanks to the exchange rate between the ruble and the dollar, and later the zloty, everything worked out perfectly, only Poland was getting poorer and poorer. TS As of January 1, 1991 this will change, because trade will be reckoned in dollars. KRASOWSKI Without a knowledge of the mechanisms by which the Soviet Union exploited our country, it is impossible to talk about what awaits us after January 1. To put our trade relations with the USSR on an equal footing, we must first understand why these relations have been unequal up to now. Take oil, for example. Is our economy threatened because the Soviets are going to stop supplying us? Some people say we are so dependent upon Soviet oil that we can't afford to kick up a fuss. We believe, however, that the apparently low prices we've been paying for Soviet oil are a complete fiction. We made expensive investments in energy production in Siberia, for which we were repaid with raw materials. The credits we received from the West in the 1970s went, among other things, into mammoth projects in the USSR, including the Orenburg pipeline, gas pipelines, and several other works. Of course we had to buy machinery for hard currency in the West. These investments were supposed to be the solution to all of Poland's energy problems. During the debate in the Sejm in the latter part of February 1990, it was revealed that Poland had made investments and undertaken construction projects in the Soviet Union in accordance with internal Soviet prices, not the actual costs we had incurred. Altogether, we have probably lost 4.5 billion transferable rubles on these investments. It takes 1.56 dollars to buy a transferable ruble, so you can see how many billions of dollars have been wasted. NOWAK We have raised this issue many times at sessions of the parliamentary commission on foreign economic relations and on the floor of the Sejm itself. The government has ignored our motions. The press has grudgingly informed the public of what we've had to say, sometimes distorting our reports. TS What has been done to stop the transfer of our dollars to the Soviet Union for rubles ? [pageend68]TRADE WITH THE SOVIETS 67 KRASOWSKI Nothing! The inertia of the government can be attributed to the continued presence of many communists in key economic positions. The head of the Polish delegation to COMECON in Moscow is Szalajda, a communist. This man has worked more for international communism than for Poland, yet he is still the most important Polish representative at COMECON. He has written various reports on reform; partially on the basis of his opinions, the Mazowiecki government has procrastinated in the matter of stopping the flow of our national wealth to the Soviet Union. TS Nonetheless, we have to trade with the Soviets. As neighbors, we are condemned to economic interdependence. How can we trade with them on a fair and equal basis? KRASOWSKI We should trade with them, but it should be for hard currency and at world prices. People like Szalajda can't do this. In late October, during a visit to the Bureau of the Trade Representative of the Polish Republic in Moscow, we obtained documents, sent to former ministers and prime ministers in the 1980s, that clearly state the unprofitability of Polish investments in raw materials in the Soviet Union. Because the costs of these investments were calculated according to Soviet rates, the prices we paid for Soviet oil and natural gas were significantly higher than world prices. TS Do the Russians accept these findings? KRASOWSKI Of course not. The Russians say that everything was done in accordance with contracts that “your comrades signed.” So the question arises, Why did the government of the Polish People's Republic ignore these reports? TS All right, that was the past, but what about now? KRASOWSKI It's not just the past, it also concerns today, because unfortunately, the Mazowiecki government has also ignored our dependence on the USSR. An example here is the failure to carry out restructuring in the machine industry, which exports much of its production to the Soviet Union. This industry continues to consume a great deal of materials and energy. [pageend69]68 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRING 1991 The Russians are paying us, of course, but they're paying in rubles. We can't buy anything in the Soviet Union for these rubles; it's a worthless currency. In the West, exports enrich the exporting country. We have an enormous trade surplus with the West which is worth something. TS What's our surplus with the Soviets? KRASOWSKI At the end of 1990, our surplus with the USSR reached 5 billion transferable rubles, from which we have nothing... TS At the moment inflation is rapidly eating away the value of the ruble. Is anything being done to prevent losses in the value of our ruble holdings? KRASOWSKI This doesn't really matter. The point is that we can't derive any benefit from these exports. We are simply exporting our national product. Our commission has pointed out that in the case of a market as uncertain as the Soviet Union, exports should immediately be balanced by imports. TS What was the ruble-zloty exchange rate fixed at after January 1, 1990? KRASOWSKI The rate was 2,100 zloty per ruble. At that rate, it paid for some Polish enterprises to export. The prices of our products in rubles were low, but for every ruble the National Bank of Poland — that is, the Polish state budget — had to pay 2,100 zloty. TS At that time the ruble was trading for 600 zloty, so the Polish government was contributing 1,500 zloty per ruble. NOWAK Actually, 2,100 zloty, because transferable rubles aren't sent from the USSR to Poland. KRASOWSKI Actually, it went from 600 zloty to 500 and even down to 300, but that doesn't really matter. The point is that the exchange rate [pageend70]TRADEWITH THE SOVIETS 69 was artificial. In reality it is 20 rubles to the dollar, and 500 zloty at most to the ruble. That's what the exchange rate should be. At 2,100 zloty to the ruble, it was worthwhile for many Polish enterprises to export their products to the Soviet Union. And the Polish government, knowing full well that this was an artificial exchange rate, did nothing to limit Polish exports. TS You warned the government in February 1990, and nothing has changed, no decisions have been taken, since? KRASOWSKI In June the ruble was devalued to 1,000 zloty for articles not covered by the Polish-Soviet agreement for 1990. The intention was to limit Polish exports to the Soviet Union. Later the ruble was devalued to 500 zloty, but that decision was immediately canceled. Why? Because the terrified directors of Polish enterprises came to the government and argued that if we stop exporting to the Soviet Union, everything will fall apart. TS The Soviet television program Vremya carried a story from Poland about how Polish enterprises would go broke if not for their exports to the USSR. KRASOWSKI That is pure demagoguery. It is quite clear that these firms are actually paid from the Polish state budget. The directors of Polish enterprises have even gone to the Soviet embassy hoping to apply pressure on the Polish government to raise the exchange rate. It was several weeks before the directors stopped protesting the decision. Do you know what idea they finally hit upon? They cooked up a plan with their Soviet counterparts by way of the central authorities to raise the price of Polish goods in rubles. Prices were tripled after the devaluation. The Polish ministry of foreign trade now reports that rates of profitability are the same as before. The whole thing turned out to be a total fiction, and Polish public opinion was cleverly fooled. I brought this to the Sejm's attention; once a month I took the floor in this matter. NOWAK Now we have a 5-billion-ruble trade surplus with the Soviet Union, instead of the 200 million surplus projected in the state budget. [pageend71]70 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRING 1991 TS Will this surplus be counted toward our 5.5 billion ruble debt to the Soviets? KRASOWSKI No! Let's take a look at what this 5 billion trade surplus of useless rubles means. It amounts to 10 trillion zloty, plus the excessive consumption of materials and energy by our unrestructured plants, interest, and other costs. It's a huge burden on the state budget. This sum is the equivalent of at least one billion dollars, and when all the other costs are figured in, it is probably more than twice that. I think it would be better to halt these exports to the Soviet Union and use the money thus saved to, say, pay farmers who aren't working. It would be less harmful to the Polish economy. TS What chances do you think you have to force the government to reveal what has been happening in Polish-Soviet trade? KRASOWSKI Back in September 1989, Marcin Šwiecicki, the minister of foreign trade, announced that a so-called white book on Polish-Soviet trade was being prepared. It had actually been finished at the time he announced it, but it has yet to be released. I am the only member of parliament who has a copy. TS You should copy it and distribute it to the rest of the parliament. KRASOWSKI It's not worth copying. Jan Danielewski, a communist economist, is the chief expert who worked on it. It's an atrocious piece of work, and that's why Minister Šwiecicki didn't release it; it would have compromised his ministry. It tries to convince us that we were getting oil cheap from the Soviets. Of course it was cheap at 100 rubles, or 210,000 zloty, a ton. However, the report does not spell out how cheap we were selling our copper, coal, and other raw materials. The only way to evaluate trade with the Soviet Union is to look at it as a whole. You can't take one product out of context and figure costs according to artificial exchange rates. The price of oil is dependent upon the prices of other products. We sell the Soviets coal at 40 rubles a ton — coal for which the West pays 60 dollars a ton. No mention is made in the report that our exports of coal to the Soviet Union, by themselves, sufficed to cover our oil needs. Do you understand, our exports of coal alone! [pageend72]TRADE WITH THE SOVIETS 71 The problem is that almost no one in the Sejm understands our trade with the Soviets. We hear populist claptrap instead: We're going to suffer enormous losses! Three million people will lose their jobs! In the Sejm there is great resistance to examining our trade with the Soviets; 65% of the representatives are from the former nomenklatura, and they're terribly afraid to discuss this matter. There is resistance within Solidarity's parliamentary caucus; even the free-marketeers don't want to touch it. Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, the new prime minister, has begun to speak up on this subject only lately, because I think we finally managed to convince him to. Television and the press are shying away from it. In the meantime, Minister Swiecicki was arguing that when Polish-Soviet trade switches to world prices, Poland will lose one to two billion dollars. Poland won't lose anything, the volume of trade will simply be reduced to a level where exports will balance imports. TS And is it worth it? After all, unemployment will increase. KRASOWSKI Of course it is, because we'll use less material and less energy. NOWAK And the Polish state won't have to pick up the tab. KRASOWSKI The burden on the state budget will be reduced several fold. This is what we have to tell the public, instead of talking about the need to trade with the Soviets at all costs. [pageend73]POLAND UNEMPLOYMENT: THE NEW THREAT by Urszula Doroszewska Urszula Doroszewska is a Polish journalist. She wrote the following article for Uncaptive Minds this past fall. During the forty years of communist rule, Poles heard all about the horrors of the capitalist system, particularly the horror of unemployment. But no one set much store by the communists' warnings: every child knew that the unemployed in the West were significantly better off than Polish workers. The economists who designed Poland's transition to a market economy were also unalarmed by the specter of unemployment. They argued that unemployment cannot be avoided and could even be beneficial: it could induce people to work harder and to improve their skills. The reality of unemployment has turned out to be far less benign. After a year of economic experimentation, nearly one million Poles — over 5% of the workforce — are out of a job; in some areas the unemployment rate is approaching 15%. The standard of living for the average working-class family has fallen 30%, and many families are now living on the edge of poverty. And the worst is yet to come: in 1991, unemployment could increase by as much as 200%. According to a recent opinion poll, 65% of those surveyed had never considered the possibility that they might lose their jobs. When asked how they would react to the threat of unemployment, a majority of the respondents — 58% — indicated that they would wait and see what happens; only 6% said that they would look for a new job if confronted with the possibility of a layoff. Unemployment did not officially exist under the communists. Along with free medical care and education, full employment was always held, up as one [pageend74]UNEMPLOYMENT: THE NEW THREAT 73 of the great triumphs of socialism. In reality, though, there was extensive hidden unemployment. Experts now estimate that nearly 30% of the working population was idle although employed; in other words, every third employee had nothing to do on the job. The worker who routinely spent the day drinking beer, the bureaucrat on perpetual coffee break — every Pole was well-acquainted with this phenomenon. As a consequence of the communists' policy of maintaining the illusion of full employment, one-third of the unemployed today lack skills. There was enormous demand for unskilled labor in heavy industry during the years of communist rule. The demand for highly trained workers, on the other hand, was limited, owing to our technological backwardness. People with no more than a grade-school education often earned more than skilled workers and engineers. For many Poles, there was simply no compelling reason to seek further education or training. Moreover, an unskilled worker could procrastinate endlessly or drink away the day with impunity since he could always find another job somewhere else. A woman whose only skill was answering the telephone, for example, could easily hold a secretarial position for years and never have to learn how to type. Why bother? The socialist system proclaimed its compassion for the individual, and firing, say, the mother of several children, even if she were utterly incompetent, would be inhumane. After years of this kind of security, many people regard any change in the nature and conditions of employment as a great injustice. Despite the implementation of Balcerowicz's economic program, hidden unemployment has yet to disappear. Enterprises are reducing production costs by dismissing employees en masse, and good workers are as likely to be fired as those who work poorly. Blue-collar workers are generally the first to go; their white-collar counterparts, with closer ties to management, are better able to protect themselves. While the economists had envisioned unemployment as a consequence of industrial modernization, the actual cause of unemployment has been recession. Hardest hit have been cities and regions dependent on industries threatened with closure, industries in which modernization is probably not viable. Nowhere is the situation worse than in Walbrzych and Lódž. Walbrzych is a mining city in Silesia. Mining there has not been profitable since the mid- 1930s. But when World War II came along, the Germans needed coal at any cost, and the miners were forced to continue working in the antiquated and dangerous mines. After the war, the communists followed in Hitler's footsteps: the mines were kept open regardless of the financial and human costs. Increases in coal production were supposed to attest to the prowess and efficiency of the local nomenklatura. The coal itself, however, was sold abroad for pennies as an easy source of hard currency. The Walbrzych mines must be closed soon. Every ton of coal mined there costs the state 400,000 zloty [$40] in subsidies. However, closing the mines [pageend75]74 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRING 1991 would leave 20,000 miners — who support 40,000 dependents — unemployed. Thus the miners, as well as the still-powerful nomenklatura, are opposed to such a step. The Walbrzych branch of Solidarity has barely been able to prevent strikes in the local mines. Discussions are now taking place with French specialists who dealt with a similar situation in France. One proposal, for example, is to establish a special enterprise zone in Walbrzych, where newly created firms would enjoy advantageous operating conditions. Plans for economic development and programs for retraining miners will require tremendous state funding, however, and the French advisers are encountering resistance from the local nomenklatura. Thus the success of these plans is far from certain. The situation in Lodž is grimmer still. Whereas miners are relatively well- off in Poland, workers in light industry are truly impoverished. Textile workers in Lodž earn the lowest wages in all of Poland; moreover, living and working conditions there are appalling. Lódž's textile factories were turning out 30% more than they could sell, so production had to be curtailed. Several factories are now operating only three days a week, and their workers are receiving only half their already low wages. Nobody is protesting, though, because half-wages are considered preferable to unemployment. Since wages in Lodž are the lowest in the country, unemployment benefits are also the lowest. The average monthly unemployment benefits are approximately 260,000 zloty [$26], which isn't even enough for food. The situation in Lodž is far worse for women than for men. A man trained in construction work or machine repair can generally find work; a woman who has worked as a weaver in the textile industry, on the other hand, has little chance of finding a new job. The authorities in Lodž have yet to put forward a plan to create new jobs for women: female labor, in their eyes, is simply not needed. Even if new jobs were created, thousands of women would need to be retrained. Many women are in poor health as a result of years of enduring horrific working conditions. They have been crushed by poverty and mind- numbing work and are simply too tired to protest. Forty years of socialism have left the women of Lodž too weak to make the leap into the capitalist age. The paradox of Poland's growing unemployment is that jobs — often relatively high-paying jobs — are in fact available. The newspapers are full of help-wanted ads. New factories, many owned by foreigners, are constantly opening and seeking to hire qualified workers. The qualifications, however, are not those that were fostered by the socialist system: professionalism, industriousness, the ability to carry out the instructions of superiors, politeness, and sobriety. Finding workers with these qualities can be difficult; many people prefer to accept unemployment benefits rather than to be “a slave to a capitalist.” On the other hand, a good many Poles have eagerly quit their jobs in state firms to work in the private sector. These people often report that, for the first time, they can work normally, their skills are respected, and they feel truly free. Not surprisingly, young people are more adept at adjusting to the new rules of the game. [pageend76]UNEMPLOYMENT: THE NEW THREAT 75 Employment in private companies is generally available in the large cities. Warsaw, for example, has an unemployment rate of only 1.5%. The situation in the provinces is much bleaker. In Suwalki, in the northeast corner of the country, the unemployment rate is around 9%. The gap between the major cities and the provinces is exacerbated by the housing situation: apartments are so scarce that it is virtually impossible for people to move from one area to another. Because of the crisis in the construction industry, the rent for a small apartment commonly exceeds the average wage. Poles lucky enough to have their own apartment hold on to it for the rest of their lives. There is another option for the unemployed: emigration. The flow of people leaving Poland has not decreased since the end of communist rule. Not surprisingly, emigrants tend to be young and highly energetic. The majority of younger Poles, however, don't want to live abroad and would prefer to make a living in their own country. The high rate of unemployment came as a tremendous shock to the Mazowiecki government, despite predictions by critics of the Balcerowicz plan that over one million Poles would lose their jobs during the first year of the plan's implementation. Economic planners rarely prepare for the adverse consequences of their programs, and Balcerowicz was no exception. Polish industry has been laying off about a hundred thousand workers every month. Why didn't the government come up with any sort of program to create jobs in conjunction with its economic reforms? Examples of official shortsightedness abound. The government decided, for example, to eliminate the insurance subsidies given to factories employing the handicapped; predictably, many employers responded by firing handicapped workers. The Mazowiecki government's handling of the unemployment problem suggests that it gave up entirely on social policy, almost as if in reaction to the communists' overprotectiveness. In all fairness, though, it has to be admitted that the peculiarities of the Polish situation — above all, the attitudes toward work instilled by forty years of socialism — make it difficult to determine the applicability of Western- style solutions to this problem. State employment offices, meanwhile, have been functioning poorly. Jobseekers often do not receive notice of job offerings. The labor ministry has not permitted the creation of private employment agencies, even though such agencies would be more flexible and efficient than the state agencies. A growing number of recipients of unemployment benefits work illegally for private employers, who, in turn, do not pay mandatory insurance taxes. Other recipients are street traders. This perpetuates the unhealthy attitude toward work and social benefits prevalent under socialism. The programs that do exist for dealing with unemployment are poorly planned and inadequate. An unemployed person is eligible, for example, for loans to start a business. This credit, however, is not available in all regions of Poland. An applicant needs two co-signers, each of whom must earn more [pageend77]76 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRING 1991 than one million zloty [$100] a month; many Poles simply do not know anyone so “wealthy.” Loans to the unemployed, moreover, carry the same interest rates as other forms of credit. Together, these factors discourage even the most enterprising of the unemployed. Extensive and rapidly growing unemployment carries with it the threat of social unrest. Many Poles have assigned responsibility for current conditions equally to the communists and the post-communist government. “Why do we want capitalism?” more and more Poles are asking. “After all, capitalism also exists in Africa.” Although Poles have thus far displayed amazing patience in enduring the consequences of the Balcerowicz program, social protests and strikes could become more frequent and more serious. If the state remains unable to handle the unemployment problem adequately, not only poverty but also helplessness and hopelessness will spread throughout Polish society. Dependence on welfare will increase, and ever more individuals will withdraw from society. Rampant crime and political extremism might easily take root among the disaffected. Clearly, the government must act now and address the problem of unemployment — before the legendary patience of the Poles runs out. [pageend78]POLAND THE DANGEROUS MINISTRY by Jan Polkowski and Ryszard Terlecki The following article appeared in the December 21, 1990 issue of Czas Krakowski, which is edited by Messrs. Polkowski and Terlecki. Who would have ever imagined that a year after Solidarity came to power so many of the security service's (SB) functionaries would still be on the job? That Polish citizens would have to sit by helplessly while those functionaries burned files and destroyed the evidence of the crimes they had committed? That, after the communist party had already disintegrated, a Solidarity government would announce a policy of “letting bygones be bygones,” forgetting felonies and acts of high treason? We have heard various justifications for this state of affairs. Change was supposed to occur gradually, and thus communist ministers who bore responsibility for society's suffering remained part of the establishment. It would be impossible to dismantle the security forces overnight, we were told, because of the threat of crime at home and terrorism from abroad. Only specialists could guarantee our safety, the government reminded us. But the crime-rate has steadily risen, and the specialists have given much more attention to their own job security than to public security. We heard, too, that firing SB agents would increase the danger of antidemocratic plotting. So they were allowed to keep their weapons. Now plots against the democratic government are no longer a threat because the potential conspirators have been incorporated into the new power structure. We were warned that revealing the names of agents and informers would spark a “witch hunt.” Now the records of collaborators have been destroyed, doctored, hidden, and perhaps sent abroad. The government did not surrender the notorious files the security services had compiled on thousands of citizens because of worries about the possibility of making errors and casting unjustified suspicion upon innocent individuals. Meanwhile, [pageend79]78 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRING 1991 informers have been able to cover their tracks. The government assured the populace that its so-called verification process would cleanse the ranks of the police and the Office for State Protection. But this has not necessarily been the case, as recent events have shown. There was a broader political context to the state of affairs within the Ministry of Internal Affairs. For reporting on the misdeeds of the security forces, the press was accused of destabilizing the state. Lech Walesa and his associates were accused of endangering the government's reforms, but it was due to Walesa that the public came to understand that the process of change had to be accelerated, and it was because of public pressure that the ministers compromised by their association with the communist regime were forced out of the government. The wing of Solidarity that took power in 1989 lacked the political support necessary to govern the country on its own. It had two options: either share power with the wing of Solidarity pressing for more radical change — the group widely seen as more conservative, more Catholic, more free-market oriented, and more imbued with traditional Polish nationalism — or maintain the power-sharing arrangement with the communists, even at the cost of granting them impunity for their earlier crimes and allowing them to keep the wealth they plundered from the nation. Sticking with the communists was the easier option for many in Solidarity's left wing because their views often coincided with those of the “reformed” post-communists. Both groups preferred enlightened socialism to capitalism; both felt closer to Moscow and Prague than to Berlin and Washington; both feared the predominance of Catholic and nationalistic views. The members of the government held divergent views, but were able to overcome their differences because of a common desire to retain power and a fear of the “primitive” nation allegedly yearning for a rightist dictatorship. The Ministry of Internal Affairs bears considerable responsibility for the events of the past year. Allowing the destruction of the security service's files means that many facts about the Polish Peoples's Republic will never be revealed. The presence of SB functionaries in countless important positions amounts to a timebomb. This presence could be particularly dangerous for the government in a time of crisis. By minimizing the issue of the responsibility the leaders of the security services bear for crimes against society, the government has done much to demoralize society. As the new system takes on a growing resemblance to the old, public horror and shock is slowly giving way to indifference and talk of “the new nomenklatura.” Moreover, the Ministry of Internal Affairs has committed repeated blunders, completely undermining what little credibility it still might have enjoyed. First, there was the unforgivable display of indifference towards Stan Tyminski's presidential candidacy. But then, why should we have expected former SB officers now serving in the Office for State Protection to denounce their former colleagues on Tyminski's campaign staff? The Mazowiecki government disregarded Tymiňski at first, expecting him to draw votes away from Walesa. [pageend80]THE DANGEROUS MINISTRY 79 When it became clear that it was Mazowiecki who was losing support to Tym- irtski, the government panicked and announced that it had materials discrediting Tymiiiski, but refused to make these materials public. These floundering efforts served only to win more votes for Tymiriski. In any normal democratic country, the top leadership of the ministry responsible would have been fired for allowing such a fiasco to occur. The Office for State Protection maintains that it did nothing because it was waiting for instructions from the prosecutor; this explanation demonstrates either the incompetence or the evil intentions of the ministry, if not both. The bungled arrest of General Miroslaw Milewski [minister of internal affairs in 1980-81, accused of running an extensive criminal network] and his collaborators similarly demonstrated the ministry's ineptitude. No doubt this action was taken to make Mazowiecki look tough and thus help him win votes; but when the authorities backed down and released Milewski, it became clear that the government couldn't stand up to the communists. The ties between former SB functionaries now serving in positions of authority and the KGB are also a very sensitive issue. We are being told that this or that SB officer was not trained by the KGB in Moscow, so no one need be at all suspicious. The people who have been coming up with such excuses obviously do not understand the situation. They seem to think that by burning the security service's records they can erase the sordid history of the Polish People's Republic. We must dispel such illusions: many people remember what took place, and some documents have survived efforts to cleanse the archives. It cannot be denied that the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party was subordinate to Moscow. Certainly the degree of dependence on Moscow varied over the years, but the party, and thus the government, was never independent. It would be more accurate to describe it as the Polish branch of the Soviet party. Likewise, it cannot be denied that the security services and the army were taking their orders from the Soviet Union. It makes little difference if someone in the security services was trained by the Soviets in Warsaw rather than Moscow; he was still serving a foreign government and betraying the interests of Poland. It makes little difference if that individual did not directly participate in the security service's crimes — that he did not take part in the shootings in December 1970 and December 1981; that he did not plough through Poznan in a tank in 1956; that he did not command a ZOMO brigade in Radom in 1976; that he did not have a hand in the “liberation” of Czecho-Slovakia in 1968; that he did not help train Arab terrorists; that he wasn't involved in the murder of Father Popieluszko or any of the other political murders. No, he might not bear direct responsibility, but he is by no means absolved of moral responsibility for having been a part of the system of official violence. Not all of the officers and functionaries in the security services worked to the nation's detriment. Colonel Ryszard Kukliňski provided the West with invaluable information that enabled the Americans to preempt Soviet intervention in Poland back in December 1980; the importance of this information has [pageend81]80 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRING 1991 been confirmed, for example, by Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was one of the best-informed Western public officials at the time. Brzezinski was not alone, however, in believing that Kukliriski was an exception. At that time, the leaders of the army and security services were clearly serving the interests of the Soviet Union, not Poland. The current leadership of the Ministry of Internal Affairs not only accepts the official activity of the KGB in Poland, but even seems pleased with this situation, arguing that it helps them in their dealings with Moscow in criminal investigations, for example. The authorities are apparently ignoring both the KGB's long-standing ties to the Polish Ministry of Internal Affairs and the vast espionage network that in all probability it continues to maintain in Poland. It is very disheartening to have to report on these problems a year after the Mazowiecki government first came to power. The Poles placed tremendous trust in the new government. But it is necessary to bring these facts to light now, as we witness the creation of a truly free Poland — a Poland that should not be corrupted by the poisonous vestiges of the communist regime. [pageend82]POLAND JUSTICE IS NOT REVENGE by Andrzej Gwiazda Andrzej Gwiazda was one of the principal leaders of Solidarity in 1980. The following passage comes from a book of interviews with him entitled Gwiazda, You Were Right, published by ZP Sopot in 1990. Adam Strzembosz resigned from his position as vice-minister of justice in the summer of 1990 because he couldn't dismiss people who had participated in the Stalinist and post-Stalinist administration of “justice,” people whose very presence in the ministry was a parody of justice. The exact same situation obtains in all the other ministries. The past is forgiven with the catch phrase “let bygones be bygones,” and our Catholic premier declares that demanding justice is tantamount to thirsting for revenge. It doesn't seem to bother him that the faith that he so openly practices considers justice one of the four main virtues, and that a condition for absolution of one's sins is confessing to those sins, regretting one's transgressions, resolving to improve oneself, and making amends, that is, penance. Just as someone who recognizes Christian values cannot receive communion without first being absolved, society cannot begin life based on new principles without first undergoing decommunization, that is, calling evil by its name. Legal mechanisms need to be set up to determine what crimes were committed and who committed them. This need not lead to further punishment. But instead, we have various verification commissions appointed by neo-Solidarity, a group which, having collaborated with the communists, is now supposed to rid important positions of collaborators. Thus verification is again being conducted according to class feeling; again we have a body — empowered by some other body, which is the sole representative of the ruling class — that is to decide who is O.K. and who is not. In other words, decommunization is being conducted in a communist manner. [pageend83]82 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRING 199 Elections held in such an atmosphere cannot be free. It would seem, for that matter, that no honorable person would run in an election with yesterday's criminals simply because our Catholic premier illegitimately absolved their guilt. Such absolution is a violation of human rights, a withdrawal from European, from Christian, civilization. The distinction between good and evil has been purposely blurred. In religious categories, this is a sin against the Holy Spirit. In social categories, it has resulted in the embitterment of the younger generations. Demanding justice is not only a task for this moment in history, for we are continually creating history, which will belong to future generations. The conclusion that logically flows from Prime Minister Mazowiecki's and Primate Glemp's actions is that it pays to be the worst scoundrel, to shrink from no act no matter how base, because if evil defeats good, evil will be blessed and consecrated, and evil people will be absolved and permitted to keep all they have gained from their crimes. What lesson will the children of today remember from the recent past when they become adults? It is best to go with the strong and not to worry about moral considerations because they simply do not exist. [pageend84]POLAND THE PRESIDENT'S MISTAKE by Karol Modzelewski Karol Modzelewski is a senator and a long-standing opposition activist. The following article appeared in the January 28 edition of the Warsaw daily Žycie Warszawy. When Václav Havel proposed in January that Czecho-Slovakia, Poland, and Hungary simultaneously withdraw from the Warsaw Pact in response to the events in the Baltic countries, Lech Walesa didn't take the suggestion very seriously. In televised remarks, President Walesa said essentially that membership in the Warsaw Pact is a formality that is not overly encumbering the Polish state nor putting us in any particular danger for the time being, whereas withdrawing from the alliance for the sake of an empty protest would cause grave tensions in our relations with the Soviet Union. The Polish president's powers were agreed upon at the Round Table in April 1989, an agreement that at the time saw Wojciech Jaruzelski as a reliable guarantor, in the Kremlin's eyes, of the Soviets' interests in Poland. In accordance with the role Jaruzelski was to play, the amended constitution granted the president supreme control over defense and internal security together with foreign policy, making him the guardian of Poland's Warsaw Pact obligations. Walesa's speech, therefore, touches upon a matter that lies at the very center of his constitutional authority. In democratic countries, however, the president's opinions and decisions are subject to debate and public judgment. I agree with Lech Walesa that the Polish government should not treat the question of continued membership in the Warsaw Pact as a means of political protest. Regardless of how fervently we sympathize with the peoples of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, we must think of Poland's national security first and foremost. However, from the standpoint of national security, Lech Walesa's decision to remain in the Warsaw Pact is a mistake. In my opinion, he does [pageend85]84 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRING 1991 not fully realize the dangers to which continued membership in the alliance could expose Poland in the future, and overestimates the risks that would accompany withdrawal at the present time. The use of force against the Baltic republics is, most likely, only the first step in an effort to halt the decline of the Soviet Union by military means. Suppressing the Baltic nations' aspirations for independence will not be enough to get the job done. It is unlikely that the Kremlin could successfully pacify these republics without crushing the independent political and national movements and newly elected parliaments and governments of the other republics, especially those of Russia. Martial law in the Soviet Union is beginning in Vilnius, but it will almost certainly spread to Moscow itself. It is highly doubtful that this effort will enjoy lasting success. If, however, it halts the disintegration of the empire for a few years, then a temporary consolidation will take place under the slogans of superpower nationalism, an ideology that will also govern the conduct of Soviet foreign policy. We should take into account the possibility that after having dealt with their problems at home, the Soviet generals will wish to regain the positions they lost in Eastern Europe. This means that the independence of Poland, Czecho-Slovakia, and Hungary will be in danger. We cannot defend ourselves against Soviet military might with our own forces. Thus our security must be ensured by the international community. The position taken by the NATO countries will play a crucial role. From this point of view, it does indeed matter whether we remain in the Warsaw Pact or not, and thus whether Soviet interference in Poland, Czecho-Slovakia, or Hungary will be treated as an intra-alliance matter. Today, while the Soviet generals are occupied with the Soviet republics, we still have freedom to maneuver: if we act in concert with our neighbors, we can leave the Warsaw Pact, probably without exposing ourselves to great risk, and sooner than it has been assumed possible. If we wait until some point in the future when the Soviet Union tries to reimpose its domination over us, it may be too late. I am not arguing that we must immediately make a decision on Havel's proposal. But I do believe that our foreign-policy makers — and especially the president — should seriously consider it and put it on the agenda when talks are held with their Czechoslovak and Hungarian counterparts. Disregarding this matter is tantamount to disregarding Polish security. As Fouché put it, “It's worse than a sin, it's a mistake.” There's another matter that should be considered from the standpoint of Polish national security: the date of parliamentary elections. At first glance, this may appear to be a purely domestic political issue. The president no doubt finds it easier to work with a Sejm that was not democratically elected, because the representatives tend to be compliant towards the president so as to assure themselves a longer stay in office. Lech Walesa, of all people, should know that the United Peasants' Party and the Democratic Party left their coalition [pageend86]THE PRESIDENT'S MISTAKE 85 with the Polish United Workers' Party when they realized that the Soviet Union no longer stood behind the Polish communists. What will these parties' parliamentary representatives do if the Soviets' shadow again falls upon Poland? Little by little we're forgetting that the government coalition that ran against Solidarity in the June 1989 elections still has 65% of the seats in the Sejm. The gunfire in Vilnius and Riga should refresh our memory. The unusually favorable international circumstances that have blessed Poland are coming to an end. We should fully institutionalize Polish democracy before someone uses the remnants of the old order to reestablish foreign domination in our country. Postponing the parliamentary elections may be useful to the president's political camp, but it is dangerous for Poland's future. [Editors' note: In early March, Lech Walesa proposed that the Sejm dissolve itself immediately and that new elections be scheduled no later than May 26. A majority of deputies, however, rejected the proposal and voted to hold elections in the fall.] [pageend87]RUSSIA IS A NEW REVOLUTION IN THE MAKING? by Yuri Levada, Leonid Sedov, and Lev Timofeev The following open-ended interviews were conducted, edited, and supplied with an introduction by Wojciech Zajaczkowski for the Polish monthly Res Publica. The whole world is watching events unfold in the Soviet Union with extreme anxiety. The fate of history's most extensive empire hangs in the balance. The legal foundations of the present system and the legitimacy of its rulers are now universally questioned. Insecurity grips all spheres of social life — domestic politics, foreign relations, the economy, the military. The greatest uncertainty of all lies with Russia, the largest and most populous of the republics, the republic with the greatest economic potential, the cornerstone of the Soviet state. The decisions the Russians will soon be making will have a tremendous impact not only on the Soviet Union, but on all of Europe and Asia as well. In a series of interviews conducted in Moscow between October 28 and November 7, 1990, several political activists and experts were asked to comment on the current situation. The remarks that follow began as responses to the question whether a new revolution is in the making. The three responses published here appear without either the knowledge or permission of the interviewees. Yuri Levada is a sociologist employed at the Center for Public Opinion Research and frequent contributor to Moskovskie Novosti, Literaturnaya Gazeta, and Ogonyok. [pageend88]IS A NEW REVOLUTION IN THE MAKING? 87 Russia now has a democratic government that faces very little opposition. It has issued a series of major declarations and announced wide-sweeping plans, but it has no idea how to put its decisions into practice. Toward the end of winter, Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian parliament, will have to confront the question “What next?” If the Russian government manages to come to an agreement with the central government or the other republics on the control of financial and material resources, a completely new type of state will be created. If this happens, we'll have optimal conditions for private property, business ventures, and commercial dealings with foreign firms. Some sort of agreement between Russia and the other republics is likely: the Russian government is already trying to work with the other republics, although the central authorities have not given their consent. That's the optimistic scenario. Now the pessimistic scenario. Russia is not able to carry out further change. The agreements it has already reached with other republics exist on paper only and can't be put into practice. If this happens, we can expect a change in the political leadership and an end to democracy. Unfortunately, the pessimistic scenario is probably the more likely. Unrest and revolts could erupt in various sections of the country, but they would probably remain highly localized. It is difficult to imagine a full-scale revolution taking place nowadays. Revolution seems to many people to be a destructive process, and there is no group or social force capable of guiding a revolution. Scattered, localized unrest could occur for all sorts of reasons. Military rebellions are also a distinct possibility. But a coordinated action of the entire army — something like what happened in Poland in December 1981 — is very unlikely. We do not have a General Jaruzelski, a commander who could count on the obedience of the entire armed forces. Still, we have more generals than any other nation on earth, and it is not clear whose orders they are following. National movements in several republics have exploited the power vacuum created by the CPSU's decline. No significant national movements have developed in Russia, but democratic groups have sprung up. As for their opponents, the party conservatives, their strength should not be exaggerated; the party has been thoroughly discredited, especially within Russia. Local conditions have to be kept in mind, though. In central Asia, the party structures have fused with those of the old feudal clans and operate as a sort of mafia now. In Russia, there is no authority capable of effectively exercising power from the center. As central authority collapses, regional centers of power will arise. Considerable chaos is to be expected. On the whole, I am a pessimist. But there are a few encouraging signs. The advocates of reform, for example, are generally younger and better-educated than those opposing them. They tend to support Yeltsin, who is widely regarded as a true democrat. Gorbachev's supporters, on the other hand, are neither especially young nor especially well-educated these days. Also, on the positive side, it is difficult to find anyone who rejects the idea of economic reform [pageend89]88 Photo: Krzysztof Miller Photo: Krzysztof Miller Homeless people demonstrate on Red Square, Moscow, October 1990. [pageend90]IS A NEW REVOLUTION IN THE MAKING! 89 entirely, even though many people fear that reform will lead to widespread unemployment and poverty. Social consciousness has undoubtedly been changing, but it is extremely difficult to predict in which direction it is moving. Research carried out in the summer of 1990 found that 30% of the population supported Gorbachev's call for a “renewed socialism.” About 20% supported social democracy, and 13% capitalism. The Christian-democratic movement also has potential. It has developed an organization and has representatives in the Supreme Soviet — all it's missing is broad popular support. Before political events began to move so quickly, many observers doubted that the intelligentsia and the workers would be able to cooperate effectively. Past experience gave them little ground for optimism. The situation has turned out quite differently, however. Intellectuals and workers share many of the same ideals. I once saw a line of miners waiting to meet Andrei Sakharov which stretched from his apartment down the staircase to the front door. Never before in Russian history has the gap between the educated elite and the masses been as insignificant as it is today. Populism has been on the rise. There are figures like Gdlyan, Ivanov, and Koryagin who demand that absolutely everyone be called to account for their past actions. They are currently busy exposing Gorbachev's misdeeds; they have not said anything about Yeltsin. They now have many supporters, especially in Moscow. Conservatives within the communist party are developing their own form of populism as well. The most important organization under their control is the United Front of Working People, which masquerades as a trade union and spouts slogans about socialism and universal equality. Its influence is limited, though, because of its close links to the party. Leonid Sedov, an essayist and sociologist, works for the Institute for Public Opinion Research. During the seventy years of Bolshevik rule, the Russian inclination to totalitarianism once again found expression in official practice. There have been three totalitarian periods in Russian history: the mle of Ivan the Terrible, that of Peter the Great, and most recently the era of Lenin and Stalin. By totalitarianism, I mean a political system that is based on the internal occupation of a country. Society is divided between the occupiers and the occupied. The differences separating the two begin at the most basic level, for example, with the way they dress and the way they speak. The division is maintained through violence. There is also a ruling ideology. Ivan the Terrible tried to create an Orthodox utopia, with society as one giant cloister; Peter the Great worshipped reason and science; and later there was the cult of Marxism. In each of these three historical periods, a particular type of individual was created. In his behavior and habits, he is very different from anyone in [pageend91]90 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRING 1991 the West. A group composed of such individuals cannot give rise to a civil society. Russia's attempt to join Europe is also doomed to failure. Russia belongs to a completely separate culture, which I would call Orthodox-Muslim. On account of this culture, Russia has a fundamentally different view of the world. It is a textual culture: knowing does not come from direct experience, but through the medium of holy texts. It is also an authoritarian and collectivist culture. I don't want to imply that Russia's Orthodox-Muslim culture is inferior to Western culture. It is simply different, and we have to come to terms with it. The rule of law has never taken root in Russia. Instead, public life has been dominated by mafia-like networks. Historically, three groups have existed within Russian society: the mafia (the occupier), the counter-mafia, and the subjects (the occupied). In the Muscovite state, for example, the Boyar mafia ruled, and the group that was in conflict with it eventually became the Cossacks. In the Romanov state, a bureaucratic gentry was in competition with various religious groups, like the Old Believers. At present, we have the Kremlin mafia, and the black marketeers of the underground economy play the role of the counter-mafia. This counter-mafia is not competing for power. It's just trying to find a niche where it can operate without external interference; it has, however, given rise to a counter-culture that does in effect compete with the official culture. Many political scientists are discussing the possibility of revolution in Russia. Some, like Mikhail Batkin, contend that something like the February' Revolution could occur. I find that highly unlikely. First, the conservative forces in society are still quite strong, especially in Russia itself. Although there are reports that the army and the KGB structures are disintegrating, both organizations remain much stronger than any of the democratic groups. Secondly, the Russian people in general are too exhausted; large-scale revolts are only a remote possibility. Strikes and local conflicts are possible, though. I think a period of stagnation is the most likely future awaiting Russia. As for the other republics, I can't make any prognosis: anything could happen with them, including civil war. The manner in which social consciousness will evolve is also very unclear. On the one hand, the CPSU has lost much of its authority, but ory the other, a poll conducted last summer found that 30% of the public would still vote for the communists in free elections. For the moment, many people can see no alternative. The army, as an institution, still enjoys a great deal of public confidence and is even more highly regarded than the Russian parliament, whose deputies are generally quite popular. About 30% of the population participates in public life. The figures are much higher, of course, for the Baltic republics and the Caucasus, much lower for central Asia; Russia falls roughly in the middle. A majority of those polled support the idea of a multiparty democracy — over half of those questioned also supported the right of the Soviet republics [pageend92]91 The Military-Patriotic Club on parade in Leningrad. An empty butcher shop in Moscow, October 1990 ' Photo: Aleksandr Belenky Photo: Krzysztof Miller [pageend93]92 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRING 1991 to go their own way — but it is difficult to pinpoint the level of support for specific political groups. Nikolai Travkin's Democratic Party of Russia is popular, as is the idea of social democracy. The popularity of social democracy is due in large part to its name. Socialism has not yet been completely discredited in Russia; it's no accident that Gorbachev constantly goes on about the “socialist choice.” Solzhenitsyn's ideas were also looked upon favorably. In the Soviet Union as a whole, 27% of those questioned said they agreed with him in whole or at least in part, while 14% were firmly opposed. We also asked people to name whom they thought the ten all-time greatest political leaders are. Lenin took first place without any competition at all, Marx came in second, and Peter the Great third. I think this reveals much about the state of social consciousness. Belief in the Bolshevik utopia has been exhausted, but a new utopian ideology could replace it. An ideology of national renewal of the type Solzhenitsyn advocates has already appeared on the scene. If the democrats are able to come to power, the scientific utopias of the Zapadniks [Westemizers] could be revived. There is also a conservative and religious ideology gaining support now. The Orthodox Church enjoys a great deal of public confidence. Most people outside the intelligentsia are not aware, however, that the church hierarchy and the KGB come from the same school. I think the most desirable scenario would be a non-utopian one. Social organization must be freed of all ideologies. People should be allowed to live their lives freely, to exercise their civic and economic freedoms. Whenever a society attempts to carry out any sort of collective project, the inevitable result is authoritarianism. We need freedom, not grandiose projects. But freedom depends on a sense of civic responsibility, and I am afraid that the Russian people are not ready for a civil society. At the moment, social consciousness is maturing and a sense of civic responsibility is slowly developing. Democracy in the West was buttressed by the principle of the defense of citizens' rights. Here, it is the principle of aggression that is paramount: you can imagine the problems we face. Consider the problems we have had with introducing economic reforms. Russian society is completely unprepared psychologically for a market economy. Even though the market is an economic mechanism, it produces certain types of interpersonal relationships. Judging by the universal hatred here for members of cooperatives or for landlords, it is clear that the population has not yet grasped the most basic aspects of market dealings. The word “capitalism” still has negative connotations. So, the majority of the public claims to support the idea of the free market and of private property, but when you ask how this new system should operate, people answer that no one should be allowed to employ more than ten people or even that private employers ought to be forbidden altogether. Obviously, we are in for difficulties. I think the “500-Day Program” is therefore completely utopian; it will probably result in the preservation of the centralized production and distribution system with [pageend94]IS A NEW REVOLUTION IN THE MAKING? 93 a few of the trappings of capitalism. We will be struggling with our economic difficulties for at least another two generations. Lev Timofeev is an opposition activist, essayist, and publisher of the independent journal Referendum. I want to avoid making any predictions. I tried once before and, with a few notable exceptions, turned out to have been thoroughly mistaken. An awareness of what is now taking place is too narrow a basis for predictions, particularly since many aspects of our system defy all understanding. So I think we should concentrate on the present. Recently, I wrote an article defending the so-called gray economy. The system that has existed up to the present is supposed to have been based on the principle of centralized command and administration. In reality, it has never worked that way. The entire structure of Soviet rule, the party as well as the government, is nothing more than one huge black market. Only official propaganda spoke of the command economy, of an economy built upon fanatic devotion to the cause. But long ago, party positions became the object of market dealings, of buying and selling, whether for money or favors. Of course, this market is merely a means of exchanging privileges and positions: It does not produce goods or wealth. To the contrary, this utterly corrupt system thrives on a shortage of goods, since anyone who possesses power will always be able to ensure fulfillment of his own needs. The problem we face is not, therefore, moving from a command economy to a free market, but turning a black market into an open market. We have to turn a system that treats power as the main form of property into a system that regards goods as the main form of property. If the secretary of the regional party committee became the owner of a sizable chunk of property as a result of this transformation, it would not be a tragedy. Unfortunately, no one in power is willing to accept this change because the free market would force them to confront competition. They would have to act like other capitalists and would be subject to the same market forces affecting all capitalists; they might become richer, they might become poorer. Their present power is stronger and more stable than the power of any property owner, so they will not go along with reform. The issue of the black market has been deliberately blown all out of proportion in order to distract public attention away from our real problems. When the government denounces the gray economy, whom is it referring to? The people who ten or twenty years ago tried to satisfy needs not provided for within the confines of the planned economy? The people who tried to produce goods we needed — and still need — and were sent to prison and sometimes even perished in labor camps for their efforts? The people who ended up in trouble even when these types of activities were legalized? [pageend95]Photo: Aleksandr Belenky Leningrad [pageend96]IS A NEW REVOLUTION IN THE MAKING! 95 The gray economy does not constitute a danger to Soviet society. It is a wholly positive phenomenon and should not be attacked. We should create conditions that will allow it to develop further and to develop legally. We have seen from the experiences of the Eastern European nations, however, that societal demands can hinder the process or even make it impossible. Maybe this is a Russian or Slavic character trait. Berdyaev observed at the beginning of the century that the Russian intelligentsia is more concerned with the distribution of goods than with their production. It is not important who produces how much, but whether your neighbor has more than you do. This state of mind is encouraged by the party officials who fully intend to preserve their privileges and will not become normal property owners. I have Ivan Polozkov's Russian Communist Party in mind, for example, and certain segments of the trade unions. I am convinced that the totalitarian visions of Orwell and Zamyatin will not be realized, but I am equally convinced that common sense in social and economic matters has no chance in the Soviet Union, at least not for the next decade. The West is not exhibiting much common sense at the moment, either. It supports Gorbachev uncritically. Sure, you might value him as a human being, but that's about it. In Russia, he is the personification of authority, and authority in Russia is undemocratic. Western adoration of Gorbachev does not help the progress of democracy. Of course, the situation in the Soviet Union is sometimes paradoxical, and it is often difficult to understand. The mayor of Moscow, Gavril Popov, is an outspoken advocate of the free market, yet now he has to introduce rationing; decisions that would free economic initiative are hindered in every way possible. I recently wrote a book, together with some friends, intended for Western readers and entitled Whom to Help in the USSR. The Americans classified it as “anticommunist” even before it appeared! In the book, we put forward a very simple argument. Above all else, the Soviet Union should be helped with the implementation of privatization programs; the party system, on the other hand, should not receive assistance of any sort, neither Gorbachev nor even Popov. The development of a free market would put an end to Soviet social delusions. What, for example, could possibly join Estonia and Turkmenia in one state system? They belong to two completely different cultures, not only religious and the like, but also economic cultures. Historically, they have had very dissimilar systems of production and exchange. Once a free market is established in the Soviet Union, these two republics will have no more in common with one another than do Sweden and Afghanistan. I am not sure how the political and economic situation will look in the future, nor am I sure how it should look. Alexander Solzhenitsyn dreams of a federation of Russia, Ukraine, and Byelorussia; my friend Vyacheslav Chornovil talks of an independent Ukraine. To be honest, I don't know which [pageend97]96 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SPRING 1991 would be better — several independent states or some sort of Slavic confederation. I think, though, that a confederation would be viable only after the member states had experienced independence and had exercised sovereignty: look at the European Community, for example. Let me close by pointing to a very serious problem. Public opinion in the West is ensnared in a terrible, even fatal error. Great changes have taken place in the Soviet Union, but it is still a totalitarian society and will remain a totalitarian society until private property is given full legal and social recognition. For all the talk of pluralism and democracy, for all the elections that have been held, power remains in the hands of determined opponents of the free market and democracy.
