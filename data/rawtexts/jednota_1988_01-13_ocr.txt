Bishop > Joseph Fiorenza of Galveston * Houston, Texas, said in a pastoral letter Bui. he cautioned "good liturgy doesn't just happen — it requires preparation, time commitment and care Fiorenza insisted that if the experience ol the Sunday euchanst is cold or even luke warm, the community will be weak and the bonds of faith and love will dimmish." He said the liturgical reforms initiated by the Second Vatican Council "were greatly ^i needed so that the liturgy of the ' church could once again be celebrated in a way that men and wo men living in the modern world could participate in the great myster ies ol our faith in their native tongue Fiorenza called the liturgi cal renewal a sign of the vitality of the church and its worship." Liturgy flourishes in an atmosphere of hospitality. Fiorenza observed. Moreover, "the entire space and atmosphere lor the liturgical celebration deserve special attention.-A well-prepared space will invite the assembly to contemplation and will aid them in then participa- tion " The bishop urged that the skills of artists and artisans be uliliz ed to create a beautiful worship space "Attention to the physical environment in the form of appropriate lighting, good acoustics and sound systems, comfortable temperature and appropriate arrangement of fur nishmgs will also enable active par ticipahon he said Preservation of the sacred character of Sunday, principles lor the celebration of the various parts I) ol the Mass and the roles of word, song and silence in the liturgy are discussed in Fiorenza's pastoral let ter Also included are pastoral applications ot the principles presented "Sunday Masses," the bishop said, "should not be need "God from God. light from light Begotten, not made, of one being with the Father Today I have begotten you. you are my Son " And from the begetter and the begotten proceeds the Spirit, the breath of the Father and the Son.

KRAJSA, KSGG SOME INTERESTING ITEMS Illusions and Realities BETTER HOMES AND - SPIRITS By Michael Novak Jozef Hasek's 1930 Convention Report The Ženská Jednota. First Catholic Slovak Ladies Union (today the First Catholic Slovak Ladies Association), first printed its Society news on the pages of JEDNOTA, the official organ of the First Catholic Slovak Union. They later started their own newspaper which*was printed by the Jednota Printery. Then they went elsewhere for a few years, only to return after 1918 until the early 1960s. Now. in the 1980s. with a magazine format, it is again being printed by the Jednota Press ■ .under the masthead. Fraternally Yours — JEDNOTA. We would like to quote here excerpts from the Report of Jozef Husek. Editor of JEDNOTA. to the XIX Rational Convention held in Milwaukee. Wisconsin. September. 1920: You know that since the last Convention (1918). the organ of the Ženská Jednota is being printed in our Jednota Printery once again. "I have always tried to have sincere brother-sister relations between these two Slovak Jednotas. The Ženská Jednota is not foreign to us as are other organizations. We are one body and one spirit. We have both grown from the same seed. We have one idea, one goal. The Women's Union is an organization of our mothers, wives and daughters, ft is natural then that their interests are our interests. What hurts them, hurts us. and what pleases them, pleases us. "It Is. therefore, our obligation to serve them sincerely and willingly. It is in both our interests to cultivate good brother-sister relations. My efforts have been in this direction, and now that the organ of the Ženská Jednota is once again being printed in our printery, reciprocal brother-sister relations among the two’Jednotas are strengthened. "We will not lose sight of the fact that these two Slovak organizations are the physical and moral strength of the Slovak American Catholics. These are our castles that the enemy can conquer only if we undermine their foundations by our own discord. "Please God. do not let this happen. The two Jednotas are married for life. They can be separated only by our own spades and hoes." — Jozef Husek Exchange Rate in Slovakia It was announced that Slovakia would switch to a single rate of exchange for its currency starting on January 1. 1988. Prior to this time, there were three rates of exchange: one for tourists, one for foreign trade, and several are used on the black market. The Crown in Slovakia would no longer have a fixed rate, but would instead be "flexible" and "more realistic." The exchange rates would be published regularly and would be based on the relationship between domestic prices and the prices the country's goods_eam on foreign markets. • * w Maintain Slovak Identity One of the many ways the Slovaks can maintain their individuality and ethnic heritage nationally is through the Slovak press, radio programs. the Slovak World Congress, the Slovak League of America, the Slovak Catholffi Federation, the Slovak Foundation, the Slovak Museum & Archives, fraternal societies, heritage centers, ethnic festivals, and classroom programs at colleges and universities. These Slovak ethnic Interests should make us feel like joining those early Slovak immigrants who changed the countryside of Pennsylvania in those mines and steel mills, and whose steel changed the skyline of New York with its bridges and skyscrapers. The Slovak ethnic identity is one of the many precious threads from which the fabric of America is woven. Symbolically, from the sounds of the first salvo fired in 1513 on the coast of Florida from cannons made from copper mined in Slovakia, to the Apollo flight of Commander Eugene Ceman. the first Slovak on the moon launched from the same Florida coast at Cape Kennedy, the Slovaks even now appreciate that the world is indeed a very' small place, with room for all the ethnic communities.each with their own ethnic contributions to Ethnic America. Yes. "Slovak immigration to the United States was necessary in order to preserve Slovak honor." — Andrew Kmet. 1086. President of the Slovak National Museum in Slovakia. ' Ži Washington Letter Churches, an Anti-Liquor Campaign and the Constitution WASHINGTON (NC) - A debate over llquor-by-the-drink sales in Tennessee has spilled over into a First Amendment fight which Protestant plaintiffs and their Catholic allies hope the U.S. Supreme Court will resolve. Backed by the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, the National Council of Churches and other religious groups. 13 Protestant churches are questioning a campaign expense disclosure law. Touching on both the religious freedom and free speech provisions of the First Amendment. the case began in Jack- son. Tenn., in 1984. during a local referendum on whether the town should permit sale of liquor by the drink. According to briefs on the case, various churches paid for anti-liquor newspaper, radio and television advertisements without forming political campaign committees and filing campaign expense disclosures as required by the Tennessee Campaign Financial Disclosure Law. Ordered by the state to file the disclosures, the churches refused and went to court, challenging whether the law should apply to them or whether it was even constitutional. A lower court found the law applied to churches and was constitutional. Next, a state appeals court held that the law JEDNOTA Catholic Weekly Issued Every Wednesday Publisher and Proprietor FIRST CATHOLIC SLOVAK UNION of the United State* of America and Canada f JOSEPH C.

The case then went to the Supreme Court. As of Dec. 30. there was no word on whether the Supreme Court would take up the case, which unlike other recent questions of church involve ment in electoral campaigns, has generated little attention. Nonetheless, whether the high court hears the case or not. the involvement of the Catholic League and other church groups suggests that the Tennessee law raises issues of national importance. The case "presents substantial federal questions under the religion clause and the free speech clause of the First Amendment because it involves court-sanctioned imposition of extensive governmental regulation of religious bodies attempting to speak publicly on matters of public concern." argued the Catholic League. National Council of Churches and other church- related groups in a friend-of the-court brief. The First Amendment guarantees that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof: or abridging the freedom of speech." "Requiring churches to register as political campaign committees in order to address the most pressing moral and social issues of our day substantially burdens the free exercise rights of religious bodies." claimed the bnef filed with the Supreme Court. The brief told the high court to consider the ramifications of the Tennessee court action "not simply upon the (Protestant) churches in this case but upon religious bodies throughout the country which have since the dawn of the republic regarded it as part of their religious ministry to announce their religious message on a wide variety of matters of social concern." If such laws can be applied to churches, then the ability of all churches to speak out on such issues as nuclear war. capital punishment, health care, immigration reform and South Africa — al) often raised in the public forum by Christian churches — is threatened, the Catholic League and other religious groups argued. Furthermore, "when the government chills legitimate expressive activity crucial to effective church teaching on matters of public concern, freedm of expression cannot nourish." the brief said. The state of Tennessee, however. argued that the churches "failed to present any substan- ’tlal question regarding the constitutionality of Tennessee s (campaign) law within the context of the free exercise and establishment clauses of the First Amendment." Rather, it said In a Supreme Court brief, the churches "are asking this court to afford them a privilege not granted to any other group in the election process. Fundamental fairness and equality in the application of the disclosure law is clearly a compelling reason to Justify (Continued on Page 5) The managing editor of Better Homes and Gardens had a better idea, even though her boss did not think it was so hot. But Kate Greer Is bright, stubborn. and persuasive, so of course she prevailed. Thal is how Better Homes and Gardens launched one of the most interesting reader surveys in recent years. Last September. a questionnaire was bound into each issue, probing a much-neglected (and perhaps taboo) area of modem life: the life of the spirit To their amaze ment, tlie editors received back over 80.000 replies — nearly three times their most optimistic projections. Plus 10.000 long letters in further clarification. In Victorian days, people talked freely of religion, with reticence about sex. Today it is the reverse: people — including women's magazine's — say anything about sex. but seem embarrassed by the life of the spirit Kate Greer broke down the wall: After Kate, the deluge? Editor David Jordan explains In the Jauary issue that FROM OUR JEDNOTA HISTORY By Anthony X. Sutherland, Ph.D. AGAIN: CLEVELAND VS. MIDDLETOWS WHERE DO WE PUT THE MONUMENT FOR FATHER STEPHEN FURDEK? Father Furdek. founder of the First Catholic Slovak Union and father of American Slovaks. died in January. 1915. Few people would deny that he was the central figure in Slovak-American history so one would think there would be no problem in the erection of a monument In his honor. Not so. The business of Furdek's memorial was rocked with con troversy from beginning to end. Furdek was buried in Calvary Cemetery in Cleveland. Ohio, the city where he lived and worked since coming to America. Eight months later members of Branches 5, 10. and 90 in Olyphant, Pennsylvania and Branch 126 in Peckvtlle. Pennsylvania, under the leadership of Michal Bosak, drew up a resolution suggesting that the remains of Furdek be removed from Cleveland and brought to the cemetery at the Jednota Home in Middletown. Pennsylvania, and that a memorial or statue of Furdek be erected there. The signatories of this resolution. George Pro- kopovic. Stefan J. Cipcer. Paul Zlomal. Jan Kupco and Michal Bosak, believed that Mid dietown would then serve as a "mecca for every member-qf the Catholic Jednota." This resolution was responded to almost immediately by the Cleveland Slovaks Reverend Jan Svozik of the St. Joseph Society. Branch 1 in Cleveland, wrote that Cleveland was the cradle of Jednota He said you cannot ask us to move Furdek's remains from the city and people where he lived for thirty-two years. Furthermore. he added, if the Slo; vak Jednotari want to make a pilgrimage, let them come to Cleveland where Furdek lived and worked. Let Jednota place a monument tn Cleveland and let Middletown publish his works. Svozik concluded. A Reverend Jo^ef Mateicka tried to mediate tn the controversy, recommending that in Cleveland they erect some cross or memorial at Furdek's grave and In Middletown they put a statue. No matter how it Promote Jednota and Its Work Let Others Know About Jednota he himself resisted the idea. "But now. the results are in. and I'l* amazed." He himself had been experiencing a new "spiritual quest" but did not suspect that he was far from alone. Granted, the readers of Better Homes and Gardens are not representative of every portion of American society. But who would deny that they represent a most important cut of mainstream America? So the findings of the BH&G survey are fascinating. A full 50 percent of BH&G respondents think that spirituality is gaining influence on family life in America, only 33 percent that it is losing. Of all respondents. 96 percent believe in God. 89 percent belong to religious organizations, and 80 percent say that what they "want most"' from religious organizations is "spiritual development." In listing activities they find "most important" in the spiritual development of their families. 73 percent list "following moral principles." 70 percent "attending organized religious is resolved, he said, there should be a monument in Furdek s honor. At the XVII Convention in Bridgeport. Connecticut in 1916. It was proposed to erect a statue of Furdek in Middletown by the Jednota Home. Each branch was asked to contribute S5.00 to this cause. The Cleveland Slovaks began to prepare for their own memorial in that city. The unveiling of both memorials in Cleveland and Mid- - town were held one week apart from each other A me mortal of Furdek was presented bn August 31. 1919 in Calvary Cemetery in Cleveland. A disappointing crowd of about 150 people was blamed on the uncertain weather but few could understand the absence of the priests from the eight Slovak parishes in Cleveland There was not even a representative from the Czech parish. Blessed Mother of Lourdes, where Furdek served. The Furdek statue was unveiled in Middletown in a more festive celebration on September 7. 1919 There were truck loads of Jednota members from Branch 335 in Lebanon. 175 in Reading. 321 in Steelton, and 278 in Middletown, accompanied by a band. The actual unveiling was done by Bishop Philip McDevitt of Harrisburg who spoke a few words. The main speaker. Andrej Kozak, spoke for an hour and a half Also present were Msgr. De- Call!. Secretary to the Apustolic Delegate in the United Slates; Reverend L. Gladek. Slovenian priest from Steelton; George Tlmko from Trenton; Stefan Cipcer from Olyphant; and Jan Krislofclk from Munhall.

Following the ceremony, the participants were treated to a baseball game between the Jednota Home and St. Mary s In Steelton (Jednota won 27 to 4) and a guided tour through the orphanage. In all, it was a memorable day and a fitting tribute to our Father Furdek. services." 57 percent "reading Scripture." and 54 percent "praying together." Only 20 percent mentioned "watching or listening to religious broadcasts.” 18 percent "being politically or socially active," and 15 percent "seeking oneness with nature." An incredible 75 percent attend religious services once or more a week, despite the fact that only 59 percent find organized religions "sensitive to the splntual needs of today's families." A full 51 percent watch or listen to religious broadcasts "seldom or never," only 1$ percent "daily." 21 percent "once a week." Faced with a spiritual dilemma. 68 percent find most guidance in "prayer/meditaiion" and 44 percent in "Scripture." Only 14 percent turn to clergy. 11 percent to friends. 6 percent to their religious group/community When do the respondents feel closest to God? 73 percent in prayer/meditation. 65 percent in times of crisis/danger. 60 percent in "time of great joy." 59 percent in spiritual/re- ligious services. 33 percent in "communion with nature." A full 40 percent "primarily pursue splritual/religlous development when they pray, meditate, or study with a group, but 66 percent when they do the same alone. An amazing 79 percent do so attending church/temple/syna- gogue. and 25 percent when they listen to or watch religious broadcasts. । The attitudes toward others of these respondents are fairly generous, too. 74 percent hold that it is possible to be a moral, ethical person without being spiritual." and 52 percent believe it is possible "to be a spiritual person without being religious." Most, therefore, see creative possibilities for those who follow paths different from their own One topical finding is that only 13 percent regard AIDS as solely a medical problem, but 67 percent regard it as both a medical problem and a moral issue. A significant minority of 29 percent regard ii as "the wrath of God in response to immoral acts." Many respondents took pains not to be judgmental. But Ms. Greer summarizes the majority view thus "AIDS seems to have come from nowhere suddenly. 1 fail to see how science can explain Its sudden appearance except as sent from God. Maybe now people will have more responsible attitudes about sex and the integrity of the family, and their commitment tn relationships will increase" It is also remarkable thal 89 percent believe in eternal life. 87 percent in heaven. 86 percent in miracles. 81 percent in reunion with loved ones after death. 76 percent in hell 9 percent arc not affiliated with a church and 11 percent believe in reincarnation. Finally, it may help interpreters to know thal some 71 percent of the respondents are Protestant. 15 percent Catholic. 1 percent Jewish. 77 percent are college-educated. Their median age Is 45.7 years and median income 838.333. There are many other fascinating findings in this Jong survey.

It shows, too, that for most persons the life of the spirit has a social, as well as a private, dimension Those who worry about excessive materialism In American life forget an important point.

Richard Haklyut. recommended to Sir Humphrey Gilbert to take with him on his expedition to the New World a University of Oxford educator, Stefan Parmenius-Stitnicky. Parmenius-Stitnicky was a poet and chronoiogist on the Gilbert Expedition, and became known as the first Slovak to set foot on America s shores. Prior to his voyage. Parmenius-Stitnicky wrote a lengthy Latin- humanistic poem. "De Navigationc." He perished when his ship, the Delight, sank near Cape Sable. Nova Scotia. Among the Slovaks who look part in the early 17th Century American life was Ferdinand Sarissky, born in Trenčín. Slovakia. He was an educator at Whittenberg University in Germany who, at the request of the Mennonite leader. Francis Daniel Pastorius, came to the newly-founded community in Germantown. Pennsylvania, to serve as a teacher. Sarissky could not withstand the rigors of early settler type life and teaching children to read and write from "block books.” As a result, the disillusioned Sarissky returned alter only two years at "primitive" Philadelphia to the urbanist ic comfort of Europe.

R.D. 1. Box 72. Lyndon Station. Wisconsin Reflections on the life of the Slovak League of America: The Slovak League of America celebrated Its 80th Anniversary in 1987 at the 49th Congress held in Wilkes-Barre. Pennsylvania. Recalling its rich history impells us to continue its noble role and traditions within Slovak American life The need to establish a cohesive force within the Slovak com munity in the United States was evident in the early years of this century. Our great Slovak fraternal societies had been established and each was accomplishing much good among the Slovak immigrants. The plight of the Slovaks within the old Austro- Hungarian monarchy was continuing to be perplex The intensive program of Magyartzation combined with the economic plight.of Slovaks was a cause for concern for their compatriots here in America. The tragedy of Cemova of 1907 brought to the conscience of freedom-loving individuals in all parts of the world the sad plight of the Slovaks and other Slavs within Austria-Hungary. A solid bullwork of effort on the part of American Slovaks was needed. The two great giants of Slovak life in America, the Rev. Stephen Furdek and Peter V. Rovnianck. met with the Slovak Journalists on April 4. 1907 in Pittsburgh. They proposed the need for a great organization of American Slovaks, which would unite the national, cultural and political life of our people here and to work for the liberation of the Slovaks In Slovakia from the yoke of the Hapsburgs. A great manifestation would take place in Cleveland. Ohio on May 26.‘ 1907. as more than 7.000 representatives of all segments of Slovak life in America gathered. The great undertaking would fuse the objectives and efforts of the Slovak community into a major force for good here and for the good of our brethren in Slovakia. The outcome of the meeting was the establishment of the Slovak League of America. The Slovak League brought together every segment of organized Slovak life in America. Affiliated with the League were the great Slovak fratemals. both Catholic. Lutheran and nonsectarian. Other institutions and local societies were likewise part of the Slovak League. A new harmony among the Slovaks was born in the United States. Over the years, much good has been accomplished for the Slovak community in the United States and in our ancestral homeland of Slovakia. It was the Slovak League, as the niTicial representative of the Slovaks In America, which met with the representative of the Czechs in America to provide the stimulus for the rights of the Slovaks within the new Czecho-Slovak federation, which was proposed during the last months of World War I. Thomas G. Masaryk met with these representatives in Pittsburgh. Pa. on May 30. 1918 and signed a document, which became known as the Pittsburgh Agreement, which would guarantee the rights of the Slovaks wtthin the framework or the new state of Czecho-Slovakia. This agreement guaranteed autonomy for Slovakia. When Thomas G. Masaryk became the first president of Czecho-Slovakia, Slovakia was not granted autonomy and he repudiated the guarantees of the Pittsburgh Agreement. This decision would cause the Slovak League of America to closely watch the new centralist tendencies of the Prague regime. The Slovak League championed the rights of the Slovaks within Czecho-Slovakia and protested the new philosophy of "Czechoslovakism." as championed by Prague and most notably Masaryk and Edward Benes, second president of the republic. In a gesture of solidarity with the Slovaks of Slovakia, the Slovak League sent a delegation headed by its president. Dr. Peter P. Hletko and made up of prominent Slovak fraternal leaders, to Slovakia to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Pittsburgh Agreement in May 1938. A ...anifestation of solidarity greeted the delegation as more than 100.000 rallied for Slovak autonomist rights. - Autonomy finally came before World War 11. The Slovaks chose independence and elected Msgr. Joseph Tiso as the first President of the Slovak Republic. The potential for greatness was very evident in the early days of the Slovak Republic, prior to World War II. Slovakia in fact enjoyed a greater economic stability than many of its neighbors during the war years. The Slovak League of America championed the Slovak Republic because it felt that it was the will of the majority of the Slovak people. The final days of the Slovak Republic proved to be unacceptable in the eyes of numerous individuals. With the end of World War II. Slovakia was reincorporated once again into the Czecho slovak Republic. The Slovaks were never given the opportunity to choose freely whether they desired to be once again a component of the state, it is for this reason that the Slovak League of America has always championed the right of the Slovak people to freely choose their national status. It is not for us in diaspora to choose the type of government for the Slovaks. The people of Slovakia must do this. Until such time as they are given the opportunity through a plebesite, to choose their form of government, we can never accept the forced reincorporation of Slovakia into Czecho-Slovakia. If the Slovaks choose to be a part of this federation, we will accept this If they choose to establish their own state, then we must accept this decision, Until then, we must champion their inalienable right to determine the type of government best suited for the Slovaks. The Slovak League of America will never cease its quest to have the Slovaks freely choose their own form of government, one which reflects their centuries-old Judeo-Christian traditions. — Daniel F. Tanzone, National President.

(Christopher Motto} By Father John Catoir Director of The Christophers MONEY TALKS — OR DOES IT? Many Wall Street observersare quite cynical about the U-S. bishop's pastoral on economics. After all. they say. aren't the bishops corporate executives themselves who often pay low wages and resist union demands? Don't many bishops have chauffeurs, palatial homes. expensive suites, and all the things poor people envy? And here they are preaching something called "The preferential option for the poor. " Why take their message seriously? When a person j'ells "fire'” in a crowded theater, it doesn’t matter how he’s dressed. The important issue is whether or not he’s telling the truth. There are at least three good reasons for taking the bishops’ message seriously: One: The Jewish prophets unanimously condemned the rich who held as their own what was intended by God to be shared among the needy. Jewish law went beyond exhorting the wealthy to be charitable. It actually prevented the rich from acquiring title to land where the poor lived. Two: Jesus said. "It is more difficult for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God. than it is for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle." Enlightened self-interest would suggest prudence here. Three: The early church fathers challenged those with ex- Chrysostom asks. "Fromwhere did you receive your wealth? Your father? How did he receive it?" The most recent popes are oven stronger in their statements. Pope Pius XI condemned capitalism as an evil system "because it was based on greed and selfishness” and also because it reaped such devastating misery. Pope John XXIII criticized neocapitalism's lack of social progress, escalating great concentrations of wealth in the hands of a relatively small segment of society while vast numbers live in squalor. Paul VI and John Paul II are on record as condemning the abuses of both capitalism and socialism in the strongest language. The American bishops have not condemned capitalism. They believe in its reform. However, they make this crucial point: “In any- society the litmus test of its justice or injustice is how it treats its poor and powerless."

O you who are uncontamable. over whom the eternal Father leans and says “You are my Son. today I have begotten you." and thus embraces you eter nally. m the inscrutable mystery of Ihe divinity O you who are uncon- tainable. over whom the earthly mother leansand says: you are my son I, the poor one. have given you birth through obedience io the Ho ly Spirit Your name is Jesus God who saves 4 . Through the Mother you enter our world, you enter human history This molher is the daughter of Sion, she bears within herself the inheritance of Israel, her people She fulfills m herself thevdesires of so many mothers of that people Within her is the world which awaits its God Within her is the creature complete ly opened before its creator Within her is the history of every human being everywhere on Earth The history of man begins ever anew from the womb of each mother, amidst all the wealth of languages. cultures and races. The history of man, in the motherhood of this unique mother, attains the summit of the divine mystery, pined eternally with the word who became flesh the son of Mary 5 Yes The summit of the divine mystery, which no human progress can attain, no measure of human perfection equal. The summit of the divine mystery “to all who believed in his name, he gave power to be come children of God" (Jn 112) He has given them power to be born, not of the flesh, nor ol the will of man. but of God (cl. Jn 1:13).

We all have our fair share of crosses, suffering and woes yet the shepherd dying for His sheep keeps us on our toes. As sheep of a shepherd we work with Joy and Him we praise never expecting credit nor bickering for a higher raise. In the shepherd s eyes every sheep in uniquely lovable merely for seeing Htm In others we are rewarded double. Matthew Bonk. OSB Our S&ure® &f Light Moments spent with God are precious to you and me. As the head keeps spinning amid life's rough sea The world's standard is money and fame to get ahead. Better to be not "with it” but with Him" instead.

He's the answerforfactions between the world and me. When In the evening of life, time seems to be so tong. His grace and strength is there to keep us from wrong.

OHIO AUGUST 16. 1987 EXHIBIT NO. 3 President’s Welcome PRIVET We ment Ihis week for the purposes of our Semiannual Meeting, holding this meeting in tho city of Cleveland which has played such an important role in the development of Slovak American affairs over the past century. The Slovak immigrants who settled in Cleveland produced many great leaders, among them Rev. Stephen Furdek. the founder of our Society, the First Catholic Slovak Union. We meet this week to analyze our sales performance over the past six months, to analyze operational income and expense, and to study thb degree of implementation of the various financial programs, fraternal programs, and innovative re-organizational programs as approved by the Board of Directors a! our Annual Meeting in March 1986, As president. I have stated on many occasions that the present Board of Directors of the First Catholic Slovak Union has been the most productive and far reaching board in our Society's history. This board has approvd all the motions necessary to place our Society in a posture to improve its income and investment picture, and to diversify our operations into the area of communications and land development. This board has approved all the actions necessary to increase our income picture through cost reduction which will be realized when our orphanage building is remodeled, and income producing entities relocated to the second floor of this building. This board has fulfilled its obligations to our membership and the Slovak community in the cultural sphere, by approving the expansion of the Slovak Museum & Archives, and its relocation to the first floor of ihis orphanage building. It is essential thal we occasionally review the founding purposes of our Society, to evaluate how well we are keeping up with the mandates of our founder and our membership, who wish to perpetuate Slovak culture and heritage in the United States and Canada. This Board of Directors over the past two years has indicated a full understanding of the wishes of our membership, and has approved all the actions required to make the protection of Slovak culture and heritage in the United States a reality. Unfortunately, although the Cleveland area has made a long and glorious contribution to the history of Slovak Americans in the past, today there are forces in the Cleveland area which are bent on the destruction of our Society. In recent weeks all of the future growth of our Society was forced to come to a standstill, when one segment of the Cleveland area brought complaints to the Insurance Commissioner of the Stateof Ohio making serious allegations that the Supreme President and the Officers of our Society were acting outside the sphere of our Society’s interests. This group totally bypassed the requirements of our Bylaws, that complaint against officers or members be brought first to the Society, which is open to members, branches, or districts which have complaints or misunderstandings. In other words, this group had the responsibility to complain to the President, the Executive Committee, the Board of Directors, the Supreme Court, or even the Convention. Instead, they chose lo ignore Ihe Bylaws of the First Catholic Slovak Union, and filed complaints directly with the Insurance Department of the State of Ohio. This action has cost our Society major damage in prestige, in the integrity and honor of its officers, as well as postpone our growth programs in Ihe Middletown area for over three months The costs to our Society for legal assistance, traveling costs, and other expenses may. to date, exceed $15.000. because of the failure of this group to follow the provisions of our Society's Bylaws. It is further anticipated that the costs of holding a trial with the Supreme Court may exceed an additional $20.000 In my report to the Board of Directors. I will as usual report on all segmenls of our operations by department. In each case. I will outline the actions taken since our Annual Board of Directors Meeting held in New Orleans. Louisiana on March 15-19. 1987. and tvhat actions are contemplated for the future. I will elaborate fully on the problems created for our Society by the Cleveland complainants, and the results of meetings with the Insurance Department of the State of Ohio. II should be noted that today* we are just twelve months away from our 43rd National Convention which will be held at the Westin William Penn Hotel In Pillsburgh. Pennsylvania. All efforts should be made lo have delegates to our convention elected as quickly as possible, so that Ihe planning for room registration and room arrangements can be handled favorably and expeditiously Let us pray, as we begin this Semiannual Meeting of the Board of Directors, thal the Holy Spirit will continue to guide us in our efforts, and enlighten our minds and those of all who will participate at this meeting, so diat what we will accomplish will move forward the programs of our nation, our Holy Molher Church, our Society, and ultimately. Ihe national Slovak Community, of which we are a very integral part. Joseph R. Kristofik Chairman — Board of Directors August 17. 1987 EXHIBIT NO. 4 Report of the President The President’s Semiannual Report to the Board of Directors for the first six months of 1987 will concentrate on the efforts of this administration to increase Society income through a change in our investment philosophy, the diversification of our investment portfolio in changing from low yield utility bond holdings to higher yield corporate and governmental bond purchases, and a study of methods to contain es- • calating operation costs Our Society over the past century has concentrated on an investment philosophy whose basic premise is that the supreme officers have a fiduciary responsibility to the Society’s membership, and that all investments are lo be made with the financial security of our Society as our utmost goal This has been done diligently over Ihe course of our Society’s history, so diligently that our portfolio today consists almost completely of government, corporate, and utility bonds, with little or no investment in stocks or other instruments which promise greater profits today than perhaps the bond market alone. The financial markets today are fast changing, with changes occurring so rapidly that a day to day study of the markets must be made in order to take advantage of investment opportunities, and which were nol so critical just a few years ago. The Board of Directors is aware, and 1 am certain that our membership is totally aware, that the development of our fixed assets in the Middletown area can contribute much to the financial growth of oyr Society if handled properly and in the proper lime frames. The Board of Directors. realizing the potential for financial growth at Middletown, has already approved and mandated the development of our assets in Middletown by taking Ihe following actions: 1. Creating the Jednota Holding Company which is responsible for the financial and structural development of the three corporations identified as: a) Jednota Communications Corporation — chartered with the printing operations and telecommunications operations for both our Society's operations and all outside sales operations. b) Jednota Land Development Corporation — chartered with the development of our 315 acres of property in Middletown area adjacent to the Olmsted International Airport. c) Jednota General Corporation — chartered with all business activities outside of communications and land development. The creation of these four corporations has not been as simple as one would believe. These corporations were created after having received the professional evaluation and approval of our actuaries, the Bruce & Bruce Company, our outside legal counsel, the Thompson. Hine and Flory* law firm, our outside accountants, the Coopers-Lybrand Company, and a multitude of other outside sources which studied Ihe practicality and legality of Ihe proposed concept. These corporations were established after receiving approvals from the Insurance Department of the State of Ohio, and after having studied the potential for increased investment income to our Society by making the above described corporate restructuring. It is anticipated that with the above restructuring concept now in position, we can proceed to develop our communications corporation and land development concepts freely and fully. It is possible that our solvency and surplus funds may decrease for some period of time which the preliminary plans for land development are being exercised, bul after a short period of time our solvency and surplus should increase when we begin lo reap the benefits of our land investments and communications profits. On July 22.1987. several Supreme Officers of our Society, the outside representatives of our Society, the Bruce & Bruce Company, the Coopers-Lybrand Company, the Thompson. Hine and Flory Law Firm, the Ostendorf-Morris Company representative, and the Mattey and Company representative were asked to meet with the Insurance Department of the State of Ohio to answer complaints filed against the Society* by complainants in the Cleveland. Ohio area. It was noted that these complaints to the Ohio Insurance Department were filed by parties in the Cleveland. Ohio area, and this party was to be represented at the hearings by John Golias and Andrew Putka. Fortunately, outside legal counsel requested that in the interest of reducing expenses, that only our legal representation meet with the Insurance Department of the State of Ohio to review all facts. A full disposition of the complaints against the First Catholic Slovak Union is to be made known at the end of August 1987. after the Department of Insurance representatives return from their regularly scheduled summer vacations. For the record, as part of my report as President. I am including the letter received from the Department of Insurance for the State of Ohio pertinent to the complaint filed with the Insurance Department 1.

WEDNESDAY. JANUARY 13. 1938 Supplements of the Semiannual Meeting of the Board of Directors ŕ t of the First Catholic Slovak Union of the United States of America ' and Canada (Continued trom Page 9) Union was inreceipt of a letter from the President of the Supreme Court, brother Michael Ridilla. advising the Supreme President that charges of violations of our Society Bylaws had been filed against the Supreme President in the Supreme Court by the Rev. Stephen Furdek District of Cleveland. Ohio, signed by the District President. Stephen J. Kandra, Jr. and John Golias. Secretary. The complaint charges that the Supreme President has been operating our Society fraudulently, or in a manner dangerous to the membership of our organization. The charges request the suspension, removal, or impeachment of the Supreme President for Bylqwsjdolations. A copy of this letter of complaint has been given to our Exej^tWfcSecretary for Society records since no formal notice was gúreri^the Society Chief Corresponding Officer as is normal practice in such instances. (Exhibit B) The Board of Directors of the First Catholic Slovak Union will be asked during the course of the Semiannual Meeting to review this situation. and to make recommendations as to the course of action to be taken as a result of the violation of our Society's Bylaws by the Rev. Stephen Furdek District and its district officers. With this general overview completed, we can now proceed with a department to department evaluation of our Society's operation over the past six months. JEDNOTA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION — MIDDLETOWN. PENNSYLVANIA The separation of the Jednota Communications from the Society was delayed approximately three months because of the actions instituted against the First Catholic Slovak Union by complainants in the Cleveland, Ohio area. However, the communications corporation has continued its internal operations uninterruptedly during this time, and it is a pleasure to report that financial statements for the first six months of 1987 project a very positive cash flow, and with the introduction of updated computer operations at the communications corporation, the year of 1987 is expected to show dramatic profit increases for the year. Á new printing press has been purchased which is a two-color press, and is capable of production at a rate four times the current equipment in use. with a corresponding decrease in labor and increase in profitability. Modems have been installed with computer operations at our customers' plants, and we are able to have materials to be printed come directly to our printing operation ready for printing, since the material was prepared by Ihe customer, with the ability to put this material directly into our computers galley proof generating system. We are presently making inroads into the television and VCR tape area for the future, as another potential income for our communications corporation. Brother Thomas J. Guidish. tho President of the Jednota Communications Corporation, and Brother Joseph J. Krajsa, our Communications Corporation General Manager, will elaborate fully on the many new innovations and profit projections for our communications company. JEDNOTA LAND DEVELOPMENT COMPANY As the Board of Directors is fully aware, the Society owns approximately 315 acres of property in the Middletown area known as the Jednota Estates. It is estimated that our property today, because of the actions taken by this Board of Directors, has increased very substantially. This is because of the decision of the Board of Directors to have this land developed by the Jednota Land Development Corporation, and to put in the infra-structure to support the buildings being contemplated through the widening of Rosedale Avenue, the construction of the roadway from the Olmsted Connector through our property into Rosedale Avenue, the widening of White House Lane and Stoner Drive, and the recent installation of sewer lines through our property. We are the largest property owner in Lower Swatara Township holding the largest contiguous property mass, and we have excellent working operations with all agencies concerning with property development and construction in the Middletown and surrounding areas. This sets the stage for excellent working relationships in the future, and we have much to be grateful for to Brother Joseph J. Krajsa for maintaining these relationships over the past several years. The Board of Directors is aware that all progress in the Middletown area has been delayed for approximately three months due to the complaints against the First Catholic Slovak Union and its Supreme Officers, However, background work has continued pending the determinations of the Ohio Department of Insurance, which asked that all contracts to AN ANTHOLOGY OF SLOVAK LITERATURE Compiled by Andrew Cincura Includes poems, jarose, and drama by noted Slovak Authors.

Brother Regis Brekcsky, President of the Jednota Property Development Corporation, along with Mr. John Mattey and Mr, Joseph Ditchman, will elaborate on the construction plans for the Jednota Estates, and the offers received for joint venturing some of the operations in the Middletown area. JEDNOTA GENERAL CORPORATION There has been no activity delegated to the Jednota General Corporation since no positive movement has taken place at the Jednota Orphanage Building, which was to be leased by the Jednota Property Development but halted by the complainants in the Cleveland. Ohio area against the First Catholic Slovak Union and its Supreme Officers. Our Society today expends over $50,000 annually for the maintenance of this building, which has not been functional since the Diocese of Harrisburg discontinued its use of this building several years ago. This building is currently in need of a new roof, and as is always the case, a building must be maintained or in a short time it will have to be razed due to the damages caused by water seepage and aging. As the Board of Directors*will remember, this building underwent severe internal damage to the plaster and paint work when a Committee in a previous administration failed to appropriate, in a timely manner, finances for a new boiler required in this building, and it went an entire winter without internal heating This almost totally destroyed the chapel walls, the walls in the basement, and adversely affected the plumbing system which had'fe be partially replaced because of this negligence. The Jednota General Corporation should become a viable entity once the Jednota Orphange Building is remodeled, and new businesses related to the Slovak Museum & Archives created. These businesses might be in the area of a Jednota Publishing House book business, a restaurant or eating facility business, and similar business ventures JEDNOTA ORPHANAGE BUILDING The Jednota Orphanage Building, which costs our Society over $50.000 annually for maintenance has been postured for occupation by the Slovak Museum and Archives on the entire first floor, and offices on the second floor, which is within the planned concept of the Jednota Land Development Corporation. In other words, the Communications Corporation General Manager is tn dire need of additional space at the Communications Building, and has asked that we move the Society Book Inventory, the Slovak Museum & Archives, the Editor and his support staff, and all other Society operations into another location. Increased work loads and increased business ventures at the Communications Corporation dictate the need for this space, and as members of the Board of Directors, it is our responsibility to seek and approve new quarters for these Society maintained operations. At our Board of Directors Meeting in March 1987. the Board approved moving all of these operations into the Jednota Orphanage Building, and appropriated an expenditure of S15O.000 annually for the purchase of office space in the Jednota Orphanage Building for the editor's staff, the Museum & Archives, and the Society Book Inventor,'. In addition, it is the intention of the Jednota Property Development Corporation to rent office space on the second floor of the Jednota Orphanage Building to any other entities interested in locating in the Middletown area, and these entities include the Slovak World Congress, the Slovak Catholic Federation, the Slovak League of America, and any other organization which might need rental space in the greater Harrisburg metropolitan area. It is anticipated that rental charges for this space will help to offset the S150.000 which the Society has committed itself to for the restoration of this facility, thus saving the Society this expenditure over future years. All of the programs of the Jednota Orphanage Building including the leasing of this building the Jednota Property Development Corporation have been held in abeyance over the past three months due to the complaints eminating from the Cleveland. Ohio area and its actions against the First Catholic Slovak Union and its Supreme Officers. JEDNOTA HOME OFFICE RELOCATION TO INDEPENDENCE, OHIO The relocation of our Home Office to a newly purchased building in the Rockside Road location in Independence. Ohio has been placed on hold for three months due to the actions taken by the complainants in the Cleveland. Ohio area against the First Catholic Slovak Union and its Supreme Officers This building was approved for purchase through the Executive Committee, which was empowered by the Board of Directors to lease or purchase new quarters for Home Office operations. This building may be purchased by the Society as an investment, in which the society will occupy space on one of the three floors of this building. Our Executive Secretary will review the potential cash flow to be realized from the potential purchase of this investment, and will present an opinion from legal counsel indicating that there are no restrictions in our Bylaws relative to financial transactions of this nature. HOME OFFICE OPERATION - 3289 EAST 55TH STREET. CLEVELAND, OHIO 44127 The internal operations of o u t Society continue today at our present location at 3289 East 55th Street. During the course of our Semiannual Meeting, we will, by the agenda, discuss our Home Office operations in detail, analyzing operations which must be cut or reduced to produce greater income throughreduced expenses. J have asked our Executive Secretary to issue a six month operations budget statement whereby we can compare budget versus actual costs incurred in the major areas such as: Officer Travel Outside Accounting Expenses Outside Legal Expenses Actuarial Expenses Advertising and Promotion Expense Fraternal and Sports Activities Postage and Telephone Charges (Five Year Comparison) I have also asked our Executive Secretary to review with the Board of Directors the status of the following internal insurance programs: Conversion Program Direct Billing Branch Delinquencies Recommender Compensation Costs Society Reserve "Funds Membership Decline The accent for our internal operations will be directed to cost cutting in all areas without affecting efficiency or morale. The Board of Directors is asked to consider these areas carefully, for it is their responsibility to analyze these cost areas and recommend improvements where possible. MEMBERSHIP AND MARKETING DEPARTMENT Approximately two years ago the Board of Directors mandated the creation of an independent Membership and Marketing Department, with Brother Thomas J. Guidish as its Chairman, and with Brother John J. Yencik as the Department Consultant. The Membership and Marketing Department as of March 1987 is fully independently operational, with full responsibility for monthly newspaper reporting, advertising, sales campaigns, recommender compensations scales, and new products. The Membership and Marketing Department has set its goals for 1987. which are $30.000.000 in new insurance, increased annuity sales, and increased membership. The Board of Directors was presented with a five-year forecast by the Membership and Marketing Department at the March 1987 Board of Directors Meeting, and was advised of which urea in the insurance programs emphasis must be directed. To promote annuity sales, a Fly-Cruise Program to the Bahamas for eligible recommenders was proposed to and approved by the Membership and Marketing Committee. The Board of Directors will be asked to endorse and support this Sales Incentive Program, and appropriate the funds for this program, which will take place in January 1988. 43RD NATIONAL CONVENTION — AUGUST 14-18, 1988. PITTSBURGH. PENNSYLVANIA The announcement of our 43rd National Convention to be held at tlie Westin William Penn Hotel in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on August 14-18,1988 has been, as mandated by the Bylaws, published in our JEDNOTA newspaper for the edification of our officers, districts, branches, and membership. At our March 1988 Board of Directors Meeting a list of Bylaws changes and recommendations as approved by the Board will . be forwarded to all the District and Branches for their study and approval. < These changes will concentrate on the area of investments, whereby outside financial organizations may be permitted to invest portions of our investment portfolio with final approval of the Executive Committee, and the maintenance and storage of our bond portfolio with responsibility for all maturities, calls and trades. These changes in our Bylaws can substantially reduce our internal costs related to investments as made by the Executive Committee, and travel costs of the Executive Committee for visits to the banks for bond purchases, sales, maturities, calls. an<f trades Bond transactions with outside investment sources promise to promote daily activity in our bond trades in preference to tho once or twice monthly attention these bonds receive under current practice. Due to the increased activity in all areas of our Society operation, y the Bylaws will be required to be amended to include the necessity of a full time President, possibly a full time Legal Counsel (or the hiring of a full time outside legal firm), and a possible combination of several supreme offices. The Board of Directors can readily realize the importance of changes in our internal operations, and these changes should be discussed openly between now and our Board of Directors meeting in March 1988 CONCLUSION At the October 3.1987 Law Session Meeting of the National Fraternal Congress, a paper will be delivered entitled, "Challenges to the Tax- Exempt Status of Fratemals: The Unrelated Business Income Tax and Other Attacks — An Emerging Battle." The subject of Unrelated Business Taxes for fraternal societies will be addressed as this area is one defined as an emerging explosion. It is very pleasant to report to this Board of Directors and to our Membership that because of the position that this Board of Directors has taken with our Holding Company and Corporate Subsidiary Concept, we have placed our First Catholic Slovak Union in a very enviable position, and that is, being at least two years ahead of all fraternal societies in the area of non-business related income. We can now look back and smile at those negative forces in our Society which have charged the Supreme President, and through him the Board of Directors for violations of our Bylaws in creating a holding company and subsidiary corporations. Instead of violating the Bylaws, this Board of Directors can take pride that it has taken the right steps in protecting the tax-exempt status of our Society, and creating the right conditions for business investments and growth in our holdings in Middletown. For once and for all our Membership can now see that the, negative forces in our Society have never had the interest of our Society’ ■ at heart, and as a minimum, are not in touch with the real world. It has taken almost two long years, but again today we are again establishing a new landmark for our Society. This Board of Directors can now feel free lo exercise its leadership in the financial and fraternal spheres by again endorsing our growth programs in Middletown, and doing what is necessary to keep our Jednota the driving force in Slovak American fraternal affairs. As a Society we can now look forward to the completion of our plans to revitalize o u t Orphanage Building for Slovak Museum & Archives purposes. and for commercial rental offices for our Society and others in other areas of this building. As a Society we can look forward lo the completion of road projects, building construction, and total development of our holdings at Middletown What must be addressed is our Home Office situation. At the Convention held in Tampa. Florida three years ago. the move to new Home Offices in Middletown were denied by the convention despite the recom- j mendation of the Board of Directors that this be accomplished. Today, it is even more beneficial for the Society to consider this move, since in our development programs at Middletown, financial resources can be made available to us if our Home Office operations were to be moved to this location. This can mean substantial amounts of funds and grants available to us. and at the 43rd National Convention this matter should be proposed to the delegates for their consideration, with a recommendation from this Board of Directors. Let us pray that the wisdom of the Holy Spirit will continue to prevail upon this Board of Directors, to lead it wisely, and direct its efforts to the betterment of our Society as the leading Slovak fraternal among fraternals. as one which acts on its Christian principles, and as , the most dedicated Slovak organization among Slovak organizations. We owe it to ourselves as we daily live and practice our religion, and we owe it to our country, the United States, as well as to the people ^Continued on Page 11) SPECIAL to Readers qf JEDNOTA THREE MILE ISLAND A Time of Fear Newsstand Price: $4.95 $3.00 (including pontage and handling) A factual, documented, and illustrated account of an incident that continues to draw world-wide attention to Middletown, Pa.

Ohio. This year's tournament was sponsored by*thefcev. Stephen Furdek District of Cleveland, Ohio. John Golias and his local committee did a superb job and I would like to congratulate John end his committee. We had a total of 148 teams entered in this year’s tournament. This was die first year that we held the Mass and the banquet in the same hotel. All of the bowlers liked this set up. but we will not be able to do this every year because it depends on the District which sponsors the tournament as to where they want to hold die Mass and banquet. The 18th Annual Jednota International Boys' and Girls' Single Handicap Tenpin Tournament was held on May 16. 1987 at Carl's Hillview Lanes in Greensburg, Pa It was hosted by the Westmoreland County Junior Bowling League. After bowling, the children were given a box lunch and then were bussed lo Kenny wood Park in Pittsburgh, Pa. for a day of fun and rides. Our youth are losing interest in this event and I am going to try and pump up some new life into it. The 21st Annual Men's Jednota International 36-Hole and the 15th Annual Women's 36-Hole Handicap Medal Play Golf Tournament was played at Uniontown, Pa. on the Springdale and Colonial Golf Courses. It was hosted by Branch 214. Wt: had 248 golfers. The Mass and the banquet was at St. Mary's Church in Uniontown. Pa.

The food was delicious and was served in a reqdrd time of 35 minutes. JEDNOTA. WEDNESDAY. JANUARY. 13, 1988 Page 11 1 thought the speed of serving the food was excellent and I know the people were pleased also. We have a few mistakes lo correct but. in years to come, whoever is in charge of the picnic will not have as many problems to cope with. 1 hope, with experience. I can solve all of them. The music this year was excellent as in the past. The people this year were in a dancing mood and liked having their local orchestra from Wilkes-Barre playing for them. (The orchestra leader and I were in (he same gun squad in World War 11. "THE BIG ONE.” We enjoyed reminiscing about our past experiences.) The sports program for the children and adults was a big success. It was a good sight to see boys and girls of all ages competing against each other. The prizes were not that bad. If I was a little younger. 1 would have competed with them myself! A little more work is needed in this area at the next picnic. We may get more of our youth at these picnics if we offer more sports and games. The committee did a wonderful job and I would like at this time to thank them for their efforts. Our "Care and Share" program for the poor was a huge success. We collected a van-full of food and over S1.1UU.D0 which we gave to the Inter-Faith Food Bank which serves the poor and needy. The food that was left over from the picnic was also donated Msgr. Lentocha and 1 want to express our thanks to all of our members who participated in Ihis program. Maybe next time we will fill up a trailer truck! Thanks to all again. I saved this for last, because I would like to thank the members of the Family Day Picnic Committee for a job well done. For the ladies who worked in the kitchen, what can 1 say? They deserve a medal for they worked in the kitchen for three days and il was like a sweat box These women are dedicated and hard working. I am not going to mention any names for there are too mam to mention. To tile men and women who worked in the feeding lines.

I have reviewed the accounting entries, as prepared by Mary Kolesar, to reflect the January 1. 1987 account balances of the Jednota Printery on the Society's Home Office Trial Balance. Based upon my review of the attached summary of adjustments, a review of the Society's trial balance and discussions with Mary. I am satisfied that the accounting entries are appropriate. In conjunction with my review of these adjustments. I also asked Mary about the segregation or the Printery's 1987 revenues and expenses for accounting and financial reporting purposes. Mary told me that the Printery revenues and expenses are in fact segregated in the Society's accounting records and preparation of the Holding Company's 1987 financial statements should therefore not be an unduly onerous process.

Kristofik, President The Board of Directors First Catholic Slovak Union of the United States & Canada 3289 East 55th Street ' Cleveland, Ohio 44127 Re. Internal Audit — January 1. 1986- December 31, 1986 Mr. President and Members of the Board of Dir^tors: We have reviewed the compiled Balance Sheets of the various units of the First Catholic Slovak Union of the United States and Canada as of December 31. 1986. and the related Statements of Income for the year then ended, in accordance with the Bylaws established by the First Catholic Slovak Union. These Financial Statements have been prepared internally by Management and have been included in this report. As Internal Auditors, we have continued to assume our responsibility to investigate and appraise and to recommend improvements to the system of internal accounting control and the efficiency with which the various units of the organization are carrying out their assigned functions as directed. Effective January 19. 1987. we commenced our final analysis and the internal audit of the First Catholic Slovak Union of the United States and Canada (FCSU) for the year ended December 31. 1986 The objective of internal accounting control is to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance as to the safeguarding of assets against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and the reliability of financial records for preparing financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that the cost of a system of internal accounting control should not exceed the benefits derived and also recognizes that the evaluation of these factors necessarily requires estimates and judgments by management. Our study and evaluation of the organization's system of internal accounting control for the year ended December 31. 1986. was not designed for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the internal accounting control and our study and evaluation would not necessarily disclose all weaknesses in the system. Our comments are based on our observations at the time of our review without making a special study of the system of intend accounting control or operations. We have submitted our internal control letter to management under separate cover, which outlines the areas of operations in need of improvements. A.

B. Recommendations/Conclusions 1. Home Office Operations — A complete and detailed analysis of our Home Office Operations should be prepaid. An office organizational flow chart should be designed to improve operational efficiencies. Additional staff personnel will be required especially in the accounting, direct billing, and marketing departments. Personnel duties should be defined and segregated for internal control purpuses and lines of authority should be established. A staff manual should be developed. The employee policies of the organization will have to clearly defined and structured to increase and improve operational efficiency. Secretarial time is being used inefficiently in the area of typing. etc. Duplication of effort could be controlled by the use of word processing equipment. Home Office computer operations must be expanded to include ail current updates of our software as enhancements are released. The acquisition of personal computers is of extreme importance in achieving future operational efficiencies Operations of the marketing department must be expanded immediately with concentration being emphasized in new product development. The future of our insurance operation will depend on competitive product releases. 2. Accounting Department — The accounting department continues to be non-effective in accomplishing the goals of the Society. Various recommendations which have been suggested by the auditors of the FCSU and by Coopers & Lybrand. Certified Public Accountants have not been addressed and/or implemented Special subsidiary ledgers should be designed to improve the record keeping system in both the mortgage loan and policy loan departments. Accounting workpaper techniques should be improved and/or implemented in certain areas. Significant should be reconciled to the general ledger on a monthly basis and detailed schedules should be kept by the accounting department A standard journal entry log should be designed to assist the accounting department in posting journal entries of a recurring nature. Documents in the loan mortgage files should bo reviewed and brought up to date with current insurance requirements. Verification of insurance and/or real estate taxes are not being completed due to nonexistent follow-up procedures. 3. Branch Delinquencies — The billing department is currently experiencing billing delays and premium collection delays. The function of the billing department should be reviewed and improved upon A policy.of collecting delinquent premiums should be established and proper follow-up procedures whould be implemented to minimize losses. It is suggested that strict adherence to the Bylaws be followed. Delinquent branches not in compliance should be reviewed for future restructuring or liquidation 4 Purchase and Payment of Invoices — Purchasing policies should be defined and implemented. Purchase orders and receiving reports are not being used in the purchase cycle The acquisition process of fixed assets, etc. should be properly defined Limitations should be set on all expenditures with proper authority required prior to any expenditure being made by any officer, director, employee, etc. of the FCSU. Guidelines on expenditures should be established. Payments to vendors, payments for advances, officer expenses, etc. should not be disbursed until all proper documentation is received. Original invoices should be obtained prior 1 to any disbursement. 5. Investments — The audit process of our investments is currently completed on a semiannual basis. Additionally, bond coupons are clipped four to six times a year and bonds are pulled for sale purposes ten to twelve times a year. This has become a very costly process to the FCSU. Consideration should be given to the future use of an investment institution in the safeguarding of our bonds, etc. It is believed that the above processes can then be completed on a cost saving basis. Our current bond purchasing system should also be ex- . panded to include other brokerage houses. Diversification of' our investment portfolio should also be considered to include the purchase of high grade common and preferred stocks. 6. Financial Reporting — The monthly and quarterly financial statements of our Society are not being prepared on a time- (Contrnued on Page 13/ VALUABLE RESEARCH DATA Now a memorable souvenir book ol the founding of Slovak parishes and institutions by our Slovak pioneers — Historical reference book.

Strict adherence to the Bylaws should be maintained. Year end reports should be properly reconciled prior to the release of any financial data and ail reports should be in agreement. Again in 198G. our year end reports are not in agreement. 7. Printcry Operations — Printcry. Home Office, etc. charges should be reviewed for their future applications. Various other overhead, etc. charges will have to be redefined in light of Ilie restructuring process of the FCSU. During 1986, improvement has been made in the accounting and reporting system of the Printery Operations. «. Budget and Cost Containment — Although budgets are currently being prepared, it is suggested that limits be established and cost reductions be required in all departments. During 1986. expenditures increased in many areas of operations. The Society should immediately implement tight expenditure controls and approach 19H7 with a belt-tightening philosophy. Concerns over future expenditures should be a priority objective of the Board of Directors of the FCSU. Respectfully submitted. Steven G. Luca. CPA ^Chairman of Auditors Rosemary Porter.

For the first half of 1987. sales are meeting our goals. Insurance in Force is up $7.500,000 or 4.1%.

This is over 50% of our goal for six months. We are right on target. Annuities are in the highlight for 1987. We are aiming for five million dollars in this program. To stimulate naw business, we are offering a special "Fly/Cruise" promotion to attract annuity money. Anyone accumulating 400 units, will be entitled to air fare plus a four day cruise with the compliments of the First Catholic Slovak Union. Further details will be announced later. New Orleans was another notch in our ladder of successful events. The Membership Meet of 1987 showed 160 members enjoying the sights and excitement of the Old South- These Meets are an excellent way for our Society to show our appreciation for the job our Recommenders do for us. The Sales Manager program continues to improve as the Managers educate themselves in the insurance business. The F.LC. Program is moving slowly. At present, we have five who hold the F.LC. designation and nine who are enrolled in the study program. The Membership and Marketing Committee wishes to acknowledge the work of our Marketing Director. Mr. John Yencik. John has proven a real asset in the upgrading of our portfolio. ' This Committee has approved the designing and printing of new brochures for our "JEP” policy, our new Five Year Term policy and cash value and rate cards in another step to make us more competitive. The Marketing Departiii^ has taken it upon itself to be responsible for all newspaper articles'concerning membership, sales and insurance. These are to be written by the Marketing Department As we continue to grow, the Marketing Department looks to the future What will we market In 1990? What amount of sales can we project for 1990 or 1995? We must develop the product of the future now Decisions made today will affect our Society tomorrow. Our First Catholic Slovak Union continues to be one of the top frater- nals in the fraternal movement- Again, we feel an air of confidence and enthusiasm in our Society. Sales are good. Insurance in Force continues to rise; and if we could only increase our membership, the First Catholic Slovak Union would be the showcase to other fratemals Thanks to all you Officers and Recommenders who give of your time and talent to promote the First Catholic Slovak Union.

In 1980 we had $126 million of Insurance in Force. July. 1987 shows S191 million of Insurance in Force. Assets have increased by S2.2 million. Insurance written in. 1980 was S4.1 million. Already, in 1987, we have written $16-1 million The insurance side of our Society is doing quite well We are presently in the middle of "Sign a Fraternal Friend Campaign." This campaign is designed to increase our membership. We ask of our Recommenders to sign a "New" member. We do an outstanding job increasing our old policies, but we do not get our share of new members. Remember, we must replace all those who have passed on. those who have cash surrendered their policies, those that have been expelled, and especially those age to 25 contracts that have not been converted. Membership is our problem. Since January 1,1987. we have lost a total of 777 members. We urge all the Officers and Recommenders to get Involved in this campaign and sign a new member in 1987. Our conversion program continues to be popular with our members. Those branches that have taken the time to explain the program find that they are converting the majority. Some branches have not been involved and this Committee is considering contacting these members through the Home Office and promoting our conversion program. The "Single Premium" contracts rate very high in our portfolio mainly because of their fantastic rales. "JEP" remains "The One" for juvenile sales. This is an excellent contract which continues to sell well. Old reliable. 20 Pay Life, with our "Vanishing Premiums” Rider is fast catching on. Our Five Year Renewable Term has been redesigned and with its new low rates, will again be a strong part of the portfolio. The "Special Juvenile Savings Plan” is slowly taking the place of our old endowments. We have set a goal of $30 million in sales for 1987. As of July 1. THE ADVENTURES OF ZIGGY ZILCH by Rev.

Kým ste boli preč, Julka sa naučila šoférovať. Vidíš, aká je vzrušená, vari bude lepšie, keď ty, Dávid, sadneš za volant." Ponoriac iba matkám známy pohľad, zahľadela sa na Katku a poznamenala: "Tušila som čosi, prečo Anka prestala chodiť k nám. Nebolo mi to veľmi podozrivé, iba že sa niečo medzi vami odohralo, až dnes, keď som jej telefonovala a jej matka mi povedala, že nie je doma," Dávid ostal živším, ako by ho bol ovial čerstvý vzduch. U- miestnil všetkých do auta a šiel s lístkami dozvedieť sa o batožine, ktorú dá doviezť zajtra. Matka, Milka, Veronka a Danko sedeli na zadnom sedadle; pri Dávidovi sedela Katka a pri nej Julka, ktorá išla nechať oči na Katke. “Mama!" zrazu vybúšilo z Danka, "prečo nám Dávid nenapísal, že privedie aj Katku, čiže svoju manželku ?” Hneď sa opravil. Milka ho potiahla za ruku, aby tak nehovoril, ale on musel svoje dovŕšiť: “Či sa bude aj s Ankou ženiť?" Danko zatľapkal dlaňami a nevinne vybúšilo z neho: “Teraz Dávid bude mať dve manželky!” Teraz sa ozvala aj matka a napomenula Danka, že nesmie byť taký všetečný. Všetci sa rozosmiali nad Danko vo u filozofiou. Dávid niekoľko ráz vrele stisol Katkinu ruku na znak, že všetko dobre ide. Spočiatku bol trochu nervózny, ale teraz už bol spokojný, stískajúc pevne volant, ktorým narábal ako skutočný znalec, šofér. Auto uháňalo rýchlo dopredu. Dávid, aby prerušil mlčanlivosť svojich spolucestujúcich, poznamenal: "Len toto auto nám tam chýbalo. Boli by sme sa rýchlejšie dostali z miesta na miesto, z krajiny do krajiny ako vlakom. Čoskoro zabudneme, že sme boli kedysi na rozbúrenom mori." '^Práve som sa chcela spýtať," zamiešala sa matka, “ako sa vám cestovalo cez oceán? Hovorí sa. že v mesiaci októbri more zvykne byť rozbúrené." “Pravdu vyznajúc, veru hádzalo loďou," ozvala sa Veronka, pozrúc na matku, "ale ináč dobre sa nám cestovalo, lebo boli aj tiché dni. Boli sme zdraví a veselí celou cestou. Avšak túžili sme za oteckom a za tebou, aby sme vás čim skôr mohli vidieť, A teraz sa vy musíte chystať na cestu. Mama, Slovensko je krásna krajina! Boli sme veľmi natešení, keď sme sa všade dozvedeli o vás, o tebe a oteckovi. Na jar sa musíte vybrať, navštíviť vašu rodnú dedinku. Tá už nie je takou, ako ste ju zanechali. Tetka nám o tom dopodrobna vyrozprávala. Sú tam teraz pekné domky pod škridlicou a okolo každého je pekná záhrada. Nikde už nevidieť dom pod slamenou strechou. Dávid na viacerých miestach prízvukoval, že na jar i vy sa musíte vybrať na cestu.” Veronka tak oduševnene hovorila, že zabudla na Dávidovu ženbu, a ten je veru teraz už na svojom chlebe. Vantalová sa zadumala. Povedala len toľko: "Uvidíme, čo otec povie. Dávid sa oženil, ako si to otec vždy vedel prorokovať," a tíško, akoby ku sebe riekla: "Ako by podľa jeho vôle." Katka sa jej pozdáva. Meno Katka nechcela dať niktorej zo svojich dcér, a hľa, dostala nevestu s krstným menom Katka! No i tak je dobre. Meno je meno, len nech bude dobrá. Dávid si len takú zaslúžil. Teraz všetko nechá tak, až ráno dievčatá jej podrobne vyrozprávajú o ceste. Azda Dávid pre nejaké príčiny niečo zatají pred ňou. Dnes nech si odpočinú. Auto zastalo. Boli pred domom, čiže už doma. Teraz im prišlo všetko tak, ako by len včera boli odišli z rodičovského domu. Nikto ich nečakal pred domom. Dávid, vystúpiac prvý z auta, nedôverčivým a zastrašeným zrakom obzerá sa vôkol, Kde môže byť otecko, keď ich neprišiel von uvítať? Chrbtom mu prešla zimnica. Trasúcim hlasom sa pýta: “A kde je otecko?" Nikto mu neodpovedal na otázku. Danko prvý odbehol napred, otvoril dvere na dome Za Dankom šli sestry, potom matka a tak Dávid s Katkou, držiac ju pod ramenom. Keď vošli dnu, dom bol už osvetlený. Matka chytila Dávida za ruku a ťahala ho do spálne S utajeným dychom ju nasledoval. Ostatní šli za ním. Keď zbadal otca na posteli, nastrašený vykríkol: "Čo sa ti stalo, otecko? čo to má znamenať, mama?" Kľakol k posteli a smutným zrakom pozoroval otca. Strach ho začal zanechávať, zmenil ho rýchlo na žart: "Otecko, čo robíš v posteli ? Veď tvár máš ružovú, pohľad jasný, vyzeráš ako zdravý muž!” No, toto u Dávida bolo len zdanlivé, lebo hneď prosebným hlasom zvolal: "Mama, Julka, čo nehovoríte, čo sa stalo oteckovi?" Milka s Veronkou kľačali na druhom konci postele. Katka stála za Dávidom a matka s Julkou a Dankom stáli z druhej strany. “Ako som rád. že ste doma, moje deti,” nadšene pozdravní ich otec, keď ho vyobjímali a vybozkávali “Vďaka Bohu, že ste už tu!" Oči mu behali z jedného na druhého. Neuveriteľne hľadí, že sú všetci spolu. Dávid pritiahol Katku bližšie k posteli chorého otca. "Otecko, toto je moja manželka Katka," a chytil jej ruku, vložil ju do vystretej otcovej pravice. Katka nemohla vyriecť slova, len sa uklonila. Jej zrak akoby sa bol vlepil na Vantala. “Dávid, tvoja manželka Katka?" prekvapene sa pozerá z jedného na druhého a namáha sa sadnúť. "Mama, počuješ? Dávidova žena!” Vantal vystrel ruky, Dávid ich zovrel do svojich. “Môj syn, ty si ženatý ? Moje deti!" Potom pokojným a tichým hlasom riekol: “Buďte šťastní! Mama, či som ti vždy nehovorieval, že Dávid nás raz prekvapí? Ach, akým šťastným sa cítim!" Vantal, zdajúc sa vysilený, spustil ruky a oprel sa na vankúše. "Ako vidím, všetci ste ma schválne, ale milo prekvapili." Dievčatá s Dankom boli už v prednej izbe, kde načúvali Julki- nej rozprave o otcovej nehode. Dávid ustarostené pozeral na otca, obávajúc sa doznať snáď to najhoršie. "Mama, opri sa o stoličku, vyzeráš unavená." Potisnul k nej stoličku a Katke kázal, aby si tiež sadla. Keď mu nikto nedával vysvetlenie, znova začal: "Ako vidím, nielen ja som vám doniesol prekvapenie, ale aj vy máte také pre mňa. čože máte predo mnou tajiť? Otecko, čo sa stalo a odkedy ste v posteli ? Nenechajte ma ďalej v neistote. Povedzte, čo sa stalo, ako, kedy.. Matka prerušila Dávida, hladiac rukami po postelí: "To horšie už prešlo. Nechceme ti zmariť tvoje prvé dni radosti doma.. .*' Milka padla matke do reči: “Dávid, nemyslíš, že Katka za ten čas sa môže ísť okúpať, preobliecť, kým sa vy tu budete spolu zhovárať? My jej potom ukážeme celý dom i jej izbu." Dávid pozrel na matku. "Hádam tak bude lepšie. Katka, choď So sestrami!" Len teraz zbadal jej ustrašené oči. "Neboj sa ničoho, teraz sme doma," prívetivým hlasom jej riekol. “Nemáš sa čoho obávať. Veď vidíš, že si jedna z nás!" Obrátil sa k rodičom, vysvetľoval: "Obávala sa, ako ju privítate. No, už jc po strachu. Vidím, že sa vám obom páči a budete s ňou tak spokojní, ako som s ňou spokojný ja." Milka a Katka už neboli v izbe, keď Dávid vyriekol predošlé slová. Odrazu zastal. “Mama, o tom budeme mať dosť času zajtra si porozprávať, ale teraz už mi povedz všetko o oteckovi." “Dávid, len na budúci týždeň budeme vedieť, či otecko vyviazne z nebezpečenstva." Ustarostená Vantalová smutne pozrela na svojho manžela. "Vtedy budeme vedieť, či otec bude môcť chodiť. Verím, že všetko sa stane, ako si to s otcom predkladáme. Áno, otec musí — musí znova chodiť!" Matka, čo by ako bola sa chcela pretvarovať, ďalej nevládala. Plač ju schytil. Prisadla si na posteľ. Ani Dávid sa už nevedel ovládať. Padol na kolená a objal otca. O chvíľu sa opanoval a šeptal: “Äno, otecko, musíš chodiť, musíš byť zdravý!" Pohladil matku po vlasoch, tešil ju: "Mama, neplač. Takí ľudia, ako je otec, nemôžu byť len tak v posteli uložení a zabudnutí. Otecko neostane dlho na posteli ležať, čo by sme ho na ňu priviazali. No a keby musel čo len okolo domu vysedávať, či nás nie je dosť postarať sa o vás ? Len nech je doma, pracovať nemusí, napracoval sa už dosť v živote." A zodvihnúc matkinu hlavu, súcitne jej pozrel do očú. “Mama, ty dobre vieš, že otecko bude chodiť. Ja tomu tiež verím. Preto neplač, nemáš byť taká bojazlivá.” Potom matka vyložila Dávidovi, ako otec sa zranil v dielni dva týždne po ich odchode. Jedno ráno, keď došiel do práce, spadol na schodoch. A to sa mu stalo osudným. Až donedávna mal nohy v gypse. Dosiaľ ešte nebol na nohách. Lekári o jeden týždeň po dôkladnej prehliadke určia, či bude chodiť. Aj v krížoch ho mučia bolesti. "Mama!" zvolal Vantal, “o tom už dosť!" A zvedavo hľadel na syna. “My chceme vypočuť Dávida, ako sa im cestovalo." Stále pozeral na syna a pokračoval: “Teda už si manželom. Mama, poviem ti, Dávid si vedel dobre vybrať. Rozpovedz nám všetko, ako sa to stalo. Nebudem môcť zaspať, kým nám o všetkom nepovieš. O mňa sa nestaraj, synu. Nepozeraj na mňa tak úzkostlivo. Všetko bude zase dobre. Chvála Bohu, že ste už doma. Katka sa mi páči, hoci som s ňou ešte slova neprehovoril. Jej pohľad ma očaroval. Je to zdravé, pekné dievča ako ľalia. My s matkou sme spokojní, všakže mama?” Otec vystrel ruku a vďačným hlasom zablahoželal synovi. "Dieťa moje, ja vám obom želám šťastlivé a blažené manželstvo!" Na prahu izby zjavila sa Katka. "Mama, pozri sa na ňu, je ako červená ruža a bystrá ako ryba," pokračoval Vantal. "To je dievča zo šalana. Dávid, viem, že je stade, lebo len tam sa také rodia!” A po prvý raz sa prihovoril Katke: "Teda ty si Katka? I tvoje meno sa mi páči!" Katka sa priblížila ku svokre a hovorila jej: “Mama, dievčatá vás chcú vidieť.” Vantalová sa začudovala, aký má príjemný hlas. Katka jej pomohla vstat Vantalová rozmýšľala, s akou ochotou jú pomenovala “mama". Od prekvapenia išla na nej oči nechať. Naraz ju pobozkala a vyobjímala. Katka jej každý bozk plnou nehou vrátila. “Choďte, prosím vás, pozrieť, čo vám dievčatá doniesli." Po odchode Vantalovej Katka pristúpila k posteli & na čelo pobozkala svojho trpiaceho svokra. “Otecko, to nie je za tie vaše krásne slová, ale aby ste sa čím skorej vyzdravili. Verím, že do Vianoc posteľ zanecháte," tak pekne sa mu nevesta prihovorila, ani čo by tu bola od rokov vychovaná. “Hodné si dievča! Dávid, naozaj si nás prekvapil. Ale prečo takú ustarostenú tvár predstavuješ, Katka ? Nechaj to. Teraz je to ešte priskoro. Starosť si nechaj na neskoršie roky. Pozri, aký je Dávid zronený. Nestaraj sa ani ty, všetka bude dobre. Moje poranenie nech ťa ani najmenej netrápi.” Katka takto povzbudená svokrom chytila Dávidov obličaj do rúk a pozrela sa doň skúmavo. Dosiaľ ho ešte nevidela takého ustarosteného: “Dávid, akože budeš zajtra vyzerať, keď si už dnes taký na nespoznáme a to len od poslednej polhodiny. Veď som tu, pri tebe, aby som tí pomáhala, čo som počula od Julky a Danka, to sa ešte všetko dá napraviť. Všetci tak cítime i veríme. Pozri, ako otecko spokojne prijíma celú vec. Poď, chod' sa okúpať a preobleč sa. Preč s pochmúrnymi myšlienkami! Tie nesmú mať prístup k tebe, lebo by ťa umorili!” CPokračoranle) Lež obávať sa netreba!

Oslavujme ho aj my, aby sme ho mohli oslavovať na veky' 1. Oslava Pána Boha. Len pred dvoma týždňami sme oslavovali sviatok Zjavenia Pána. Pánov zjav mudrcov tak zmenil, že potom už ich celý súkromný 1 verejný život bol neprestajnou oslavou svojho Pána a Spasiteľa. AJ cirkevní otcovia druhého vatikánskeho snemu. to svojej pamätnej konštitúcii o Cirkvi v súčastnom svete (ČI 14) kladú na srdce každého pokrsteného, aby jeho súkromný i verejný život neustále’vyznával a tak oslavoval svojho Pána a Boha. Inak svojho spaseftia nedôjde. V prvom čítaní tejto sv. o:nše íl Sam 3, 3-10) čítame o prorokovi Samuelovi, ako ochotne poslúchol hlas Boží. Bolo to v čase, keď si kňaz Heli ťažko prehrešoval proti Najsvätejšiemu. Vo svojej slabosti prestal aj karhať svojich dvoch synov. Vo svojej nezbednosti zašli tak ďaleko, že sa opovážili vkrad núť do chrámu a Jedli z Alahov zasvätených Pánovi. Pán nato oslovil mladého Samuela a oznámil mu, že prevezme miesto Héliho. Samuel počúvnl a povedal: "Hovor. Pane, tvoj sluha počúva " Kňaz Heli nato tragicky zahynul a Samuel slúžil tak verne Pánovi, že jeho celý život bol oslavou Pána a jeho najsvätejšej vôle. O niečom podobnom čitárne aj v príbehu dnešného sv. evanjelia. (Jn 1, 35-42} V tem čase chrám jeruzalemský bol. ľudsky povedané, na vrcholí slávy. Chrám bol stále preplnený ľudom, kňazi im vysluhovali rôzne obrady a dávali rôzne predpisy. Hlavné ale im beln. že pokladnica chrámu bola vždy preplnená. Keď ale do chrámu prišiel Syn Boha živého, ktorého v chráme oslavovali, neprijali ho. Kristus preto odchádzal na pustatinu na rieku Jordán, aby si povolal apoštolov, ktorí by viedli jeho vyvolený ľud. Aby o Kristovej totožnosti nikto nemohol pochy bovať, sv. Ján Krstiteľ im ho, z vnuknutia Ducha Svätého predstavuje. keď hovorí: "Hľa, Baránok Eoží." Sv. apoštolovia boli Kristom dojatí, nuž sa ho pýtajú: "Učiteľ, kde bývaš?" Keď potom s nim zotrvali osamote nejaký čas, spoznali, že už viac nepatria sebe, ale Kristovi, že On je ich Boh a Pán. Nuž vyhľadali aj Simona a oznámili mu: "Našli sme Mesiáša." Keď Pán Ježíš stretol kimona, povedal mu: "Ty sl Simon, odteraz sa budeš volať Kelas, čo znamená Peter." Meno sa Obyčajne mení pri vážnych udalostiach. A toto predsa bola jedna z najvážnejších udalosti, lebo Pán tu pripravil Petra na Jeho védúcu úlohu, že bude /lesť Božie stádo a nasycovať ho pokrmom večného života. Sv. Peter toto aj verne konal, až kým neoslovil Pána svojou mučeníckou smrťou. Svätopeterský chrám v Ríme sa vypína k nebesiam, aby mohutne volal k celému svetu, aby oslavovali Pána Boha a svojim životom, aby smerovali ta. kde oslava Pána trvá na veky . 2. Oslavujme Pána ej my. aby sme ho mohli oslavovať na veky! Zo všetkých zakladateľov náboženstiev, Pán Ježiš Jediný zomrel a vstal z mŕtvych, čím dokázal, že bol Vtelený Boh a že má plné právo, aby pokračoval svoj život na zemi. Pokračuje ho v srdciach, tých, ktorých si sv. krstom vzkriesil-lomovému životu. Kristus teda neni Osoba minulosti, ale v našom živote, ktorí sme v neho uverili, chce plným právom oslavovať svojho a nášho nebeského Otca a chce nás k nemu priviesť, do neba. Sv . Pavol nám v druhom čítaní tejto sv. omše (l Kor 6, 13-15; 17-18) hovorí, že od sv krstu patríme Pánu Bohu celí, s dušou i telom. Jemu teda musíme slúžiť v myšlienkach, slovách i skutkoch, ktoré ho musia neustále oslavovať. Oslavujú ho, ak sa nepriečia Jeho Najsvätejšej vôli. Sv. Pavol mal v tomto ohľade isté ťažkosti s Korinťanmi. Boli síce pokrstení, ale ešte vždy sa nevedeli rozhoonúť. kde patria. Nábožensky sa spolčovali s nevercami, s nimi jedával! aj ich bohom zasvätené jedlá, pri Čom hoveli rôznym radovánkam a nerestiam Preto sa ich Pavol otvorene pýta: "Aké spoločenstvo má svetlo s tmou? Aký je súlad medzi Kristom a belialcm? *ký súlad môže byť medzi chrámom Božím a modlami? A my sme chrámom Boha živého, ako bol povedal Boh: medzi nimi budem prebývať a pohybovať sa, budem im Bohom a oni mi budú mojim ľudom." Teda budú Boha oslavovať celým svojim životom. Pán Beh sám dáva každý deň mnoho príležitostí, aby sme mu mohli dokazovať, že patrime len Jemu. Približuje sa k nám v každom tlkote nášho -rdca, ktorým nás udržuje na žive. Približuje s ku nám v Pravek hnoj Sviatosti Oltárnej, ako živé Telo a Krv nášho Vzkrieseného Pána a Boha. Približuje sa ku nám v našom blížnom, neraz ranenom neduhami života, ba aj v rôznych udalostiach nášho každodenného života. Vo všetkých týchto sa máme snažiť, aby sme živo rozpoznali svojho Pána, plnili jeho Najsvätejšiu vôľu a tak Hc oslávili. Toto živé uvedomovanie si prítomnosti Božej nám veľmi pomôže najmä v pokušeniach, ktorým sme vystavení na každom kroku, ba pomôže nám pokojne čeliť aj rôznym nedorozumeniam s inými. Lebo, ak sa snažíme patriť Pánovi celou dušou a celým srdcom, musíme si uvedomiť, že mu patrí aj náš blížny. Len tak nám Pán Ježiš mohol povedať: "Veru, hovorím vám. čo ste urobili jednému z týchto molích najmenších, mne ste urobili." (Mt 25, 40) Tým teda, ak «?. budeme ohľaduplne chovať voči každému, s kým prídeme do styku, tým ho nepriamo upozorníme na toto tajomstvo šťastného života, že Pán aj v ňcm prebýva a že nás s ním viaže puto jednej a tej istej lásky, ktorej žriedlom je Ježiš, večná Láska. Takto je Pán Boh v nás oslávený a stávame sa apoštolmi jeho oslavy aj vo svojom prostredí. Keď dnes pri sv. prijímam prijmeme svojho Vzkříšeného Spasiteľa, uvedomme si sc sv. evanjeliom tejto nedele, že: "Sme našli svojho Mesiáša”, Spasiteľa a Pána Neprekážajme mu, aby ovládol náš celv život, aby sme ho stále oslavovali svojimi myšlienkami, slovami u skutkami. Potom môžemaPánovi spievať medzispev tejto sv. omše neustále: “Hľa, prichádzam, Pane, natešenom plním tvoju vôľu", í ž 39), čim oslavujeme Pána na každom kroku Lebo inej záruky spasenia niet, len Ježiš, náš Druhá cesročná nedeľa PRVÍ ČÍTANIE Hovor, Pane, tvoj sluha počúva Čítanie z Prvej knihy SamueloveJ. — V tých dňoch Samuel spal v chráme Pánovom, v ktorom bola archa úmluvy. I zavolal Pán na Samuela. Ten odpovedal: "Tu som!" A bežal k Hélimu a vravel: "Tu som, pane, veď si ma volal!" Ten odvetil: "Nevolal sbní, spi ďalej!" Odišiel teda a spal. Ale Pán volal znova: “Samuel!" Samuel ’/stal, Išiel k Hélimu a vravel: "Tu som, volal si-marUC^odpovedal: "Nevolal som, synu, spi ďalej!” Samuel yšak^eštcnep oznal Pána, slovo Pánovo sa mu ešte nezjavilo. Á Pán znova, po tretie volal Samuela. Ten vstal, išiel k Hélimu a vravel: "Tu som, volal sl ma." Vtedy pochopil Héli, že Pán volá chlapca. I povedši Héli Samuelovi: "Choď, ľahni si; a ak fa znova bud e volať, povedz: "Hovor, Pane, sluha tvoj počúva'” Samuel odišiel a spal na svojom mieste. Pán prišiel, zastal si a volal ako predtým: "Samuel. Samuel!" A Samuel odvetil: "Hovor, Pane, sluha tvoj počúva!" Samuel dorastal, Pán však bol s ním a ani jednému zo svojich slov nedal padnúť na zem. Počuli sme slovo Pánovo. MEDZISPEV Dúfal scni v Pánu, dúfal som a naklonil sa ku mne a počul moje volanie, a do úst mojich vložil novú pieseň, chválospev Rohu nášmu. Hľ«» ja prichádzam, Pane, teší ma plniť tvoju vôľu. Nechcel si žertvu a obeť ďakovnú, lež uši si ml otvoril; celostnú žertvu si nežiadal, ani obetu za hriech; vtedy som povedal: "Hľa, Ja prichádzam!” Hľa, ji prichádzam, Pane, teši ma plniť tvoju vôľu. V závitku knihy písané Je o mne: Teší ma plniť tvoju vôľu. Bože môj, b zákon tvoj Je v útrobách mojich Hľa. ja prichádzam. Pane, teši ma plniť tvoju vôľu. Vo veľkom zhromaždení zvestoval som spravodlivosť, hľa, perám svojim neprekážal som. ty. Pane, vieš. Hľa, ja prichádzam. Pane, teší ma plniť tvoju rôľu. DRUHÉ ČÍTANIE X Vaše telá síl údmi Kristovými čítanie z Prvého listu svátého apoštola Korinťanom. — Bratia! Telo nie je pre smilstvo, ale pre Pána, a Pán pre telo! Boh vzkriesil Pána a vzkriesil aj nás svojou mocou. Neviete, že vaše telá sú údmi Kristovými? Kto sa však spája s Pánom, Je s ním jeden Duch. Varuje sa smilstva! Každý iný hriech, ktorého sa človek dopustí, Je mimo tela; ale kto smilní, hreší proti vlastnému telu. A neviete, že vaše telo je chrámom Ducha Svätého, ktorí’ Je vo vás a ktorého ste prijali od Boha, takže sto už nie svoji? Veľmi draho ste boli vykúpení. Oslavujte teda Boha a noste ho vo svojom tele! Počuli sme slovo Pánovo. PRÍPRAVA NA EVANJELIUM (: Aleluja:) Našli sme Mesiáša, ktorým je Kristus. Jeho pôsobením prišla milosť a pravda (: Aleluja:) EVANJELIUM Videli, kde Pán. býva. a zastali u neho čítanie zo svätého evanjelia podľa Jána. — V tom čase stál Ján s dvoma učeníkmi a uvidiac Ježiša, ktorý tade šiel, povedal: "Hľa, Baránok Boží'” I počuli tie slová obaja učeníci, a odišli za Ježišom. Tu sa Ježiš obrátil, a keď videl, že idú za ním, spýtal sa ich: "čo hľadáte?" A tí mu povedali: "Rabi" — čo v preklade znamená: Učiteľu — "Kde bývaš?" Povedal im: "Poďte a uvidíte!" Išli teda a videli, kde býva i zostali ten deň u neho. Bolc asi desať hodín (odpoludňajšie štyri). Jeden z týchto dvoch, čo bo počuli od Jána a odišli za Ježišom. bol Ondrej, brat Šimona Petra. Hneď vyhľadal Simona a povedal mu: “Našli sme Mesiáša" — čo v preklade znamená Pomazaný. I priviedol ho k Ježišovi. Ježiš pozrel na neho a povedal mu: "Ty si Šimon, syn Jánov, budeš sa však volať Kefas. čo mawá Peter (Skala).” Počuli sme slovo Pánovo. MODLITBY VERIACICH Bratia a sestry, modlíme sa s pokorou k nášmu nebeskému Otcovi s pevnou vierou, že vyslyší naše modlitby. • Za Božiu Cirkev: — aby ako verná Kristova nevesta rástla v svätosti a podobnosti s Ním .prosme Pána. • Za všetkých ľudí- — aby s! zmilovali Kristov príkaz lásky k blížnemu a všetkými svojimi schopnosťami sa pričiňovali o spoločné dobro, prosme Pána. • Za snúbencov: — ahy sa pripravili na sviatosť manželstva čistou vzájomnou láskou a vrúcnou oddanosťou Kristovi, prosme Pána. • Za nás všetkých' — aby sme sa odovzdali telom-dušou Kristovi, a tak cez celý život žili v dôvernom priateľstve s ním, prosme Pána. Pane Ježišu Kriste, ktorý nás potešuješ a nasycuješ nebeskými darmi, udeľ nám na orodovanie-Panny Márie, našej Pomocnice, aby sme s radosťou plnili tvoju vôľu a vo Sviatosti spájali sa s tebou, ktorý žiješ a kraľuješ na veky vekov OSLAVA BOHA "A’ašH *me Mesiáša" (Jn 1. 41) Na istú železničnú stanicu pribehol istý cestujúci, keď už. jeho vlak mal odísť.

Františka J. Fugu Kanadskej Slovenskej Lige. Na sté výročie narodenia Dr. Jozefa Tisu (13. okt. 1987) bola podpísaná úradná listina, ktorou 48-akro- vá záhrada Mons. Fugu prešla do vlastníctva Kanadskej Slovenskej Msgr. František Fnga Ligy. Na tejto farme má byť vybudované sociálne a kultúrne stredisko pre kanadských Slovákov z Hamiltonu a aj zo širšieho okolia, najmä v provincii Ontario. I tento veľkodušný dar Mons. Fugu necelý mesiac pred jeho smrťou je prejavom jeho obetavej lásky a štedrosti ku slovenskej pospolitosti. Pán si však povolal svojho verného služobnika prv než by svojimi telesnými očami uzrel ovocie tohto svojho daru, a plné výsledky svojej neúnavnej práce na slávu Božiu a pre dobro slovenského národa. Najmä tej cash národa, ktorá je pre nepriaznivé politické pomery odrezaná od svojej vlasti. Pán života a smrti si ho povolal uprostred jeho mnohých krásnych podujatí ý a plánov do budúcnosti. Hoci v poslednom čase Monsignor väčšmi pociťoval následky svojej zákernej choroby, nepoddával sa jej. S napnutím svojich síl plnil si svoje povinnosti farára osady Klokočovskej Panny Márie, generálneho vikára eparchie sv. Cyrila a Metoda, záväzky predsedu Zahraničnej Matice slovenskej a veľa-veľa iných prác spojených s chystaním, sádzanim. tlačením, korigovaním a rozposielaním slovenských tlačív vo svojom Slovenskom vydavateľstve. Mons. František Fuga vedel, čo Slováci žijúci mimo svojej vlasti potrebujú a vedel tieto potreby aj plniť. Vedel o potrebe slovenských kňazov, najmä pre veriacich byzantského obradu v Kanade. Hoci bol rodom i krstom rímskokatolík, po zakončení teologických štúdii prestúpil na byzantsko-slovanský obrad, doplnil svoje štúdia o liturgii Východnej Cirkvi a dal sa vysvätiť * za kňaza tohto obradu. Vedel, že gréckokatolíci zo Slovenska potrebujú kňazov slovenského povedomia a stal sa jedným z nich. Vedel, že živoriaca gréckokatolícka osada v Hamiltone potrebuje svoj kostol a po svojom ustanovení za farára tejto osady začal r. 1954 budovať nielen obyčajný kostol, lež prekrásnu pútnickú svätyňu zasvätenú Klokočovskej Panne Márii. Na sviatok Uspe- nia Bohorodice (Nanebovzatia) usporiadal každoročne púť Slovákov do tejto svätyne. Monsignor Fuga.boLsi vedomý dôležitosti katolickej tlače. Za pomoci uvedo- ] melých slovenských gréckokatolíckych kňazov (Rev. M. Rusnak, Rev. A. Krafčik) založil mesačník pre slovenských gréckokatolíkov Mária, do ktorého prispieval pravidelne svojimi článkami. Časopis Mária stal sa neskôr úradným orgánom eparchie sv. Cyrila a Metoda pre Slovákov v Kanade. V krásnom formáte a s bohatým obsahom vychádza pod dozorom biskupa Michala Rus- naka, D.D., a redaktorstvom Ing. J. Suchému až podnes (XXXII. ročník). S vydávaním slovenských časopisov, kníh a iných publikácií sú spojené veľké finančné náklady. Mons. Fuga vedel vyriešiť aj túto ťažkosť. Postupne si zariaďoval svoju vlastnú tlačiareň. Monsignor sa naučil všetky tlačiarenské práce, zadovažoval väčšie tlačiarenské stroje a zariadil si napokon svoje Slovenské vydá- , vateľstvo, v ktorom vytlačil nielen drobnejšie brožúrky náboženského a národnobuditeľského obsahu, lež aj farebné karty na rozmanité národné jubileá a aj náročné knihy, ako Eliášovu Slovenskú otčinu (3 zväzky), preklad Wallensteinovho Katechizmu do slovenčiny, Borové úvahy “Po stopách sv. Františka z Assisi" a i. Vo svojej kázni pri 25 výročí kňazskej vysviacky Mons. Fuga som ho prirovnal k veľkému slovenskému rodoľubovi kanonikovi Jurajovi Palkovičovi, ktorý svojím nákladom vydal Cyrilometodiádu Jána Hollého i Bernolákov Slovár a iné hodnotné literárne diela, ktoré bez pomoci tohto obetavého mecéna by sotva uzreli svetlo sveta. Mons. Fuga, mitrovaný prelát, nasledoval príklad kanonika Palkoviča vo vydávaní hodnotnej slovenskej literatúry V jednom ohľade ho i předčil svojou pracovitosťou. A to tým, že vydané diela vlastnoručne sádzal, tlačil, korigoval a rozposielal. Utrhoval si z nočného odpočinku, nikdy nešiel na vakácie — a len tak bol schopný znížiť výdavky s tlačením kníh a drobnejších publikácii. Možno takto zaplatil značnú časť výdavkov vlastnou krvou, obetovaním zdravia a predčasnou smrťou. Zástoj Matice slovenskej v kultúrnom živote Slovenska je známy každému vzdelanému Slovákovi. Komunistický režim Česko-Slovenska sa po uchvátení poli- $ tickej moci (1948) rozhodnul zlikvidovať alebo obmedziť na minimum význam Matice v slovenskom národnom živote. Zrušil jej členskú základňu a urobil z nej národnú knižnicu a múzeum a do jej vedenia dosadil komunistických pracovníkov, ochotných plniť rozkazy Prahy. Obetaví matiční pracovnici, ktorí po r. 1945 museli zo Slovenska utiecť, ťažko niesli toto degradovanie Matice. Dr. Jozef Ciger Hronský, Dr. Stanislav MeČiar a podobne zmýšľajúci rodoľubi obnovili v Argentíne Maticu slovenskú v duchu biskupa Moysesa a Kuzmányho a „ v daných možnostiach pokračovali v ich intenciách. Na nešťastie však obidvaja predčasne zomreli. Nebolo ľahké nájsť ich nástupcov a pokračovateľov ich diela. Konečne voľba padla na Mons. Františka Fugu, ktorý bol všeobecne známy svojou obetavou činnosťou za Pokračovanie na 19. sírane SLOVO BOŽIE [pageend18]JEDNOTA. WEDNESDAY. JANUARY 13. 1988 Page 19 Fašiangová, tanečná zábava v New Yorku Pozývame váa úctivo na fašiangovú, tanečnú zábavu, ktorá bude dňa 6. februára 1988 v oaadnej hale slovenského kostola sv. Jána Nepomuckého v New Yorku na 1. Ave. a 67. ulici Začiatok je o 8 30 hodine večer. Po niekoľkých minulých rokoch dokázali sme vám, že vieme usporiadať naozaj dobré kultúrne slovenské tanečné zábavy. Hala je vždy vzorne vyzdobená, máme zaistené parkovisko pre autá, máme nadostač jedál a nápojov a čo je najhlavnejšie vždy vyhráva nefalšovaná slovenská hudba do tanca, na počúvanie i na zaspievanie. A toto je to čo sa žiada slovenskej pospolitosti, cítiť sa naozaj ako doma na rodnom Slovensku V tomto duchu bude i táto fašiangová zábava. Máme zase slovenskú hudbu: Pám Lojzo Hasprnár s manželkou. Jedál bude nadostač, tak isto i ob- čerstvenie. r Vstupné je určené iba 5.00 dolárov v čom je zarátané voľné parkovanie na školskom Stratili sme vzácneho kňaza Dokončenie z 18. strany Slovákov v exile a skúsenosťou s vydávaním kníh a tlačív vo svojom Slovenskom vydavateľstve. Mons. Fuga voľbu prijal a s oduševnením ujal sa vedenia Zahraničnej Matice slovenskej. Ako predseda Mons. Fuga vytlačil viacero kníh známych slovenských literátov (Kalen- čík, Dilong, Polakovič), ako aj pohľadnice, letáčky a kalendáre s národnými námetmi. Postaral sa o zaregistrovanie ZMS v Kanade ako dobrovoľnej kultúrnej inštitúcie, ktorá nepracuje pre finančný zisk. Na popud Mons. Fugu rozbehla sa aj akcia zriaďovať aj miestne odbočky ZMS medzi Slovákmi v zahraničí. Aj touto prácou si Mons. František Fuga získal nehynúce zásluhy o Slovákov v slobodnom svete. Co však v očiach Bižích najviacej v hodine smrti zavážilo, je skutočnosť, ako Mons. František Fuga obstál pred súdnou stolicou Božou ako kňaz. Som plne presvedčený, že dobre, ba výborne.

A nesklamal som sa! Všetko dýchalo Vianocami a slovenskosťou. Tento “Štedrý večer“ barber- tonských Slovákov bol v sobotu večer 12. decembra 1987 v hale kostola sv. Augustina. Večer začal typickou slovenskou večerou, ktorá pozostávala z oplátok, polievky, zemiakov, hrachu. na drobno rezanej kapusty so smotanou, slivák, pupáčkov (bobálok), ovocia, koláčov, kánie je tajomstvom, že po každom vyznáni lásky žena opeknie...

Krochká. Krátko, ale výstižne prehovoril Štefan Hruška, správca Slovenského Katolíckeho Sokola. Hovoril o slovenských vianočných zvykoch a tiež o duchovnej náplne a zmysle Vianoc. Modlitbu pred večerou predriekol Otec Pavol J. Clines, farár osady sv. Augustína. Po chutnej štedrovečernej večeri Slovenskí speváci z Can- tonu pripravili pre prítomných výber slovenských vianočných piesni a kolied. Predsedníčkou tohto barber- tonského “štedrého večera" bola i teraz neúnavná a skrz-naskrz láskou k Slovensku a vset- kém,u slovenskému presiaknutá pani Margita Klukova. Pomáhali jej Marge Pramíková, Trúda Kozlowská, Ján M. Krochká, Irena Arnoldova, Anna Abrahamova, Jakub Sapák, A1 Ki- mak, Anna Nagyova a samozrejme jej manžel Frank. Vari štvrtina z prítomných, okolo dvesto ľudí, bola oblečená do slovenských krojov, čo veľmi pekne dopĺňalo slovenského ducha tohto Štedrého večera barbertonských Slovákov. Po programe vyhrávala hudba Jozefa Ligasa. Ján Beliansky Ján S.

Gajdoš Správy slovenského vysielania Vatikánskeho rozhlasu VATIKÁN — "Úkon zasvätenia Matke Božej a Kráľovnej Poľska na Jasnej Hore je zakorenený v histórii toho veľkého paradoxu, ktorého prvou vlasťou je samé evanjelium — povedal Svätý Otec skupine 18 poľských biskupov, ktorí na čele s kardinálom Henrykom Gul- binowxczom prišli na návštevu "ad iimina apostolorum" do Ríma. — Poukazuje nám našu “polskú cestu“ k novému tisícročiu kresťanstva ak novej evanjelizácii Cirkvi v Poľsku.” Z úkonu zasvätenia vyplýva aj kľúčový problém pre našu pastoračnú službu: '‘bojovať za dobré užívanie primerané užívanie slobody medzi našimi krajanmi. To znamená vždy a všade užívať slobodu v pravde. A v tomto zápase vyhľadávať aj spojencov. Panna Mária z Jasnej Hory musí ostať prvou xnedzi našimi spojencami." Ján Pavol H. ďalej poukázal na právo náboženskej slobody, ktoré nemôže ostať oddelené od celku práv ľudskej osoby a ľudských spoločenstiev. HOTxANDSKO — 17. decembra zomrel vo veku 87 rokov holandský k a r d inál Bernard Alfrink. ktorý- bol na čele holandskej cirkvi v ťažkých 60. a 70. rokoch. Zomrel na porážku srdca v nemocnici sv. Antona v Niewechgeine, kde sa liečil od 25. septembra. Kardinál Alfrink pochádzal z Nejkerku, silného centra holandského protestantizmu. Studoval na seminári v Utrechte, kde bol za kňaza vysvätený roku 1924. Teologické štúdiá dokončil v Ríme. Kardinál Jozef Tomko navštívil Afriku Rím — Kardinál Jozef Tomko, prefekt Kongregácie pre evanjelizáciu národov, navští* vil v dňoch 10. do 15. decembra africký štát Burundi. Na letisku ho privítal apoštolský pro- nuncius, všetci biskupi krajiny a riaditeľ protokolu Ministerstva zahraničia. Kardinál Tomko navštívil semináre, noviciáty hlavnejších rehoľných spoločnosti a viaceré rehoľné inštitúty. V sobotu 12. decembra predsedal na slávnostných bohoslužbách v mariánskej svätyni “Mater Misericordiae” v Gitega v prítomnosti vyše 20 tisíc veriacich. Na programe bolo aj korunovanie sochy Panny Márie. Vrcholom jeho návštevy v Burundi bola národná mariánska púť na horu Mu- gera v srdci Burundi, na ktorej je napodobenina lurdskej jaskyne. Toto miesto sa pokladá za národnú svätyňu v Burundi od prvvch rokov evan- jelizácie z konca minulého storočia.

Po smrti kardinála De Jonga roku 1955 bol menovaný za arcibiskupa. Ján XXUI. r 1960 ho vymenoval za kardinála. BOLÍVIA — Mons. Sandoval. predseda Konferencie bó- lívskeho episkopátu, oznámil, že Svätý Otec Ján Pavol IL navštívi Bolíviu 9. mája budúceho roku. Bolívia očakáva od tejto návštevy potrebnú silu, aby mohla pokračovať vo výstavbe krajiny v duchu spravodlivosti a solidarity. Mons. Sandoval o sociálnej situácii Bolívie povedal, že “nemožno vyžadovať bolesť a utrpenie len od nezamestnaných a od tých čo dostávajú nízke platy, zatiaľ čo iní nežijú v neistote o bezprostrednú budúcnosť.” Vyzval majetnejších občanov, aby sa aj oni podieľali na obetiach. MOSKVA — Časopis moskovských liberálov “Okfábr" uverejnil v posledných dňoch veľa listov čitateľov, ktorí by chceli rehabilitovať postavu Stalina. Hoci časopis je proti- stalinovského zamerania, dal miesto aj svojim protivníkom s nasledovným vysvetlením: "Duch glasnosti spočíva práve v tomto: zaistiť všetkým, aj tým, čo ináč zmýšľajú ako my, právo prejavu slobodu slova a myslenia." RÍM — Imre Miklos, tajomník Sekretariátu pre náboženské záležitosti v Maďarsku, ktorý’ už vyše 40 rokov kontroluje činnosť Cirkvi v Maďar* skn. v rozhovore so zástupcom talianskeho katolíckeho denníka AWENIRE medziiným povedal: "Cesta, na ktorú sme nastúpili od 50-tych rokov nebola ľahkým procesora; situácia bola zložitá, všetci sme sa dopustili omylová netrpezlivostí. Tak my ako i Cirkev museli sme prekonať vzájomné podozrievania. My sme sa zriekli idey, že náboženstvo musí zaniknúť v socializme. A Cirkev zo svojej strany musela uznať, že socialistický štát nie je prechodný. Po konfrontácii a zápase v prvých 50-tych rokoch našli sme alternatívnu cestu, dialógu a spolupráce Naše rozdielne ideologické koncepcie ostávajú, ale -vieme nájsť, čo je spoločné v záujme národa." O situácii v Cesko-Slovensku Miklos povedal :“Nie je mojou úlohou rozdávať rady. Môžem iba konštatovať, že v Cesko- Slovensku sa vytvorilo mnoho problémov ako hora kameňov, ktoré sa neprestávajú hromadiť Azda nastal čas, aby sa z jednej i druhej strany začali odstraňovať.” RÍM — Nedávny prieskum v Taliansku priniesol prekvapujúce výsledky: skoro 80% opýtaných Talianov pokladá modlitbu za podstatnú časť ľudského života: 16% ju pokladá za dôležitú a iba 3.7% za zbytočnú. Co sa týka praxe modlitby iba 7.3% mladých. 3.3%- osôb stredného veku a iba 2% dospelých vyhlásilo, že sa nikdy nemodlia. Všetci ostatní. absolútna väčšina sa viac-menej modlí. JAPONSKO — Jinyu Morishita. 45-ročny japonský budhistický mních sa vydal na cestu svetom, aby upozorňoval ľudstvo na nebezpečenstvo jadrovej vojny. Tento mnich sa eelý týždeň postil — ako hovorí — "aby sa osvietili mysle Reagana a Gorbačova” počas ich dôležitého stretnutia vo Washingtone. JERUZALEM — V Jeruzaleme zomrel prof. Nicu Haas, antropológ na Hebrejskej univerzite v Jeruzaleme, ktorý- žil v bezvedomí 13 rokov. Bol známy ako jediný vedec, ktorý identifikoval ostatky ukrižovaného muža spred 2 tisíc rokov. Kostra bola objavená v jaskyni 3 kilometre vzdialenej od miesta, na ktorom v čase rímskej okupácie Palestíny sa ko- návali ukrižovania. Prof Haas, ktorý- na Hebrejskej univerzite v Jeruzaleme vyučoval anatómiu a antropológiu, pochádza z Rumunska. VATIKÁN — "Mnohí ľudia v Poľsku .zvlášť katolícki laici, sa obracajú dnes na Cirkev s dôverou a nádejou, že nájdu v nej nielen porozumenie, ale aj možnosť uskutočňovať .svoje ľudské a kresťanské povolanie" — povedal Sv Otec skupine 40 poľských biskupov, ktorých pri jal v túto sobotu na audiencii v Konzistoriálnej sieni vo Vatikáne. — Ich oduševnenia a dobrú vôľu musia sj duchovní pastieri ceniť a prijimať s pozornosťou a láskavosťou. Cirkev je vychovávateľkou národov a ľudu, pretože sama je "Božím ľudom". Túto veľkú ú- lohu dávať dôvody života a nádeje má aj Cirkev v Poľsku. Dôležitou úlohou a veľkou pastorálnou zodpovednosťou Cirkvi je: vedieť udržať spojenie s ľudom, podieľať sa na jeho starostiach, na jeho nespokojnostiach. na jeho ťažkostiach, formovať správne svedomie jednotlivcov i spoločnosti, aby ľudia správne hodnotili svoje postoje a povinnosti v osobnom, rodinnom i spoločenskom živote. Problém laikov a laického apoštolátu má základnú dôležitosť v tejto oblasti." RÍM — Na inej audiencii Ján Pavol II. prijal skupinu okolo 40 osôb z Korutánska, ktorá darovala vianočný strom, ktorý stál pri. veľkom betleheme na námestí sv. Petra počas minu- Jvch vianočných sviatkov. Skupinu Korutáncov sprevádzal ich biskup Mons. Kapellari. PARÍŽ — Trvalá rada francúzskeho episkopátu vydala vyhlásenie s názvom "Prispe- vok Cirkvi k demokratickej debate” pri príležitosti volieb, ktoré sa budú konať vo Francúzsku v máji budúceho roku. Vyhlásenie po krátkom úvode sa dotýka nasledovných tém: sociálne problémy a zodpovednosť, medzinárodná solidárnosť výchovný systém, úcta k životu, manželstvo a rodina .integrácia prisťahovalcov a demokratická debata. Francúzski biskupi vydali podobné vyhlásenie pred voľbami aj vo februári 1981. RÍM — Medzinárodné združenie malých speváčkov “Pueri cantores" organizovalo v Ríme kongres v dňoch od 28. decembra do 1. januára. Zakladateľom tohto združenia malých speváčkov bol francúzsky kňaz O. Femand Maillet, ktorý ako znalca hudby chcel obnoviť posvätný spev v Cirkvi podľa smerníc sv. Pia X. Mali speváč- kovia majú všade na svete rovnaké biele rúcho. Podobné kongresy už mali v Lurde Paríži. Londýne, v Mexiku, v Brusseli a vo Viedni. Na programe mali viaceré vystúpenia v niektorých rímskych kostoloch. Na Nový rok spievali na slávnostnej pápežskej sv. omši za svetový mier vo svätopeterskej bazilike.

WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 13, 1988 - Mária Valéria a Dušan Tóth 25 rokov v stave manželskom Naša jubilantka Mária Valéria Tóthová, dcérka An d rajka, syn Peter a náš Jubilant Dušan Tóth. Dva životy, dve srdcia — m po jen é v priateľstve s láske. Dušan a Valéria. Nechce sa nám veriť. veď obaja vyzerajú veľmi mladí, ale je to vraj pravda, že pán farár Dušan Tóth a pani farárka Mária Valéria dožili sa dňa 17. novembra 1987 požehnaných 25 rokov stavu manželského. Členovia slovenskej evanjelickej cirkvi sv. Pavla v Torontě, rozhodli sa, že z tohto príležitostného jubilea urobia nie- čo, čo naši jubilanti Dusan a Mária Valéria ako aj ich diet- ky Peter a Andrejka dlhé roky nezabudnú a budú si vedomí toho, ako sú obľúbení medzi členmi cirkvi ako aj u ich najbližších priateľov, ktorých naši jubilanti určite majú nie len v Torontě ale po celom slobodnom svete ako aj doma na rodnom Slovensku. V sobotu dna 14. novembra 1987 plní sa náš slovenský e- vanjelický kostol sv. Pavla, prichodia členovia cirkvi, priatelia a členovia najbližší v rodine našich jubilantov, aby ai spomenuli na tento ich slávnostný a pamätný den a tiež aby vzdali úctu našim jubilantom za prácu, ktorú už vyše 16 rokov tuná medzi nami v Torontě či už v kostole alebo náš jubilant ako generálny tajomník Svetového kongresu Slovákov vykonáva aj s jeho milou manželkou Valériou. Ďakovné bohoslužby začali o 5 30 popoludní, ktoré vykonal pán farár Daniel, ktorý zavítal medzi nás z Akron, Ohio, aj s jeho milou manželkou. Počas pobožnosti na organe bral Dr. Dérer. Po ďakovnej pobožnosti naši jubilanti obnovili si aj ich stav manželský, ako to býva v našom kresťanskom živote. Boli sme dojatí slovami Rev. Daniela, ktorý nám zdôraznil význam stavu manželského. Tak ootom všetci zišli dole do haly pod kostolom, kde pri- šli ešte ďalší hostia, takže vyše 200 hostí zaplnilo halu, ktorí prišli vzdat úctu našim jubilantom. Svadobná hostina,začala podávaním chutnej večere a ob- radníkom tohto jubilejného večierku hol nám dobre známy Janko Benko, predseda slovenskej evanjelickej cirkvi kostola sv. Pavla v Torontě. Veľmi náa dojalo, keď syn Peter a dcérka Andrejka ukázali pám diapozitívy. ktoré zrobili z obrázkov z minulosti ako aj z prítomného Času. Mali sme možnosť vidieť našich jubilantov, ako začínali pred 25 rokmi sa schádzať, potom svadbu, tiež narodenie syna Petra, ktorý sa im narodil v Bratislave a dcérky Andrej- ky, ktorá sa im narodila už v East Chicago, Hl., USA. V krátkosti prehovoril prítomný predseda SKS pán Štefan Roman, ktorý zdôraznil význam práce, ktorú náš jubilant vykonáva ako dnes už 16 rckov generálny tajomník SKS a tiež vzdal vďaku jubilantke, ktorá vždy a všade stojí za svojim manželom a ako sa povie, kde je dobrá a rozumná žena, je aj rozumná práca v rodine- Tiež nás dojalo, keď vystúpil riaditeľ Torontskej operety pán Guillermo Silva -Marin, ktorý zaspieva) z opery Gejza Dusíka “Hrnčiarsky bil“. "Najkrajší kút v šírom svete”, a “Ja svoje srdce dám”. Určite každý mal pôžitok počuť tieto krásne slovenské piesne. Potom ujal sa slova Dr. Vladimir Bu- tora, ktorý v mene prichodiacich slovenských emigrantov v tomto čase poďakoval sa naším jubilantom za ich pomoc, ktorú oba ja ako Dušan a Valéria všade, kde to najviac zapotreby a nikdy nepovedia, že nemajú času. Prítomní z rodiny našich jubilantov boli: m a nŕi čka jubilantky pani Solarová, ako aj sestra Alica z Kitchener, Ont, tiež druhá sestra Darina z Chicago, Ill., s ich rodinkami. Prítomná bola aj pani Betka Romanová a tiež bezmála všetci spolupracovníci SKS, ktorí žijú v Torontě na čele s Dr. Jozefom Kirschbaumom a jeho man Selkou. Ďalej prítomná bola pi Rasmussenová, teta našich jubilantov z USA. ktorá veľmi krásne pripomenula začiatky našich jubilantov, ako prišli do USA. Ako ťažko to bolo, keď človek nerozumie anglicky a ona zdôraznila, že ona zase nevie alovenaky, nuž ale ako krásne sa vedeli dohovoriť. Určite tieto pripomienky padli veľmi dobre našim jubilantom. V krátkosti z histórie jubilantov. Náš jubilant Dušan narodil sa v Modre a jubilantka Januárová úvaha Januárom sa začína nový rok. Keďže január je prvým mesiacom v roku, robia sa plány nielen pre tento mesiac, ale pre celé ročné obdobie. Prv však, než človek prikročí k novým plánom, musi si akosi zhrnúť udalosti predchádzajúceho roku a urobiť bilanciu. Z tejto bilancie robíme uzáver, ktorý nám ukáže, čo sme robili správne a čoho sa treba vyvarovať. A takto prichádzame k novým predsavzatiam,.novým plánom, novým ideám. Ľudstvo od pradávna, rok za rokom, prechádzalo týmto procesom, kedy pri otváraní nového obdobia, novej fázy dejín, nového roku zažiarili nové nádeje o lepšiu budúcnosť sveta, sveta naplneného pokojom, láskou a blahobytom. Nádeje, predsavzatia, plány — to sú méty, ktoré nás vedú životom, ktoré dávajú náplň životu, ktoré usmerňujú naše konanie. Bez nich by nebolo pokroku, bez nich by bola stagnácia a konečný zánik. Nuž i náš slovenský život v Kanade, ba nielen v Kanade, ale i v ostatnom avete, sa muaí niesť v znamení napredovania, Mária Valéria, rodená Soláro- vá, narodila sa v Bratislave. Sobášili sa dňa 17. novembra 1962 prvé na radnici v Bratislave a cirkevný sobáš mali v evanjelickom kostole v Pezin- ku. Sobášil ich prof. Dr. Karol Gábriš a počas obradov spieval spevokol evanjelickej Fakulty. Do USA prišli dna 4. februára 1969 a so sebou priniesli si syna Petra, ktorý sa narodil v Bratislave. Dnes Peter študuje na Torontskej Univerzite lekárnictvo a dcérka Andrejka narodila sa im už v East Chicago, Ind. a dnes chodí do High School. Ako som spomenul, dlho si budú spomínať naši jubilanti na tento krásny večierok, ale dlho si budeme spomínať ej my ostatní, ktorí sme mali možnosť zúčastniť sa tohto večierku: Verím však, že pri čítaní týchto riadkov tisíce Slovákov roztratených po celom slobodnom svete ako aj doma na Slovensku budú v srdciach s Vami, drahí jubilanti a každý bude Vám priať to isté, čo sme Vám priali my prítomní a to mnoho zdravia a šťastia, dožitia sa v požehnaní Božom aj 50 rokov stavu manželského. Toto Vám prajeme my přítomni, ale aj ostatní Vaši priatelia, ktorí Vás mali možnosť poznať za tie roky, čo ste medzí nami, či už v kostole sv. Pavla alebo ako pracovnici v slovenskom národe. V mene všetkých prítomných Vám želá všetko dobré Bernard Kadnár spravodaj Jednoty z Toronta v znamení pokroku. Musíme sa pýtať sami seba, ako kedysi starí Rimania: “Quo vadis, hornine?" Kde sa uberáš, človeče? Musíme vedieť, kde ideme, čo chceme vykonať, aké ciele chceme dosiahnuť. Iba loď, ktorá má presný kurz plavby na mori, dostane sa do vyvoleného prístavu. Náš. slovenský národ pozná svoj vyvolený prístav — je to národná samobytnosť a jej cieľ — byť pánom na svojom, obrábať si svoju hrudu a brať z nej osoh celý. Nechce byť viac nájomníkom na svojej vlastnej postati. Za toto pracovali celé generácie našich predkov a je na nás, aby sme aj my držali pred svojimi očami tento cieľ, živili v našej hrudi tieto nádeje a rozpaľovali v ardci tieto predsavzatia na začiatku nového roku, aby sme mohli so zadosťučinením povedať, keď sa tento rok pominie, že sme v duchu našich predkov konali a že sme aj urobili, čo nám vštepovali do našich slovenských sŕdc' "Nič pre seba, všetko pre národ." Na prahu nového roku dvíhame naše zraky k Pánovi neba i zeme a prosbou, aby žehnal VRELÉ NOVOROČNÉ POZDRAVY Z DUBOVÉHO LESA! Dostávame časopis “Slobodné Slovensko” zo Západného Nemecka. Sú to zaujímavé a dokonalé noviny, ktoré zahrňujú dejiny náboženské, kultúrne, spoločenské aj politické- Rada ich mám, lebo keď mám veľa čítať, nemám na to všetko potrebného a túžobného času, dokonale všetko prečítať, ale ich poprezerám s očami dosť dobre. A tu a tam sa dobre zastavím, že čo to tu píšu. A som sa naozaj zastavila nad touto zvesťou. Radšej vám vypíšem, ako je to v reportáži (z dcembrové- ho čísla 1987): “Zjavila sa Panna Mária na Ukrajine?” — Ešte vlani v apríli na Bielu nedeľu zjavila sa llročnému dievčaťu Marine Kizynovej Panna Mária nad vežou zatvoreného kostola v Gurseve. Zvesť sa bleskové rozšírila po celej Ukrajine. “Kronika Ukrajinskej Cirkvi“ oznámila, že odvtedy putujú denne tisícky Ukrajincov do tejto obce. Raz ich narátali na 80,000' Referoval o tom aj stranícky orgán 'leninská Molod" a napísal, že medzi pútnikmi je neobyčajne veľa mladých ľudí. Skupina študentov prišla takmer z tisíc kilometrovej vzdialenosti Dnepropetrovsk!. 13. mája 1987 sa s vecou zaoberala aj sovietska televízia, ale počas vysielania o udalostiach v Gurševe sa aj na obrazovke zjavila Panna Mária! A v ten- deň bolo 70. výročie zjavenia vo Fatime! Komunistická tlač označuje tieto udalosti ako "vynález” gréckokatolíkov a že vraj zjavenia v Gurševe patria do ríše halucinácii. Je to vraj “protisovietska propaganda katolíkov východného obradu na Ukrajine, ktorí sú spojení r Rímom”. Tak sami komunisti predstavili našu nebeskú Matku, a dali ju na televíziu. Jak je to všetko pravda (ja tom uverím), vďaka Ti naša Matička Božia1 Zas k nám zavítal ľud na naše dve Štedré večere! Sú to nám milí návštevníci.

A to ich kuchárenie je výborné a jedlo veľmi chutné. Stála som na ulici čakajúc na autobus- Stál tam aj jeden chlap, ktorý sa dal do reči a mi povedal, že on počul o tých večeroch, a že tie “mashed potatoes were the best out- My wife wants the redpe"! Keď Slovenka varí ,ona varí zo srdca a nie z knihy. Ďakujeme aj ženám a dievčatám Modrej Armády, ktoré obsluhovali hosťov. Výborná obsluha. (Boli aj v rovnošate). Každý sa cítil ako doma a uctený.

Prv než zakončíme túto pamätnú slávnosť polstoročia jubilea založenia 4 ženského zboru a sa rozídeme do tepla našich domov, mám česť previesť ešte jeden akt blízky môjmu srdcu. Dostala sa mi úloha pozdraviť človeka, ktorý sa natrvalo zapísal do našich srde tu v Montreale i do sŕdc tých, ktorí mali možnosť stretnúť sa s ním a podiskurovať s ním o tých našich ťažkostiach a radostiach, s ktorými sa stretávame v našom každodennom národnom, spolkárskom a kultúrnom živote- Hneď na začiatku treba o úom povedať, že jeho štedrosť tieni iba jeho večne usmiata tvár a jeho pohotová pohostinnosť. Jeho práca a činnosť na poli národno-kultúmom a spolkárskom zasluhuje si našej pozornosti. Všimnul si jej aj Svetový kongres Slovákov a sa rozhodol udeliť mu Záslužný diplom. Inštitút o udeľovaní vyznamenaní SKS hovorí "Záslužný diplom udeľuje sa osobám, ktoré sa dlhoročnou činnosťou, alebo iným mimoriadnym spôsobom zaslúžili o rozvoj slovenskej kultúry, o presadzovanie slovenských záujmov, alebo šírenie dobrého mena Slovákov vo svete.” Človek, ktorého si ideme uctiť takýmto spôsobom má tieto kvalifikácie a nie je ani “nováckom", keď ide o vyznamenania. Tie už dostal od odborových organizácii za svoju mimoriadnu podnikavosť a vzorné vedenie svojho vlastného podniku. Preto je len potešu- júce, že i my Slováci všímame si prácu a činnosť našich vlastných ľudí a si ju oceňujeme, dokiaľ ešte stoja na nohách. Recipienta Záslužného diplomu SKS všetci dobre poznáme. Keď niekto, tak on s! také vyznamenanie zaiste zaslúžil. Jeho dávny priateľ sa o ňom vyslovil, že “od svojej útlej mladosti žil slovenskej veci a nestratil záujem o osud našeho národa ani v ťažkých okolnostiach po vojne v utečeneckých táboroch“. nám rodina Beňovičová zo Seven Hills, Ohlo vzácny balík pre múzeum.

Je to mflj priateľ, priateľ nás všetkých a všetkého, čo dýcha slovenskosťou — brat Kornel plaček. S Kornelom sa poznáme už dlhé roky. Z Rakúska poslal list našej redakcii a pripojil k nemu aj äteplíkovej veľkosti dve fotografie — svoju a brata Emila, aby sme pre nich našli sponzora, lebo chcú emigrovať do Kanady. O živobytie sa postarajú sami, len aby sa dostali do Kanady. Vec som vybavil Neskoršie som sa dozvedel od jeho blízkeho priateľa, ktorý ho poznal veľmi dobre, že Kornel je vytrvale podnikavý mladý muž, keď si zaumieni, “vykreše z kameňa krv”. Krv z kameňa síce nevykresal, no vykresal z tvrdého emigrantského života so svojou manželkou Blankou .prosperujúci ú- deninársky závod "A 1 p in a”, ktorého výrobky sú známe po celom svete. Drahý Kornel! Je pre mňa nesmiernou cťou, že tí môžem odovzdať Záslužný diplom Svetového kongresu Slovákov so srdečným pozdravom Dr. Jozefa Kirschbauma a celého sekretariátu tej vrcholnej reprezentácie Slovákov v zahraničí. Gratulujem! Stefan Hreha Montreal, Que., 15. nov. 1987 [pageend20]
