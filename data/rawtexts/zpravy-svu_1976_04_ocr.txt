(202) 229-6315 THE CZECHOSLOVAK SOCIETY OF ARTS AND SCIENCES IN AMERICA There are no statistics, only estimates of the number of Czech and Slovak intellectuals abroad. The first Czech refugees from religious persecution by the Hapsburg counter-reformation during the Thirty Years’ War (1618 - 1648) arrived in New York - then New Amsterdam; the most prominent one among them was Augustin Herman, later known as ‘Lord of Bohemia Manor’. During the 18th century Moravian Brethern immigrated and established the Moravian Brethern Church of America, with centers in Bethlehem, Pa., and Winston-Salem, N.C. But while a great many Czech and Slovak emigrants settled in the United States starting in the 1860s, before 1939 it was rare for a university professor, writer, or artist to leave Czechoslovakia for permanent settlement abroad. Then came World War II. The Nazi onslaught precipitated the emigration or escape of some 20,000; among these exiles, at least one-fourth were intellectuals. At the war’s conclusion, some returned to Czechoslovakia. Many, however, remained in the United States, Canada, England, France and other Western countries. A still greater exodus began in 1948 after the February coup in Czechoslovakia. In the decade following that coup, over 60,000 people excaped to the West, it is estimated that about one-tenth of these emigrees, some 6,000, are intellectuals, scholars, and professional people. Most of them found their way to the United States, Canada and Australia, while a few hundred established themselves in Western Europe and ''anous countries in Central and South America, Asia and Africa. In the fifties it became increasingly difficult for Czechs and Slovaks to emigrate from Czechoslovakia either legally or bv illegally cros23 [pageend23]sing the borders, and the influx of Czech and Slovak refugees into the United States was reduced to a trickle. But after the liberalized Dubček regime was crushed by the invasion of the Warsaw powers in August 1968, another large exodus followed, again largely consisting of intellectuals, some of whom were admitted to the United States or Canada, while this time a majority stayed in Western Europe. During the fifties, intellectuals who had managed to leave Czechoslovakia and gain permanent residence in the United States felt increasingly the need of maintaining and further developing Czechoslovak culture, while in Czechoslovakia history was being rewritten as if Orwell’s ‘1984’ had been advanced by thirty years and the writings of past and present Czech and Slovak authors were on the proscribed lists. In 1958, a group of scholars led by the late prof. Vaclav Hlavatý, the mathematician of the University of Indiana, and Dr. Jaroslav Nemec of the National Library of Medicine began to organize these intellectuals throughout the world into a society of arts and sciences. In 1960 the society became incorporated under the laws of the State of New York, as a Not-for-Profit Corporation, assuming its present name: Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences in America, Inc. Its activities, as outlined in its bylaws, consist in supporting and coordinating the educational, scholarly, literary and artistic endeavors of Czech and Slovak intelligentsia abroad, but the concept of the society has broadened into that of an organization open to all scholars, regardless of national background, who are genuinely interested in the advancement of Czechoslovak scholarship. By a ruling of the U.S. Treasury Department in 1962, contributions to the organization are tax deductible. The society is known among Czechs and Slovaks as SVU, an abbreviation of its name in the Czech or Slovak languages. From its inception the society has maintained its nonpolitical character and refused to become an instrument of the cold war. The membership, of course, is opposed to any totalitarian ideology, be it of the right or the left, knowing that culture and freedom are inseparable. PUBLICATIONS The organization has embarked upon an ambitious publishing program. Among its first publications was a monograph on the composer Antonin Dvorak,by the composer Karel B. Jirak, late of Roosevelt University. In 1963, Mouton 8c Co. of The Hague, published for the society the ‘Essays on Czech Literature’ by Rene Wellek of Yale University. Papers delivered at the society’s first two congresses (1962 and 1964) were published by Mouton & Co. under the titles ‘The Czechoslovak Contribution to World Culture’ and ‘Czecho24 [pageend24]Slovakia, Past and Present’ respectively, both edited by the present president of the society, Dr. Miloslav Rechcigl, head of research of the Agency for International Development. In connection with the 300th anniversary of the death of Jan Amos Comenius (1592-1670'1 several English translation of Comenius works and a volume of essays on Comenius (papers delivered at the society’s 1970 congress) were published, partly in cooperation with the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures of the University of Michigan. The same cooperative effort also produced a unique billingual (English and Czech) anthology of Czech Poetry, edited by prof. Alfred French of the University of Adelaide. In 1971 the society published, with the cooperation of Michigan University, a collection of brilliant essays in the Czech and Slovak languages, ‘Studies in Verbal Art’ by prof. Roman Jakobson of Harvard University. Many other publications followed, a bibliographical directory (last issued in 1972, a supplement to which is in preparation), and a number of publications in the Czech language - a novel, poetry, essays, and others. Recently the society has published a monograph on Czechoslovak Military Justice during World War II, in the English language. A collection of essays on Czech and Slovak Music, and a collection of essays on Thomas Garrigue Masaryk (based on papers delivered in 1975 at Harvard University and at the University of California, Los Angeles) Since 1959, the society has been publishing an information bulletin ‘Zprávy SVU’ (News of SVU): since January, 1964 it has been publishing a quarterly for literature, philosophy and the arts, entitled ‘Proměny’ (Metamorphoses). THE CONGRESSES The society held its first nationwide congress in April, 1962» in Washington, D.C.

The central theme of this year’s eighth congress, to be held at Georgetown University, August 12-15, 1976, is ‘The Contribution of Czechs and Slovaks to North America’.
