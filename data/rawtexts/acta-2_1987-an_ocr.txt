On more than one occasion, expectations were voiced in much the same vein as Václav Havel's comments elsewhere in this issue. We feel duty-bound to do everything we can to fulfil such expectations. But no editorial board can ever manage entirely on its own. It needs the suggestions and critical comments of others. And their contributions, above all. In other words, our proviso is a chal- lenge to all those who have anything to say about the issues covered by ACTA- i.e. the problems of our independent literature at home and ab- road - to assist us in this work. Even though our correspondents have so far refrained from adverse or critical remarks, the editors are all too aware of certain obvious short- comings. We have battled valiantly, albeit not al- ways victoriously, with a number of technical dif- ficulties connected with the type-setting of Czech texts abroad. It goes without saying that every new periodical needs time to "settle down" and develop its own distinctive style. ACTA is no exception, even though its aims are strictly circumscribed and has no intention of competing with any other of our literary journals, as we made clear last time. None the less, even these very specific ambitions can make significant de- mands and will take time to achieve. One of the main tasks facing the editors is to bring the discussion of plans for Patočka 's Col- lected Works to a successful conclusion so that work on their publication can start without de- lay. The editors were hoping that exile publis- hing houses would also join in the discussion. Since this has not yet happened, we renew our appeal for their assistance and advice, without which the realisation of this urgent project will be even more difficult. Apart from this , it is ACT A's wish to continue with its flexible approach of publishing different thoughts on the meaning, history and termino- logy of independent literature. This issue brings our readers more contributions along these li- nes. ACTA would also like to give wider cover- age of samizdat books and periodicals, but here too we chiefly depend on the co-operation of ot- hers both at home and abroad. Much the same applies to our retrospective lists of various sa- mizdat book series. In this issue we update the annotated list of the series New Thought Trails , and for the next issue we pian to feature a com- plete list of Petlice Edice (Padlock Books). In conclusion: ACTA faces such an enormous task that it cannot hope to fulfil it unaided. We therefore rely on the assistance of all those who really care about independent culture in Cze- choslovakia. [pageend3]ARTICLES The following seccion is made up of pieces by Czechoslovak aurhors intended for this year's Franken symposium, /zeld on the theme Czech and Slovak books, writers, translators and publishers, at home and abroad. 1970-1987. The contriburions were prepared in a variety of ways. Václav Havel telephoned his remarks informally and the recording of them was then edited. Ludvík Vaculík's comments, written in the form of a lerter, were the basis for the Imaginary Interview. The most comprehensive text was contributed by Milan Simečka; as the author did not give his paper a title we have given it a heading of our own which reflects one of the main ideas of his text. Václav Havel JUST ONE POINT Comments over the telephone When samizdat came into existence in the first half of the seventies, it consisted of typewritten texts which circulated in various ways and only the odd one here and there managed to reach the outside world, where it got printed here and there by some exile journal or other. Invariably this gave rise to heavy police interrogations ab- out how it got out and who sent it. And the exile journals naturally printed an explanation that the text was being published "without the au- thor's knowledge or consent" and that it had got out of the country by chance. People abroad felt the need to provide the authors back home with an alibi in case of any repercussions arising from the publication-of their texts by exile publishers. That was fifteen - or maybe twelve -years ago. Since that time, things have changed, even though the stereotypes created in those days for obvious reasons still survive. I recently conduc- ted a small private opinion poli and discovered that everyone I spoke to about this matter belie- 2 Th e editors ves that it would be more reasonable to alter some of these stereotypes in line with new deve- lopments. What does this mean in practical terms? Exile journals - some to a greater, some to a lesser degree - reprint a whole lot of texts from the home country, but either out of habit or motiva- ted by the stereotyped attitude that it is neces- sary to provide a cover for the authors back home, they do not specify the source of their texts or how they came by them. The point is that nowadays there are already dozens of samizdat journals, which there weren't years ago , and they are journals that have a steady output. Fur- thermore they have their own editorial ambi- tions and a regard for their reputations. It is fre- quently a hard and complicated business for them to obtain contributions from authors , and the subsequent task of editing them is no less complex and time-consuming. Bear in mind that unofficial literature lacks the services of traditio- nal editors, correctors, etc, so writers' standards tend to decline and increase the need for edito- rial work- something which is made all the more difficult by samizdat conditions. To cut a long s tory short, our samizdat journals commission or [pageend4]obtain texts, work on them, publish them. These contributions then come out in various exile pu- blications without any mention of where they have been taken from. When people come to read the exile press they get the impression that we have no samizdat periodicals here at all, only those journals being published in exile. And in those cases where authors from back home are published abroad, it is because they either wrote specifically for emigré publications or because some text of theirs circulating back home some- how found its way abroad and was published there. There is nothing wrong, of course, in texts from back home being reprinted that way-iťs to be welcomed, in fact. The trouble is that the wav it is done is no longer appropriate to the new si- tuation. As I have discovered, all the samizdat journals are interested in making themselves known. Otherwise the optical illusion could well be created that there only exists an exile press and no home-grown periodicals. The point is that exile Journals are tending to take as much as a third or even half of a samizdat periodical wi- thout even mentioning that the latter exists. . Some time ago, for instance, Obrys reprinted a text from the samizdat journal O divadle [The- atre] as its leading article. It happened to be an eye-catching, well-informed analysis of the re- cent state of the National Theatre, which could have only been written by someone in an official post who regularly visited it. Getting hold of the text, persuaďing the author to write it under a pseudonym, not to mention having to edit it. since it was not the greatest piece of writing ever - all this required enormous effort. And then it came out in Obrys without any explanation that it had been taken from the samizdat publication O divadle. The reader is left with the impression that Obrys has some kind of special network of people back home who write leading articles for it, not to mention well-informed analyses. Of course this was not some evil scheme on the part of Obrys to claim the credit for another's work. In fact, in a subsequent issue, it published- as if by way of correction - a paragraph about the ap- pearance of a new Czech journal- O divadle. Such things are commonplace, though. Take the latest issue of Čtení na léto ("Summer rea- ding" , the annual literary issue of Listy maga- zíne, trans). It also includes several articles ta- ken from O divadle without any mention of that journal's existence. Admittedly that section of Čtení na léto is headed "O divadle", but it only looks like the editors' heading for that part of the magazíne. That issue of Čtení na léto also inclu- des an article by me which I gave it permission to publish. Thus it did not appear "without my knowledge", but "with my knowledge", on the sole condition that there be some indication that it was originally written for the samizdat journal O divadle. However, no such indication was oi- ven in Čtení na léto. ~ l'd like to stress again that I do not suspect the editors of exile journals of wanting to take credit for another's work , or of poaching from samiz- dat journals in order to pretend that they have correspondents back home. It is merely a relic of the times when it was a sensitive issue and people were afraid of prejudicing authors in the home country. As a result, maximum care was taken to stress that it was not the authors' fault if their texts found their way abroad. I have not the least 3 [pageend5]intention to indulge in recriminations or accuse anyone of bad faith. The examples I have given are naturally chosen at random , and no persona! reflection was intended. My sole concern is to il- lustrate a situation which should occupy our jo- int attention. The fact is that the time has come to alter surviving stereotypes. I can state on my own responsibility that sa- mizdat journals are worthy of publicity. They ap- pear in limited print runs. Their distribution is fraught with difficulties and every little publicity is important. However, apart from the odd ex- ception , the exile press says nothing about them. The exceptions are truly few and could be coun- ted on the fingers of one hand: a brief item on Paraf and O divadle, an editorial some time ago in Svědectví about just two issues of Vokno and Revolverové revue Jednou nohou, even though Sv ědectví would certainly have no difficulty ob- taining every issue of the above mentioned jour- nals and having them properly reviewed by a specialist. It is to a great extent the fault of people back home who fail to make sure that home-grown journals find their way into the right hands. None the less, the fact is that Revolverová revue Jednou nohou includes large adverts for books published by exi_le publishing houses or for exile joumals. We have yet to see any exile publishing house print an advert for samizdat journals let alone any news of their actual existence. They are quite happy to select from them any items they fancy and gaily reprint them without it oc- curring to them to tel1 their readership somet- hing about the periodicals back home. 4 We can only hope that things will improve sub- stantially with the appearance of ACTA and we look forward to its providing more information of this kind, including regular news about the world of independent/samizdat publishing back home as well as publicity for different periodicals and books. And it is not even necessary to wait until the Documentation Centre receives them , A CT A can take the information from Kritický sborník which has always diligently informed its readers of all publications received by its editors. Obviously nobody is 100 per cent informed ab- out what there is, nor can they hope to be in the present circumstances. Even so it would surely be possible to provide quite a good picture on the basis of the publicity in Kritický sborník and In- foch. To sum up: so far, people who are not in the know must get the impression that, as far as Czech is concerned, there is only the exile press for which some people living in Czechoslovakia also happen to write, and nothing else. Such an impression derives from the fact that there is no regular information about the periodicals publis- hed here at home, not even news about the diffe- rent titles, their main articles, their contributors, and possibly some sort of appraisal. Obviously, no single journal is capable of reviewing everyt- hing, but as things stand almost nothing is being reviewed and nobody seems to be losing any sleep over the fact! And iťs not as if the editors of samizdat jour- nals were anonymous any more, even if the na- mes of the publishers are not usually printed. They each have a particular editorial policy, cer- tain clear ambitions and are proud of their crea- [pageend6]tion when they manage to put together a good is- sue or establish a particular overall concept and keep it coming out with progressively higher le- vel of professionalism. This makes it all the more frustrating when they see that a lot of the texts which they sweated to obtain, edited asbest they could and published in a magazine cobbled to- gether out of nothing, appear in the exile press without the slightest reference to the fact that they were taken from samizdat periodicals or that the latter exist even. Once more, let me stress that we are not touting for praise or tribu- tes to samizdat output. What we need are critical reactions. Let people write and say what they think about it. The main thing is that they should do so. For our part, we too have had to get out of old habits and abandon stereotypes. There was a time when you were virtually asking to go to pri- son if you published a magazíne. In the end. even Obsah , which resisted acknowledging its maga- zíne status longer than any other journal - in spíte of it~ being one of the oldest Czechoslovak samizdat periodicals - finally came round to the view that the situation had changed, that habits of former days were no longer appropriate and that the time had come to admit to being a jour- nal. This is a general trend. All the samizdat jour- nals have an interest in being known. They want people to write about what they publish. They welcome publicity, reviews and criticism. And when their texts are reprinted elsewhere they want the source to be clearly stated. Statements like "reprinted without the author's knowledge ·· are superfluous nowadays. Samizdat journalism is a public business, so what appears in their pa- ges is ipso facto published. Therefore the use of a text published in this way constitutesreprinting something which has already been made public in samizdat form. In normal circumstances, there would be no need to stress all these things. People could go to any news-agents or bookshop, or find out from any library what titles were being published and either take out a subscription for anything they fancied reading or put in a regular order for it. In our situation, though , each samizdat journal or boo k only reaches a restricted and - for the time being-small readership. It is impossible for indi- vidual readers to have an overall idea of everyt- hing that is available. In such circumstances, it is important that people should publicise each ot- her. This is the only way to inform the wider pu- blic about things which the individual has trouble with discovering even in fragmented form. Every reader is not going to read everything. Pe- ople will chaose things that appeal to them and suit their taste and interests. But if they are to have that choice , if they are to have any real no- tion of the whole range of literature in existence, it is necessary to create the basic level of infor- mation for which I so desperately plead. Ob- viously it would still be difficult for the time be- ing for readers to obtain everything they would like to read, but at least they would know what to search for. They would have the basic informa- tion and an awareness of the whole gamut of sa- mizdat literature. What I have said is evidence of a shift in the cultural situation here. Ten years ago there did not exist a single journal. At best, there were 5 [pageend7]some timid and coded experiments. We must have no hesitation in declaring out loud that the evolution that has occurred is something norma!. This point must be made quite clear and unders- cored. In other words, it is necessary to stop creating a sort of aura of semi-illegality around samizdat journalism as if it were something alm- ost conspiratorial, and about which it is better to keep quiet lest anyone get into trouble. The op- posite is the case. The best way to help a samiz- dat journal these days is to make sure people know about it: by writing about it, by treating it as part and parcel of the cultural life of this coun- try. So it looks as if what might seem just a tech- nical matter actually has wider implications. A mutual effort by samizdat and exile publications to publicise each other would constitute further proof that there exists just one indivisible litera- ture , irrespective of whether it is typewritten, cy- clostyled or printed, and whether it is published at home or abroad. Milan Šimečka LITERARY PLURALISM I imagine that exile literature after the first wave of emigration in 1948 viewed its situation in much the same way as the emigrants, ie , as tem- porary and transitional. The home country ad- mittedly looked in a very sorry state but people have a natural tendency to believe in a quick re- covery rather than permanent invalidity. Not ha- ving been there and not having known what it feels like to be an exile, it is impossible for meto guess at what point the realisation became wide- spread that literature just cannot abide inaction or temporary arrangements, that it needs to in- habit a world of <lignity and plurality in order to 6 survive. I don't mean to imply that in those days, at the end of the fifties and in the sixties, all the products of that plurality reached us by any me- ans. I, for one, no doubt laboured under the illu- sion that Svědectví represented the extent of that plurality. The point is that people made the most of what they got hold of. The same applies nowa- days. The situation bere in the wake of 1968 was si- milar. Things were happening which created the impression that the situation could not last, that it was only a passing phase. Even though I was there and went through it all, I am still not sure if Vaculík's samizdat version of Morčata belonged to an earlier era of literature or whether it mar- ked the beginning of a new one. Or did the latter start with the business in Počernice 1 that time? None the less, the realisation was felt for these- cond time that litera ture cannot wait for things to improve, that if it tried to do so it could even pe- rish. It could well be that what happened here was not a question of conscious realisation but actually a strange manifestation of culture's im- manence, rather like some biological process in nature. The fact is that the upshot of not having waited for things to improve is what we have to- day: ie. widespread independent creation here at home , exile magazines and publishers abroad , a whole lot of fine books, the beginnings even of video production, translations-in short, literary pluralism worthy of the name. I also include wi- thin this pluralism those works published offi- cially in Czechoslovakia which have managed to avoid the ideological pit-falls. I refer to litera ture which skilfully side-steps the main ideological se- wer and can actually give some thought to stan- dards. Thank goodness for it! Just think of all the [pageend8]work entailed if every little pot-boiler had to be hand made by alternative publishers. As I myself once pointed out, in the present state of affairs here - one which otherwise goes from bad to worse - the existence of today's plu- ralist Czech and Slovak literature is, in my expe- rience, the most encouraging phenomenon at the present time. I should think it would only be a slight exaggeration to talk in terms of a miracle. But enough _of such rhetoric! We here are all aware of your complaints and criticisms. After all you are no doubt going to be discussing preci- sely how to keep this miracle alive. But don't be tempted to believe us too much when we say we understarÍ'd the problems you have in bringing out books. The fact is that scarcely anyone here has a predse notion of how much it costs to pu- blish a single little book, or what it means to ne- gotiate with printers who have to set boo ks full of weird Czech accents, let alone convince people to buy your book when they have the choice bet- ween buying books or a holiday in the Bahamas. Of course not one of the books I am referring to can be bought in any bookshop here, but you ought to know that even here they enjoy a life of their bwn. And though I personally ,Yitnessed a young woman toss Škvorecký's Engineer of Hu- man Sou/s into the dustbin in panic when faced with an imminent house search (may the good Lord forgive her!) such cases no longer occur here. What is more likely to happen nowadays - and I'm ~lways touched when it does - is that a book I once lent to somebody returns in a really scuffed condition after having passed through the hands and minds of dozens of people. And I actually saw a samizdat edition which had been bound in cloth by its owner, and whose title was embossed in gold on the cover. Boo ks do not di- sappear without trace nowadays. There are two main reasons why we need lite- rary pluralism to continue: one is to preserve a pluralism of language , the other is to maintain a pluralism of human experience - rather than for the sake of any political pluralism or plurality of ideological platforms. The latter are subordinate considerations and changeable. Most people do not need their eyes opening. In fact I would go as far as to say that people in this country know where things are at and have learnt some hard lessons. What I am not so sure of, though, is whether they have the capacity to survive unsca- thed the mutilation of our language which has gone on for decades , whereby it has been sterili- sed, impoverished and downgraded along the lines of Newspeak. This applies particularly to the language of the press, radio and television which can engender profound depression after being consumed for any length of time. There is only one way of resisting the prolonged battering of clichés and the absurd repetition of greetings telegrams, communiqués about state visits, news items about meetings of various official bodies, etc, and that is when people have at least somet- hing to counterbalance it. The existence of lite- rary pluralism plays an irreplaceable role in pre- serving normal Czech and Slovak speech. Many people have told me that what distinguishes the aridity of official pronouncements here from ideas freely expressed is precisely the colour and sound of the language. You only need to read the first three sentences to know that what your are reading is prohibited. It is not the voice of the an- nouncer that tells you you have tuned into the 7 [pageend9]right station, but the feel of the words. This is so- mething that always needs bearing in mind, along with a concern to preserve a plurality of language. Otherwise the risk is that people just change their political spots while keeping their bad habits, such as when they write for exile pu- blications with the same sort of rancour to which we are accustomed from official publications here. The existence of literary pluralism also helps keep alive the variety of human experience. It helps complement that restricted picture of the nation's life provided by "permitted" literature. Officially available fiction seeks to create the im- pression of reflecting the whole range of human experience. Their characters include the good and the bad. They love and they hate, have wor- ries with their children, chase after money and careers - and these days they are riot even requi- red to be over-enthusiastic about building socia- lism. In spite of that, the stories are flawed. The very reality of the world in which they are set is mutilated in many ways. And it is conceivable that the authors of such stories are themselves not even aware of the fact. I can recall such self- deception among authors in the sixties, when ad- vance censorship was gradually relaxing and creating an illusion of freedom. But it was no more than an illusion, because the most tragic of · human stories continued to be considered unsui- table for public consumption. It is possible that today's official writers are falling prey to the same deception. But what they are doing is pan- dering to the "eventlessness" of the present day and doctoring reality from the outset by separa- ting their heroes from their country's cheerless story. Havel even goes so far as to declare that 8 "the onslaught on plurality and 'the story' within the public sphere is not merely an attack on one aspect or field of life but an attack on life as a whole". ( " Příběh a totalita" ["The story-' and to- talitarian power], Svědectví , No.81. p.31). This is arguable because one can cite examples of sto- ries totally divorced from major historical events which are none the less capable of gripping the imagination after many centuries. But that is not the case of our official literature. In our situa- tion, the reason why "private tempests" are di- vorced from history is not because writers have sufficient self-confidence and independence not to have to worry about them, but because in their pathetic situation they are not even permitted to concern themselves with them. There can never be too great a variety of hu- man stories. We vitally need a rich choice of them if we are to piece together a true picture of the nation's life to serve as a basis for a pluralist future. Even though I should think I have access to a sufficiently broad choice of reading matter, I am pleasantly surprised again and again to dis- cover - such as in Willy Lorenz's book2 - that in the geographical region which is my home , so- meone could have an intellectual experience so very different from any I have known of pre- viously. However, I am very wary of talking about books as if they could be the forerunner of a plu- ralist future , because their power is so very li- mited compared with the totalitarian influence of state television , radio. etc. None the less I re- gard today's literary pluralism to be a source of hope since, in my view, it is not a relic of what once was, but the beginnings of what is yet to come. [pageend10]Naturally we each have our private thoughts about the circumstances in which it will be possi- ble to put an end to the present state of affairs and bring our pluralist literature home , lock, stock and barrel. At the same time we are kee- . ping an eagle eye on the events in the Soviet Union , fully aware that, whether we like it or not, we have been a Soviet appendage for the past forty years. We conclude realistically that nothing in particular is going on here, even if it is gradually beginning to Iook as if the possession of books other than state-approved ones might no longer be regarded as a crime. lt does not amount to much, but it is quite a lot if you com- pare it with the way things have been. The régi- me's Jack of self-confidence and its habit of copy- ing others are so entrenched that it is possible that minor improvements will even come about willy-nilly. Even a bad copy will make things · Iook better round here and even hesitant copies of reforms could pave the way to real reforms. Nevertheless, a lot of other things would need to happen in the meantime, wouldn·t they? But even such a cautiously optimistic vision is still light-years away from the time when it will be possible to end the present divisions within our litera ture. There is no trusting even the most acquiescent of states so long as it maintains a mo- nopoly of all the means of production necessary for the norma! existence of culture. A more pro- mising approach in my view is to go on develo- ping the present forms of literary pluralism come what may. If, after all, things do get a bit better and pluralist literature acquires greater room for manoeuvre here at home, it will represent a giant step forward. This implies, for the time being, that we will have to look after what we have. while acknowledging, albeit modestly and scep- tically, that it is not entirely a negligible achieve- ment. Because when I think about it, with all we have we could virtually hold our own Frankfurt Book Fair in miniature. Whoever would have believed i t not so very long ago? ! August 1987 (I) On 1st Novem ber 1972. a group of young amateurs per- formed a new play by Václav Havel. a version of The Beg- gars' Opera, in a public hall at Horní Počernice on the Pra- gue outskirts. This alternative cultural event was used by the police as a pretext for a widespread campaign of harass- ment against the author. the producer, the actors and even some of the audience. (2) Willy Lorenz, Monolog iiber Bohmen. Munich. 1964. The book was published in Czech by an exile publishing house in 1987 AN IMAGINARY INTERVIEW WITH L.V. To my knowledge, Ludvík Vaculík is not one of those people who give interviews readily. Nor, unfortunately, is he someone who writes long letters. Even so , he occasionally does get around to writing a couple of pages which are not so much a letter, more a ready-made interview, with just the questions missing. So we made some up, partly with his agreement. The que- stions are imaginary, the answers authentic, though slightly abridged and re-arranged in pla- ces. Responsibility for the result rests entirely with the editors of ACT A. 9 [pageend11]A: You're bound to read at least some exile jour- nals. What is your opinion of them? V: We get them so irregularly that any assess- ment I might make of them would have to be ba- sed on fairly random impressions-I'm referring, of course, to journals other than Svědectví and Listy. For instance, I've often found Reportér rather uncongenial and I'm not alone in this re- spect. On the other hand, in some ways it is uni- que - such as in the way it provides news about the situation of our exiled compatriots, or in its features and interviews. But it would not be a good idea for it to eliminate the gutter-press tone of some of the minor contributions and letters; after all, they too provide a picture of the rea- dership; the only way for Reportér to counter it is by setting a good example in its own articles. One journal I rate very highly at the present time is Proměny, but I feel I haven't known it for long enough. The last issue for instance - on Charter 77 and the national character - should be read by as many youngsters as possible. Inge- neral, there is only one answer to the question about whether the books and journals published by the exile community have helped raise the le- vel of information about our modem history, and that is: Yes, very much so! A: Thaťs nice to hear. But tel! us more. V: Iťs clear that the exile journals have to fight to stay afloat and have to rely on the assistance of the Charta 77 Foundation. It strikes me - and take this for what iťs worth because I really have no idea - that the different journals could per- haps make themselves a bit more distinctive - go 10 for a particular "image" and then find a financial backer in sympathy with that image. How about each journal making a deliberate and patient eff- ort in their particular country to find a sponsor in the form of a cultural body- which would entitle it, of course, to have a say about output and stan- dards? These days, even the proverbial Slušo- vice Co-operative Farm sponsors its own maga- zíne - and even books (though iťs true there has to be some mention of cows in them ... ) . A: You talk about creating an "image". What do you have in mind exactly? V: I mean that people here would increasingly like to be able to distinguish journals for the emigré readership from those intended for our consumption. In this respect, judging from its most recent issues, Reportér would seem to be a forerunner. I get the impression that it is geared chiefly to the emigré market and we here find out mostly about the exile community from its pa- ges. There are other journals which would do well to follow the example of Listy and Svědectví and publish material intended for us with a view to compensating for what we miss here. Pro- měny does this. There was a time when I would get hold of Studie more frequently , but nowa- days part of that magazíne tends to be filled with news items from Infoch and VONS statements. Iťs very useful, of course, but it does make for rather stodgy reading. · To comeback to Reportér for a moment. It oc- curs to me I might be doing it an injustice through lack of knowledge. The fact is I've just received its last issue ... and iťs obviously the li- veliest of the j ournals we read here. Whereas the [pageend12]rest basically cover politics and cul ture in varying proportions, Reportér also gives coverage to news, life-stories and events. I notice it has got correspondents and readers all over the world, so it stands a good chance of becoming the me- dium of communication within the exile commu- nity. A: We'd like to turn to another question of interest to people over here, namely, the problem of the so-called "generation gap" .. . V: Over here or over there? If iťs here you mean, then the most serious factor I can see is the lack of a real exchange of ideas between the generations. As a result, I get the feeling that there is no real scope for us to discover what the younger generation are prepared to accept from us, and what they reject. And this is an area where precisely the exile community can be of great assistance to us, in terms of publishing acti- vity. Incidertally, while we are talking about this, I've just received a copy of the magazíne Host, a great thick volume, nicely printed - probably photocopied - that is put together by youngsters in Brno. The most striking impression I have is that it tells one far less about what young people are creating than what they go for, namely: La- dislav Klíma, Havel's la test play, a text by Uhde, etc; etc. Can it be that youngsters in Brno are not up to producing their own literary magazíne? A: Yoiťve mentioned Brno. How about Slovak literarure? V: Thaťs one of the things that has concerned me for a long time: I mean the fact that nobody pays any attention to it. But its not the sort of thing I am able to write about. There are some fine books around, and first rate authors: Hu- dec, Ferko Jr, Johanides, Sloboda, Puškáš. I've read quite a few of them over the past few years, but I don't seem to be able to interest others in them. I really think that Slovak consciousness could help to enrich Czech thinking. And whe- reas Slovak literary criticism - such as Romboid and Slovenské pohl ady - takes notice of Czech literature, Czech literary criticism is totally obli- vious to the Slovak output. (Of course, not even Slovak criticism is informed of Czech "inédit" li- terature !) However, Slov ak writing about life tends to be much more raw and harsh, but it lacks any awareness of the political implications. It also lacks any transcendental element: "iťs only human nature, after all!" And I have the feeling that when it indulges in unadorned des- cription and makes a virtue of realism or even naturalism , litera ture actually starts to lose its way and deny its mission. Iťs well on the road to becoming dehumanised. It displays a kind of Páralesque cynicism. Take Sloboda's Uršul'a or Hudec's Čierne diery. There's an ease and raci- ness about their writing, but it lacks literary effort. So let this be a lesson for you, too! Keep an eye on Slovak writing! Someone should volunteer to lend special attention to it, or otherwise you should get someone to take on the job. Iťs worth the trouble! On the one hand the Slovaks swank about being more truthful or having a freer hand with the truth, while on the other hand they pro- fane it criminally by their lack of awareness, att- ention and comment. They're spoiling litera- ture! 11 [pageend13]Wouldn't it be a good idea if various institu- tions got together to found some prizes for the study of Slovak literature and its relationship to Czech writing, etc? Give someone a grant to do it. Oh, how should I put it, for heaven's sake?! I just can't seem to find the words to explain it. I see that I'll just have to write afeuilleton about it to show that Czech literature and Czech social awarenes~ in general is stupidly missing out on a whole area of knowledge and even some real gems when it does not pay at least the same sort of attention to Slovak literature that the Slovaks do to our own. The fact is that they have a debt of responsibility to be even more aware of it than the contrary. JANPATOCKA'S COLLECTED WORKS A group of specialists working dosely with the Vienna-based Patočka Archive on the editing of rhe philosopher·s lirerary legacy sent the CSDC for discussion its own scheme for rhe plannecl publication of Patočka's Coilected Works. We are publishing rhe group's proposals here in full. JAN PATOČKA ' S COLLECTED WORKS SCHEME II Foreword Nowadays it is quite obvious that Patočka ' s work will continue to be a fundamental part of the Czech spiritual heritage and exert a major influ- ence on Czech culture. This point was made elo- quently in ACTA 1/87 in the introduction to the first proposal for the Collected Works. In Cze- choslovakia, work is now almost complete on the preparatory, samizdat version, and the eventual editors will soon have virtually all the material available, some of it already processed. The first proposal for the Collected Works strove to make maximum use of the texts in their existing state, whether published in samizdat or in earlier prin- 12 The eclirors ted editions. While such an approach would ad- mittedly save a certain amount of work. it would render impossible both the standard textual edi- ting which is so urgently required and a re-arran- gement of the sections, which is vítal. since the samizdat edition was improvised in several re- spects and its arrangement was frequently dic- tatecl by technical considerations or marginal concerns. We trust that the CSDC will be capable of en- suriQg the sort of conditions for the publication of these works that enable them to be conceived in a manner befitting their importance and the fact that they will become the definitive. critical edition of the collected works, which is likely to remain for the foreseeable future the only com- prehensive source for the study not just of Pa- točka 's philosophy, but also of many aspects of [pageend14]Czech history and thought. We therefore submit a new drah structure for Patočka's Collected Works, divided into 15 volumes, together with a detailed -description of their contents. An ex- planation of the principles which guided us and notes on individua! volumes can be found in the Comm~ntary. Jan Patočka, Collected works Propo~ed structure 1.

Apart from the actual con- cept of the subject groups, which we will com- ment on in connection with the individua! volu- mes , there is the question of their interna! arran- gement. We have gone for what is essentially a chronological arrangement (in the case of Vo- l ume 12- The history of philosophy- the chrono- 24 logy is based on subject matter rather than the actual date of a given study). In certain cases, it seemed to us useful to depart from chronological order very slightly in order to achieve a clearer structure of some of the volumes in terms of theme or the relative importance of certain artic- les. However, we would be reluctant to disturb the unified chronological construction by crea- ting "subject nests" of contributions which would be very disparate or remote from each ot- her in time. In our view, original texts should form the back-bone of the Works. Only these texts were authorised and the language in which the author wrote them no doubt influenced their overall style also. We suggest that translations of them should be put all together in the last vol ume. Thus, apart from separating them visibly from P a točka 's originals, such an approach will gain time for the translations to be worked on without this holding up the entire publication. In the in- dividua! volumes we have included either for- eign-language texts regardless of whether they were subsequently translated into other langua- ges under the author's supervision; or we have included the author's Czech version where this exists and left out the authorised foreign- language version , unless the text of them was fundamentally re-worked. THE INDIVIDUAL VOLUMES PART ONE (volumes 1-7) Volumes l & 2: Spiritual Welfare In the section under this title , we include- partly in accordance with the samizdat edition - those of the author's works relating to the situation of [pageend26]people in the world and in history: they range from the moral and religious problems of the in- dividua!, to the relationship to contemporary hi- storical and political events, and general consi- derations about the philosophy of history. The title of this section is a Czech translation of the Platonic term EPIMELEIA TÉS PSYCHÉS on which Patočka centred his interpretation of the problem. The topics covered by this term form. in a sense, the pivot of Patočka ' s life-long stri- vings and rightly occupy the pride of place in the entire collection. Besides, this section, taken as a whole, may serve as a convenient introduction to specialised study of the other volumes. The interna! structure is essentially chronolo- gical, though the dating of some of the manus- cript studies is only approximate. In contrast to the samizdat edition, Spiritual Welfare also in- cludes all the texts which belong in this section and were published originally in the Art and Plú- losophy collection (see below). However. we have excluded texts which would normallv be- long hefe under the general heading, but could also be regarded as "Czech studies". These have been assigned their own special volume - No.3. Volume 3: Masaryk. Czech thought and hisrory The theme of this collection is dosely related to that of the previous two volumes and includes those of the author's writings devoted to que- stions of Czech history and philosophy. Volumes 4, 5 & 6: Phenomenology The author's contributions to phenomenological philosophy. We think it inappropriate to retain the samizdat division into "the natural world" and "pure phenomenology" - a distinction which has been questioned on more than one occasion and was dictated chiefly by external circumstan- ces. The context and evolution of the author's philosophising will be best conveyed by a simple chronological ordering of the texts. This will also enable the insertion between two volumes of stu- d i es and articles (Vols. 4 & 6) of a separate Vo- lume 5 made up of phenomenological lectures from the brief period at the end of the nineteen- sixties, when the author was working at the Fa- culty of Letters of Charles University. Volume 7: Art and philosophy The only difference between this volume and the four-volume collection already published under this title is that it only includes texts which are di- rectly connected with art. The point is, as men- tioned in the editorial note , that the original col- lection was conceived as a representative selec- tion of reading, Jong before the idea of the Works crystallised. We accordingly reassigned those pieces that were only loosely connected with art to appropriate volumes elsewhere. We therefore consider the retention of one specific volume on the theme of art as justified on grounds of subject-matter and reader inthest. We have placed the texts in strict chronologi- cal order, avoiding narrower thematic divisions, since their usefulness for the reader would be ne- gligible and they would adversely aťfect the over- all structure of the Works. PARTTWO (vols. 8-13) This is devoted to writings on the history of phi- losophy. In view of the amount of material, Lec- tures on ancient philosophy (Vols. 8 and 9) are divided into two volumes, whereby we also seek 25 [pageend27]to reflect the two different periods of the au- thor's teaching activity at Charles University. Si- milarly, the studies relating to Comenius, which come from the author's years of teaching activity at the Pedagogical Institute of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences,-are divided into two volu- mes (10 & 11) because of their size. Volume 12: The history of philosophy This encompasses occasional studies on various topics related to the history of philosophy, and which are not covered by earlier volumes. Ex- ceptionally, this collection is not arranged accor- ding to the texťs date of origin, but follows a the- matic chronology which seemed to make greater sense from the reader's point of view. Volume 13: Miscellanea This includes brief texts not included for reasons of subject and form in earlier volumes. The over- all amount of material justifies issuing them as a separate volume. APPENDIX (Vols. 14- 15) Volume 14. Correspondence This is not yet sufficiently edited, so it is impossi- ble to specify its length precisely. However, one may assume a single volume of standard length. Vol ume 15. Footnotes, translations, bibliogra- phies, indexes, etc. We are leaving the actual contents of this vol ume open for the time being, pending a final decision on the question of translations of the author's foreign-language studies, and in case any so far unidentified writing of the author should come to light in the mean time. 26 A CTA's editors submitted the second scheme for Patočka 's Collected Works to Jiří Němec who sent us the following brief comments. We hope to conclude the discussion on the publication of the Collected Works in our next issue. COMMENTS ON SCHEME II FOR PATOČKA ' S COLLECTED WORKS One cannot but welcome the comprehensive scheme for Jan Patočka 's Collected Works sub- mitted by the group collaborating with the Pa- točka Archive in Vienna. The group·s attempt to respect nuances of subject-matter within a strictly chronological framework certainly has much to be said for it. Essentially, I only have two objections: 1. According to the proposed scheme, indivi- dua! volumes would contain, in chronological or- der, drafts, semi-elaborated texts and often final versions of studies, alongside fragments. I would recommend that the contents of the individua! volumes be arranged or edited in such a way as to assign the fragments or draft versions to a sepa- rate section at the end of the volume. 2. Concerning the texts which Patočka wrote in languages other than Czech, I would recom- mend that in this "definitive" Czech edition, Czech translations replace the foreign-language originals in the appropriate places. These origi- nals would then be re-assigned either to a spe- cial section at the end of each volume (and prin- ted in a smaller type-face) or to the final volume of the Collected Works. There are many reasons for such an approach which I do not intend to de- tail here. [pageend28]The form in which the scheme has been sub- mitted looks to me like a "copious heap ·· of some of the most valuable materials for informed rese- archers seeking texts for their own editions eit- her in Czech or other languages. From the rea- der's point of view, however, this proposal for the publication of the Collected Works seems overly demanding or, dare I say it: unmerciful. I accept the group's arguments in support of their proposals but I feel they are more appro- priate to the practice adopted hitherto for samiz- dat editions of Patočka. They constitute a severe impediment for readers of a book edition. parti- cularly where they are not philosophical experts, Comeniologists, or others who would be looking in such a collection for their own "favourites" and w~rnld obviously have no difficulty in finding them m a clearly chronological arrangement. However, I rather tend to see the main readers of the Collected Works as being Czech intellectu- als with broad cultural interests or Czech stu- dents engaged in this particular spiritual field of study. For such readers, my own proposals, as map ped out in the last issue of A CT A, would also seem to have their merits. Jiří Němec TERMINOLOGY IN INDEPENDENT LITERATURE ft would be playing with words if a disrnssion of the terminological aspects of so-called ··fndepen- dent" caltural activities, particularly lirerature, made no attempt to explain or analyse the mea- ning and implications of the matter in quesrion. Without such an effort, even the most apposite of terms could easily remain just an empry she!l; equally empty and fruitless could be auempts to burden the epithets "independent", "parallel", "unofficial", "second" - or any others used to describe culture or literature - with excessively complex ar philosophical meanings. ft is ob- vious, for instance, that no literature any H·here in the world -including Czech and Slovak lirerawre -can be independent,strictly speaking. One good reason is because it is not created outside of time and space. However, in that respect nothing in the world is "independent" and strictly speaking the word independent is meaningless and redundant. That does not stop us from using it, though, and we are more or less in agreement that it describes a certain compulsive drive that is characteristic of humanity. ln this connection it would not be inap- propriate to recall a few lines from Ivan Kadle- čík 's samizdat collection Rhapsodies and Minia- tures. In his very first text, that remarkable author writes: "But if human beings are not to lose their proof of identity or their distinctively human birth-mark and end up no longer identifiably or distinctively human, they have to have their own good deeds and words. ft is inconceivable that they should lack them - despite the derision of time which endlessly throws al! their ambitions, resolve and promises awry". 27 [pageend29]A similar note is sounded by more than one of the replies to the enquiry carried out recently by H. Gordon Skilling on theto pic "Independent so- ciety in Eastern Europe - samizdat and the se- cond culture". We are publishing abridged ver- sions of some of these replies on the following pa- ges, along with quotations from others. The Editors Eva Kantůrková DEMOCRACY AND INDEPENDENT COMMUNITIES From the replay to Gordon Skilling's questionnaire When discussing "independent communities" or activities, it is useful to determine what they are independent of, what they have detached them- selves from, and what are tbe implications of their independence. The political, economic and ideological monopoly that exists in our country creates an artificial reality wbicb encases our so- ciety. This artificiality constitutes the basis of its power. The original aim of creating a monolitbic "communist civilisation" ie. something unnatur- ally one-sided, could well have seemed magnifi- cent at tbe outset. But those of us who bave to live bere and breathe the local air not only can perceive the source of tbis unnatural stencb; we can also actually sense its falseness witb all our faculties. Tbe frenzied political somersaults ex- ecuted bere render every official statement ab- . out society meaningless; there is no reality wbicb corresponds to tbe phrases that are bandied ab- out all over tbe place. Even the word socialism has become dead letter in official moutbs. It has 28 nothing to do with what they are talking about and for wbicb society is being "educated" (as the bureaucrats pompously declare). It has quite simply to do with staying in power, full stop. Tbe creation and preservation of absolute power, like the shameless state domination of everyt- bing and tbe consequent artificiality of society's operation, vary in intensity from one country of tbe eastern bloc to another, depending on the ex- tent to wbicb reality manages to resist or under- mine the implementation of the lifeless ideologi- cal canon. ( ... ) In our country, tbe monopoly of power is so imbecilic that it effectively destroys society's na- tural tendency to structure itself. In fact it de- stroys it to such a degree that within the resultant vacuum it is able to gobble up all human values, thereby preventing them from being used to belp create a system of values. They are then superse- ded by pseudo-values in all areas of life. Looked at from this angle , tberefore ... inde- pendent activities" may be seen as a blue-print for natural social structures and value scales. They migbt also be regarded as a first step in tbeir direction , or even their actual creation. It is social self-defence: a last line of defence against terminal decline. The writer banned from being published by state-run publishing houses who decides to "publish" his works himself in typew- ritten form, the actress who puts on theatrical performances for her friends in her own home , artists who hold exhibitions in the courtyards of old houses, may well all be persecuted by the ré- gime but they do not suffer the consequences of the vacuum we refer to. Similarly, those type-co- pied unofficial journals which have the spiritual [pageend30]stami11:1 to reflect our situation regularly are an embryonic structure within which values can be differentiated and establish themselves and the- reby promote a cultural awareness. This is why the barrier between the so-called second culture - artistic or academic works published in samiz- dat or in exile - and works of excellence produ- ced within the officially dominated sphere is not impermeable. The power of spirituality raises everything of quality to the same common fac- tor: culture. Thus authors and their readers. ac- tors and their audience , creators and consumers form a single cultural environment, defying the official vacuum. The value criteria are being established objectively as much as possible: the idea prevails that not everything created unoffi- cially - "independently" - is ipso facto the ge- nuine article. Though I have chosen examples from culture. the vital desire for naturalness also penetrates the rest of society. Charter 77, for instance. has. in the course of its ten years' activity, established an identifiable social platform to which people may subscribe, but are not obliged to. one which , nevertheless, has become one of the country's valid structures and a foil to the pre- sent administration of national life. ( ... ) In this way, all unofficial activities penetrate and imbue the rest of society and ensure that they do not divorce themselves from it. They re- spect what is positive in it while seeking to share their own positive contribution to it as widely as possible. There is nothing exceptional about cer- tain writers publishing their boo ks both officially and under the Petlice imprint, and the fact that Petlice Books are only too happy to receive th~ir unpublished manuscripts. By the same token , Petlice's authors would willingly have their works published by official publishing houses, if the latter were to offer them the opportunity un- conditionally. And as far as the Charter is con- cerned, there is no reason in theory why even a government minister should not be the author of one of its documents , providing the text was truthfuL The point I am trying to make is that alt- hough independent activities are prosecuted, their organisers harassed and even persecuted in various ways , they do not vegetate on the fringes of an inimical system - thanks to their determi- nation and the available opportunities. The ré- gime is hostile to them, but the régime is not the whole of society. And let us hope that the natio- nal community is coming round to the idea that it is not doomed only to hopelessness and life on its knees. ( ... ) In my view, the purpose (and goal) of ''inde- pendent communities" lies in the very fact of their being. It generates a dynamism other than linear "progress". Living one's own life, sticking to one's principles and preserving one's identity are all , in themselves, quite ambitious aims - both in the immediate and the long term - in a vacuous society. They involve confronting non- meaning with meaning, destruction with crea- tion , emptiness with substance. The very exi- stence of such independent activities and the na- ture of their existence serve to push back the frontiers of what is banned and indictable, de- spite the resistance of the régime. Five years ago people used to go to prison for copying out books. Nowadays far more books are copied out in many more ·'workshops'' and the level of pro- secutions is by no means equivalent. The same 29 [pageend31]applies to the publication of journals or the work of VONS. Even in this connection it is possible to talk in terms of goals: namely, extending the scope and opportunity for independent activity. However, it must be realised that these goals cannot be attained otherwise than through this work, nor can they be postponed. There is no way one can talk in terms of preparing to occupy "positions". The paradoxical goal of Charter 77 is to become extinct. Unofficial journals do not "object" to official publications that are properly printed in enormous numbers. For one thing, almost no one reads them, and for another thing they also serve to create a certain picture of rea- lity. The only regrettable factor is that so much needlessly printed paper should be produced for the pul per. When I consider the ends, I would say rather that the search for new forms of self- expression, new solutions for various problems and situations, as well as the dialogue between different opinions and, of course, academic and artistic creation of different kinds help achieve and preserve a certain level of national culture; and that is something that is difficult to describe as a "goal". Rather it is the purpose of being a nation. I look on independent communities and activi- ties as a dynamic process of seeking, one which 30 displays a healthy tendency to poke its way into every nook and cranny in its effort to see to what extent the régime is capable of protecting its va- cuum. Meanwhile it is quite possible that through some absurd global political turmoil they will arrest the lot of us and some of us will even be killed; I can just as easily imagine some clumsy oaf dropping the vacuum pump and brea- king it. Either occurrence would affect indepen- dent activities only indirectly: the only effect would beto restrict or widen their influence. But the moment they sought to govern in any shape or form they would stand to lose their indepen- dence. That must remain taboo. Their indepen- dence is something that is divorced from the world of·manipulation and rule. It would be equally absurd to imagine that someone else could come on a white stallion ( or war-horse for that matter) and establish freedom and a demo- cratic order here. Yearning for freedom is more of an undying hope than a goal. I would sumit up as follows: despite all our fear of persecution and imprisonment, we ourselves are creating scope for freedom and democracy by the mere fact of being what we are. There is nothing anyone can give us. And it is probably from this awareness and realisation that the independent activities derive their confidence. Prague , Apríl 1986 [pageend32]SAMIZDAT PERIODICALS REPORT ON OBSAH If one included those periodicals that appear ir- regularly or which fizzle out after their first issue, it would be possible to talk of dozens of Czech sa- mizdat journals. In reality, there are only a handful of truly reputable journals appearing re- gularly including Kritický sborník, Obsah. Vok- no, Střední Evropa, Revolverová Revue. Jednou nohou, Pražské komunikace, Informace o církvi, Informace o Chartě. I should think , though, that the most sought after of these is Ob- sah , a magazine whose authors belonged to the literary élite of the sixties but have been banned from publishing since 1968. Its first issue appeared in 1980 or thereabouts. Since then it has been appearing once every month except during the summer holiday pe- riod. Until quite recently, the way that each issue was put together was by the individua! members of a permanent group of writers bringing their contribution in an appropriate number of copies, after which the various articles, essays. stories or poem s would be compiled in an-agreed order. There was no editing of texts. Each of the au- thors would vouch for themselves or for a „guest contributor" on those occasions when they brought someone else's text in place of their own. The only duty which the members of the '·editorial board" had was to write one contribu- tion per month. The rules were simple dueto the constraints of time , secret police surveillance and the character of the authors who are not r,1r- ticularly practical individuals, having an innate aversion to organisational activity. Over the re- cent period, though , it looks as if Obsah has changed its style. It now has a uniform layout. There are now regular "columns" and a whole lot of new contributors, some of whom only in- itial their pieces. The main circle of contributors does not have a fixed number of members, but roughly spea- king it includes the following writers and genres: Zdeněk Urbánek (prose and translations) , Ivan Klíma (prose and essays) , Petr Kabeš (poetry), Karel Pecka (prose), Eda Kriseová (prose) , Jan Trefulka (prose and journalism), Milan Uhde (drama, essays and literary criticism) , Milan Jungmann (literary criticism) , Sergej Machonin (prose plus theatrical and literary criticism), Milan Šimečka (journalism and political com- ment) , Iva Kotrlá (prose , poetry and literary cri- ticism) , Zdeněk Rotrekl (poetry) , Lenka Pro- cházková (prose and interviews), Miroslav Červenka (poetry, literary theory and criticism) , Václav Havel (drama and essays) , Ludvík Vacu- lík (prose and "feuilletons") and Miroslav Kusý (philosophy and journalism). These will no doubt be familiar names to those whose memory stretches back to the sixties and who followed the literary goings on of those times. 31 [pageend33]That is about all one can say in a brief news item. Obsah is undoubtedly the most important of the samizdat journals and in view of its high li- terary and intellectual level, it is bound to be the subject of many future analyses. It bears much of the credit for the fact that today's Czech unoffi- cial literature now represents a powerful current of independent thought and creation. An unsigned article from the Slovak samizdat journal K whose subtitle derives from the month of the year, hence A PR. 1987, April 1987, pp.26-27. O DIV ADLE: FIRST IMPRESSIONS O divadle (About the Theatre) , I, July 1986; II. February 1987. Samizdat, 244 and 450 pp. A4 Imagine this reviewer sitting on an imaginary in- ternational "Board for Dramatic and Theatre Arts" which was to assess the value of an equally imaginary, new journal called About the The- atre. Imagine also that the nature of this journal was something like this: It has a section on specu- lative questions (say, a scholar's evaluation of the nature of a 'national theatre' or a theatre cri- tic's essay on the pitfalls of acting). Another sec- tion, entitled playfully " Whaťs what on the stage", consists of various comments by drama- tists , critics and other 'theatre people' on aspects of the contemporary theatre scene in a given place (London? New York? Prague?). A third section is dedicated to a new dramatist or a new play; another to a certain recent production of a 'classical' text raising issues of cultural history; then comes a feuilleton section analysing a con- temporary dramatisťs oeuvre and another called '"Connections, Portraits, Reminders" . in which 32 an eminent actor or actress (say, Peggy Ash- croft) muses about life in the theatre, contempo- rary playwrights (say Harold Pinter and Tom Stoppard) discuss each other"s plays, and scho- lars analyse particular aspects of the theatre. These sections are followed by one or two translations of topical essays by foreign writers (say, Michel Foucault), and a report about the contemporary theatre scene of a particular coun- try (say, the Soviet Union). Finallywe find a for- midable section of bibliographical information related to the topics discussed in the journal, plus lists of dates of stage performances under a given director, television and radio broadcasts of a particular writer' s works, in other words. mate- rial for a theatre archive. After this Hrabalesque enumeration, in which I have tried to provide the reader with a hasty overview of this imaginary new journal. I must pronounce my vote to be cast on the imaginary "Board": Without hesitation I would welcome and express support for a new journal of this sort and applaud its truly Herculean effort to --cover the field" , as my imaginary colleagues on the "Board" would want me to put it. Now, howe- ver, it is time to put my cards on the table and ad- mit that - alas - there exists no journal of this kind on the British, French, American, German rriarkets, nor- thank goodness - am I a member of any such "Board". Is this description then a pure invention of wishful thinking? Not at all. Since 1986 there has existed a journal that inclu- des all the names mentioned. You only need to change some names in my previous remarks: "Pinter and Stoppard" to "Havel and Uhde", "Peggy Ashcroft" to "Vlasta Chramostová··, and [pageend34]visualise names eminent in Czech culture ( though not appearing in official publications) like Zdeněk Urbánek, Sergej Machonin, Karel Kraus , Otomar Krejča , František Pavlíček and many others. And so we have About the Theatre (O di- vadle) , appearing in Prague as a bi-annual samiz- dat publication, and - in the mind of this revie- wer - able to compete with any international pu- blication of this kind. This, it must be stressed. is significant indeed, because we are dealing with a theatre scene in which the nation's best drama- tists have not seen the light of the stage for close to two decades , where eminent actors have been silenced or have gone abroad, where the interna- tional theatre repertory is carefully selected by the authorities, while the rest disappears in the recesses of submerged culture which Milan Ši- mečka aptly calls the "black ho les" of history. Two numbers of About the Theatre have ap- peared to date. The first is 244, the second -1-50 pages long .. This length may surprise readers who are used to much slimmer journals. Three remarks are to be made about this length. First. it proves once again the intense intellectual and artistic movement that is going on outside the bounds of official cul ture (indeed, hopeful spirits may see it as an extension which, particularly in the theatre, shows signs of the possibility of some kind of integration - though this is a complex to- pic which is best avoided here). Secondly, the journal should perhaps be looked upon as a bi- annual year-book, and as such have claim to a greater length. Thirdly, if a pragmatic comment is permitted, if some of the contributions were judiciously pruned, a possible pian for a transla- tion into English ( or another language) might have more of a chance , because printers here would seem rather less patient than the devoted and admirable copiers of typewritten manus- cripts. The international calibre of About the Theatre is apparent. It avoids narrow professionalism, brings together writers, actors and directors , ex- plores past perspectives but constantly pays sharp attention to the present, permits scholars- hip and imagination to complement each other, in other words, summons al! it takes to make good theatre and think about it in a useful and creative way. As such, About the Theatre could compete with The British Theatre Journal in London , The Performing Arts Journal in New York or Modem Drama in Toronto , to name just a few. Of course, it lacks one feature important in the theatre: visual impact. It naturally has no illustrations. But here again , and ironically enough, its illustrations could be provided by the international theatre scene: the Royal Shake- speare Company for Václav Haveťs latest play Temptation (which is discussed in the second is- sue), Geneva's Théatre au bout du fil for Milan Uhde's A Blue Angel, Theater heute, the emi- nent German theatre journal, for one of Otomar Krejča ' s productions when he still directed at Prague's theatres; and the archives of Austrian Television for a picture of the actress Vlasta Chramostová. The editors and contributors of this remarka- ble publication (for it is a "publication" even in its present form , and will enter the annals of the- atre history) are to be congratulated not only on the high quality of their journal but also for ha- . 33 [pageend35]ving shown that Czech theatre culture, though much of it is today denied official standing, is very much alive Marketa Goetz-Stankiewicz Annotated contents of Nos.1 & 2 of the journal O divadle Page numbers are given in the left margin.

It is the latest samizdat periodical to appear in Slo- vakia and serves to refute the frequent assertion that Slovakia has adapted better to "existing so- cialism", or that it has somehow come to terms with normalised thinking and state-run culture. This journal is proof that the younger generation in Slovakia has not given up its striving to think freely. Nor hasit succumbed to the flood of cli- ches and half-truths given out by official propag- anda. In the first issue, the editors declare their chief inspiration to be Dominik Tatarka, the Slovak writer silenced for the past twenty years. In their eyes, Tatarka is " ... the greatest figure of con- temporary Slovak literature and an eminent re- presentative of Slovak society". They publish his [pageend38]scathing commentary Navrávačky (Cajoleries), shortly to be issued by Index publishers in West Germany. The journal also recalls the case of the writer Hana Ponická who , in 1977, made a force- ful defence of persecuted Slovak writers. The editors quote that most powerful passage in Lu- kavica Notebooks , where the writer recalls how the leaders of the Slovak Writers' Union faced her with an ultimatum: if she refused to back down. not only she, but also her relations would suffer the consequences. In publishing a review of Leopold Lahola's fiction , the journal repays an acknowledged debt to this representative of Slovak existentialism. The issue also includes an interesting analysis of two new Slovak periodi- cals reviewed in the first and second issues. J\llladé rozlety (Young flights) is the title of a new weekly published by the official U nion of Slovak Youth. while Dotyky (Contacts) is a supplement to the literary review Romboid and is devoted to younger authors. These journals have one main thing in common: they both ape the existing adult publications and differ from them solely in the writers' ages. One sentence in particular caught my eye in is- sue No.2. Writing about the persecuted Czech Jaz:ová sekce (Jazz Section) , the author decla- res: ··After all , I have to map out reality for my- self. so as to find the paths I wish to follow and identify those I have to be wary of' This sen- tence , I believe, best sum sup the situation of yo- ung people who are entirely left to their own de- vices if they do not wish to submit to the norms of existing socialism. Where such subordination le- ads is shown in a discussion of the works of Lu- boš Jurík, who rendered unto Caesar more than was necessary in order to get the chance of pu- blishing a few "more liberal" thoughts. The second issue of K also informs readers ab- ou t the Czech literary periodical Obsah whose contributors include reputable Czech writers of poetry, prose and criticism who are currently banned from publishing officially. Original wri- ting in the issue includes a short s tory, full of black humour, entitled Ballad about balance by Milan Šimečka , as well as two stories by Oliver Svišť (in Nos.l & 3) which indicate that their au- thor has all the makings of a good fiction writer. The third issue examines the current state of Slovak cul ture even more thoroughly. It includes a detailed analysis of the congresses of the diffe- rent arts' unions (writers, playwrights, film ma- kers and artists) which indicates how the timid debates of the pre-congress period are translated into sterile cliches in the congress resolutions which ignore the fundamental issues of artistic creation. And everything stays as it was: writers go on being banned. and according to the critic V. Mack, there are some 200 films which cinema audiences are not allowed to see. While recommending the editors to make things easier on their readers by publishing the contents of each issue clearly, we wish them every success in winning a large readership of youngsters claiming the right to think independ- ently. Michal Kubín 37 [pageend39]INDEPENDENT SOCIOLOGICAL JOURNAL IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA There has been a new addition to the wide-ran- ging Czechoslovak samizdat scene in the form of a new sociological journal Sociologický obzor (Sociological Horizon). The journaťs first two issues appeared this year, and its editors have put together a highly professional product, col- lecting articles of topical interest from contribu- tors who can write eminently readable prose. In- deed , the country's officially published sociolo- gical journals, one Czech and one Slovak, could well learn a thing or two from this samizdat pu- blication. As to the journaťs orientation, the editors of Sociologický obzor have said that they will deli- berately refrain from taking a binding editorial line that would rule out other views from appea- ring on the journal's pages. "What we need above al/ are some of that cele- brate 'drobná práce', or responsible endeavour on a persona/ basis, that would gradually fill, at least partly, the gap that has opened up in social investigation during the past twenty years. We are not only lagging behind in terms of theory and methodology; we even lack basic information. We have virtually lost contact with sociology around the world, and countries that we viewed several years ago with the benign condescension of those who know better, have now overtaken us. However, this extremely difficult work can be pursued only in a climate of tolerance, a climate that permits the study of diverse concepts that may often appear mutually exclusive. ft means not ex- cluding any of them out of hand according to the 38 discredited criteria of whether or not they belong to the one single licensed school of thought. ft me- ans allowing other concepts to flourish here and addressing our own specific social experience which is unique in many respects. "These unique aspects of our experience are precisely what we seek to reflect using the various methods available to sociologists who, whether they like it or not, are obliged to forego the resour- ces of the 'great' science of computers. However, let us give credence to the saying about 'an ill winď and get on with the job, because one has to start the work somewhere and in some fashion. The fact is that the path to the horizons of sociolo- gical knowledge will only be travelled by those who, to paraphrase a Chinese saying, keep on walking. " Both issues of Sociologický obzor have com- prised 103 typed pages ( double-spaced) and con- tained about 35,000 words each. Sources are re- ferred to in the body of the text, and short biblio- graphies of works consulted by the authors are appended to most of the articles. Articles are si- gned by the authors with their full names (many of which are new to samizdat publications). Short notes and reviews are initialled. Issue no. l of Sociologický obzor contains five main articles, ranging from a study of "feminised or feminine society" by J . Polehňa , discussions of conservatism (by L. Čep) and the "decline of or- der" (M.Piluša), to an article by J.Benedikt on Immanuel Kant . The issue also includes several reviews of books and articles, as well as of some Soviet plays. In addition, there are notes, a num- ber of quotations from outstanding thinkers, in- [pageend40]formation on new publications and a translation of Tatyana Zaslavskaya's article "Perestroika and sociology" which first appeared in Pravda (Moscow) on 6 February 1987. Issue No.2 of Sociologický obzor contains an article by J .Polehňa dealing with the topic of "a society where time is 'behind schedule"' It is ba- sed on the concept developed by French sociolo- gist G. Gurvitch of "le temps en retard sur lui- -meme". There is also a contribution on Cze- choslovak penal law by L.Čep, and another on the amended abortion law, signed with the initial "z". M. Piluša writes on the humanist sociology of Florian Znaniecki. J. Benedikt discusses the ethos of Chingiz Aitmatov's fiction and M.Piluša looks at the 1960s as a time of "nostalgia, reality and mystification". In addition to the reviews , brief notes and quotations of the previous issue, No.2 also contains two interesting documents. The first , entitled "Conscience and duty", con- sists of an exchange of letters between a woman doctor (D.K.) and the Czech Ministry ofHealth, about whether the doctor could or could not re- fuse to participate in abortions. The second do- cument ("Three statistics") includes three tables of statistics on the crime rate in Czechoslovakia from 1976 to 1985. This is particularly useful in- formation , since crime figures have not been gi- ven in recent editions of the official Statistical Year-book. · The appearance of Sociologický obzor adds to the impression that the promise of reform in Czechoslovakia has already had a favourable in- fluence on the samizdat scene. Other indepen- dent journals devoted to political and cultural is- sues, a new Slovak periodical, the appearance of economic and historical compendia, the conti- nued publication of Charter 77 documents and religious material, and the various regular and ir- regular texts associated with the "underground" cultural scene all suggest the development of a strong unofficial cul ture in a country which many thought had been forced to abandon any aspira- tions to free expression in the face of dogmatic "normalisation". VVK ANYONE KNOW ABOUT PSI? However extensive and regularly updated the CSDC's collections are, unhappily they cannot hope to be exhaustive. Among present lacunae is a collection published in Czechoslovakia under the title "Psi" ( as in the Greek letter). The only in- formation we have about it so far comes from are- cent communication from Czechoslovakia. We have decided to reproduce this both to inform rea- ders and to solicit your help should any of you al- ready obtained a copy of Psi. ff you have, please let us have a copy. Better still, loan us any is- sue(s). We will be happy to reimburse any expen- ses involved. The Editors So far, the collections marked with a Greek Psi have come out once a year and numbered some 30-50 single-spaced type-written pages. Techni- cal limitations mean they come out no more than once a year. In more favourable circumstances they would most likely appear more frequently. Psi stands for psyche. The collections publis- hed under this title are intentionally monothe- matic. Each consists of theoretical or practical 39 [pageend41]treatment of a single anthropological theme which its editors consider topical. There is cle- arly an effort to respond to "public demand". The publishers declared aim is to respect the em- pirical scientific approach to anthropology, while seeking to avoid scientism. Instead they stress the ethical, philosophical and theological relevance of a particular topic. The collections ( and their publishers) share an overtly Christian orientation. The prevailing outlook is one of catholic ecumenism or non-mi- litant catholicism, although protestant and Je- wish spirituality have also been known to figure on their pages. It is nice to see that the publishers seem to be making an effort to avoid denomina- tional quarrels. The collections include both original texts and translations, largely from German and English; the reviews are mainly of German and English/ American publications. They are targeted at rea- ders with an arts education, particularly those working with people, eg. social workers. psycho- therapists, counsellors. They are apparently pu- blished in some 200 - 300 copies. As far as I can tel1 , they are well in demand and the distributors do not neglect readers outside the metropolis, such as those in Moravia and Slovakia, though supplies to the latter are more limited. I have even come across an instance of the collection being transcribed in Slovakia- also in Czech. in- terestingly enough. Though it is a publishing venture aimed more or less at the reading "elite", it is good to see that the collections are mostly read by people active in those professions - i.e. in "the structures" - and who are in a position to put their ideas into -Hl practice in their particular sphere of activity. It is likely to take some time before Psi's efforts have any effect, but they could well help sway the atti- tudes of the collections' readership in a desirable anti-scientistic, anti-consumerist and , of course , anti-totalitarian direction. The previous editions have dealt with the transcendental dimensions of Being ("verti- cals "), psychological and ethical aspects of the question of guilt, and Freudian psychoanalysis. I gather that forthcoming issues pian to tackle the q uestions of education , sexuality, old-age and ageing, etc. Some time ago , the Rome-based magazíne Studie , in its triple issue 104-107. re- produced a text originally published in Psi. In my view, Psi is a welcome publication which is worth supporting, particularly if it maintains its past sense of topicality and an ecumenical ap- proach which will assure it a broad audience.

[pageend43]NEW BOO KS - PRO MEMORIA RHAPSODIES AND MINIATURES Ivan Kadlečík, Rapsodie a miniarúry [Rhapsodies and mi- niatures] . Edice Petlice [Padlock Books], 144 pp. Prague 1987. The very length of time it took Rhapsodies and Miniatures to come to fruition says much about its calibre. At a time when people chase madly after the things that life has to offer and pursue success at all costs, a book that unassumingly embodies the first of these goals and has no inter- est in the latter must inevitably stand out from the crowd. Suchan author can afford to take his time and let things grow in their own way over a span of twenty years, leaf by leaf, branch by branch, rather like the trees of which Kadlečík speaks with such feeling and, above all, under- standing. About half of the book, the author re- calls, was written in the seventies and was publis- hed in its original version in Edice Petlice under the title it bears today. In this latest edition, as Kadlečík explains in an afterword, the slender vol ume has been extended by a number of texts written "after a short break - to get my breath back? - and on an almost chance impulse, in the period 1984-87". Even with those additions, the book does not number more than about sixty pieces of prose. If the time they took to mature is exceptional, then their character is no less so. In fact I am reluctant to characterise these brief texts - mostly one or two pages long - in any precise way, because they do not really belong to any usual literary genre. They are as much intended as apostro- 42 phes or short homilies as they are prose poems, as much reminiscences as they are credos, as much sketches of nature as they are minute sto- ries - as well as many other things, all of which add up to a unique whole, expressing Kadlečík ' s own very special vision of humanity and the world. Moreover, Kadlečík's unique view of huma- nity and the world is undoubtedly the most chal- lenging aspect of Rhapsodies and Miniawres. lt is also what lends the boo k artistic unity, not- withstanding the considerable time span over which the individua! pieces were written and their great breadth of subject-matter. It matters little, though, whether one reads them in the or- der they are printed or whether one picks out in- dividual pieces intuitively orat random. such as when· one read poetry - or certain works by Friedrich Nietsche, the only philosopher, I fancy , that Kadlečík - rather unexpectedly - mentions by name. In sum, the individua! pieces in Rhapsodies and Miniatures are quite capable of standing on their own, but their full signifi- cance becomes apparent only when one has read them all. A major unifying feature of Kadlečík's - prose pieces is their particularity. They all derive from a living and constantly renewed contact with rea- lity, the simple and frugal reality of his daily life, whether in the shape of the earth which he digs, the trees which he plants out or fells, th~ bees which he cares for, the family, and particularly children, that he takes to christenings or burials, [pageend44]but also the different ancestors, known and un- known, who represent his roots, his physical and spiritual lineage, his persona! and shared tradi- tions which in his case are marked by the unique features of Slovak protestantism. Particular also is Kadlečík ' s contact with the spiritual world , with scripture , symbolised by his old family hymn-book or with music which is embodied in the organ about which he not only writes with enthusiasm, but on which he also plays and which he even knows how to tune and repair. Such is the subject-matter of his writings. And he writes about it all in a practical, simple and mat- ter-of-fact way with a sure knowledge but also an undisguised enthusiasm. It is precisely this prac- ticality and enthusiasm which firmly links the in- dividua! and the cosmic in Kadlečík's prose: his Rhapsodies and Miniatures is one of those in- creasingly rare boo ks which tel1 us that it is possi- ble to beat home in this world. But Kadlečík is also aware of those things which prevent our being so. These undoubtedly include the ever-increasing supremacy of words over reality. It is a phenomenon to which Rhap- sodies and Miniatures returns time and again - and rightly so, since it is one of the burning exi- stential problems of the present day , particularly in the country where the book's author lives. Or- well invented the neologism Newspeak for it. The French call it- no doubt under the influence oť Polish - la langue de bois i.e. "wooden speech". Czeslaw Milosz, in the sub-title of his essay "The enslaved idea", calls it "logocracy". Ivan Kadlečík , for his part, dubs it ''meta- language". He goes on to explain what he means thereby: "It would seem that, as primitive tribes , humans can get by with as few as ten or twenty words. I recall someone in a radio discussion spending almost a quarter of an hour juggling with just a handful of words - like hollow balls ( though they assume an air of ceremonial sanc- tity) - and right up to its lucrative conclusion, the whole statement amounted to nothing at all. By means of an arbitrary number of isolated con- junctions, particles and indefinite pronouns it is possible to stretch out a speech for several hours using a mere handful of words. It has been calcu- lated theoretically on a computer and demon- strated in practice by the most skilled orators and innocent parrots - whom I do not mean to offend in any way, since they do not have the natural ca- pacity to use conjunctions, particles and pro- nouns independently· in a creative fashion. In the course of that broadcast reality disintegrated. dissolved or evaporated; the aqua vitae transfor- med its substance into an ethereal vapour of buoyant words. " Like a good teacher and also a bit of a prea- cher, the author oť Rlzapsodies ancl Miniatures follows this with a practical example of how even the most basic reality - such as bread - can be transformed in such a language: for radio an- nouncers and other official speakers, bread is "the in-spite-of-ongoing-objective-pro- blems final product of the baking industry". In a world ruled by the tyranny of mere words, reality truly dissolves into nothing. In such a world anyt- hing is indeed possible because everything, in- cluding the most enormous lies, wrongs and cri- mes, can not only be concealed but actually justi- fied by means of a smoke-screen of words. With- out fulminating or using drastic examples, Kad- lečík demonstrates the mortal danger that "meta-language" represents for all living things. -+3 [pageend45]and concludes by saying: "Meta-language justi- fies the artificial reality of those who neither have nor are permitted to have any interest in true reality: their jargon describes nothing, but merely skims round the edges of a thick, hot por- ridge. ( ... ) Meta-language just tries in vain to conceal dire ignorance and a loathing of Mother Reality and Grandam Matter" . It was certainly not Ivan Kadlečík ' s intention to join in the debate about the meaning andjusti- fication of so-called independent literature in Czechoslovakia, but he unwittingly contributed to it none the less. His book confirms that the main task and justification of such literature is the defence and celebration of human reality in a human language. J.V. MILAN UHDE'S "ANNUNCIATION" By an odd coincidence, Milan Uhde's play Zvěstování aneb Bedřichu, ty jsi anděl (The Annun- ciation, or, Freddie you're an Angel) made its appearance in the Federal Republic of Germany just at the moment when a three-part serial on the life of Friedrich Engels entitled The Flight of the Falcon, arrived from the GDR to be broad- cast at peak viewing hour on West Germany's First Channel (ARD). This gave viewers and cri- tics alike some practice in the history of the "ILM" (as the ideologically-doctored history of the International Labour Movement and its pro- tagonists is abbreviated in Czechoslovakia - and no doubt in the serial's country of origin, too). It also provided an opportunity to mourn the fact that things would have turned out otherwise and better had the best ideas of the best people re- 44 mained in the best heads and hands: in the·way that Marx's notions occupied - alas , for all too short a time - the head and hands of his devoted friend from Wuppertal. Given this spiritual climate, I hardly think that Milan Uhde's play will enjoy the same sort of success - even if it is on a similar theme. Unlike the big-screen socialist epic from the East Ger- man Hollywood, the Czech playwrighťs piece deals with just one brief episode from the lives of the revolutionaries. Moreover, Uhde tackles his theme with the experience and courage of an ar- tist who cut his teeth on the realities of revolutio- nary practice of a country where scurrilous texts like Dialectics of Nature or Anti-Dúhring-which Marx's erstwhile friend from Wuppertal once penned. These texts have been compulsory rea- ding for generations of students who - without discrimination - have compulsorily studied .. . good old "ILM" . And, of course , for generations these gems have frequently been the object of scarcely concealed hilarity. Mind you. Uhde is no political polemicist. It is just that he is totally au fait with the ideology whose progenitors and purveyors are the subject of his play. He knows its enticing, Siren-like melodies. He knows its "good" motives and does not ridicule it in the le- ast. What concerns the author is the "concrete inhumanity" of "concrete dialectics". The comic nature of the play's theme serves his purpose excellently. The well-known - albeit artfully ignored - story of Marx's relationship with the family's serving-maid during his years in London is the play's lynch-pin. Revolutionary Max - this subtle modification of the hero 's name suggests that the conclusions to be drawn [pageend46]have universal application - finds himself con- fronted with that most real of realities: the maiďs pregnancy. The "angelic" intervention of Max's friend Engel ( a similar nuance), which lets him off the hook, constitutes the play's non-pur- gative catharsis. By shouldering responsibility for the paternity, Engel enables the Marxist ca- tegory of Practice - proclaimed to be the funda- mental criterion of truth - to function in what is a most unphilosophical - albeit most likely true- - to- life - fashion: the 'practice' of deception. The piece is also a skit on those plays of critical realism, unmasking the "true face" of the bour- geois, which were once written in such abun- dance. Ibsen used to write such pieces in Max- Marx's day and the "father of the proletarians" would applaud them with glee. And if he did not actually see the then scandalous Ghosts , which deals with a similar faux-pas , I expect he read it. at least. Even now, plays of this kind tend to owe their success precisely to the brutal seriousness with which the bourgeois children lecture their parents without themselves abandoning any of the lattet's vices/virtues - apart, that is. from the making of money. Not long ago I witnessed the latest production in Bonn of Ibsen's spooky sce- nario which nowadays can hardly be played as anything but semi-farce. Unfortunately. mv fits of laughter earned me reproachful glaňces from the audience in this, my serious-minded new ho- meland. Naturally, Uhde does not stray from the path of co medy. The conversational na ture of the play allows him to purvey ideological blather in all its untrammelled pristine glory. Since the subordination of things and creatu- res is its general characteristic, there is little hope of such an insignificant creature as a house-maid escaping it. The new supremacy stemming from their conviction that they have discovered how the universe works, pupates as a universal me- thod ( or technique) for interfering with the origi- nality of human lives. What matters is not the pregnant belly of little L., but the birth pangs of the glowing tomorrows. The Angel Engel brings the paradoxically good tidings - a practical re- cipe for returning from the "base" to the "super- structure": from the world of deeds to the world of conjecture. Of course, Engel is also the angel of what , in the jargon of all the Maxes, is dubbed "the dustbin of history". He disposes of nuisan- ces. Heis the man without whom Maxes amount to nothing, in the way that circus acrobats cannot do without their anchor-man. And we laugh. They are presented rather like a 'Charley 'n' Fred' comic duo , but it is in fact a cautionary tale. And it is cautionary particularly in those parts of the world where socialism is not yet alto- gether "real". Uhde will not have an easy tas k over here , even though he has authored an excellent text which diverges radically from the sulky self-pre- occupation which unlicensed Czech literature displays all too often. The fact is that Uhde talks directly to the public over bere, and about un- pleasant matters, thus precluding the usual kind of peep-show syndrome which tends to dominate consideration of "East European" issues. And that may be a good thing.

It was decided to honour Mr. Petr Pospí- chal, Charter 77 signatory and member of the Committee for the Defence of the Unjustly Pro- secuted (VONS). Petr Pospíchal (26) , whose home is in Brno, can rightly claim much of the credit for the present fruitful co-operation bet- ween the Polish and Czechoslovak citizens' in- itiatives in the fields of civil liberties, literature and art. This activity has led to his conviction and imprisonment on repeated occasions. Last Fe- bruary, the Provisional Committee of Solidarity issued a statement praising Pospíchaťs contribu- tion "to our nation's struggles for freedom". Jiří Lederer, after whom the prize is named, was a Czech journalist who worked for years in favour of doser contacts between Paland and Czechoslovakia. He died in exile on 12th Octo- ber 1983. The prize of five thousand Francs is awarded to Poles, Czechs or Slovaks actively en- gaged in promoting understanding between the two countries through unfettered cultural and political information.

The illu- stration has an interesting history: it is done from a block made in Czechoslovakia by„ an- onymous graphic artists in 1987 who copied it from a 1902 wood engraving by Max Sva- binský and made it available to the CSDC.
