Awarded Arts Grant Sigrid Piroch Passes on Knowledge of Slovak Traditional Textiles Through Apprenticeship Vatican Letter Pope’s Roman Diocese in Financial, Clergy Crunch By John Thavis VATICAN CfTY (NC) — Just as a commission ot cardinals was silting down to tackle the Vatican's perennial deficit in mid-October. a new $5 miffion budget shortfall popped up in the pope s own diocese across the Tiber River. The Diocese of Rome, whose bishop is Pope John Paul ||. is facing its worst-ever financial crunch —. in pari because the Vatican Ihis year began cutting off funding for its payroll Cardinal Ugo Poletti, papal vicar of Rome, who handles daily administration of the diocese for the pope, sounded the alarm Oct 11 when he appealed for ' interest-free loans" from the faithful. Loans ol even $1,000 would help. 1he cardinal said. He promised Io guarantee Ihem personally, although he didn’t say when he would pay them back. The alternative, diocesan officials say. is real financial hardship Already about Si million is overdue to banks, and the diocese is racking up huge interest bills To some Romans the Vatican's recent decision to sever its financial support smacked of "robbing Peler to pay Paul." The Rome diocese has traditionally been seen as not just a local community of Catholics, but the pope's pastoral hnk to the world. "They called it 'detachment' of the Rome Vicariate from the Holy See. but they forgot one detail The pope is fhe bishop at Rome.' said one vicariate official, who asked not to be named "Now, at least. Ihey're calling it ■partial detachment.' "heseid.The Vatican will still cover some salaries and seminary programs. The vicariate, with headquarters about a mile from the Vatican next to the Church of Si John Lateran, employs approximately 150 peo- pfe. Some of Iheir work is directly related Io the pope — such as organizing parish Visits and planning frequent papal audiences with Italian groups. The Lateran Palace itself has historic ties with Roman pontiffs. For about 1.000 years popes kept Iheir residence there, moving permanently to the Vatican only in the 15th century. Even today, ihere is a (Continued an Page 8) Dear Cardinal Tomko, my brothers in episcopal ministry, dear Slovak pilgrims: I extend warm greetings from my heart io each ol you. just as my predecessor.

Pope Paul VI exhorted you to hold close to your hearts the work of the Institute in preserving and "promoting the hopes and ideals of your people scattered throughout the world'' (Attivita della Santa Sede, 1963. p. 198) On November 8,1981, when I visited the Slovak Institute of SS. Cyril & Methodius, I witnessed for myself Ihench spirit of your holy patrons At the Institute, promoting vocations to the priesthood, laboring on behalf of the spiritual needs of Slovaks in the tree world, its rich printing apoštoláte, all these are evidence of the Slovak presence in Rome All this is testimony to the enduring legacy of the holy brothers of Thessalonica even now among the Slovaks today For this, the Lord is to be praised. The chapel ol the Slovak institute is presently the only oratory dedicated to the holy co-patrons at Europe. SS Cyril & Methodius From this center springs the rich legacy of the Holy Brothers which you have an obligation to promote and propagate so as to continue to enrich and nourish the common faith traditions which gave birth to the European nations. "Here. too. is the foundation of your spiritual greatness and the rich cultural traditions ol your nation." as I related to you during my visit to the Slovak Institute in 1981. You have gathered here from many parts of the free world and from your homeland Slovakia. Your rich heritage of faith unite you asa people Remain faithful and united in your faith traditions, both in your homeland and in diaspora, thus remaining one Slovak family. May you be faithful in preserving the faith traditions of your Holy Patrons, under Ihe mantle of Our Lady under her title of Mother of Sorrows, patroness ol Slovakia With this. I offer my pater nal and apostolic blessing The Pennsylvania Council on Ilie Ans and the Pennsylvania Haniace Affaire Commission have approved a grant for the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures at the University of Pittsburgh to sponsor an apprenticeship progam in the preparation of traditional Slovak textiles. According to the tenns of the one-year grant the "Master, '' Sigrid Piroch ol Meadville, wdl instruct two Pittsburgh apprentices, Joseph Ar- mata and Christine Metil, in traditional Slovak techniques of spinning, natural dyeing and weaving. Towards the end of their apprenticeship the team will demonstrate and display their craft al Slovak events and festivals in the Com monwealth.

Even nor-infallible teachings should be received wilh "religious submission of mind and will.” he said. The pope said there is room for "a legitimate pfuraiism intheology" in the church.

KRAJSA, KSGC Illusions and Realities CHOOSING OUR KING IMPRESSIONS OF ONE PILGRIM By Michael Novak 25TH JUBILEE OF THE SLOVAK INSTITUTE OF SS. CYRIL AND METHODIUS IN ROME By Sister M. Toland* Lederleitner, SS.C-M. A large, lively group of Slovak Americans from New York. New Jersey. Pennsylvania. Conner; tlau^^ndiana. and Illinois, under the ausplcesjtftRe^lbyák Catholic Federation, left Kennedy Ah^ort on September 27 for the Eternal City to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the Slovak Institute 4of SS. Cyril and Methodius. The pilgrimage was under the spiritual guidance of our beloved Most Rev. Andrew G. Grutka. Bishop Emeritus of Gary and Protector of the Slovak Institute; the Most Rev. Joseph V. Adamec. Bishop of Altoona-Johnstown; the Most Rev. Michael Rusnak. C.S.R-. Bishop of the Byzantine Rite Diocese of SS. Cyril and Methodius for Slovaks: as well as the Rev. Edward M. Matash. president of the Slovak Catholic Federation. Many other Slovak priests and Sisters were also in attendance. Soon after our arrival in Rome we were bused to Michelangelo Hotel, conveniently located near the famous, ever ancient, ever new St. Peter's Basilica. On Thursday. September 29. Cardinal Jozef Tomko was the principal celebrant of the concelebrated Slovak liturgy at the Basilica of St. Mary Major. I was thrilled to recall that It was In this beautiful, majestic basilica that. centuries ago. the Slavonic liturgical texts used by SS. Cyril and Methodius, approved by Pope Hadrian II. were placed upon the altar. And how moved 1 was to be present to pray the Mass and sing cur venerable Slovak hymns Md th my brothers and sisters from all over the world. (Into my mind came Hviczdoslav’s "Ja som pysny. ze som Slovak . . . Jeden brat moj palmy sadí, druhy vecne vidi lady, tretí morom lieta"). On Friday. September 30. the Most Rev. Andrew G. Grutka was the principal celebrant at the liturgy in the Basilica of Saint Clement, third pope after St Peter. It was our Saints Cyril and Methodius who. while evangelizing the Khazars, recovered the relics of Saint Clement In the Crimea and brought them to Rome in 868. Bishop Grutka recalled that 55 years ago he celebrated Mass at this very place In the presence of one priest and two laymen. Today he spoke to a crowd of 600 Slovaks. After the liturgy, the entire assembly proceeded to the lower levels of the Basilica, where a special service was held at the tomb of Saint Cyril. Bishop Michael Rusnak addressed the audience, then there followed a reading of Jan Okai's "Žalm nad hrobom sv. Cyrila" and the traditional hymn. "V sed- mobreznom kruhu Rima." While we returned to the upper level, we sang "O Maria bolestivá, naša ochrana," joined in spirit with our suffering brothers and sisters In Slovakia. After the services the people lingered outside the Basilica, eager to meet the Slovak people from all parts of the world. I was happy to be Instrumental in effecting a meeting of a Mr. Pekar from Slovakia with our Father Pekar from the USA. Saturday, October 1. was the red-letter day. when we were received by Pope John Paul II at a special audience In the Clementine Hall of the Vatican Palace. The hall was literally wall-to-wall people. As we awaited the arrival of the Pope. Bishop Hrušovsky led us in prayer. 1 was recalling with joy my last visit to Rome with ray cousins. Salesian Fathers Joseph Figura and Anthony Figura, when we three spoke to our Holy Father in Slovak and His Holiness shook hands with us. As we prayed. Pope John Paul H was escorted to his chair before us. We listened with elation as he read us his beautiful message in flawless Slovak. He then arose and headed toward us He headed down the middle aisle, where he was almost crushed by the people trying to be as near him as possible, hoping to at least touch his hand. Sunday. October 3. was the highlight of our trip. Early Ln the morning we were bused to the Slovak institute of Sainis Cyril and Methodius to celebrate the 25th anniversary of its establishment. We were warmly greeted by Cardinal JozefTomko and by Bishop Dominik Hrušovsky. Bishop of all Slovaks In Diaspora and Rector of the Institute. The con- celebrated Mass of Thanksgiving by Cardinal Tomko and many priests took place outdoors. The grounds were temporarily transformed into a majestic natural cathedral, where an enormous. Inspiring rustic crucifix served as a backdrop. In the sanctuary, in addition to Bishop Hrušovsky. Bishop Rusnak, and Bishop Adamec, were seated Bishop James Timlin of Scranton and Bishop William H. Keeler of Harrisburg. The last two were immediately welcomed as "honorary Slovaks" for the day. An outstanding feature of the celebration was the blessing of the handsome bronze life- size statues of Saints Cyril and Methodius, work of the famed sculptor Schiffer, commissioned for the occasion. They now adorn the entrance of the Institute, as if inviting all to come in. • Following the liturgy, a luncheon was served to all 7W guests. It was prepared by the Slovak Sisters who live and work at the Institute. They had spent many days preparing for this great occasion. The food was delicious and plentiful, especially their homemade poppyseed and nut rolls. Thank you for all your dedicated work. Sestrička Galla a vsetke Sestričky! During our luncheon 1 was delighted to meet Zuzka Vrablik of Germany, an old friend who was proud to have me meet her son Jozko. now enrolled at the Ustav (Institute). At 2:30 a specially prepared Thanksgiving service was held. Representatives of various fraternal organizations delivered their c o d- gratulatlons and presented their generous contributions. ft was also at this time that several young ladles entertained with several choral selec- riona. Including a well-loved hymn of Slovak youth, "Jczlsu. tebe žijem.“ At the conclusion the Litany of Loretto was supg In a strong, resonant voice by Bishop Hrušovsky, followed by prayers of thanksgiving. Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament brought the memorable celebration to a close. Aa we prepared to leave the Institute. Bishop Hrušovsky presented each one of us individually with a copy of the newly revised edition of the Slovak New Testament, which had Just arrived the day before. He encouraged us to try to disseminate this valuable edition everywhere. On Monday. October 3, our group toured unforgettable Assist As we arrived a long procession was weaving its way to the Basilica of St. Mary of the Angels, passing slowly, two by two, through the tiny but famous Poreluncola. where St. Francis spent many hours in prayer. During the Mass familiar strains of Gregorian Chant were heard. We also visited the Church of St. Francis and many quaint shops. On Tuesday. October 4. we traveled through the lovely Italian countryside to Tivoli, a city famous for its ancient palace and colorful gardens and myriads of fountains. On Wednesday, October 5. at 10a.m. we boarded our Pan Am plane for New York. As we fiew back, we relaxed and relived all the wonderful experiences of the past week, including meeting old and new friends. Among the clergy we met. besides the Bishops, the following; Most Rev. Abbot Roger Gries. O.S.B.. Msgr. John Balberchak. Msgr. Francis Beeda. Msgr. Thomas Banick. and the Reverend Fathers: Charles Hawkins. O.S.B.. Vincent Danco. SJ.. Joseph Javorka. S.J..

Washington Letter THE SUPREME COURT: REVISITING A MAJOR CIVIL RIGHTS RULING WASHINGTON (NC) - When the U.S. Supreme Court announced last April It would reconsider Runyon vs. McCrary, a key 1976 civil rights ruling, the move sent shock waves through the civil rights community. Many. Including the National Catholic Conference on interracial Justice and its executive director. Jerome Ernst, viewed the move as a threat to the faith minorities have placed In the high court to fight racial bias- The Runyon ruling prohibited private schools from discriminating on the basis of race.

In the Runyon case the Justices looked into the language of post-Civil War laws enacted by Congress to guarantee the rights of newly emancipated blacks. The Justices then concluded 7-2 that an 1866 law. though it did not mention schools, authorized suits against private (Continued on Psge 5) Electing a U.S. President Is not like electing a European prime minister.

Sutherland, Ph.D. PUEBLO, COLORADO, 1921 In 1921 there were six Jednota branches in the state of Colorado, in Brookside, Glober- ville. Pietou. Pueblo, Rockvale, and Rouse. Most were small mining settlements, each having only a few Slovak families. Branch 230 in Brookside, for example, had only 17 members: Branch 392 in Globerville had six members: Branch 383 tn Rockvale_22; Branch 331 in Rouse. 11; Branch 301 In Pietou. 50. Pueblo, however, a city of about 50.000, had a prosperous Slovak community of about 150 families. In 1896 they built a Slovak Catholic church. St. Mary’s, and in the same year opened a Slovak school where 340 children attended. The St. Anthony Society. Branch 93 in Pueblo, had 164 members. Although far from the Slovak strongholds of the eastern U.S.. Pueblo quickly became known throughout Slovak America. In June 1921. a disasterous Good struck the city of Fueblo. Flood waters of the Arkansas River completely destroyed 71 Slovak homes and seriously damaged St- Mary s Church. The pastor. Rev. A. Keclik, O.S.B.. and Branch 93 President. Ignac Semola. sent an urgent message to Supreme President Andrej Dorko. asking for assistance in rebuilding Pueblo's devastated Slovak community. On July 6. 1921 President Dorko announced that a special collection would be taken up for the victims of Pueblo. The Supreme Officers Immediately voted to donate S500 from the Society treasury to the cause. Individual branches followed, over 30 In all. As they had in the past, baptisms, weddings and other family get-togethers became opportunities to give to the Pueblo collection.

In thinking George Bush would be a pushover. Dukakis allowed himself to seem a cold and imperious boss of an administration. but not a fatherly king. He presented himself as an unsympathetic figure. According to complaints from Democratic state offices, his Boston stalf also conveyed a strong whiff of Northeastern arrogance. But while Dukakis began running for prime minister. Bush was running for that and more; to be elected king.

They think that the people want a manager, accountant, expert on the issues, and articulate debater. They forget that the people want someone like themselves to become their most important public selfimage. They want a person like themselves to stand against “enemies foreign and domes- * tic." The president Is the people’s tribune against the congress, the courts, and the entire world. This secret to the office of the presidency helps to explain the Republican lock on the electoral college. In state after state, especially in the South and West, but also Just beneath the surface Ln nearly every state, majorities of the people do not like the Ideology, mor- * als. and arrogance of "the ex* W perts." They are tired of experts telling them that they are wrong, stupid, and immoral. They have learned by experience to dislike government officials. researchers, lawyers, judges, journalists and others. Although Ronald Reagan is the president closest to the hearts of the people in recent memory, many of these experts contemptuously describe his grasp of reality as a tissue of "Illusions." Their own sense of reality is widely different. They think of Reagan's years as a "nightmare" that will pass away. They assert that the American people have been in a “daydream." But President Reagan thinks of their sense of reality as a nightmare, too. one that in his view has thankfully passed. Who is right? Whose are illusions. whose realities? Sort- ( Ing out which is which is the i major business of our time. The experts have been wrong about Reagan from the start, and the reality of peace and prosperity k has vindicated him and frus- F trated them. And they can scarcely hide comtempt for the millions who admire Ronald Reagan. ' Why do the experts always seem to look down, on those with whom they disagree? They are entitled to disagree, but not to think that their wisdom is of a superior type, higher than common sense. This is why Lt has been so easy to win the affections of all those who feel scorned by the nation's expert class. The people resent being held to be in- ferior. They retain the old- * fashioned American belief that they, the people, are the source of all sovereign power. To them, the experts are usurpers. And the Governor of Massachusetts too often shows that he wants the esteem of the experts most of all. He looks down on his fellow Americans. He looks down on Bush and Quayle as — in his word — "pathetic." The point of view from which he speaks is often that of Harvard. His favorite language Is Expertise. Thus, the "feeding frenzy” of the press in New Orleans stirred a massive backlash. It united all the scorned of America as one. Those who would be king should not try to seem superior to the people. They should try to be worthy of the people’s friendship, love, and bond of intimate Identity, so that when the people choose which candidate is "one of us." he Is that man. He must be the vehicle of their-dreams, even more than a manager, a king even more than a prime minister. And his sense of reality must be their sense, the other fellow's illusions they reject. The latest class division in America is between the experts (who have disgraced the noble name "liberal") and the ordinary people. The new aristocracy of experts is resented by the commoners. I hope we have a president soon who can heal that breach. It is one of the tasks of kings to heal and to unite, to be beyond party, and to ennoble all. We are about to choose that king. 1 » [pageend4]JEDNOTA. WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 26. 1985 Page 5 ,<0 if LIGHT ONE CANDLE Il is better io tight one candle than to curse the darkness. (Christopher Molta) By Father John Catolr Director of The Christophers $ GOD ANSWERS ALL PRAYERS God answers all our prayers, sometimes subtly, sometimes dramatically. Sometimes He Just says "no" and that's His right to do so But He has answered so many of my prayera 1 can’t keep track of them ail. One of my favorite memories of God's kindness had Lo do with a Cousin of mine named Vincent Wagner. His mother and my mother were sisters. Vincent, nicknamed "Brother." was nearly 10 years older than I. so we realty djdn X know each other very- well until 1 was an adult- In his early 20s "Brother" developed a severe case of rheumatoid arthritis. His life was a sea of pain and my heart went out lo him. 1 remember talking with him in a car for nearly three hours one night many years ago. "Brother, why don't you try to find a nice girl and start a new life for yourself. You're a good looking man. break cut of Ibis rut you're in." He had become quite bitter: "Who would have rue? Look at me, I'm a wreck. I can't walk half of the time. I can't work on a regular basis. 1 wouldn't want to burden any woman with this miserable body of mine. It wouldn't be fair." He was angry with God and with himself. And who could blame him? His misery laid heayily on my heart and L told him I would pray that he'd meet someone who would love him well and whom he would love in return. Years later he married a wonderful young woman named Margie and his attitude toward life changed completely. In spite of recurring pain, he became acheerful person and they were happy together. One night at a family reunion “Brother" leaned over to me and said something 1 shall never forget. "Marge and 1 have you to thank for bringing us together." I was stunned; "Me. what do you mean?" I thought he might be referring to my prayers. "Don't you remember, it was you who Introduced us." My jaw dropped. 1 had absolutely no recollection of it. He told me it was at a family wedding where she was a bridesmaid. Apparently J had introduced them in passingand forgot about it. I had no intention of matching them up since Marge was about 16 years younger than he. t never even remembered that they met at that wedding. As I look back on It, 1 marvel at God's creativity Ln answering my prayers. "Brother" died a few years ago. but he had had a wonderful life for many years with Margie and he died a happy man. I smile when 1 think of all the prayers God has answered for me. I hope you do. too. For a free capy, of the Christopher Netos Notes.

THE SUPREME COURT: REVISITING ,, A MAJ0R CIVIL RIGHTS RULING ?ri' ,k'' fČťri&nued reel Page 4) Citizens accused of discrimination- The decision has been a key to dozens of lower court ' rulings and later Supreme Court decisions that forbid racial dlacrimlnaton in all kinds of private transactions The 1960s civil rights laws prohibited discrimination tn- volvlng housing, employment and public accommodations but left a number of areas uncovered- Runyon gave plain tills the power to sue and collect monetary damages for discrimination in situations Involving, for example, a refusal by a shopkeeper to sell Io blacks. Ms. Patterson's lawyer. Julius Chambers of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, argued before the high court Oct. 12 that Runyon conformed with the 1866 law. which Congress passed because Lt "had egregious conduct to correct" after the Civil War. "Congress meant to reach the type of conduct*' al issue tn the Patterson case, he said. Roger S- Kaplan, the credit union's lawyer, said the Runyon ruling Improperly extended the 1866 Civil Rights Act to bar discrimination by private Individuals. The Justices were not expected to announce their decision until later in their 1988-89 term, which ends next summer. One obstacle to overturning Runyon is the judicial doctrine of "stare decisis.' * a Latin legal phrase meaning the court must stand by any earlier decision unless there are especially strong reasons for reversing It. "The Runyon case was a landmark Supreme Court decision," said Ralph Neas. executive director of the Leader- ' ship Conference on Civil Rights, a coalition of 180 groups that includes the U.$. Catholic Conference and other religicus. civil rights and labor organizations. Neas said the decision to reconsider It brought about unprecedented ULirobera of individuals and Organizations filing frlend-of-the-court briefs. He noted that 66 senators. 145 members of Congress. 110 civil .rights groups and 47 of 50stale attorneys general said in such briefs that reversing Runyan could overnight "put In Jeopardy” well-established civil rights law. On the other side were U-S. Rep. Henry J. Hyde. R-ÜL, Sen. Jesse A. Helms. R-N.C.. and others who stated in another brief that Runyon "should be reconsidered and overruled or modified because It Is a clear misinterpretation of the intent" of the 1866 law. "This court should not usurp the role of Congress even if some of its members may be willing to shirk their legislative responsibility to make hard policy decisions.” they wrote. Neas added that “not just Runyon is al stake, bui the Patterson case also. If you have a situation where a woman was hired and not discriminated on the basis of race but is racially harassed you really haven’t gained io much." Court watchers also were waiting for the outcome of the case to see how the newest justice. Anthony M. Kennedy, would decide. He Joined In the majority on reconsidering Runyon. During conflnnation hearings last December on Kennedy's nomination to the court, his opponents said they were troubled by bls narrow rulings as a Judge on the 9di Circuit Court of Appeals in civU rights cases involving women and minorities. Buta colleague of Kennedy's. Nathaniel Colley, a prominent black lawyer from Sacramento. Calif., said Ihat he had no doubts about his commitment to civil rights. "Judge Kennedy embraces Brown vs. the Board of Education (the 1954 Supreme Court desegregation ruling) and has said so many times, " Colley said. ' For black people that is our Magna Carta. Whoever am braces that embraces us." Styn J flew Member today! JEDNOTA TALK From Fr.

Following the religious services the more than 700 guesis enjoyed a picnic lunch on outdoor tables and chairs set up on the Institute's spacious grounds. The warmth of th© early fall Roman sun provided the perfect setting lor Ihe jubilee celebration. The meal was prepared by Ihe Daughters of St. Vincent de Paul, who staff the Slovak Institute, and trie fooo was served by Slovak seminarians currently studying in Rome A total of 13 are currently in their theological studies.

Bohemia, end Moravia After an enjoyable luncheon, the pilgrims returned io the outdoor altar erected for the celebration Io participate in a cultural program Greetings were extended by representatives of a number of Slovak organizations in Western Europe Australia. Canada, and the United Stales A special musical presentation was given by a group of five young girts from Kosice m Eastern Slovakia, who traveled to Rome for the celebrations. The diocese of Kosice is the home diocese of Jozef Cardinal Tomko. Greeting the celebrations on be- ha/f of the first Cathdic Stovák Union was Supreme President Joseph R. Kristoik, who together with Supreme Chaplain Father Char es Hawkins. O.S.B., and Executive Secretary Treaauier Cynl M Ferenchak. represented the Society at the festivities Sister M Raymund Horvath. SS.CM. greeted the gathering on behali of the Sisters ol SS. Cyril and Methodius Representatives ol the various Slovak Catholic iraiernals also extended greetings. Following the civic program, the concluding spiritual exercise of the celebrations, the "Te Deum." began at 3 p.m. Bishop Hrušovsky was the esiebrant ol Benediction ol the Most Blessed Sacrament with Cardinal Tomko presiding In this final act of Thanksgiving to Almighty God. several individuals who have gone on to their eternal reward were recalled. Among the pioneers of the Slovak Institute who were remembered were its first rector, Msgr. Stephen J. Naheňka, S.T.D-, who died in 1975. and the Rev Stephan Fabera. S.D.B.. who was in charge of Slovak pilgrims to Rome lor many years. The jubilee festivities ended with Bishop Hrušovsky personally presenting a copy of the newly printed New Testament in Slovak to each ol the pilgrims. This newest edition in Slovak ol the New Testament is yet another of the important books published by the Slovak Institute. In reflecting on the jubilee celebrations from the point of view of a Slovak American pilgrim, it can be said that a sense of warmth and oneness with the Slovak Institute was much in evidence. It was an occasion to thank Almighty God for this great monument to our Slovak faith in the Eternal City. The splendid cooperation of the Slovak Catholic fralernals ol the United States both at Ihe Institute's beginnings and now at its quarter century of existence testifies to the wonder- hj accomplishments ol Ihe fraternal benefit system which made possible this great source of faith lor ihe Slovak nation it certainly made one proud to be a member of one of the five Slovak fralernals which have made the Slovak Institute possible. All American Catholics ol Slovak ancestry can take pride in the work of the Slovak Institute this pasl quarter of a century and we assure this great spiritual center ol our people that in the future we will continue such support in the best traditions of our ageless Slovak motto.

Religious and iaily io speak Spanish and underhand Hispanic cultures and foreign-born priests to speak English, the Diocese ol Brooklyn, N.Y., developed a Diocesan Insbiule ol Languages and Immigrant Ministry, said Auxiliary Bishop Rene A Valero of Brooklyn.

Bishop Valero said he is optimistic that efforts like ihe institute will keep Hispervcs of the Brooklyn Diocese from becoming "a separate Church" within the U.S. church He said 103 of Ihe diocese's 230 parshes have Sparxsh-language Masses offered on a weekly basis.

"They say (here are places in the City where you can touch Lie walls of two churches." said Bishop Valero Nowthe churches are not all needed, he said, but parishioners are reluctant to have the>r own shut down. "Today we're paying lor our sins of Ihe past." said Bishop Valero. He called for encouragement of religious vocations among "Hispanic- Americans,'' whom he defined as "per sons whose parents are from Latin America but who were themselves bom hare or entered ihe United States at a young age " These people, said the bishop, "have the advantage of knowing both cul lures" and can "serve as a bridge " When working with Hispanics who are new arrivals from war-torn nations, sad Ms Roque, parish leaders should keep in mind they are "refugees, no! xn- mgrants " In the Archdiocese of Washington, lor example, where an estimated 70.000 Io 150.000 Salvadorans settled alter fleeing their nation she $a>d.

OCTOBER 26. 1989 Pope Defends Teaching Authority -- Sigrid Piroch Passes on Knowledge dom ol conscience' to justify this way of acting Therefore, il is nee essary to clarify foat it is not cor- science that 'freely' establishes what is right and wrong." he said. Theologians, in particular, must remember that their role is based on service to the church and the lailh, ihe pope said. They have a "grave responsibility" toward Ibis service, particularly if Ihey have received a canonical mission to teach in^ch^tch faculty, he said. Ti]g._pgó^Srtfed agarrtst seeing ihe lailh ’’aSa philosophical invention to be perfected." Instead, ha said, il is a "divine deposit to be faithfolly guarded and infallibly interpreted " The task of interpreting It "has been entrusted exclusively to foe living teaching office of the church." he said. This teaching office, or magister- ium, "includes Ihe charism of infallibility, present not only in the solemn definitions Of the Roman pontiff and of ecumenical councils, but also tn the universal ordinary magistenum, which can truly be considered as the usual expression of Ihe church's infallibility." the pope said In explaining his remarks about infallibility, Iha pope cited the Second Vatican Council's document on the church. "Lumen Gentium." That document said infallibility was present when a pope formally proclaims a doctrine pertaining to lailh and morals, or when a pope and an ecumenical council define a teaching on such matters. II also mentioned the possibility of bishops proclaiming doctrine infallibly, under certain conditions. Those conditions have been the subject of much theological debaie since ihe council. So has the meaning ol rhe term ‘'universal ordinary leeching" olihe church and foieex- tent to whiehji shares in infallibility. Some theologians have proposed, for example, that toe . church's position on birth control has been definitively held and universally taught, and therefore would qualify as an infallible leaching. Many others disagree, however. The pope did not mention specific examples of theological dissent. But one ol the mqSt ISfnouS (Cortinuad Adm P&qb 1} cases in recent years occurred at The Calholic University of America in Washington, wheret Faiher Charles Curran was stripped of his canonical right to teaoh theology because of his dissenting positions on some church teachings The case was a controversial one in the Uniled States and prompted a debate about infallibility as understood by Iha Vatican and by theologians. Some U.S. theologians seid at Ihe time that in acting agahst Falber Curran, Vatican officials were blurring the distinction between infallible and non-infaliible teaching. This represented a threat to Iheclogicat investigation, they said. The pope referred briefly to Catholic University in his talk, saying he hoped the institution's future would bring "aver greater academic achievements, including those in theological scholarship." presented a weli-attended lecture on Slovak textiles al the University of Pittsburgh, and demonstrated Stovák handweaving on floor looms and handspinnirig on a Slovak sitting distaff at the Pittsburgh Folk Festival.

Board öl Directors EXHIBIT 2 President’s Report We meet today for the semiannual meeting ol the Board oi Directors of the First Catholic Stovák Union, which now is jusl a lew days away from the start of our 43rd National Convention. AN the reports have been written. all the committees have been appointed, and the direction in which we want our Society to move has been firmly established As we make lha línal preparations tor our convention, perhaps we. as a Board of Directors, should look at our accomplishments since our last convention, for I am certain that some of us even today do not fully comprehend the magnitude of the changes in our Society over he past three years fl you will take a moment lo refreshen your memories, you will recall that in the early 1980$. when his board assumed their elected offices, our theme to Iha membership was the necessity for "change" in our Society, and how difficult it was lo make changes. Change was necessary, lor we had just changed administrations, the last administration having been ona very deeply divided in philosophy and action. In fad, a review nt Ihe minutes ot the administration of 1976-1979 will indicate that those negative forces on the Board in those days ere stNl causing unnecessary costs to our Society today. In the early 1980s we concentrated on updating our buildings m Middletown, and bringing new products into cur Society’s insurance portfolio. Many of us remember Iha painting of the pavilion, the editor's home, the apartmente. Ihe former priest's heme, and the orphanage building. Many will remember tearing down the old barn, bringing wafer and new electricals to the pavilion, and tilling In the old swimming pod Many wiif remember the creation ol new soccer fields and ihe planting of new Heids of grass lor the beautification ol ihe Jednota Estates , How'well this 8oardof Directors remembers the middle 1980s. pur- -njHasngjatmcis! drib hundred wröflST how propenýattojir Jedneta Estates, bringing our holdings to approximately 315 acres íróm the roughly 200 acres to which our holdings had shrunk over the past fifteen years. Previous administrations had the benefit of enjoying adding the profits from land sales lo their annual statements but this administration had no such good fortune. This admmisiration was destined lo buifd for the fulure, and establishing a solid base on which their new growth could be accomplished During these middle 1980s this Board of Directors took the responsibility lor relocating our Slovak Museum & Archives from Ihe Jednota Home, lo updated quarters In the printery burlding This Board testituded Ihe Jednota Family Day Picnics, whlgh^are now an established program for our entire membership. • •- In 1935 this board, in its wisdom, saw the necessity of creating a chair of Slovak studies at the University ol Pittsburgh, and pledged Society lund- ing for this program over ihe next ten years. The program is now in its fourth year, with approximately $200,000 cl the program landed and highly visible and successful. For ihefirst time Incur hisloryouiside funds have bean obtained tor the expansion of the Slovak program al the university, and we are now in Ihe position Of creating college studení exchange programs with the universities in Slovakia and the University of Pittsburgh. There are no other Internals with this unique funding and programs. Bui the Slovak community has done it and the First Catholic Slovak Union was at the forefront of this undertaking. This Board of D reclore also look the bold step of buying anew ihree story building in Independence, Ohio, tor approximately two and a hall million dollars, instead of repairing and refurbishing the old home office headquarters In a deteriorating section of Cleveland. Ohio, as fought for and recommended by delegates from the State of Ohio Had we taken this action, we Would have truly relegated our Society to second rate status In 1986 this Board of Directors again began Id broaden <1$ horizons. How many of our Board of Directors remember our meetings in which we formally discussed re-structuring our internal operations, and had Bob Bruce. Coopers Lybrand, and Ihe Thompson. Hine and Flory firm looking into Ihe legality and practicality of holding companies and corporations for a fraternal benefit society. How many of our board remember Ihe introduc tion ol the "Guaranteed issue" insurance program, followed immediately by the new "i 9&0 CSO program," both of which are still in progress today. How well this Board of Directors den remember the filing of complaints with the Ohio Department ol Insurance by Stephen J. Kandn. President, John S. Golias, Secretary, and Andrew Putka, member, of the Rev. Stephen Furdek District of Cleveland. Ohio. While this Board of Direclors was fighting to preserve the life ol our Society, these three were questioning Lhe legality of this board s actions before the Ohio Department ol Insurance, and seeking the impeachment ol Ihe President of the F rsf Catholic Slovak Union by Ihe Supreme Court for operating our Society fraudulently These com- . plaints were tiled In violation of our Society's Bylaws, which mandate this misunderstanding between members and the Society be resolved within the forums cl ihe First Catholic Slovak Union before complaining before Outside entities How well this Board can remember the problems in the Executive Secretary's office which forced ihis board to remove the Executive Secretary from his elected office in September 1987. But all ol these problems and all of this strife is now history. This board has weathered all the storms of the past lew years, and hes won every legal battle- What must now be determined is what effect all Cl this has had on ou< Society, the First Catholic Slovak Union. In brief, I will attempt to outline ihis determination. Because of the action taken by this Board or Directors, our Society is stronger and mote financially solvent today Irian il has ever bean in its entire history. This Board of Directors can lake lull credit without any hesitation. that it has taken the right direction in assuring out Society s survival and growth for the next one hundred years of our existence. All of us realize (hat our Society will be one hundred years old in less than sixteen months, and ft is prudent for all of us to step back and see where out Society stands today. We are the only Slovak Fraternal Society with a Holding Company, and three subsidiary corporations. We are the only Slovak fraternal with a priming operation second to none, and as a result of re-slruclurmg we are able to enter the commercial marketplace without jeopardizing our ’lax free” status, as questioned by Ihe IRS several years ago. We have given our printery operation the "go ahead" to obtain all the outside business that it can handle, and the financial siatements of our printery loday wilt indicate that there are handsome profits to be made which will add greatly to the profrtablily ol our Society. We are the only Slovak fraternal society with a Properties Corporation. through which we can now develop our properties consisting qf approximately 315 acres in Middletown. Thus Board has already authorized the construction of a new 50,000 sq. ft. office/warehouse complex, which will be completed and fully occupied by June 1989. This is the first of approximately ten buitdings which can be buill on cur 44 acre Sub-divided tract south of Rosedale Avenue. We have increased Lie value of all of our property holdings in Middletown, having made our last acreage sale at $30.000 per acre, with increases in value per acre as our building pro grams progress. What does the future hold for our membership? Since the foundations have been property laid in our Communications Corporation, and in our Properties Development Corporation, we can now plan to obtain greater participation from our membership in the Society Investment field. We can all appreciate that our annuity programs within the Society permit our members to obtain a high rateol interest returnon their annuity programs in our Society Now Is the time to study the possibility of Limited Partnership and Unit Trusts lor all members of our Society interested m investing in our building programs in Middletown, Pa I have asked our tax experts and other consultants to review Ihe legality, and practicality, of offering Limited Partnership and Unit Trusts to ourmembeiShip, and our Chairman of Auditors. Brother Sleven G. Luca, has been asked to spearhead this study. Only membersol Ihe First Catodc Slovak Union will be able to participate in these investment programs, sp it is in Ihe besl interests ol all of our members to have their entire families involved in our Jednota ac tivities for the beneliis which will accrue to all members. Limited partnerships are purchases of units ol ownership in increments cl $i ,000 or more, and made available to all of our members exclusively if each of our members were to subscribe lor only one umf of ownership, almost eighty million dollars would be available to our Society lor property deveicpmenl programs in Middletown. Our membership would then participate in prow not only m increased dividends as a policy holder in the First Caihoiic Slovak Union, but also In profits generated from the ownership ol units in Ihe Limited Partnership. II is a credit to this Board of Directors ihat this can now be accomplished because of me Holding Company concept adopted by the Board ol Directors for the membeiship of the First Catholic Slovak Union. The future growth of the First Catholic Slovak Union is now an accomplished fact As we open our 43rd National Convention, we can illustrate to our delegates that we have done an excellent job in behalf of Ihe membership. and challenge anyone to show that any prior Board ol Directors has either taken such bold action, or have given our Society so great a leap info 8 new century JEDNOTA PROPERTIES On July 31.1988 ground breaking ceremonies were held at our Jednota Estates at which time our programs at the Estales were blessed in a formal religious and civic ceremony; Construction of Our new 50,000 sq. footofticehvarehouse complex has now begun; and is expected to be tetly completed by December 28th of this year. Completion in this case means the cuter walls, and roof, with all the foundation work and footers already in place K is the specific intent and desire d Ihis Board ol Directors to have this new building fully leased by the completion date if possible, so that the completion Oi internal structures can be worked on during the winter monlhg. This building has been projected to produce a positive cash iFpw, as well as appreciate financially with time. JEDNOTA MUSEUM & ARCHIVES The Jednota Museum & Archives is now one ot the major considerations lacing this Board of Directors. We have approved converting the Orphanage Building into a National Slovak Museum on the first floor, and converting Ihe second Door for offices of the editor, curator, and any drier body which requires office space available in this area. We have approved a new roof tor this structure, which must be replaced before Ihe end of tall. Work or the relocation of the museum must begin immediately, which • will require the transfer of tends for this specific project. Work must begin immediately il we are to finish ihis museum commitment before the end of 1988. JEDNOTA HOME OFFICE There riave been dramatic improvements In our Home Office operations which should be brought to the attention of this Board of Directors. For this reason, rather than go into an analysis ol the Home Office Opera- tions. I have added an addendum lo my report tilled Home Office Operations, which I am certain will be ol interest to this Board as it outlines in detail ihe changes made in our Home Office operations, and the status of atl of our operations to dale CONCLUSION Our Society for the past three years has been blessed in many respects, as evidenced by the degree of success experienced over this short period of time. There is no doubt that the guidance of the Holy Spirit has been wilh our organization over these past three years, and we can only pray that this guidance will continue. As President and Chairman of the Board, J have slated many times that the changes and improvements made in our Society ever the past three years have been second to none This is a direct tribute to the,fersighied visions of this Board of Directors, and f feel proud that as we begin our 43rd National Convention there is no delegate thai can find fault with the leadership of our Society since our last convention. The best is yet Income, since Ihe proper groundwork for success has been effectively established. As we open our 43rd National Convention, I would like io thank this Board of Directors for its effective leadership, and would heartily recommend to the delegates that they continue with the effective leadership which this Board of Directors has shown, lor this Board has not only done its best ovei the past three years, but can demonstrate that ihe actions that it has taken is the proper course of action to be taken in behalf ol the greatest Slovak Fraternal Society in the world today, the First Caihoiic Slovak Union.

Assets have increased by $21 million. Insurance written in 1950 was $41 million. Already, in 1983 we have written $11 million. Again, we emphasize "Progress." We are presently in the middle of the "43fo Triennial Convention Campaign " Ibis campaign is to generate an exceptional year using our convention as a magnet drawing in lhal new business We also have a "mini" campaign, "The Year ol the Bear." This campaign stales that anyone signing a NEW contract for $3.000 or more insurance will receive a "Jednota Bear" at the Convention. This campaign Ts designed to Increase our membership. We must sign those new members. We continue to Increase our insurance in force bui continue fo lose members Membership isaproblem. Since January 1.19S8 we have lost a total of 8D3 members and 1.221 certificates Our conversions continue to prove very popular with our members. We are now in the third year of this program. The committee is seriously studying a direct mail campaign tg get our entire membership acquainted with the Conversion program. Single Premium confrads continue to be the number one seller in our Society. Jost remember, premium on Single Premium policies comes in just once, so we must sell more each year to keep the premium income from disappearing. JEP, now in its seventh year, oonlinuesto sell well We have over $45 million in this type of policy alone. 20 Pay Lite, our old reiiaWa wilh the new vanishing premium concept, is selling well The "New" Five Year Renewable is catching on slowly. Grandparents are buying this to provide «liege education money. This is an excellent plan which we expect to grow into a major product. Goals have been set for 1986- Our goal for sales <s $35 million. As □f July 1. 1988, we have Sold $10,341.924. This is SťMíi of the goal set. Hopefully. we will receive a heavy load of new business at our Convention. We still feel very strongly that we will achieve our goal of $35 million. Annuities have been the leader this year, in the first six months of 1938. . we have taken in $1,351.000 and those annuity checks continue lo come in every day. Our 9% rate Will remain In effect until July 1, 1989 The Fly/Cruise promotion in January was a big success Over 150 people were on board the Cam/vai as il left port in Miami Everyone departed the ship with nothing but praise and compliments tor the cruise. Again, these Membership Meets are the way to show our appreciation for the time and effort c ut Recommenders give us The Sates Manager Program is improving as Sates Managers become more knowledgeable ol our products and the insurance business This committee must extend a special thanks to Thomas Hridk. our newest million dollar salesman We now hava tour talesmen who have sold over $1 million in insurance in one year: Andrew Beno has done il iwice. Joseph J. Krajsa. F.I.C., Cyril Ferenchak. and now Thomas’Hricik. The F.I.C. Program continues to move forward. The newest recommender to achieve this designation is Edward T, Surkosky ol Windber. Pa. Michael Leko Of Pittsburgh is in the final stage of his studies. This committee also wishes to advise this Board that all slates are making licensing more difficult and many are requiring continuing education to preserve ydur license. The F.C.S.Ü. is aware of the situation and trying to stay alert to developments. The Marketing Department will attempt to publish bi-weekfy articles on various phases of our portfolios. In Ihis manner, we hope to educate those who are unabte lo attend seminars. Projections of the future insurance sates of the Society are being studied Whai will be cur market in 1992? Will we protect S100 million sales by 1995? Whai is Ihe produd of ihe future? Dedsions made today wiii affect all of tomorrow. The Membership and Marketing Department feels we will have another good year. Our insurance in force will rise, our premium will rise, and if only we could increase Ihe membership, we could be the showcase of ihe fraternal movement. Thanks lo all of you and all those hard working Recommenders who give iheir time and talents to promote ihe First Catholic Slovak Union. Fraternally. THOMAS J- GUtDlSH.

OCTOBER 26. 1988 Page 15 THE NOBLE NAME OF LIBERAL Il bothers me Ehat Governor Dukakis has so long refused to defend the noble name of "lib- 4 era!.” In bls last debate with George Bush, he quivered under the name as though It were a lash He begged not Lo be hit with It again. This was not brave. True enough, the liberal movement in American politics deserves criticism. True enough, the name ' libera]’' has been captured by many on the left whe are not In the least Uberal. Many who call themselves liberals today are actual- l ly socialists (Michael Harring- ton. Dissent, the Institute for Polley Studies) or statists (House Speaker "Tip" O'Neill and Jim Wright) or foreign policy Third-worldists fJesse Jackson). During the primaries, all the Democratic candidates fought to bear the liberal label. But none of them did a very good job of criticizing highly visible excesses. None gave this honorable term a new content for a new era. None rooted it again A in the recent learning exper- ’ fences of the American people. From 1932 until about 1968, liberal was one of the most popular names tn politics, in those days, "conservative" was the bad name. The landslide defeat of Barry Goldwater exhibited the relative status of those who labels circa 1964. At that time, liberals meant three things. IL meant compassion for the unfortunate and needy and. second, a willingness to use an activist, national government to come to their I assistance. These two together led to social security, the war on poverty, the civil rights a movement, bussing, and much ” else. I The third leg of that liberal- I ism was a strong, determined I will to contain the international I advances of Communism, by I force of amis if necessary. 1 Those were the days of the Truman Doctrine. Those were the [ days of resistance against the imperial Communist ambitions of North Vietnam. (Today by I contrast, how many liberals J even notice that Communist * Vietnam, the site of a massive Soviet air and naval base, is still at war with its smaller ' neighbors?) I By 1972. liberalism began a drastic change Many on the left not only moved into opposition to the war In Vietnam, but also into opposition against, American involvement elsewhere in the world. (I myself did the first, but not the sec- By Micbael Novak ond). If American liberalism had once rested on a triad — compassion, activist government. and anti-Communism — some now kicked away Its third leg. Meanwhile, certain mistakes committed in the name of compassionate big government were not quickly corrected. Welfare dependency rose, group entitlements encroached on individual merit: and without popular consent lawyers and judges took charge of ever larger areas of daily life. Many good liberals criticized these mistakes, only to be loudly denounced as heretics. Instead of being pragmatic — testing what does actually help the poor — some liberals began to operate like a religious sect, excommunicating all who did not toe iht new party line. Then. too. the class basis of the liberal movement began to change. Academic and Journalists liberals began to treat the labor movement with disdain. The center of gravity of Democratic Party primaries began to shift toward new inter esL groups such as feminists, gays, environmentalists, "nogrowth" advocates, consumerists. and others. The name liberal began to be endowed with a new and higher class status, indicated by new names such as "limousine liberal" and “the chablis and brie set."Movie stars and rock singers (often flaunting non- tradttlonal values) became the new class heroes. Cultural politics moved the grubby economic concerns of ordinary workers from the center of attention. Union households and ethnic groups that had long been the dynamos of urban Democratic liberalism, under Mayor Daley in Chicago, for Instance, were now rejected. Called ■‘pigs" and "honkfes” (too close to 'hunkles" or "Hungarians" for comfort), the pride of many lifelong liberal Democratic working family was deeply wounded. In this way. the liberal move- menttn America became fess and less a movement of proletarians. workers, and ordinary high school graduates in CLEVELANDERS PROUD OF SLOVAK HERITAGE ,4 Over two thousand people from Ohio and neighboring stales attended (tv IBth Annual Slovak.

As the class basis of traditional liberalism eroded, so its cultural symbols changed. Set dom could Democratic presidential candidates speak with a straight face about "work, family. neighborhood, strength, and peace" (which Ronald Reagan promptly made into a winning slogan). Latter-day liberalism no longer sprang front working class culture, which it regarded as square, benighted, racist, militarist, and sexist. Liberals came to be identified with a much "higher" elite culture. How could liberals after 1972 credibly attack "the rich,” when so many of their most prominent spokespersons were demonstrably rich? How could liberals after 1972 credibly attack the business elite, when so many of them were themselves from the new elite of lawyers. Judges, journalists. movie stars and rock singers? The true values of liberalism involve three liberations: (1) liberation from tyranny and abuses of human rights, here and throughout the world: (2) liberation from poverty through the "Uberal" free- market economy of Invention, creativity, and enterprise, with free labor unions, and coupled with intelligent government aid for the unfortunate, aid that does not lead to dependence and a kind of state-run serfdom; and (3) the free exercise of conscience through inclusive pluralism. There is still much to be said for the noble, classical tradition of liberalism. It is sad that so many who falsely call themselves "liberals" have abandoned it If the 1988 election is a referendum on liberalism, it is a false liberalism — the tyranny of the new class — that is being rejected. Democratic Party leaders have allowed Re- publtchhs to selže the high ground of the three classic liberations of true and enduring liberalism. POPULAR FRONT RIGA.

The picture below shows many ol the SS Cynl and Methodius members. 300 Strong, celebrating |he branch's 25th Anniversary in 1913. The location was in Front of the first Slovak Catholic church, built in 1891. The Society provided funds to build this Slovak Catholic church. The first Slovak Mass was celebrated there in February. 1891. The name selected forlhe church was SS Cyril and Methodius since ihese were the patron saints tor Branch 3. The celebration ol the Centennial of Ihe SS Cyril and Methodius Society. Branch 3 of the FCSU. presents an opportunity tor writing a brief historical sketch of the origin. growth, and events of this benevolent fraternal Organization. To record in detail the various sacrifices. Ihe activities and changes of thus one hundred years is impossible One can. however highlight some important events and dates. The beginnings of the branch were most humble and somewhat surprising. Shortly after the Civil War in America. Slovaks began to arrive in the United States By 1875 many had come to the Eastern states, especially Pennsylvania where they could find employment in the coal and mining industry. Nearly all who became miners detested that occupation arid gave the mines the nickname the "dark caskets," due to ihe dangers involved and the darkness of the work place. Thus, many Slovaks ventured West lo places such as Minneapolis where they found more suitable work in flour mills, lumber yards, railroads, foundries, and mattress companies. Among the first Slovaks in Minneapolis were two brothers. George and John Gogols, who arrived around 1875 They were followed by John Zetenak, Joseph Martonik, and Thomas Ovsak. By 1886 a few more arrived; and shortly alter some discussions were held about organizing a Slovak fraternal society. This was difficult because the idea was unfamiliar io many Slovak immigrams. Two years later, in 1888, eleven Slovaks met in the home of George Olha and formed Ihe Society of SS Cyril and Meihodius The first officers were John Hreha. President; John Gaidunik. Vice- President; John Brehovic, Overseer. John Martonik. Secretary: Michael Hreha. Financial Secretary; and John Medvec. Sergeant-at-Arms. ' In ll^lhe' ApcsileofSlGvsk Ameficans.''Rev Stephen Furdek. invited all Slovak Catholic societies to send representatives to Cleveland to establish a union of the individual societies. John Brehovc was delegated to represent the Society at the First Catholic Slovak Union Convention. The purpose of the meeting was achieved and the First Catholic Slovak Union was bam. The SS. Cyril and Methodius Society was officially designated as Branch 3 and can claim pride in being one of the original lodges of Jednota The Minneapolis Slovak Parish Another notable achievemenl occurred the following year in 1891 Due in large measure to ihe efforts ol the lodge, the Slovak pansh of SS Cyril and Meihodius was formed. Without the help of clergy, the lodge members decided io build a church and then seek a Slovak priest Possible conflict was avoided by ihe intervention of the paster ol the neighboring parish ol Holy Cross who advised the Jednota laymen to first seek the permission ol Archbishop John Ireland. The idea ol a church was accepted by (he local hierarchy but the name for the new church. S3. Cyril and Meihodius was LACK OF SAFETY CHARLESTON, S.C. (NC) - Bishop Ernest L. Umerkoefler ol Charleston, S.C., has urged government and corporations who run nudear plants to provide information on safety to nearby residents and plant employees. He also advised the public to seek such information The tices oi nudear reactors at the U.S. government-owned Savannah River Plant. In government reports the plant, which makes nudeár weapons- grade plutonium and tritium, has been cited for lack oi safety and poor management practices DISCRIMINATION WASHINGTON (NC) — The U.S. Catholic Conference in early Oc (ober began disinbuting forms to be filled out by individuals who have experienced employment discrimination based on national origin or citizenship status. Data collected will be forwarded to ihe U.S General Accounting Office where they will be used to document effects of employer sanction provisions of the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act. said Jesuit Father Richard Ryscavage. deputy director of policy of the USCC's division of Migration and Refugee Services COMMON IDENTITY STRASBOURG. France (NC) — Pope John Paul II fold a body established to promote European unity that Europeans should rediscover Iheir “common identity’ in iheir 20 centuries of Christianity The Christian heritage makes Europe a “single unit" despite its great variety of languages, nations and cuUures, he said. Il is also the basis ot any i-ue respect for human rights, Ihe pope said. He made ihe remarks in an address to the Parfiameniary Assembly of ihe Council ol Europe during his trip lo eastern France not They were bluntly told. "One saint's name is enough." With few exceptions, since that time, the church has been known as Si. Cyril, but within the last year the name has been changed to include St Methodius They are the pairons cl Slovakia, and a few years ago were designated the co-patronsof all Europe along with St. Benedici. The lodge played the major sole in financing and constructing Ihe first church In the year of its organization — 1898 — Ihe lodge raised funds lor the church. The members worked diligently to raise funds through personal sacrifices and through solicitation and raffles The account of the first raffle in 1894 is both in- terestmg and amusma The iniriä Hem offered was a revolver. It sold for $5.00. a rather substantial sum lor that time. Other members offered their most prized possessions such as a briar pipe, boxes of cigars, a straight razor, harmonica, and even two pairs of pants Attachment to Slovakia Eventhough the members had left Slovakia, they still maintained a deep attachment to Iheir native country. This is so eloquently expressed in the third verse of Rev. Stephen Furdek's poem. ' Hymn of ihe Stovák Americans’’; "And thou white capped Tairas, far off are we thy childfen .. Bui weep thou not. for thy brood e'en beyond the sea is true to thee: For as a son loves his mother, though with wife in the world he be, So love I that Land. where rest the dusts of my fathers " It is not surprising that the society :n Minneapolis strongly supported Ihe Slovak nationalist movement in Slovakia. In 1894 the lodge resolved to join the Matica Slovenska in America, a cultural society formed to replace one in Slovakia by the same name which the Magyars had destroyed in 1874. Every lodge member paid an entrance fee of fifty cents and supported it until it was dissolved due to lack of support elsewhere. This feekng of nationalism was reviewed in 1900 and Ihe society resolved to contribute to a "National Fund" for the oppressed brothers in Slovakia Every Jedmta member pledged to contribute one cent a month in order to help finance the election of Slovaks to the Hungarian Parliamenl. During World War I the lodge joined with (he Slovak League of America to work for the independence Of Slovakia from Hungary. They supported the terms ol the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Pacts which promised the Slovaks equality with ihe Czechs.in Ihe new republic. Golden Jubilee In 1938. in connection with the branch's Goiden Jubilee, a fifty page book was published. Nearly a third was devoted to photos and nearly the same space to advertising. More than three quarters ol the written material was in Slovak. This is not surprising since Ihe branch's minutes were written in Slovak until 1949. Six members co-!' baled lo the Golden Jubilee bock: Rev. George Dargay. Andrew Zgodava. Andrew GalLk, George Ondrej, John Martonik. and John Hnasko. Only John Hnasko’s article was in English, and this was a condensed frans ation of ľgodava s article. Andrew Zgodava was the lodge's literary worker (Spolkový Literary Pracovník) and wrote more man half of the written content. In his writing he praises the Untied Slates as being the land ol Ihe greatest liberty. Gratitude was given to God lor ihe meny graces bestowed upon the members over Ihe past half century Members ware reminded of the benefits ihe lodge has given io the sick and the infirm. He acknowledged the fact Ihat Ihere were many commercial organizations which provided the same benefits, but, he adds, only in Branch 3 does "Godliness and brotherly iove prevail so we truly can say it is our society." [Minneapolis, Minn., 1913. Church in Peru NEW YORK (NO) — Peruvians are suflenno from “an economic earthquake" following austerity measures imposed in September by the govern- meni sad Archbehop Ricardo Dirand Florez of Catao. head of the nation's bishops' conference.

WEDNESDAY. OCTOBER 26, 1988 BRAT JAN HERMAN 70-ROČNÝ V jeho dome na fiale 32 Second Avenue v Kingston«, Pa., bola malá súkromná oslava. Náš ctený oslávenec, ktorý pracuje zdanlivo s nekonečnou energiou a nadäenfm, je vždy pripravený podujať sa na úlohu, ‘či -už sa má zvolať mimo- riadna schôdza, či ak má byť predded^q^ure dve spoločenské podaja$j^Ľ?ý, ktoré sa obyčajne poriadajň v oblasti Wyoming Valley.

Náš Janko, totiž Janko Herman, oslavoval svoju sedemdesiatku v kruhu svojich blízkych priateľov, ktorí el ho veľmi cenia. Takáto osoba, vlastenec, tento zvláštny druh človeka sa každoročne zdá zriedkavejší a zriedkavejší. A preto tento náš oddaný, tvorivý nápaditý a pomáhajúci vedúci v hnutí Slovenskej Ligy ochotne plnil funkciu a zodpovednosť tajom- níka-pokiadnlka 487. zboru Slovenskej Ligy vo Wyoming Valley, Pa.

Roku 1984 išiel na odpočinok. Potom mal brat Ján viac voľného času venovať sa funkciám taj.-pokl. 487. zboru, ako aj podpredsedu SLvA vo východnej Pennaylvanii. Roku 1986 náš vzorný Slovák po 38 rokoch exilu navštívil woje rodné Slovensko. Svoju návštevu označil za neopísateľnú pre radosť 20 zvítania sa s rodinou, príbuznými a priateľmi po toľkých rokoch. Povedal, že niekoľkých priateľov skoro nepoznal; dobre mu však robilo to slovenské kamarátstvo, čo viaže našich Slovákov dohromady. Jeho radosť a nadšenie z cesty boli'také veľké, Že už plánuje novú cestu na rok 1989. Oddaná Blužba tohoto rodu- verného slovenského viastenca a jeho vernosť slovenskému dedičstvu sú príčinou veľkej váž- noeti, ktorú požíva medzi tými, čo pú okolo neho 8 čo bo poznajú.

SINÁKOVÁ fPofcračtnwriel Prvý raz zatúžila po tichej izbietke a dobrej knihe. Keď večer deti uložila, otvorila veľký americký kufor, vytiahla niekoľko kníh, v ktorých sa prehŕňala. Pokochala sa so svojimi najlepšími priateľmi a uložila ich naspäť “Len keby 00m UŽ prestala s ľutovaním seba samej, všetko by bolo lepšie,” vzdychla zamyslene a uložila sa na odpočinok. V nesledujúcich dňoch žfôala sa ovlažovať myšlienkami, ale boli to len chvíľkové okamihy: Keď sa jar rozleje vo svojej plnej kráse, bude mať voľnejší čas a môže začať pracovať na svojej vysnenej knihe. A v takýchto trápnych, neznesiteľných chvíľach zatúžila aj po Dávidovi, ľutujúc ho. Akoby mu chcela dôverovať, mať v ňom vieru, že vari sa dá ešte v&ette napraviť. Ale nemohla sa nijako uspokojiť, nemohla viac veriť, žeby Ba vráti) k statočnosti a vernosti. Prečo, prečo nechce) prijať zamestnanie nd Šimonových, ani od Róberta, kým ona bola v Definite ? Len čo sa však stratila mu 2 očú, začal hneď pracovať. Ani sama nevedela, ako prežila tu už rok. Jej bremeno, o ktorom tunajší ľudia, bratia a švagriné nevedeli, bolo obľahčené prívetivosťou a láskavosťou všetkými, ktorí sa s ňou stýkali. Nikto dosiaľ nevedel povedať, že o ňu v Amerike nedbajú, alebo že by ju nepostrádali. Liety z Ameriky, ktoré jej poštár prináša každý týždeň, šíria o nej dedinou priaznivé správy, aká je ona vzácna manželka, nevesta 8 švagriná. Každý jej 20 srdca žičil, že šťastie jej bolo prajné, keď mohla navštevovať matkin hrob, ktorý okrášlila kvetmi. Dedinčania hovorili, že prišla domov na Slovensko na neurčitý Čas zo zdravotných dôvodov. Dosiaľ Katka vedela aj tak vystupovať, svoju česť 1 česť Dávidovu ako manžela zastávať. Ci však bude môcť tak vystupovať dlho? Zo všetkých listov najväčšmi ju zaujímali Dankove. Niektoré vedela aj naspamäť. Všetky listy prichodiace z Ameriky spálila, aby bratia neprišli na stopu, čo je vlastne vo veci. Cítila sa ako zlodej, ktorý v noci vychodí na lov, za korisťou. Predsa však jednu časť z prvých Dankovýcb listov si zachovala. Znela: »Drahá Katka! Ej, mala ai to vidieť, čo sa stalo, keď sme sa vrátili z Floridy domov. Ani čo by bomba bola zasiahla náš dom. Otecko nemohol odpustiť Dávidovi, Že ťa vyhnal z domu. Odpusť, že Ti to Ináč na papieri nemôžem vyjadriť. My vieme, čo Dávid urobd, preto pred Tebou nič neskrývanie Otecko mu doprosta povedal, že Ta nebol hoden. Avšak nielen otecko mu tak vyčítal, to isté sme urobili aj my ostatní. Keby si bola videla Veronku a Julku, išli el za Teba oči vyplakať. Len šťastie bolo, že švagor Róbert to všetko nevidel, lebo za desať dni bol v Chicagu. Veronka za šesť dní bola v postelí. Myslím, že dostaneš hostí, lebo Veronka povedala, že aj a Róbertom príde pre Teba. Otecka ešte väčmi rozčúlilo a rozhnevalo, keď sa o týždeň Dávid priznal, že on je všetkému vina, že si Ty preč... To len narobilo ešte viac zla, hoci sme vedeli, čo sa medzi Vami odohralo. Katka, ver, mi, že ak sa nevrátiš domov, otec nám vyhynie. Tiež bol v posteli — a len polihuje. čosi sa trápi i o Veronku ...« Hoci nechcela si viac spomínať na slová a zmysel celého listu, predsa znova sa jej vnucovali myšlienky do jej ubolenej hlavy: Co, ako tam v Detroite — v dome vážneho svokra — sa veci vy- viňujú? Rada by nakuknúť, čo am tak dnes robia? Zatúžila po tom druhom domove. A zase si hovorila, že ešte raz sa pokúsi písať. Banovala, že rukopis spálila, nevedela dosiaľ pochopiť, prečo tak urobila. Nuž Či sa ešte raz môže odhodlať zahĺbiť sa do tejto namáhavej práce, keď ruky má ako zdrevenelé? Dnes jej Danko neschodil z mysle, ako sa e ňou pýši), keď hovorí], že jeho švagriná napíše veľkú novelu. A táto myšlienka a& jej akosi hlbšie vrývala do hlavy. Marec a apríl ubehli, ako by bičom pľasol. V máji sa lepšie dýcha. Ale s Katkou tak nebolo. Cítila sa neavoja, vzrušená, aj dietkam rozdrážděně odpovedala. Obávala sa, že tu nebude môcť dlho vydržať. Je ako by splašená, nespokojná čosi ju narádza, aby niekde zutekala. A obáva sa, že ani bratia a švagriné e ňou dlho nevydržia, lebo jej napnuté nervy raz prasknú a vyzradí im svoju tajnosť. Niekoľko ráz sa pokúsila písať, ale za každým pokusom pero odsotila- Novelu síce vedela naspamäť a preto začínala písať od začiatku. Keď však zase napísala niekoľko riadkov, ruka ako aj myseľ zastala. Obličaj prezrádzal, že ju niečo trápi, líca boli uvädli a oči vpadnuté. Cítila, ako by ju sila opúšťala. A keď mala trochu voľného času, strávila ho polihcvanim na postelí Takto sa tu trápila už rok, prežívala bôľne spomienky, bôľne chvíle v tejto Izbe, dusila v sebe všetko. Ako predtým listy aj teraz často prichádzali z Ameriky, ale ani jeden nebo) od Dávida. Vedela eíce, čo robí, lebo Julka ju informovala o všetkom. Bôľne Ba jej dotkla správa o smrti v rodine Šimonových. D&nko obšírne opísal tú nešťastnú náhodu, ktorá zapríčinila smrť. Znova zdôrazňuje, že musi čoskoro prísť domov, lebo ju veľmi postrádajú. Opísal jej aj ieh pobyt v zime v'Miami na Floride. Nikto z Vantalovej rodiny nevyzradí), prečo je na Slovensku. Ba ani jej najlepšia priateľka Etela nevie pravú príčinu jej pobytu na Slovensku. Ako dlho to ešte udrží v tajnosti? C1 Bl nepohnevá svokra, keď bo neposlúchne? Akože môže vyhovieť jeho žádosti? či len preto by šla naspäť k Dávidovi, aby ho oslobodila — od seba? Zistila a videla, že sa chcel od nej všemožne oslobodiť navždy! A čo vlastne jej donesie zajtrajšok? Ó, keby sa mohla aspoň niekomu vyžalovať. Zhrozila sa nad touto myšlienkou. Nic, nesmie, tak urobiť! A keď zase došiel liet z Ameriky, dychtivé čiahla po ňom, čí to nie je asi od Dávida. Dosiaľ ani len slovíčka od neho... Ostatní všetci naliehali, aby čím skôr prišla domov. Veronka by už vraj bola pre ňu prišla, keby bolo dieťa staršie, z ktorého má neskonalú radosť. A Katka jej tú radosť žičí z plného srdca. Keď jej v jedno ráno poštár zase oddal list, Katka- ea cítila neobyčajne vzrušená, opustená. Obsah listu ju však priniesol do rovnováhy. Pani učiteľovi ju volá a prikazuje, že na budúci týždeň musí k nim prísť na návštevu, čo mysli tým? či azda je chorá a nechce jej o tom spomenúť v liste? Aký obrat sa stal s ňou? Pozvanie prijala nadšene. Veď sa jej naozaj zíde, aby aa vydala na cestu, odišla z domu na niekoľko dní. Uvažovala však o tom a povedala si, že to nie je možné. Veď deti tu nemôže nechať samé. Len tak by mohla odisť, keby Ich vzala so sebou- Pripomenula si však, že pani učiteľová zdôrazňuje, aby neprišla bez dietok. Naistc ju čaká. Katka váhala. Konečne sa rozhodla, že sa poradí s bratmi a švagrinami, čo tí povedia. Dala im čítať aj list pani učiteľovej. Bratia rozumne uznali, že táto vychádzka bude pre ňu ozaj osožná. Švagriné ju núkali, len aby šla, hoci ju budú postrádat doma. Trnava je pekné mesto. Tam bude môcť nakúpiť aj všelijaké látky & potom sa môže dať doma do šitia. Katka pristala, švagriné nachystali tvaroh, maslo a vajcia. Katka vedela, prečo sa vyhýba Trnave, ale teraz nedbala, čo by sa e nim aj stretla. No, hádam ju osud nezavedie, aby sa 8 ním stretla, )ebo on bol posledný, s ktorým by sa chcela zísť — aspoň nie teraz. ■- J Brat odviezol Katku aj s dietkam) na stanicu. Malý chlapec V sedí vedľa sestričky a drží ba ako malý gentleman. Matku i sestru nechal sedieť pri okne a on sa pozorne pozerá po vozni. Všetko ho baví červená tvárička je okrúhla ako jablko. Vidno, že slovenský vzduch mu neškodi. A keby ho tak teraz mohol vidieť jeho otec, ani by ho nespoznal. Sestrička vedľa neho sa tiež hrdo drží. V hlavách im dunejú matkine napomenutia, ako im to každý večer zopakovala: “Pani učiteľova je stará dáma a je navyknutá len na pokoj. Musíte byť úslužné a zdvorilé. A keď bude vidieť, že ste dobré a poslušné, ostaneme tam celý týždeň. Ak by Bte. bolí roztopašné, druhý raz vás nikde nevezmem." Katka sa už Vo vlaku divila, že dietky sú také pokojné. Ne- J mala s nimi ani za okamih zlú vôľu, ani £0 by vedeli, že je ’ nervózna. Pozerala sa s uspokojením na ne a s materskou pýchou sa pýtala sama seba: “Akú mohol byť Dávid natoľko ľahostajný, drsný, že odkopnul také krásne deti od seba? Je bez srdca, bez citu. Hoci o ňu nedbal, ako však mohol zavrhnúť detičky? Nemôže sa nijako odtajiť, že nie sú Vantalova krv! Akože sa môže len cd detí zdržať, keď ona sa nemôže vzdialiť od nich ani len na jednu noc? Ona žije vždy v úzkostiach, aby sa im niečo nestalo. A koľko sa s nimi I natrápila, kým ich naučila, že by nešli blízko kráv a koní. A vy- j strihala ich aj pred inými vecmi, vodila ich za ruky, aby sa ne- ' priblížili k otvorenej studni a inde. Ó, vďačne sa im obetuje.” Katka skúmavo pozerá von oknom. Rozmýšľa, ako by sa I mohla uplatniť a nechať svojmu ľudu pamiatku. Veď v novom I svete ea naučila mnohým veciam. Či tam nedostala päť dolárov I za rozprávku? čí jej tam neuznali, že čosi vie? | Och, škoda myslieť. Tu by nikdy nedosiahla takého víťazstva \ J ako tam. Keby bola len ostala tam, mala tam ostať. Mala času. ' ’ mohla písať. Len keby Dávid jej bol vyšiel v ústrety. Dnes by je] detičky neboli osirelé, bez otca. Ach, aký je to do neba volajúci hriech, že ich Dávid tak odmrští)!

Či pani učiteľova ju bude čakať na stanici? I Dvanásť minút neskoršie sa ozýval sprievodcov hlas: I “Nasledujúca stanica je Trnava!” I Každý z cestujúcich sa zahniezdil, ani čo by sa chystal opustiť M vozeň. Len niektorí zostali sedieť, ostatní sa pripravovali na od- I chod. Bolo desať hodín predpoludním. Mnohí šli do Trnavy — | sedliaci a sedliacky — nakúpiť tovar. I Aj Katka sa chystala s dietkami. Vlek zastal. Okolo Katky I sa všetko zatočilo. Keď ju však ovial čerstvý vzduch, cítila sa I lepšie. A srdce jej radosťou podskočilo, keď ešte zo schodov za- I zrela pani učiteľovú. O niekoľko sekúnd sa už aj a ňou objímala. I Pani učiteľová ju vybozkávala, ako aj dietky so zvláštnou rados- I ťou vyobjímala a pobozkala. Jej prvé slová boli: I “Ani neveríš, ako by si ma bola sklamala a zarmútila, keby J si nebola prišla." . ,1 O chvíľu boli usadené v koči, ktorý ich viezol k bytu učíte- ^1 ľovcov. Katka sa obávala, že pani učiteľová spozná na nej, že I S ňou nie je všetko v poriadku. Oj. keby sa mohla aspoň zdôveriť, I ale nie... Nesmie sa ani živej duši zdôveriť, aspoň nie teraz, čo I ona v súčasnosti prežíva. Musí ea opanovať, pretvárať, lebo ináč ■ pani učiteľová by sa cítila nešťastná, keby sa dozvedela, £0 vlastne 1 ju priviedlo oa Slovensko. I Celou cestou sa stará pani bavila s deťmi. Katka bola rada, I že nemusí hovoriť. Keď koč zastal, zbadala, že sú von z mesta. I Jej zrak spočinul na malom ale krásnom útulnom dome, okolo I ktorého sa rozprestierala nádherná záhrada, vysadená s košatými I ovocnými stromami. Celé okolie akoby holo pohrúžené v hlbokom 1 spánku. Taká tichosť tu panovala. 1 Pani učiteľová zbadala Katkin údiv. Hneď bola ochotná a vy- f J svetlení m: ,éil “Ako vidíš, nebývame v meste. Toto miesto je asi pol h-odiay , I vzdialené od mestského hluku. Páči sa nám tu, lebo je tu ticho.” I I Katka pozorne skúmala okolie i nadšene hovorila: J I "Všetko sa tu podobá ako raju. Je to báječné. Nikdy som ei 11 nepredstavovala, že v susedstve Trnavy by bol taký utešený kút zátišia. Naozaj sa teším a vami, že vaše dlhoročný sny as splnili.

Vo svojej homílli Otec Deller poznamenal, že v duchovnom živote, aby sme žili správne, musíme mať stále na zreteli smer života. Taký smer nám dal Ježiš, keď pred svojím odchodom do neba povedal ľ "Idem vám pripraviť miesto..." Týmto nám Ježiš dal nádej, akú celý svet dať nemôže, lebo vieme, prečo žijeme. Preto ES vyplatí milovať Ježiša a verne mu slúžiť. Toronto Sestra Eleonóra zasvätila celý svoj život, Čo podoprela svojimi rehoľnými stuhami: chudobou, čietetau a poslušnosťou.

Slávnostné obedy majú byť bez alkoholu a počet účastníkov má hyť čo najmenší, aby sa znížili štátne výdavky. Cestovanie minia- trov po štáte má byť vždy na pomoc ľuďom.

A pritom si našiel čas na Štúdium práva Navštevoval večerné kurzy na univerzite. V krátkom čase sa dostal do vlády.

DRUHÉ ČÍTANIE Preto, že zostdoa wmeAw, ted kňazskú hodnosť čítanie z Listu židom. — Bratia! Viacerí sa museli stať. kňazmi (Starého zákona), lebo smrť im prekazila zostať kň«?^ mi naveky. Ale Kristus, pretože zostáva naveky, má kňazskú hodnosť, ktorá neprechádza na iného. Preto môže dokonale spasiť tých, ktorí skrze neho pristupujú k Bobu, lebo ostáva vždy nažive, a oroduje za nás. A takého Veľkňaza sme naozaj potrebovali: svätého nevinného, nepoškvrneného, bezhriešneho, povýšeného nad nebesia, ktorý nemusí — ako obyčajní veľkňaz! — deň po deň prinášať obetu, najprv za svoje a potom za hriechy ľudu. On to urobil raz navždy, keď obetoval seba somäio. Zákon totiž ustanovuje za kňazov ľudí, podrobených slabosti, ale slovo prísahy, ktorú odznelo po zákone, ustanovuje Syna, ktorý dosiahol večnú dokonalosť. Počuli sme slova Pánovo. PRÍPRAVA NA EVANJELIUM (:AléluJa;) Ak ma niekto mthifc, řiicltottl moje slovo, hovorí Pdn. a môj Otec ho bude tiež milovať EVANJELIUM Tola je prvé prikázanie. Druhé je mu podobné Čítanie zo svätého evanjelia podľa Marka. — V tom čase pristúpil ktorýsi zákonník k Ježišovi a opýtal sa ho: "Ktoré prikázanie Je prvé zo všetkých?” Ježíš mn odpovedal: "Prvé Je: Počuj, Izrael; Pán Boh náš je jediný Pán. Preto milovať budeš Pána, Boha svojho, z celého srdca svojho, z celej duše svojej, zo všetkej mysle svojej a zo všetkej sily svojej. To Je prvú prikázanie. Druhé Je toto: Milovať budeš blížneho svojho ako seba samého. Iného väčšieho prikázania nad tieto niet. Zákonník mu hovoril: "Dobre, uateľ, podľa pravdy si odpovedal, že Jediný Je Boh a že okrem neho niet Iného; a že ho máme milovať z celého srdca a z celého rozumu a z celej duše a zo všetkej svojej sily a že milovať blížneho ako seba samého je omnoho viac ako všetky zápalné a ostatné obete.“ Keď Ježiš videl, že rozumne hovoril, povedal mu: "Nie sl ďaleko od Kráľovstva Božieho." A vi nikto sc hc viac neopovážil spytovať. Počuli w slovo Pánovo. MODLITBY VERIACICH Bratia a sestry, modlime sa k všemohúcemu Bohu, aby nás sprevádzal svojou pomocou v časných aj duchovných potrebách. • Za pápeža, biskupov a kňazov: — aby účinne roznecovali v Božom ľude vieru v Ježiša Krista a záujem o každé Božie slovo, prosme Pána. • Za všetky svetské vrchnosti: — aby spravodlivými zákonmi umožňovali zbratanie všetkých ľudí, prosme vrúcne Pána. • Za nekajúcich kresťanov — aby sa vrátili na Kristovu cestu života a spásy, prosme Pána. ’Za nás všetkých: — aby sme sa živou účasťou na svätej omši posilnili v láske k Bohu a blížnemu, prosme Pána. Všemohúci Bože, ty sl náš Otec a vieš, čo potrebujeme: prosíme ťa, aby sme hľadali najprv tvoje Kráľovstvo a nech pociťujeme ustavične tvoju lásku a pomoc. Skrze Krista, nášho Pána. CELÝM SVOJÍM SRDCOM “Milovať budeš Pána. Boha svojho, i celého srdca svojho“ (Mk 12, 29) Istá starostlivá matka poúčala svoju dcérku Aničku o tom. ako ich rodinu Pán Boh veľmi miluje. Anička prerušila matku s otázkou: "Mama, ako môžem milovať'Pána Boha, keď som ho nikdy nevidela?" Prv, ako jej matka mohla dať nejakú odpoveď prišiel poštár n doniesol ixn list od starej mamy. Anička starú mamu nikdy nevidela, lebo bývala v ďalekej krajine, za morom. V liste ale bola fotke starej mamy s poznámkou, že fekka je pre vnučku, Aničku, ktorú veľmi miluje. Matka ukázala fotku Aničke a pýtala sa tej, čí starú mamu miluje? Anička ho- verí, že Ju veľmi núluje Matka sa jej pýta: "Ako môžeš starú mamu veľmi milovať, keď sl ju nikdy nevidela?” Anička hovorí: "Však vidíme jej fotku." Na to jej matka doloží: "Nuž vidíš, tak máš milovať aj Pána Bcha, ktorého verný obraz je Jeho Syn, Ježiš, ktorý nás veľmi miluje." Slovo Božie tejto nedele žiada, aby sme Pána Boba milovali celým svojím srdcom. Od zachovávania tohoto prikázania nás nikto nemôže oslobodiť. 1. Celým svojím srdcom. Keď člc.yek vyšiel z rúk svojho Stvoriteľa, nemusel sa pýtať, čl a ako ho ma milovať? Miloval ho svojím celým srdcom, lebo bo poznal a v jeho prítomnosti žil. Požíval nesmierne šťastie zatiaľ, kým svojou pýchou svojím Bohom a Pánom nepohrdol. Odvtedy človek hľadá a túži, aby ho zas mohol nehatene poznať a milovať. Veď milovať môžeme niekoho len tak, ak ho poznáme. čím lepšie niekoho poznáme, tým viac ho môžeme milovať. Cirkevní otcovia 2. vatikánskehe snemu, vo svojej konštitúcii o Cirkvi (40) nám hovoria, že jšetky tieto túžby nášho srdca sú splnené v Kristovi, že v ňom môžeme Boha zas milovať celým svojím srdcom. Cirkevní otcovia hovoria: “Ako Kristovi vyznavači, od Boha povolaní- a v Pánu Ježišovi ospravedlnení, nie podľa svojich skutkov, ale podľa jeho vôle a milosti, stali sme sa krstom viery naozaj dielkami Božími a účastnými Božej prirodzeností a teda tým stnesa^ltali svätými.“ V prvom čítaní tejto sv. omše (Dt 6. 2-6) sa hovorí o Časoch Mojžišových, kedy sa Izraeliti boli pozabudli a nemilovali Pána Boha, ako to od nich očakával. Pán im ich neveru neraz pripomína), posielal ku nim ororokev. ha vyhnal ich cj z vlastnej otčiny, len. aby sa svojím srdcom k nemu vrátili. Keď ich napokon zázračne vyviedol z Eeypta, Mojžiš im pripomína, že všetko, čo sa s nimi deje, že je z riadenia Božieho, aby sa poko. rill. Mojžiš im hovorí: "Nuž, počuj Izrael..., aby si robil to, čo ti Pán prikázal, abv ti bolo dobre ... Pán je náš Boh, Pán jediný! Miluj ho celým svojím srdcom, celou dušou a celou silou svo Jduí” V príbehu sv. evanjelia 12, 23b-34) čítame, že Kristus narazil na silný odpor Izaelitov. Postupom Času sl totiž k Prikázaniam Božím pridávali rôzne ľudské prikázania a nariadenia. V Kristových časoch ich mali okolo 613. Chybou ale bolo, že často nástojili viac na zachovávaní ľudských prikázaní, pri čom obchádzali Božie. Rôzne chrámové ceremónie prevádzali s tou najväčšou presnosťou, ale Pána oslavovali len Jazykom. Ich život bol ďaleko od toho, čo vyznávali. Nečudujme sa, že sa v čase Kristovom dohadovali, ktoré prikázania sú dôležitejšie a ktoré n». Otázku predložili aj Pánu Jažišovi. ktorý im povedal to, čo už Jeho Otec nebeský bol povedal Mojžišovi: “Počuj, Izrael, Pán je náš Boh, Pán jediný! A ty budeš milovať Pána, Boha svojho, celým svojím srdcom, celcu d’išou svojou a celou silou svojou.” A Pán Ježíš, v plnej svojej Božskej autorite, toto prikázanie doplnil, keď k nemu doložil: "A budeš milovať svojho blížneho, ako seba samého, čo je a mnoho viac, ako všetky zá- paľné obete.” Kto toto plní, povedal Ježiš; "Nie Je ďaleko od Kráľovstva Božieho.” 2. Od zachovávania tohto prikázania nás nikto nemôže oslobodiť. Pán Ježiš neraz zreteľne vyhlásil, že akékoľvek náboženstvo je zbytočné u Jeho Otca, ak nespočíva na týchto dvoch hlavných príkriwtTviHCh človek sa lob nesmie opovážiť rozdeľovať, alebo meniť za žiadnu cenu. Od toho, ako zachovávame tieto dve prikázania, bude závisieť, ä budeme vôbec spasení, čí nie. Pán Ježiš nám hovorí: "Ak ma njllulet^jachováyate.moje prikáMU nía.” (Jn 14,15) A na Inom mieste hovorí: "Ak budete zachovávať moje prikázania, zotrváte v mojej láske" (Jn 15.10) na veky1 Sv. Pavol nám v druhom Čítaní tejto sv. omše (Žid 7, 23-28) hovorí, že Pán Ježíš, za nastolenie tejto lásky, plynúcej z Prikázaní, horlil celý svoj život, Ba zato aj trpel, zomrel a vstal z mŕtvych. Tým sa Ježiš stal kňazom na veky: "preto môže spasiť všetkých ktorí skrze neho pristupujú k Bohu.” On nemusí najprv obetovať za .wba, ako iní kňazi. On Je: "Svätý, nevinný, nepoškvrnený.1’ On Je Boh lásky preto plným právom kladie prikázanie lásky k Bohu a k blížnemu, za najhlavnejšiu podmienku spasenia, od ktorého prikázania nás dlšpenzovať nikto nemôže. . V našich časoch mám^ tiež hodne tzv. moderných farizejov, ktorí majú "svoje názory na lásku”. Neraz hovoria. Že Pánom Bobom nepohrdli ale, lásku k Bohu a k blížnemu majú len na jazyku. Možno ešte milujú tých, čo Ich navzájom milujú, ale to dokážu aj hriešnici. Následky takéhoto nesprávneho chápania lásky sú tragické nielen pre jednotlivca, ale aj pre rodiny a pre celú ľudskú spoločnosť. Pre nedostatok ozajstnej lásky k Bohu a k blížnemu, sa svet varí v nepokojoch, rozkladajú sa manželstvá, nivočí sa manželské Šťastie, zástupy sirôt a nemanželských detí sa rozmnožuje, milióny nenarodených sú vražděné ulice sú preplnené cedením nevinnej krvi a triedne rozpory rozleptávajú celý svet... Koľko len sv, povolaní, kňazských a rehoľných sa rúca preto, že srdcia zvla*nejú a -r lásky k Bohu a blížnemu sl už nikto nič nerobí... I Svet dnes musí, stoj čo stoj, nastúpiť smer, ktorý mu dal Syn Boha živého, Ježiš Kristus, keď o sebe povedal: “Ja som cesta, pravda a život." (Jn 14, ň) Kto chce dôjsť pravého pokoja, osobného a spoločenského, tní-Že hc docieliť iba čistou láskou k Pôvodcovi všetkej lásky, k nebeskému Otcovi a Jeho Synovi Ježišovi. Ak sme boli pokrstení nielen vodou, ale aj Duchom Svätým, musíme kráčať cestou ktorú nám naznačil Ježíš, mu» sírne veriť, čo r Am v Cirkvi zanechal k vareniu a musíme žiť 8 nie duševne Živoriť, žiť, ako dletky Božie, určené pre neho. Ak -toto všetko chceme naozaj docieliť, pri sv. prijímaní nám Vzkriesený Spasiteľ aj dnes povie: “Milovať budeš Pána. Boha svojho, z celého srdca svojho .. " Prosme ho o ozajstný dar lásky k Bohu 1 k blížnemu, aby sme ho mohli naveky oslavovať medzispevom tejto sv. omše: "Milujem ťa, Pán, sila mo- VERÍM VO SVÄTÝCH OBCOVANIE "Radujte sa a veseľte, vaša odplata je hojná v nebesiach" (Mt 5,12) Chlapci sa po škole hrali na ulici.

Isteže to bola milá hra, ktorá nesie Hlboký yýznsm ... / 1. Verím vo svätým obcovanie. Na sviatok Všetkých svätých sme prišli pred trón Pána pánov a Kráľa kráľov, aby sme vo svojich srdciach prežívali hlboké tajomstvo, nekonečnú dobrotu nášho Boha a Pána. Tento sviatok nás nabáda, aby sme zdvihli svoje zaslzené oči a ustarostené tváre, aby sme trochu zabudli na svoje pozemské lopotení© a videli nebeské spoločenstvo Svätých a Svätíc, teda tých. Čo v láske Božej hrdinsky žili a zomreli. Toto tajomstvo Je pre nás tým radostnejšie, lebo vlastne ich nebeská radosť je už teraz aj naša radosť, ktorú ako diotky Božie už teraz na zemí s nimi prežívame. V láske dlefok Božích sme so svätými stále spojení, kým oni nám, svojim mocným príhovorom pomáhajú, aby $me sa na ceste života niekde nestratili. V prvom čítaní tejto sv. omše (Zj 7, 2-4: 9-14) nás Slovo Živého Boha uisťuje, že je to všetko tak, čo s celou Cirkvou dnes vyznávame, že v skutočnosti jestvuje "Svätých obcovanie” Sv. Ján apoštol mal totiž videnie neba, v ktorom videl nekonečnú oslavu, ktorá v nebi stále prebieha. Je to oslava nebeského Otca, ktorý nás stvoril a ktorý nás v nebi očakáva. Sv. Ján videl, ako od východu prišiel anjel, ktorý- niesol pečať živého Boha. Na východe totiž bola kolíska ľudstva, raj, kde Človek "pečaťou živého Boha" prvýkrát svojvoľne'pohrdol. Krvou Baránka Ježiša však bola táto Škvrna zmytá a húfy "blažených", čo od stvorenia svet čakali na svoju spásu, holi teraz predvedené pred tvár velebností Božej. Tešia sa zo spásy a prihovárajú sa 2a všetky pokolenia, teda, aj za nás. aby sme aj my boli spasení. Prirodzene sa pýtame, že ako aj my môžeme dôjsť blaže nostil, v ktorej už len budeme -pokračovať vo večnosti? Pán Ježiš nám dáva ns túto najvážnejšiu otázku nášho živote odpoveď v ringen nm sv. evanjeliu. (Mt 5, 1-12) Hovorí, že už teraz na ženú máme žiť životom dtetok Božích, za Božích nodmlenok. ktoré ak svedomité dodržíme, už teraz nás nazýva "Blaženými." Náš Pán nám hovorí, že* "Kráľovstvo Božie Je už teraz naše, ak sme chudobní duchom.” Pán Ježiš tu myslí tých, čo sa nedajú zotročiť ničím a nikým na «svete, čo za svoje najväčšie šťastie na svete pokladajú svoju úplnú dôveru v Pána Boha a svoju úplnú odvislosť od Neho. — V ostatných blahoslavenstvách Ježiš blahoslaví tých, čo našli ozajstné hodnoty života: žiť Bohu a pre Beáte. Lebo teM sú tichí a svojou Jemnosťou si podmania a) svoje prostredie; takí, čo .halia, nájdu posilu a potechu v Pánovi; ak lačnejú po spravodlivosti, budú ňou nasýtení; ak sú milosrdní, takým aj Pán dá svoje milosrdenstvo; ak si prechovávajú svoje srdcia čisté. Boh už teraz v nich prebýva; ak ich nespravodlivo prenasledujú, ich je rúl teraz kráľovstvo nebeské. — Tí, čo dl'a tohoto žijú, sú už teraz svätí, lebo svojim svätým životom obcujú a tými, čo sú už svätí v nebi. 2. žime tomuto svätému spoločenstvu, aby sme v ňom v nebi pokračovali. O mnohých blažených, čo sú už v nebi, kým ešte 11Ľ v tomto slzavom údolí, svet mnoho nevedel. Noviny o nich nepísali a televízne stanice o nich nehovorili. Mnohí z nich sa zriekli pozemskej slávy a vavřínových vencov, lebe prijali pozvanie Pána všetkých pánov: "Poďte a žite už teraz, aby ste žili na ve- Je pravda, náš tav. pokrokový svet, nemá pre myšlienku s svätosti žiadna porozumenia. Tí, čo Pánovým pozvaním pohrdli, 1 skladajú svoje nádeje v pominuteľný rozum, možno v pijatiku, v rôzne drogy (otravy) a pôžitky a neraz končia v krajnom zúfalstve. Ti, však, čo sa dali verne nasledovať Pána, skladajú , svoju všetku nádej v Jehc Lásku, ktorý nás každého jedného osobne miluje ako svoje dletky. Sv. Ján v druhom čítali tejto sv. omše (1 In 3, 1-3) v tejto myšEenke pokračuje a hovorí, že , ak sa už teraz snažíme žlť, akc. dletky Bcžle, že nám Pán Boh zaručuje, že "budeme podobní Jemu, lebo Ho uvidíme takého, aký Je”. Aby «me sa tejto nádejí zachovali” musíme sa denne stávať čistejšími a čistejšími, akc aj On Je čistý”. Cirkev svätá nám na tento sviatok odhaľuje zástupy nebeských svätých, Bby sme sa nadchli. Aby sme videli, že keď to oni mohli dokázať, že to aj my môžeme. A napokon, nebeskí svätí sú naše nebeské vzory a posila k nasledovaniu. Veď kým svätí žili na zemi, ani oni neboh anjeli, ale boli ľudia, ako sme aj my. Zažívali ťažkosti každodenného života, možno väčšie, ako my zažívame. Sv. Ján videl ich zástupy, že bili: "Z každého národa, kmeňa, ľudu, jazyka ... zástup, ktorý nikto nemohol spočítať: stáli pred trónom n Baránkom, boli oblečení v bielych rúchach a mali palmy v rukách... Prišli vraj z veľkého súženia a do biela sl oprali svoje rúcha v Krvi Baránkovej. Preto teraz stoja pred trónom Bo*im a slúžia mu dňom 1 nocou.” Pán Ježiš im bol všetko: posila, nádej 1 láska a preto Ho obsiahli. Zamerajme si svoj žlvc-t na Krista, ako to robili sváti a sväté Božie e dá aj nám záruku, že už teraz budeme začínať Ich spoločenstvo, ich blaženosť a pokoj. Kristus pri sv. prijímaní aj nás uisťuje, ako uisťoval blažených nebeských, keď ho prijímali: "Radujú.- sa a veseľte, lebo vaša odmena je hojná v nebesiach.'' Podrobme sa vôli Božej každý deň, aby aj z nás Ježit mohol vykresať Svätých a aby žalmista aj o nás mohol denne povedať- "Toto Je pokolenie, ktoré hľadá Tvoju tvár. Pane.” (2 24) Prasme svojho svätého Patróna, ktorého meno od narrdenla nosíme, aby nám pomohol Žiť v spoločenstve svätých, aby sme do nehu patrili každý deň. teraz í na veky!

Dievča hovorí: "Povie im, aby sa vzdialili do ohňa večného.” Potom aa všetkých pýtal. Že čo Pán Ježiš povie tým. čo neboli dosť dobrí, aby boli pripustení do neba, ale neboli ani tak zlí, aby boli večne zatratení?

OCTOBER 26. 1983 Page 19 * 4 SLOVO BOŽIE Ukončenie Mariánskeho roku v Torontě Posviacka mozaiky v Unionville, Ontario Dokončenie z 18. strany budeme verní Bohu, že-nás očakáva večný život a nie večná smrť. Nuž tak žhne, aby sme obsiahli život večný. 1. Pre verných život večný. Možno nikdy necítime skutočný zmysel pravdy, "že sme sa nato narodili, aby sme raz zomreli", ako práve na Dušičky. Co ako by sme ša pokúšali tejto skutočnosti vyhnúť, nikto z narodených ju obísť nemôže. Pohania všetkých vekov, včítane našich sa sami seba presviedčajú, že smrťou sa konči všetko. Robia to, lebo neveria v Boha. O tom, ta aj ich očakáva a chce loh odmeniť životom večným, keby sa pravda pokorili, nechcú ani počuť. Radšej sd volia žiť v strachu a zomrieť v zúfalstve. Pisateľ knihy Múdrosti, z ktorej stať čítame v prvom čítaní tejto sv. omše (Múd 3,19) a osvietenia Božieho nám hovorí, že veriaci človek sa nemusí vůbec báť myšlienky na smrť. Pisateľ tejto knihy povzbudzuje Izraelitov, aby sa vo viere v Pána upevňovali. Hovorí, že len viera v Boha dáva zmysel pozemskému životu a zaisťuje nádej pre blaženú večnosť. Hovorí: "Duše spravodlivých sú v rukách Božích, ruka sa ich nedotkne," Ak Ich aj niečo zastihne: “Po nedlhej dobe trestu príjmu veľké dobrodenie, pretože ich skúšal Boh a zistil, že sú hodní... zľutovanie sa im dostane ako vyvoleným. Len nemúdri pokladajú smrť za nešťastie, pre verných je ale život večný, radosť bez konca, lebo došli domov, k Otcovi na veky. V príbehu dnešného sv. evanjelia (Jn 11, 32-45) Pán Ježiš, Syn Boha živého, kriesi bohabojného Lazára. Lazár a jeho dve sestry, Mária a Marta, boli blízky priatelia Pána. Chcete sa pýtať, že keď Ich tak miloval, prečo potom nechal Lazára zomrieť a prečo Jeho sestry neušetril od toľkého žiaľu? Náš Pán mal nato veľmi vážny dôvod. Lazára nechal zomrieť, aby ho potom mohol vzkriesiť a tak vyjaviť svoju Božskú moc, že On Je vlastoe Vzkriesenie a život a ta všetci, čo v neho uveria a dľa viery žijú “uvidia slávu Božiu”. Pán Ježiš, ktorý má moc nad životom a smrťou, nám môže nielen večný život sľúbiť, ale ho aj dať, ak ho úprimne milujeme do konca. 2. Tak teda žime, aby sme obsiahli život večný! Jesenná přírod?., ba aj tí. čo nás predišli do večnosti, nám hovoria, že ani my tu na veky nebudeme. Jedného dňa. Ten. ktorý si nás stvoril, sl nás povolá, aby sme s Ním žili a radovali sa na veky. Zo svojej skúsenosti ale vieme, že sme vždy nežili, tak ako to Pán od nás očakával. Preto, aby sme pred Neho, Najsvätejšieho mohli predstúpiť, musíme byť tiež svätí, očistení. Sv. Pavol nám v druhom čítaní tejto sv. omše (Rim 5, 5-11) hovorí, ta zárodok života večného nám bol daný pri sv. krste. Ťažký hriech ale v nás tento život znivočí. V ťažkom hriechu sme nemali ani náde| spasenia. Ježíš ale, svojím vykupiteľským dielom, svojou prehorkou smrťou a zmŕtvychvstaním, nám našu nádej zas obnovil. Sv. Pavol hovorí, že teraz sa zas: "Božia láska prelieva v našich srdciach skrze Ducha Svátého, ktorý nám Je daný " A to tým viac, ta Kristus zomrel ža nás vtedy, keď sme ešte boli Jeho nepriatelia, ako hriešnici. Už v biblických časoch sa Izraeliti medlili za zomrelých (2 Mach 12, 43-46), lebo verili, že tí zomrelí, čo nebolí dosť óis tí pre nebo, alebo sl neraaluhovall peklo, že môžu byť očistení. Modlili sa za nich, postili a prinášaj zvláštne obete za ich oils tu. Cirkev katolícka v tomto zvyku pokračuje. Robí to o mno ho dokonalejším spôsobom. Za takých zomrelých sa nielen modlí, ale za nich obetuje pri sv. omši Vzkriesené Telo a Krv Kristovu. Na Ňom sú oslávené rany, ktoré aj za nich obetoval. Veriace srdce nájde v tejto náuke iste mnoho potechy a nádeje. Vzkriesený Spasiteľ sí nás očisťuje pri sviatosti zmierenia, v ktorej nám On sám osobne hriechy odpúšťa. Od Iných nedokonalostí si nás očisťuje aj, keď ku nám hovorí vo Svätom písme a v homíllach, ktoré nám Slovo Bože ohlasujú alebo, keď sa za nás iní modlia. Je veľmi důležité, aby sme Vzkrieseného Spasiteľa vždy stretali e počúvali v živej viere a v pokore srdca. Ježiš je náš všemohúci prostredník u nášho nebeského Otca, ktorému nikto neni milší, ako Jeho vlastný Syn, Ježiš. Preto je aj sv omša, v ktorej sa Syn Boží neustále obetuje svojmu Otcovi za spásu sveta, najúčinnejšia pomoc dušiam, ktoré sa vo ve& nosti ešte musia očisťovať, aby mohli požívať Pokoj a radosť v nebi. Pri sv. prijímaní nás Vzkriesený Spasiteľ aj dnes uisťuje, ta: "Uvidíme slávu Božiu, ak budeme veriť" & dľa vierf aj skutočne žlť. Prosme ho. aby nám pomohol, že by naša viera stále vzrastala a prosme ho aj za duše, ktoré ešte potrebujú vo večnosti očistu. Modlime sa za nich taste: Odpočinutie večné daj im, ó, Pane — a Svetlo večné nech im svMl! — Nech odpočívajú v Pokoji. — Skrze Kriste, Pána nášho! Amen.

Gregus tajomník-pokladTĽÍk Noví Blahoslavení V nedeľu 25. septembra Svätý Otec vyhlásil šesť nových blahoslavených, O mexickom Jezuitovi, mučeníkovi Michalovi Pro-ovi sme vás už informovali. Teraz vám prinášame krátke životopisy ďalších. "Všetci v Cirkvi majú účasť mocou krstu na poslaní Krista, veľkého proroka — začal svoju homíliu Svätý Otec. — Táto účasť na prorockom poslaní sa osobitne prejavuje v živote svätých... FREDERIC JANSSOONE BOLLENC-LER, francúzsky františkánsky misionár vo Svätej zemi a v Kanad?, pochádzal z maloroľníckej rodiny, z dedinky Ghyvelde, kde sa narodil roku 1839. Po otcovej smrti na 7 rokov prerušil štúdiá, aby pomáhal rodine- Akp 26-ročný vstúpil do františkánskeho noviciátu v Amien- se. Po štúdiách roku 1870 bol vysvätený za kňaza. Roku 1876 sa splnila Jeho túžba pracovať vo Svätej zemi. Tam za 12 rokov organizoval púte a staral sa o pútnikov. (On začal povestnú krížovú cestu po Jeruzalemských uliciach.) Potom sa vrátil na krátky tas do Francúzska. Roku 1888 odišiel do Kanady do mesta Quebeku, kde horlivo pracoval na rozvoji mariánskej úcty. Za 14 rokov tni správcom pútnického miesta Cap-de la Madeleine, ľudovým misionárom a autorom náboženských spisov. Vynikal láskou voči chudobným a trpiacim a zaslúžil si názov "druhý František asslský”. JUNIPERO JOSE SERRA FERRER bol ďalším františkánskym misionárom, ktorý priniesol Kristovo evanjelium na ú- zemle dnešného Mexika a Kalifornie. Pochádzal zo španielskeho meste Pedra na ostrove Majorka. Po úspešných štúdiách bol profesorom na univerzite Palma de Mollorca. Rád sa zriekol vedeckej kariéry a prijal od predstavených poverenie pracovať ako misionár v Amerike. Najprv vychovával rehoľných novicov a potom sa s nadšením pustil do misionárskej práce v Kalifornii, kde založil 9 misií. S osobitnou starostlivosťou a láskou sa venoval domorodým Indiánom a bránil ich práva. Vynikal aj v mariánskej úcte. Zomrel v misii Karmel v Monterrey 28. augusta 1784. Dňa 7. augusta. 1988 do 2000 Slovákov a hosti prišlo za horúceho slnečného počasia do katedrálneho sídla Slovenského gréckokatolíckeho biskupstva v Kanade, aby boli svedkami nielen zakončenia Mariánskeho roku, ale najmä posviacky veľkolepej mozaiky Preav. Bohorodičky. Keďže katedrála je zasvätená tajomstvu Premenenia Pána, sviatok ktorého si väetd katolíci každoročne pripomínajú dňa 6. augusta, uskutočnili aa aj výročité odpustové slávnosti miestnej farnosti ako takej. Slávnostnú pontifíkáLau Bohoslužbu celebroval v spodnej hale katedrály Najd. O. biskup Michal Rusnak v prítomnosti O. biskupa ukrajinských katolíkov Izidora Boreckého. Liturgia sa niesla v znamení oelo- cirkevného významu, lebo v tomto mesiaci sa skončil mimoriadny Mariánsky rok, ktorý vyhlásil Sv. Otec minulého leta na sviatok Zoslania Sv. Ducha. Po vzájomnej dohode teda pri oltári sa zišli slovenskí i hosťujúci kňazi oboch obradov, latinského i gréckeho, aby spoločnou oltárnou obetou vďaky- vzdávall za ten milostiplný Mariánsky rok- Videli eme medzi nimi Najd. slovenských otcov jezuitov J .Javorku, J. Moravského, F. Litvu, V. Danča. S. Smržfka, R. Ondruša; fran- tiSkána-ntínuritu o. K. CverQta so spolubratra!; a gréckokatolíckych kňazov o. J. Perejdu, CSeR, diecéznych kňazov otcov J. Papulaya, J. Leäa,SJ, L. Šamana, mladého nádejného o. Cyrila VaaiTa z Ríma a gréckokatolíckeho bohoslovca^ Študujúceho v Ríme, Igora Zdravec- kého. Počas slávnostných Bohoslužieb spieval katedrálny spevokol pod vedením pani Mariky Oláhovej. Po ekončení liturgie sa pohol do katedrály sprievod prítomných veriacich, ns čele ktorého išli matky, manželky, ženy, sestry a dievčatá, akoby symbolické ochrankyne slovenského rodu a aby spolu s ostatnými mohli x-ždať vďaku Najsv. Matke Božej za jej neprestajnú ochranu v búrkach dejín alko aj za jej sprostredkovanie pomoci medzi svojím Synom Ježišom Kristom a nami. Krátky obrad posviacky mozaiky uskutočnil o. biskup M. Rusnak. Po ňom všetci prítomní kňazi požehnali ikonu svätenou vodou a nakoniec o. biskup L Borecký uzavrel svojou modlitbou tento slávnostný akt. Komornú hudbu v katedrá. le ako aj spevokol slovenskej rímskokatolíckej farnosti sv. Cyrila a Metoda v Torontě riaKARD1NÄL GIUSEPPE BFNEDTTTO DUSMET pochádzal z mesta Palerma. Tam sa narodil 15 augusta 1813. Od malička vyrastal v benedlktínskom klľJtcre svätého Martina delle Scale, kde si urobil noviciát a zložil rehoľné sľuby. Roku 1842 bol vysvätený za kňaza. Viac rekov vykonával apoštolát mimo kláštora. Roku 1858 bol zvolený za cpáta kláštora sv. Mikuláša v Ka- tánii. V tom tase horlivo pracoval na reforme mníšskeho života. Roku 1867 bol vymenovaný za arcibiskupa v Katánli. Za 27 rokov rozvíjal svoje mimoriadne pastoračné schopnosti zvlášť v tase veľkých prírodných nešťastí: cez vypuknutie cholery, počas výbuchu sopky Etny, cez tri strašné zemetrasenia, záplavy, atď. Veľkú pozornosť venoval výchove kňazov. V pastorácii vedel múdro spojiť prísnosť s miernosťou a sám dával dobrý príklad svojím horlivým a bezúhodným životom. Vždy bránil práva Cirkvi a zastával sa aj Jednotlivých veriacich. Bol skutočne dobrým pastierom. Na žiadosť pápeža Leva XHT. založil benediktinsko kolégium sv. Anzelma na Aventin? v Ríme roku 1888. Na Vianoce toho istého roku hol vymenovaný za kardinála. Zomrel v Chýre svlitost! v Katánil 4. apríla 1894» Odvtedy k jeho hrobu v katárisltej katedrále putujú zástupy veria- cích. FRANCESCO FAA DI BRUNO pochádzal z piemontskej Alexandrie, kde sa narodil 2D. marca 1825. študoval v kolégiu sv. Juraja, ktoré spravovali rehoľníci zvaní "SomaschT. Tam dostal dobrú kresťanskú výchovu. Ako 15-ročný vstúpil do Kráľovskej vojenskej akadémie v Turíne, z ktorej vyšiel ako dôstojník. Neskoršie dostal hodnosť kapitána a bol v službe vojvodcu Vittoria Emanuela Savojskŕho. Pohyboval sa v salónoch vysokej talianskej spoločnosti n neúnavne podporoval dialóg Cirkvi s talianskym štátom. Dner sa pokladá za predchodcu obrany ženských práv v spoločnosti. Osobne sa totiž zaujímal o osudy mladých dievčat, ktoré prichádzali z vidieka do miest a pracovali ako služobné v mestských rodinách. Pre ženy a dievčatá z ulice zriadil výchovný ústav. Bol mužom pevných zásad, ale v každodennom živote a v dialógu s tými, čo boli "ďaleko” od Cirkvi, prejavoval nezvyčajnú citlivosť a taktnosť. V Turíne dosiahol od mestskej správy lacné stravovanie, "mensu" pre robotníkov, čo vtedy v Taliansku bolo veľkou novinkou. Roku 1851 náhle sa vzdal vojenskej kariéry a chcel sa stať kňazom. Prišiel do Ríma, za pontifikátu Pla IX.. ktorý ho dal za tri mesiace, bez pobytu v seminári, vysvätiť za kňaza. Zomrel v Turíne. Je vzorom a príkladom tak laikov ako i kňazov. JOSEFA NAVAL GIRBES pochádzala z dobrej španielskej kresťanskej rodiny z Algemesi. Keď mala 13 rokov, zomrelá jej matka, takže sa musela starať o domácnosť. Horlivo navštevovala miestnu školu, ktorú založil kňaz Gašpar Silvestre pre dievčatá. Učili sa tam vyšívať i iné domáce práce, škola však vynikala aj dobrou duchovnou výchovou, Jozefa sa v tomto kresťanskom prostredí dopracovala k opravdivej svätosti. Duchovne sa živila častou modlitbou a veľkou úctou k Eucharistii a k Panne Márii. Zomrela 24. februára 1893. Je pochovaná v bazilike sv. Jakuba v rodnom meste Algemesí Bola aj karmelitánskou terciárkou. "Curriculum vitae" našich nových blahoslavených — končil Svätý Otec — oplýva ťažkými chvíľami až do tej miery, že po ľudsky hovoriac, to bolo priam deprimujúce Ale aj napriek tomu sú svedkami veľkej duchovnej radosti. Nachádzajú radosť v Božích prikázaniach, v Pánovom zákone, žalmista ohlasuje, íe Pánov zákon oosllňuje dušu. To je naozaj pravda, človek nachádza vnútornú silu ducha a radosť srdca v tom. čo je správne, čo sa zhoduje s pravdou. Cesta k svätosti je vždy cesta "posvätenia v pravde". Budúce porady v Poľsku? Varšava — Dražoba v Polsku vyvolala veľké robotnícke štrajky v apríli a potom i v auguste t.r., čo sa potom zakončilo tak, že terajšia poľská vláda a robotnícky vodca Walesa sa dohodli, že je potrebné, aby sa konala porada početnejších odborníkov v októbri t.r., na ktorej sa má rokovat aj o uzákonení Solidarity. Medzitým sa stalo, že poľský parlament schválil vzdanie sa celej vlády po 12-hodinovej debate. Za vzdanie sa hlasovalo 359 poslancov a proti len jeden. 17 sa zdražilo hlasovania. Nezávislý poslanec Richard Bender povedal v parlamente, že Solidarita mala by znova zaujať pravé miesto v odborovom hnutí. ••Okrem združení, okrem Solidarity tiež je potrebné mať nové politické strany," povedal nezávislý poslanec z Lubline. A zároveň urgoval generála Jaruzelského a Walesu, aby sa stretli a vydali spoločné vyhlásenie. Jaruzelski sa trocha usmial, ale neodpovedal. [pageend19]Faße 20 JEDNOTA, WEDNESDAY.
