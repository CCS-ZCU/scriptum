"As a European, I'm a Westerner - and I suy this to those Slavophiles who see in Russia and the Slavic spirit something that goes beyond Europe. The best Russians were also Westerners." T. G. Masaryk, founder of ¡he Czechoslovak Republic and it's first President Three years ago, a bi-monthly magazine called Zapad (The West), a cultural and political journal aimed at Canadian citizens of Czech and Slovak origin began appearing in Canada and in forty other countries, In that short length of time, the maga- zine has gained enough subscribers to ensure its future. Now. Zapad is happy to be able to issue this spcciai number in English, presenting a se- lection of articles from Zapad over the past three years on the 10th anni- versary of the Canadian govern- ment's official multicultural policy. Why an English issue of Zapad? In its multicultural program, the Canadian government supports what is called ethnic activity, which is in- tended to preserve the traits of the cultures with which Canadians of non-French and non-English origins came to this country. This policy is supposed to differentiate Canada from the American melting pot, that produces a uniform type of American with only his name to remind him of his forefathers. It is certainly a noble aim, and thanks to government sup- port, a great deal of good has been done in the field of ethnic cultures. Unfortunately the policies have also had an unplanned side-effect. City girls, dressed in approximations of national costumes that have been paid for by the Ministry of Multi- culturalism, and dancing imitations of dances long-since dead in the old country except in professional troupes who cultivate them chiefly for export, have fixed in the minds of Anglo- Saxon and francophone Canadians the image of "ethnics" as colour- ful rural folk from the backwaters of Europe who drink a lot of beer, dress up in something like theatrical costumes on Sundays, dance de- rivative cossack dances, hold ban- quets redolent of garlic and speak doubtful English in a colourful range of accents that arc always bad. As for those New Canadians who have come to this country not pri- marily for the material advantages it offers but because democracy was destroyed in their former homeland, the image approximates reality only on the last point, and even that is true only of those who came to this country as adults, for their children are notorious for bringing home "A"s in English from school. All the other details are like Hollywood stereotypes, corresponding only to the reality of a hundred years ago. That is why we are putting out this anthology of articles from Zapad, so that our fellow-Canadians may see with their own eyes that Czech and Slovak "ethnics" are concerned with the preservation of a different national heritage than pork-and- dumpling feasts or choral renditions of feudal folk songs. The fact is, however - and as al- ways, the facts tend toward absurdity - that the Ministry of Multicultural- ism makes grants available for ethnic pork-and-dumpling feasts, while un- fortunately they have no provision for supporting ethnic publishing houses, for example. May this issue of Zapad, therefore, be a portent that in the future, there will fewer pseudo-folk costumes in Canada, and more books written in languages other than French or English. For books, far more than gastronómica! oddities, are the real basis of the cultural heritage of ethnic Canadians. The editorial board »/'Západ (The West) in a meeting, 1 [pageend3]Canada Canadian Contradictions bv Richard Drtina Immigrants are a marvellous in- vestment for this country. They are the salt and pepper of Canada, of the country's life and work, and not merely ornamental aspects of the ethnic mosaic, those exotic but isolated anniversaries and carnivals, or the folklore of national costumes and painted easter-eggs. For an im- migrant, the optimum stale is one of active integration, and this means, for example, not allowing one's culture to be dissolved in television commercials and the programs that fill the spaces between them. It is not passive assimilation with any- thing whatever. I am thinking rather of the immigrant who maintains a sharp awareness of his identity (and also the ability, desire and the will to read books in both the old and the new languages) and for whom a decent standard of living means more than merely a way to enjoy a comfort- able softening of the brain. Canada is still one of that hand- ful of countries that are relatively happy and rich. Nevertheless it does have its contradictions and some arc serious enough to warrant careful examination. Relations between English and French Canada are still a problem, and they derive from the origins of a country founded by two rival co- lonial powers. Related to this are the attempts of Quebec, which is pre- dominantly French-speaking, to separate, or at least to gain greater autonomy. Another conflict is the autonomism of the majority of the provincial governments acting against the centralism of the federal government of Prime Minister Trudeau and his Liberal party. This plays into the hands of the separatist tendencies in Quebec, although that province might well be satisfied with greater autonomy. It also explains the resistance most provincial govern- ments have offered to Trudcau's new constitutional package, and in particular, their fear of a loss of provincial powers. A constitutional crisis is therefore a real possibility. Quebec is even considering calling new elections on the issue of "sover- eignty-association", although the question has already been defeated in a referendum. Another problem is relations be- tween the rich (Western) and the poor (Eastern) provinces. For most of the rest of the world, it must have seemed odd indeed when Alberta's premier cut back oil exports to the rest of the country until an agree- ment on profit-sharing favourable to Alberta was reached with the federal government. Obviously, the d e m o c r a t i c a l l y d e c e n t r a l i z e d Canadian federation reaches de- cisions by consensus, not by direct- ives. Canadian oil prices, which have so far been relatively cheap, are expected to double in the next live years, although they are not to go beyond 85% of worid prices. Another economic problem is Canada's relations with the USA. What were once considered ad- vantageous investments have now become a problem of foreign owner- ship, which stands at 50%. In an era of economic recession, the branch- plant nature of production is a dis- advantage in that Canadian plants are the first to be shut down, thus creating higher unemployment in Canada than in the USA. On the a disadvantage in that Canadian plants are the first lo be shut down, thus creating higher unemployment in Canada than in the USA. On the other hand, the efforts of the Cana- dian government and Canadian corporations to buy companies back from foreign owners has caused a sudden drain of huge amounts of capital and thus the Canadian dollar has dropped in value. Following the USA, Canada has also introduced monetarism and is attempting to push back inflation by high interest rates. Nor can environmental problems be ignored. "Acid rain" as it is called (rain that is in fact a weak form of sulphuric acid) is caused by air-borne waste from industrial regions. It has already "killed" about 4,000 lakes. Canada has been asking the USA to do something about it for several years now, and there is some hope that the USA may improve its record. While Prime Minister Trudeau has for some time now concentrated his efforts in domestic politics on the new constitution, he has raised only a single issue in foreign policy: the North-South dialogue. It cannot be denied that ignoring the problems of the poor countries of the Third World could lead to a dangerous explosion in the near future. Willi its humani- tarian foreign aid, Canada has es- tablished a good reputation for itself in these countries. Given the com- plexities of foreign policy, however, it is hardly corrcct to concentrate all efforts on a single project. The Canadian contribution to NATO is today criticized as in- adequate. Apart from a small number of well-trained professional soldiers, young Canadian men have practical- ly no experience in military training. Canada is also behind in the field of armaments. Liberal Government In the near future, the Liberal party will have to find a new leader. Prime Minister Trudeau is preparing to retire. His new stylish house in Montreal is ready for occupancy. Before leaving the scene, however, he wants to complete two large projects: the constitution, and North- South cooperation. According to Liberal parly tradition, the new leader should be someone from English-speaking Canada. It is uncertain whether Minister for Multiculturalism \ Jim Fleming 2 [pageend4]Signing the agreements on sponsoring and assisting refugees from Czechoslovakia are the Canadian Minister of Immigration Llo vd Axworthy (left) and President of the Czechoslovak National Association of Canada. Jiří Corn. The agreement n oj signed June lOt/i 1980. John Turner will return to the scene. As last summer's by-elections in- dicated, the Liberals are losing in popularity. The economy, inflation (around 13%), high interest and mortgage rates (around 20%) and on top of it all, the passive wait-and-see altitude of the Liberal government, have all taken their toll. Although unemployment is now the lowest it has been in the last five years (less than 8%) and though the Canadian dollar has gained against European currencies by 25%, the Liberal party's popularity has dropped from 44% at the last elections in February, 1980, to 42% in the fall of 1981.11 has yet to be seen whether this decline will lead to any sudden concessions and a softening of the centralist liberal line with regard to provincial autonomy. The Opposition After a brief period as the minority government, the main opposition party the Progressive Conservatives lost the election of February, 1980, in which they polled 32% of the popu- lar vote, Since then, their popularity has risen to 39% in fall 198L At the same time, the question of party leader Joe Clark's competence has been raised both publically and behind the scenes. New candidates are on the horizon, and the question of leadership will have to be settled sooner or later. The New Democratic Party, which is in effect a social democratic party, does not enjoy large popular sup- port. Party leader Ed Broadbent supports the government position on the constitution, chiefly because of the Charter of Human Rights. Other aspects of its program are'di- fused with a left-wing pacifism. The N D P rejects Canadian participation in NATO (whereas the head of the Italian Communist Party - thanks to his European experience - has ap- proved of Italy's NATO member- ship). According to the latest polls, the popularity of the N D P has de- clined from 20% to 16%. This could also have something to do with the party's connections with the large trade unions. Strikes Paradoxically, Canada is one of the top-striking nations of the world. There are few radicals here and com- munist parties of various types get less than 1% of the popular vote. Most strikes, however, are economic- ally motivated, and are not part of a plan to usher in the dictatorship of the proletariat. In the USA, where there are far fewer strikes, the method of neutral arbitration is used; in Canada, so- called collective bargaining is the rule. This usually leads to a belated working out of collective agreements and to strikes being used as pressure tactics. It is worth mentioning that in Canada, 38% of all employees are unionized, whereas in the USA, less than 25% are. The right to strike, of course, must be respected in a democracy that wishes to remain a democracy. Un- fortunately, many strikes undermine democracy as well. Frequently, the victims are ordinary citizens. Illegal strikes are also on the increase. On one coast, policemen strike and teen- agers loot the shops; on the other coast, the garbage piles up because the garbage men have struck. Some- times even the most minor incident is used as a pretext to create false solidarity: for instance, a two-day illegal strike of bus-drivers in Mont- real was precipitated by an argument between a driver and a garage at- tendant over who should close the bus windows. Most strikes are local and so the country can absorb them with rela- tively few disruptions. Nevertheless they do disturb economic and social relationships. Statistics show that the number of strikes is increasing. From 1965-69, an average of 4.9 mil- lion work-days per year were lost to strikes. In 1975 to 1979, that average had increased to 6.2 million per year. And in 1980, it was 8.9 million. In the 1975-79 period, Canada was even ahead of Italy and Great Britain. Inflation will probably remain a chronic problem in the next few years. According to statistics, the increase in prices and the cost of living has caused a relative decrease in the income of working Canadians of more than 11% per annum since 1976. Inflation has a negative effect chiefly on pensions and the situations of the weaker groups who cannot win higher wages by striking, although the minimum wage is now almost $4.00 per hour. Democracy, as de Tocqueville once wrote, requires a degree of res- ponsibility, civic self-discipline and ethics in which the freedoms and rights won do not degenerate into an individualistic quest for personal gain at the expense of others. The Constitution Until now, the British North America Act has served as the Canadian Constitution. At the birth of Canada in 1867, the Fathers of Confederation drew up a document about the voluntary addition of provinces to the new entity, and this "consensus" of the provinces became the cornerstone of the Canadian con- federation, It allowed a decentralized democratic federation with wide pro- vincial powers. On the other hand, it also became a stumbling block for constitutional reform, since full agreement among the provinces was not always possible to achieve. After a number of conferences and 3 [pageend5]rather unsuccessful negotiations, Trudeau and the federal Liberal government decided to change the old BNA act and give Canada a much-needed new constitution. The constitutional debate centred around three questions: L the so-called "amending formula", which es- tablishes that amendments to the constitution can be made with the agreement of a certain combination of the provinces and the federal Parliament. 2. The Charter of Human Rights, that will legally guarantee a whole series of important rights for the entire country, includ- ing the right to use the official Cana- dian languages. This is important for both Anglophones in Quebec and Francophones living outside Quebec. 3. Patriation, or "bringing the consti- tution home", which requires the British parliament - the only body now that can legally decide on the BNA Act - to pass a law making the BNA Act a part of the Canadian Constitution and also empowering Canada to amend the constitution itself. Thus Canada, both formally and in practice, will rid itself of the a- nachronistic relics of the colonial era and achieve full constitutional in- dependence. In November 1981, the provinces and the Federal government finally came to a compromise over the a- mending formula and certain contro- versial clauses in the Charter of Human Rights having to do with native people's rights and other fundamental freedoms. The consti- tutional package was passed through Parliament and sent to Great Britain for final approval. Unfortunately, the Quebec legislature rejected the compromise, thus assuring further conllicts with the Federal govern- ment. Quebec The predominantly francophone province of Quebec remains the sword of Damocles over the Canadian scene. More than five million French Canadians - or rather francophone Quebcois - have no sentimental ties with France, who utterly abandoned them after losing the war with Eng- land in 1759. If the French Canadian has any inclinations towards national- ism or autonomy, he considers him- self first and foremost a citizen of Quebec. The Parti Québecois - a social democratic party striving for Quebec's independence - came to power in 4 1976. It tried to confront the difficult role of governing, which was compli- cated by the economic problems it faced. To avoid pushing the citizens of Quebec too rapidly, and so as not to appear too eager to set out into the uncertain waters of a separated state, the leadership of the party concocted a modified route to in- dependence of the more gradual type. They called it "sovereignty-associ- ation", which would mean complete political autonomy and fiscal sover- eignty on the one hand, and an as- sociation with Canada on the other in the realm of customs and tariff agreements and mainly in the use of a common currency, A referendum was held in May, 19K0, on this issue and the separatists were defeated. The Quebec voter decided against "sovereignty-association" by 60% to 40%. After subtracting the Anglo- phone vote (including most im- migrants), of which there are more than 1,000,000, it was shown that a good half of the francophone Québéc- ois voters rejected the notion of sovereignty-association. After its defeat in the referendum, it was also expected that the Parti Québécois would lose the next provincial election scheduled for April, 1981, particularly when the Liberals won all the post-referendum byelections. The Parti Québécois went into the elections with the s l o g a n " G o o d G o v e r n m e n t " , promising that if elected, it would not present another referendum on sovereignty in its next term of office, and that it would stop talking about separation for good. (This even led to accusations of betrayal, and several radical independentists left the party.) In addition, the party pro- mised more social legislation (family allowances, maternal leaves). The Liberals, on the other hand, did not choose the most appropriate electoral strategy. Their campaign was a clumsy imitation of the Parti Québécois' promises of social bonuses and, moreover, they were badly organized. Claude Ryan, the new party chief, and a devoted Catholic, proved an authoritarian leader and tried to run everything personally. His platform style, more- over, was unattractive. The Parti Québécois won 80 seats and the Liberals only 42. In terms of the popular vote, however, the two parties were close, with the P.Q. taking 49% and the Liberals 46%. Ryan's position as Liberal leader in Quebec has been shaken. On the question of the new constitution. Ryan adopted a negative position that is de facto identical with that of the separatists. Ryan, however, is not for lull separation. By emphasizing greater autonomy for Quebec, he has gained favour with francophone voters and this, on the contrary, may help to break the back of separatism. In any case, a number of other provincial governments. Alberta in particular, entirely support this line. So far, this has resulted in a split within the Liberal party in Quebec. The federal Liberals and Trudeau have always had their greatest sup- port from the Quebec voters, (The Progressive Conservatives only won a single seat in Quebec in the last federal election.) Ryan has not even opposed Bill 101 on language, the aim of which is the "francophonization" of Quebec and the rejection of official bilingual- ism, which is seen as a threat to the existence of French on an English- speaking continent. Thus Ryan has antagonized the English-speaking minority, which until that time had been the chief supporters of the provincial liberals. Ryan, however, is trying to gain support from the francophones, who are in the majority and will decide the next elections. The problem is that minority rights are also a part of democracy. The English-speaking minority in Quebec has its own schools, uni- versities, newspapers and theatres, but their growth is severely limited, and Bill 101 is the main instrument of this limitation, along with drastic cut- backs in government support for English-speaking universities, for example. According to the provisions of the Bill, only the children of parents who attended English language public attended English language public schools in Quebec (or whose siblings were enrolled in such schools before 1977) can go to English language schools. This means that Anglo- Canadians from outside Quebec have to send their children to French schools, as do immigrants, of course. Moreover, all signs must be in French, It is worth mentioning that more than 50% of the francophone Quebeckers feel this measure is too harsh. And in Montreal, two thirds of the population is for the preservat- ion of bilingualism. The new class of entrepreneurs in Quebec does not see independence as such an important value. The English minority, which formerly dominated the business life of Montreal, have lost their positions and arc on the decline. Montreal, though it is still a cosmo- [pageend6]A Conversation with Peter C. Newman poliian metropolis, is returning to a new period of growth after the pre- referendum stagnation. According to polls, only about 25% of Qucbeckcrs arc for separat- ion, whereas the number of positive responses to the question of "sover- eignty-association" has risen from 42% to 59%. In a new document, the Parti Québécois declared its intent- ions to link the question of "sover- eignty-association" to the next pro- vincial elections in 1985. Thus the evolution of the "French question" continues. In a democratic system, every nation has the right to realize its own values. The right to self-determi- nation and autonomy is respected as something quite legitimate. Al- though it is an objective fact that larger integrated wholes are econom- ically and often politically more viable, national values and interests are not usually based on such object- ive calculations. National aims can be placed higher than affluence. Different nations go through this development at different limes and with different specific problems. Czechs and Slovaks know this very well from their own history. For a Quebecker, it is naturally satisfying to know thai his own language has at last become the first language of his home province. The degree of autonomy and national security can satisfy him to the extent that he will reject separation. That is one possible outcome. Trudeau's efforts at unification and the idea of the Canadian state have their merits, bul it would seem that to most members of the Canadian federation the decentralized con- ception of autonomous provinces are more appealing. This solution also has a greater chance of preserving the integrity of Canada. The near future will show which of these concepts will triumph.

SIXTY-EIGHT PUBLISHERS CORPORATION is a non-profit organisation publishing hooks by Czech and Slovak writers abroad and by writers living in Czechoslovakia who are not allowed to publish their books in their own country. 68 Publishers, Corp., Box 695, Station A, Toronto, On., Canada M5W 1C.2 Peter Newman is the editor-in-chief of the Canadian weekly news-magazine Maclean's, and also the author of many political books. Since 1975, he has published three bestsellers: The Canadian Establishment, The Bronf- man Dynasty and The Acquisitors. They are detailed portraits of the people, families and clans with the greatest political and economic power in Canada. Peter Newman spent the first ten years of his life in Czechoslovakia. Since he is an extremely hardworking man. it was difficult to find time for an extended interview. Nevertheless, arrangements were made and the con- versation took place in his seventh- floor office in the Maclean-Hunter building on University Avenue, Toronto. The editor-in-chief strode briskly into his office and said. "I understand Czech but I don't speak it myself any longer." Then he sat down at his desk with his inevitable pipe, a pouch of Amphora and nine urgent messages. Peter Newman was interviewed for Západ by Václav Táborský. Západ: Were you born in Czecho- slovakia? Newman: No, I was born in Vienna because my mother was there on a visit at the time, but our family lived in Břeclav. My father owned a sugar refinery there. He came from Rakov- ník, and my mother from Olomouc. Západ: I low long did you live in Břec- lav? Newman: 1 was born in 1929. in June, 1938, when the problems with the Sudeten Germans began, we moved to Prague. Západ: What are your memories of Břeclav? Newman: Those were rather strange times. Mother studied the piano in Vienna, and she spoke German, al- though she could speak Czech as well. My father was a Czech patriot. He fought against the Austro- Hungarian empire in the first world war, and was a friend oX Jan Masa- ryk and other well-known statesmen. I spoke both German and Czech fluently. Břeclav was a small town and my father, in fact, was the town's largest employer. This put me in a strange kind of situation. I never knew whether 1 had any real friends or whether the other boys were nice to me just because my father employed their fathers. So I led a rather hizarre existence. We had a large house with a big garden, three maids, a gardener, a chauffeur and a big grey Tatra. I had my own small garden with a pel reindeer in it. On my last birthday in that house my parents forbade me to go into the garden. Naturally I was surprised, but later in the day, they let me go into the garden - and there was a present for my ninth birthday: a swimming pool, I only mention this so you'll understand that I lived in quite untypical circumstances. And all of that vanished overnight - literally overnight. When the problems with the Sudeten Germans began, some bombing and shooting started one night - it didn't go on for long - and our family packed up and drove to Prague the same night. My father said thai nothing wouid happen because we had pacts with the Western powers, so he didn't send any money out of the country, and we had nothing abroad. In March, 1939, the Nazis arrived. They wanted to take over the sugar refinery legally and they forced my father to sign it over. He used the money to buy some rare stamps and diamonds, but all he told me was that on the border I was supposed to say it was my own collection or stamps. I still don't understand to this day why, but that first year the Germans allowed several families to go to Italy on holidays. Because we were only supposed to be going for "holidays", we couldn't take much luggage with us so it wouldn't be obvious we were leaving for good. But we had the stamp collection. What my father didn't know was that I was determined to shoot a few Nazis and I had traded some of the stamps in school for a revolver. When we crossed ihc border and he discovered thai there were very few stamps left in the album, it was too late for him to get angry. We stayed in Italy for a year, then we went to France. My father had some money - not a great deal - in London that he'd sent there to buy some refining equipment. But it was almost impossible for us to get to London. We ended up in Biarritz, where there were Czechoslovak army units who wanted to sail to England. They took over a Belgian ship called Ville de Liège. The commanding officer recognized my father and invited us to sail with them. There were dozens of other refugees who didn't manage to get passage on any ship and ended up in the concen- 5 [pageend7]Report on a Meeting Excellency by Miloš Šuchma Západ: Haw successful have your books been? Newman: In Canada very. But be- cause the themes arc so typically Canadian, there has only been one translation so far. The Canadian Establishment, about the captains of industry - and by the way, a Czech, Thomas Bafa, is among them - has only been translated in the Soviet Union. They regarded it as a con- firmation of all their theories. They claim it proves what they've always said about the big imperialists, the cliques of monopolists and so on. In short, they liked it. The book came out last year and was immediately sold out. But I didn't get a penny for it. Západ: One day you'll be able to take your whole family on a luxurious vacation to the Crimea and dine on caviar and champagne from morning to evening so that you'll at least get something oat of it, Newman: Hardly. 1 was in the USSR in late 1979 and early the following year I wrote a detailed article about it in Maclean's. The Russians were outraged. So I very much doubt they'll ever let me go back. As far as Canada goes, the Bronfman book had a run of 250,000 copies. Západ: Can you tell us what you consider your greatest success, or what has given you the greatest pleasure over the years? Newman: Pleasure? 1 think my great- est delight has been to watch my daughter grow up, I like sailing on the lake; I have a rather large boat. 1 admire Stan Kenton. I have a set of drums at home and when I want to relax, I play them. Professionally my greatest excitement has been to develop this magazine. I have always been a Canadian nationalist and I wanted to prove that we could have a good weekly of our own, without having to depend on Time or News- week. That was my greatest satis- faction. Books, you know, bring a strange mixture of feelings with them. Someone is always attacking them, it happens. I hate bad reviews and so this bothers me. Norman Mailer once said that writing a book is like going into a ring and de- fending your title. And you have to defend it all the time, with each new book. As one grows old, it is easy to feel tired, especially with a work load such as I have. And sometimes, when I read an unfavourable review, I wonder if I really need it? But I don't think I'll be working like this till I die. In a few years I'd like to take a really good rest. It is not often one gets a chance to hear a Soviet ambassador speak in public. If you live in a capital city, however, the opportunities are more frequent. And it needn't necessarily be the anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, when the massive doors of the Soviet embassies all over the world swing open to receive polite guests from the host country, most of them government representatives with a wealth of experience on the so-called "cocktail circuit", and then the regulars from the ranks of the faith- ful, among them diplomats from Eastern Europe and, of course, people from the "right-thinking" public, above all members of the local Communist party. Occasionally, however, a uni- versity professor decides to invite the Soviet ambassador to "inform" his students on the state of the Soviet Union. An observant reader may find an announcement buried in the local paper that Alexander Jakovlev will be lecturing at such-and-such a time and place on "Canadian- Soviet Relations." To the average Canadian, the name Alexander .lakovlev means nothing, and the theme of his talk promises little excitement. Nevertheless, the reader shows up at the appointed hour, drawn as much by curiosity about the audience as by His Excellency. The audience consists of about 20 students, 10 invited professors and 10 "others", in quotation marks because they might be agents of the KGB, or as easily, of the Mounties or perhaps simply interested members of the public. The ambassador is given a brief introduction, there is a smattering of polite applause from some people, including two "advisors" who are sitting close by and who, in the course of the "lecture" and the "question and answer period", prompt their ambassador both in his choice of English phrases and also in Russian, to clarify the subject of discussion. Then the ambassador, after taking out a few pages with his prepared address, puts his hands casually into the pocket of his unironed trousers and begins to read. His lecture can be divided into three sections; disarmament, the with His The bread of falsehood tastes sweet, but then his mouth is filled with sand. - Solomon Helsinki agreements and Soviet- Canadian relations. He reads with a pure Russian accent, and his voice is monotonous, reminding the listener of other such addresses, fortunately now half-forgotten, in another capital city. For the Canadian students the lecture must be a rather unusual experience, for it differs from what the newspapers say. Nevertheless the speech is alive with confirmations about the Soviet Union's best intent- ions, The word "peace" is used with an almost religious frequency, al- though comments about "certain circles" that want to destroy the peace are less clear. The listener sighs with relief, however, when the ambassador quotes American doves like Senator McGovern with whom, in the ambassador's opinion the Soviet Union can fully agree with on the question of arming Western Europe with rockets which are a threat to peace. The ambassador, however, sincerely omits mention- ing Soviet rockets, because Soviet soldiers, of course, are walking around Eastern Europe with bare hands. His explanation of the Helsinki agreements is also clear, and ought to leave no one in doubt about the best intentions of the USSR, even though the ambassador generously admits that values in East and West might differ a little. But he doesn't go into detail. On the other hand, he is free with statistics, drowning the listener in figures having to do with culture, such as how many western books and films are available in the Soviet Union, and at the same time, he asks why such an insignificant number of Soviet books and films are to be found on the Western market. It is impolite to interrupt and also the prompter is not working and therefore can't help him answer the question as to who he thinks is going to read these wonderful Soviet works of art or go to see the films and above all, who is going to pay for this unprofitable culture. After reading the final page of his prepared "lecture", which differs only cosmetically from similar articles to be found in Pravda, the ambassador thanks his audience. At this point we are subjected to an 7 [pageend8]astonishing display of servility on the part of the worried professor who has organized the whole affair. Announcing that Mis Excellence has kindly consented to answer any questions, the professor asks nervous- ly whether there is anyone from the press present, suggesting to the ambassador that if so, both the lecture and the questions and answers might be declared out of bounds for publication. When the ambassador makes no reply, the professor then suggests that the lecture might be made available to the press to be quoted from. At this point the ambassador, whose 6 years in Canada have taught him some- thing about the ways of democracy and freedom of the press, rescues the awkward professor with the generous assertion that perhaps they could allow everything to be quoted since in any case, there is no way to prevent it. And so the professor, born in a democratic state, sighs with relief at the smooth resolution of an embaras- sing situation by a representative of a non-democratic state. Most questions posed by the students are weak, indicating both the superficial preparation by the naive professor, and their own lack of experience. After all, they are still carefree youth. In any case, the ambassador is armed with an arsenal of propaganda and has answers to every question, even though they may'be quite different from what the listener expected. He is frequently assisted by the professor who rules a question out of order whenever it appears to be heading in a danger- ous direction. And so the only sur- prise for the ambassador is a ques- tion from a Czech in the audience about the "temporariness" of the presence of Soviet soldiers in Czecho- slovakia. (The lecture took place before the "fraternal assistance" to Afghanistan.) This is the only time the ambassador drops his smile, and he requires at least 15 seconds before coming up with a reply. He assures the audience, however, that after the departure of American troops from Western Europe, the Soviet Union will be more than willingtowithdraw the troops stationed in Eastern Europe immediately. It was also the last question and answer of the evening, which was quickly termi- nated by the nervous professor. The former Canadian ambassador to the Soviet Union, invited to the meeting for this purpose, lightened the mood once more in his conclud- ing remarks, in which he demonstrates Miloš Šuchma. editor-in-chief ttfZi- pad, lives in Ottawa where he works in the field of Data Processing. that he has forgotten nothing of the art of diplomacy. He thanks the Soviet Ambassador for taking the time to come here and delivering such a fine talk, and he recalls with pleasure the happy time he had spent in the Soviet Union and journeys he had been allowed to undertake and which he had enjoyed so much. The Soviet Ambassador and his advisors once again smile broadly In short, the fellowship is wonderful, and it would certainly improve during the reception to which a small circle were invited afterwards. It is to be hoped that the next time His Excellency meets the public, some people might show up who are prepared to ask the ambassador a few interesting questions of a more knowledgeable nature and thus spend the time with him "in a cordial conversation of value to both sides," as those familiar government com- muniqués are wont to put it. Perhaps then both the students and the professor might widen and correct their knowledge about the real experience of people living under Soviet jurisdiction, experiences that are very different from the mystifying opinions of His Excellency. OlAI HAN LI LETTERS FROM CANADA An Open Letter to His Excellency The following letter is neither a joke nor a Saturday literary diversion. The original event, which inspired the attached letter 10 the Czechoslovak Ambassador in Ottawa, is true. V, T. Dear Sin By hearsay I learned about the de- plorable fact that my wife and I were sentenced for having left Czecho- slovakia in 1968, and that all our possessions were confiscated. I find this rather confusing and request your generous clarification of several points. When I say "hearsay" I mean that we were informed of the sentence un- officially, through friends. I wonder about your authorities' failure to notify us about the trial. Could it be that they were reluctant to hurt our feelings? Or could it have been their consideration of Canadian postal problems? What if the important documents had arrived one or two weeks late? Wisely, they avoided the possibility of such an embarrasment. The word "sentenced" was used. Yet this sentence was not handed down in 1969, 1970, nor in 1974, the year we acquired Canadian citizenship. No, we were tried in 1978, ten years after acting on the United Nations De- claration of Human Rights, which your country signed in San Francisco in 1945, and reaffirmed in Helsinki in 1975. We simply decided to move to another country, one of the basic rights of any human being. We left behind no debts, black eyes or poli- tical insults. Yet, a mere ten years later, your patient courts arrived at family names starting with "T", and our long forgotten existence was un- earthed and used as a deterrent. We have nothing but admiration for such methodicalncss in persecuting felons. You must be proud to serve such a government, your Excellency. Actually, we appreciate not having been notified. We would probably have tried to defend ourselves with a foolish reference to your country's constitution, which grants all free- doms to its citizens. We might have tried to persuade the court that such a constitution invalidates the law de- 8 [pageend9]d a r i n g that "abandoning one's homeland" is a criminal offence. We would thus have openly revealed our na i veté and become the object of ridicule by some minor court clerks. Among other things, we were not told what the sentence was. The suspense is killing us. Pray, tell us! Is it one month on probation? Two months without probation? Several years? Could we serve the sentence on weekends? Should we fly to Prague or may we surrender to the Ontario Provincial Police for im- prisonment every Friday night? Should we have the proof of our stay in jail accomodation validated? Perhaps it's not that simple. Perhaps capitalist prison terms arc only equivalent to 50% of the "socialist" ones. Please enlighten us. The last thing we want to do is causc you any embarrassment! Another confusing aspect of the sentence is the confiscation of all our property. Does this apply to all the possessions we left behind? Docs it mean that all the books by Karl Marx and Fricdrich En gels with my personal annotations, which 1 had to study six hours a week during my university years, are lost f o r c e r ? What about my wife's diploma with comrade Lenin's profile? What about her diary? My rubber duck? Or - if my suspicions are correct - does the act refer to anything we once had, now have or will have in the future? Should we surrender every- thing? It is very harsh, and we doubt that the Minister of Externa! Affairs will be able to help us in this case. Well then, give it to us straight. Should we rent a U-haul and deliver all our casseroles, clothing, our tom- cat Poker, our snow shovel, the last case of Carlsberg and all our other things to 171 Clem o w in Ottawa? Do you want us to leave it on the side- walk in front of the embassy or would you rather we waited until after sun- set and stored it all in your basement? Maybe you did not mean it literally. You must want us to sell everything, our house, our Canada Savings Bonds, our two antique bedpans bought in Cape Cod, our paperback book on the KGB and send you the proceeds by registered mail. Or would you prefer a money order? Travellers cheques? A Swiss bank account? Please reply—the uncertainty is driving us crazy. Could I keep things I need for my job? The US army gas mask case which I use for carrying my lectures and slides to the college where I work? Of course, the nature of our "crime" is dubious. The punishment is even more dubious. Never mind that, sir, kindly send your reply to Yours truly, Vaclnv Tahorsky Václav Táborský, a member of the editorial board of Západ, is professor of film at York University in Toronto. Jetting Across Canada hy Vladimir Skutina Canada is a land of forests and lakes. But I wouldn't want to get lost in those forests like Hansel and Gretel; I probably wouldn't find my way out of them until the end of the millenium. It is worse than the parking centre at the Zürich Airport. There you park your car and if you forget your level number and section colour, you're lost. I've met families there who have been wandering desperately through that labyrinth of automobiles since the early 1970s, searching in vain for their now historically valuable automobile. When I saw so many forests and lakes and mountains, I was sur- prised that there were still people living in Canada as well, and not just bear and deer and moose and caribou. And first rate people too, Canadians know how long a metre is and how many beers make a litre. That may also be the reason why they weren't so upset by the rise in gasoline prices. After all, a litre of gas is still cheaper than a gallon. In Vancouver, I discovered that Czech theatre thrives there. Besides an amateur theatre troupe (they were just having a dress rehersal of The Straw Hat), Vancouver television was just taping Tom Stoppard's Professional Foul, with some of our countrymen playing minor roles as normalized citizens of Prague. What an absurd world. Emigrants playing Hustikian bootlickers. But thanks to them, at least Canadians will understand that communism is not to be flirted with, that communism and all the varieties of Marxism are criminal. Perhaps they will under- stand one day. Canadians are smarter than the left-wingers in Europe. Or at least it seemed that way to me. On the other hand, the world perhaps should be just a tiny bit grateful to the communists. If the communists had not started carrying on in Czechoslovakia in February, 1948, Professor Vladimir Krajina would probably have stayed there, up to his knees in politics. I don't know what kind of politician he would have made. But he certainly wouldn't have had time to do the enormous amount of work he had done in Canada in ecology. A gigantic tract of land in British Columbia bears the name The Vladimir Krajina Eco- logical Reservation, and in the late 1950s Canada nominated Professor Krajina for a Nobel Prize in the field of biology. Canadians make coffee just a touch better than Americans do. What is passed off as coffee in the United States is more like leftover Coca-cola that's been poured into a pot and warmed up. Even so, I pre- ferred drinking tea in Canada. Západ comes out in Canada, and so do a number of other magazines and periodicals. There is a Czecho- slovak radio program in Montreal and Ottawa and four Czechoslovak television programs - in Ottawa, Toronto, Kitchener and Montreal, and occasionally in Vancouver as well. Even so something is missing. There should be a monument. And on the pedestal should be inscribed: "To Zdena Škvorecká, for her con- tribution to Czech literature." If, in the woods beyond Winnipeg, in the bush, as they call it, you meet someone gathering mushrooms, you can speak Czech to him, Czechs are the only ones there who gather mush- rooms. That's why they call those woods the Czech woods. 9 [pageend10]Baťa is still a name to be reckoned with in Czechoslovakia, even though the communists have been in power there for the ihirty-four years and have tried to wipe the name out of living memory. Yet today, even the youngest will say, "I'm going to Baťa's", meaning I'm going to the shoe shop. The difference between now and the pre-war years is only this: then, you went into Batas and came out with a pair of shoes, where- as now you go into a shoe shop and if you don't bribe someone the right amount, you'll leave the shop with nothing but the faint hope that the shoes you want will be in stock some- time within the next half year. The story goes that on Wenceslas Square in Prague in the former Baťa department store, today bearing the inspired name The House of Foot- wear, they have rationalized the purchasing process. You enter a passage and there you see two entrances: Ladies Footwear and Men's Footwear. You enter the men's door. There you find two more doors: Dress Shoes and Workboots and Sporting Footwear. You enter the door marked Dress Shoes, only to be confronted by two more doors, marked Dress Shoes with Laces and Dress Shoes Without Laces. You choose the door marked Without Laces. Beyond it are two more doors: Brown Shoes and Black Shoes. You choose the brown. Two more doors, this time with the inscription: For Members of the Czechoslovak Com- munist Party, and For Non-com- munist Party, and For Non-com- munists. You are honest, so you choose the non-communist door, only to find yourself back on the street, in Wenceslas Square again. Baťa is still a household name in Czechoslovakia even though the communists have done what they can. The more Husák's Sovietized Czechoslovakia sinks into the swamp of economic decline and failure, the more people remember TomáŠ Baťa, who was able to take that alienated American Fordism and Europeanize it, Czechify it, humanize it. Before I landed in Toronto, my encounter with Mr. Tomáš Baťa was preceded by a rather piquant story from Switzerland, where one of the 101 Baťa factories around the world is located. It is in the city of Möhlin and it employs a large number of Czechs, In the summer of 1979, they phoned me in Ziirich and told me that Baťa was going to manufacture track shoes for the Moscow Olymp- ics, with the Baťa logo right there above the emblem for the Olympics, with its red star, i was about to go to Canada, so I decided to ask Mr. Baťa himself what was going on. Tomáš Baťa welcomed me very cordially. He was just sixty-five and he looked wonderful, with a sports- manlike figure, slim and full of élan. And he spoke magnificent Czech, despite the fact that he hadn't been in Czechoslovakia since 1931. His wife is Swiss and he has practically no opportunity to speak Czech. When I told him about the track shoes for the Olympics, Mr. Baťa shot out of his revolving chair and said, "Out of the question!" Even though each of the 101 plants around the world has a more or less free hand and is independent, he was convinced that he would have known about something like an order of track shoes for Moscow. That evening, when I arrived in Waterloo, there was a message wait- ing for me. The plant in Switzerland had owned up. They had manu- factured a few prototypes for Moscow, but when they saw the negative re- action of Czechoslovak emigrants, they realized that they would be putting their foot in it, so to speak. So they put a stop to the order. And so, Baťa will remain a house- hold name for me. Unsullied. * * * Vladimir Škutina is a well known Czech journalist and television person- ality, He now lives in Zurich, Switzer- land. In almost every city in Canada there is a huge Hudson's Bay Company department store, belong- ing to a firm that was founded in the seventeenth century. For us Czechs, it is interesting that the first president of the company was Prince Rupert, a native of Prague and son of Fredrick Falcký, who lost the war with the Habsburgs in 1620. It was the Hudson's Bay company that provid- ed one of the impulses towards the founding of Canada. They began trading in beaver skins and that was how the English got into Canada, Couldn't Czechs be given a dis- count when they buy fur coats here? 10 [pageend11]The World Is The Time Out of Joint? by Jiří Lab sic We are a generation that shares Hamlet's view of the world. We are living through a series of calamities and crises that undermine our securi- ty, our optimism and our faith in people. We seek inspiration in the past but, as a popular witticism has it. even nostalgia today isn't what it used to be We are losing our ideals, our joy of living and, according to sexologists, even our interest in sex. This in the middle of the sexual revo- lution! Quo vadis humanitas? One thing is certain: the world in 1984 will be burdened with problems that George Orwell never even dreamed of. It is true, ofcourse, that lamenting over civilization is a defensive reflex indulged in by educated people in every generation. In periods of crisis like today's, it is not particularly difficult to criticize civilization. To what extent, however, is the criticism justified? Cultural pessimism is proclaimed chiefly by conservative and religious- ly oriented thinkers, who frequently see the roots of our problems deep in the past, specifically in the secu- larization of society and the growth of individualism. After his deport- ation from Russia in 1974, Solzhe- nitsyn became one of the most influential spokesmen of this religious conservatism. In his opinion, we are now reaping the fruits of our de- secration of the mora! heritage of Christianity. Modern humanism, Solzhenitsyn argues, declared the autonomy of man and thereby de- prived him of humility before God and a sense of responsibility and meaning. In the spirit of Dostoyev- sky, Solzhenitsyn hopes that Mother Russia will renew herself by a return to Orthodoxy and thereby show the way to the decadent West. Non-religious thinkers point out that it was not the religious fanatic- ism of the Reformation and Counter- reformation that improved the conditions in which people live, but the secularization that took place in the 18th century. According to Erich Fromm, the problem is that modern civilization liberated man from op- pressive social and natural burdens without teaching him how to deal rationally with his new freedoms. Freedom with no apparent limits then becomes a source of new de- formations, including tendencies towards criminality, violence and destruction, which eventually lead to the desire to trade this "unbearable" freedom for the comfort of social or political conformity. Despite the predictions of philo- sophical pessimists like Schopen- hauer, Nietzsche and Spengler, the world has always recovered from its illnesses. In the history of civilization, periods of decline alternate with periods of prosperity. The post-war years, particularly the 1960s, was a period of growth. Only the past ten years have produced a series of criti- cal trends that may well be of a long- term nature. Will' life in the 1980s also be marked by an atmosphere of crisis? In social terms, there can be no doubt that we are living at a time when the family, authority and the moral standards of society are erod- ing. I'hey are traditional signs of social deprivation that began to multiply after traumatic events like August 1968, Vietnam, Watergate and prolonged economic crisis. The war in Vietnam, for example, was of secondary importance in military terms, but an enormous social event in terms of its social impact. Day after day, year after year, the mass media brought generous doses of the Vietnamese spectacle to every family. As this "television" war continued, some segments of Western society began to lose a sense of right and wrong, Jane Fonda and her friends politically, others esthetical- ly and morally. Remember how we were shocked, in the early 70s, by films like Straw Dogs and Clockwork Orange, in which senseless violence was depicted in a morally neutral context? Coppola's The Godfather, which followed them and won an Oscar for the best film of the year, gave moral indifference to evil the stamp of legitimacy. After several years of carefully documented jungle warfare, violence and blood flooded television programs and films. Today, Americans who watch TV regularly see an average of 18,000 television murders and other crimes before they reach voting age. As might have been predicted, criminality grew dramatically in real life as well, influenced by economic crisis and high unemployment. Each year, 70,000 American school teachers require hospital treat- ment as a result of injuries inflicted at school. Every two years, as many people die violent deaths on American soil as died in more than ten years of war in Vietnam. Communist ideologists used to like quoting American crime statistics as proof of the moral superiority of their regimes. Today, they have very tactfully begun to avoid that argu- ment, for it appears that the gene- rations weaned on Marxism-Leninism are not immune to so-called capitalist diseases either. After decades of socialist education, criminality in the countries of the Soviet bloc and in China has become a serious problem. Disrespect for legal and social norms is a phenomenon of modern society, regardless of the social system. This phenomenon has also affect- ed social and political activism. It is no accident that an American histor- ian called the 70s "the 'me' decade". Unprivileged groups in Western society - from women, national and racial groups, political dissidents, religious sects, down to homosexuals and lesbians - have, in the past fifteen years, become very vocal in demand- ing their particular rights. Failure, frustration, and sometimes simple impatience have driven them to adopt violent methods. In the United States, the Black Panthers tried to create "black power" by street terror, but they were unsuccessful and in the end, reverted to electoral methods. In Northern Ireland, a sporadic civil war broke out in 1969, and to this day the British Army has been unable to bring the situation under control. In Spain, neither the Franco dictator- ship nor the liberalizing monarchy of King Juan Carlos has been able to pacify the Basque separatists. Italy, West Germany and Japan, three highly developed countries that had apparently overcome an unhappy past, had to deal with the problem of fanatic groups of urban guerillas from left and right during the 1970s. Soviet bloc countries used to sup- port Western left-wing terrorists. Thus Renato Curcio and his cohorts in the Italian Red Brigades, who murdered not only Premier Aldo Moro but also functionaries of the Italian Communist Party were once It [pageend12]Jiŕl ľabšic, a member of the editorial board of Západ. is a historian living m Hamilton. Ontario. given terrorist training in Carlsbad, Czechoslovakia. Dnring the 1970s, however, the Russian absolute rulers began to experience active resistance from their own citizens. Several years ago, Brezhnev became the target of an unsuccessful attempt on his life on the way to the Kremlin, and in 1979, bombs went off in the Moscow sub- way. A group of Armenians paid for it with their lives, although according to dissidents thev were not guilty. From the sub-kingdom of Czecho- slovakia in the 70s there emerged news of sabotage in industry and agriculture and in 1979 Prague announced that a group of dissidents were plotting an attempt on the life of the First Secretary. There were unconfirmed reports that the same fate was being prepared for Vasil Bil'ak. The regime is almost certainly dramatizing the situation to justify harsher measures against dissidents. But there can be no doubt that regicidal thoughts arc gaining popularity in the Czecho- slovak vice-regency. Waves of violence and the gloomy economic situation have led Western middle-class society back to traditional values. Politically this expressed it- self in the election of conservative parties in Britain, Sweden, Canada, Italy and elsewhere. In North America, liberalism has become a dirty word. The retired Californian businessman Howard Jarvis headed a protest movement against taxation and overnight became the hero of the middle classes. Western society is now demanding fiscal frugality,strict laws, order and conservative social policies. Disillusion with secular power has given a new lease on life to religion. Until recently, the Iranian revo- lution and the renaissance of the Islamic world seemed to be isolated phenomena. After the election of Cardinal Wojtyla as Pope, it turned out that the Christian world was also awaiting the appearance of a charismatic spiritual authority. The triumphal tours of John Paul II on three continents have no parallel in the modern history of the Papacy. Churches on both sides of the "Iron Curtain" are filling up again. Religion is becoming an oasis of certainty and inspiration in a period of crisis. Circumstances would seem to indicate that the wave of terror and violence is on the decline in the western world. The same, however, cannot be claimed for the developing countries. The decolonisation of the Third World opened the way for the power and influence of groups that reject the norms of civilization. As developments in Indochina have shown, the communist regimes in particular have proved themselves a match for Hitler and Stalin. During less than four years of a monstrous experiment in communism, the Pol Pot regime exterminated perhaps a quarter of the population of Cambodia. After Pol Pot was over- thrown in the name of the "more h u m a n i t a r i a n " M o s c o w / H a n o i version of communism, hundreds of thousands of Cambodians died as a result of the cynical pacification policy of the new rulers, Hanoi itself showed its true face when it robbed hundreds of thousands of its citizens of their last sou and drove them out of the country. These events prove that the millions of victims of Stalin's terror and Mao's revolution were not merely an accident of history. In the race after noble ideals, communism has effectively shown itself to be the most ruthless system in the world. After the events in Indochina, there can be no other conclusion. In the last decade, terror and violence also became techniques of international politics. The first chapter was written by Palestine terrorists who skyjacked several western airliners to the .Jordan desert in September, 1970 and threatened to blow them up with the passengers if their cohorts were not released from western European prisons. The civilized world was shocked: innocent third parties had become the tools of blackmail. Al- though the Palestinians gave in to public opinion, their piracy became an inspiration to others. Ten years of international blackmail came to a climax with the occupation of the American Embassy in Iran with the consent of the highest authority in the land. It can be expected that the developing countries will remain at the epicentre of world political un- rest in the 1980s. Although the United States and Moscow gravitated towards détente in the 1970s, relations between the two superpowers remain the focal point of international politics. America attained the zenith of its post-war prestige with its landing on the moon in July, 1969. During the era of Vietnam and Watergate, however, it lost its privileged po- sition and authority. The retreat of America from its position of glory is a relative phenomenon, brought about on the one hand by the grow- ing strength of other powers and regional blocs, and on the other hand by the masochistic tendencies of American society and its politicians. The low point of American politics in the 1970s was not the fall of Saigon in April 1975, but something that followed: in January 1976, the American House of Representatives decided to cut off support to the pro- western political movement in An- gola, despite - or perhaps precisely because - of the fact that the op- position Marxist movement received aid from the Soviet bloc in the form of weapons, advisors and volunteers. Such toothless American policies played directly into Soviet hands. Under Khrushchev, Moscow's aim was to cooperate with "bourgeois nationalists" of the Third World like Sukarno and Nasser. As Soviet positions became firmer under Brezhnev, the Kremlin began public- ally to support the aspirations of local communists in the developing world. The first major success of Painting by Ivan Dobroruka 12 [pageend13]this new strategy - the occupation of South Vietnam by Hanoi - set up a small chain reaction. From the fall of Saigon in April, 1975 to January 1979, pro-Soviet communist parties seized power in seven countries in Africa and Asia. In South East Asia, Hanoi installed puppet regimes in Laos and Cam- bodia. In the Middle East, com- munists took power in Afghanistan and South Yemen, In Africa, Soviet weapons and Cuban mercenaries played a decisive role in the An- golan civil war and in the con- solidation of Ncto's rule. And when the Marxist colonel Mengistu seized power in Ethiopia, the Soviets sent him two billion dollars worth of weapons and 20,000 Cuban soldiers, and with their help Mengistu sup- pressed the Somali and Eritrean separatists. Circumstances also indicate that communists attempted putsches in Somalia and the Sudan. The Soviets have managed with sur- prising ease to gain a solid strategic position on the black continent, and there is no hope of ousting them, Moscow's interests in Africa and the Middle East are guarded today by tens of thousands of Cubans and a new German Afrika-Korps, as the "volunteers" from East Germany are called. It would seem that Soviet policies in the Third World have finally opened the eyes of many in the West who have naively assumed that if Moscow were offered the olive branch, the Kremlin would grate- fully accept it. Soviet expansiveness in a period of American retreat led other non-communist powers to take a more active role in the defence of Western interests. Japan limited its relations with Moscow and began a policy of rapprochment with China. The western European nations initiat- ed new economic and political ties with the Third World, and France even intervened militarily against a new expansion of pro-communist movements m Africa. The recent agreement about the installation of tactical nuclear rockets in West European NATO countries confirms the regeneration of Western solidarity and unity. Soviet expansionism was behind the most important international event of the 1970s, the Sino-American rapprochement and the return of China to the international forum. Historically, China has had more conflicts with Russia than with America. Nixon's "ping-pong diplo- macy" was therefore built on solid foundations and was able to survive the departure of its initiators from the scene. After Nixon's resignation in August 1974 and the death of Mao Tse Tung in September 1976, the tempo of Sino-American détente in fact increased. The present Chinese leadership are following a policy of national reconstruction with the aid of the West, and it is probable that their successors will continue that course. On the other hand, Sino- Russian rivalry has deep roots and will remain an important factor in international politics in this decade. As long as major wars do not break out, the fate ofthc main power blocs will to a considerable extent remain tied to their economic potent- ial. International economics today is a vicious circle. Persistent inflation on the one hand and high unemploy- ment on the other require mutually exclusive medicines, and western governments have not yet found an effective formula, but for thé time being they have dealt remarkably well with economic ailments. The Soviet bloc will fee! the full impact of the economic squeeze in this decade, and that will obviously bring with it a new wave of political unrest,* Unlike the economic crisis of the 1930s, the present economic difficult- ies have profound, structural roots. The situation today in many respects is reminiscent of the chronic economic crisis of the 17th century that gave rise - in the 18th century - to the first industrial revolution. But mani- festations of the 17th century crisis do not concern us here; analogies do. The historical perspective suggests that the economic recovery of the Western world hinges on these major prerequisites: the development of new major sources of energy other than oil, the consolidation of the t Lthird i n d u s t r i a l r e v o l u t i o n " characterized by automation and computerization, and a widening of the international market by inte- grating the developing countries of the Third World. Obviously there are no short-term solutions, and there- fore the possibility must be faced that, after two centuries of economic growth, the civilized world may enter a period of prolonged economic stagnation. As one Czech poet warn- ed, pull down the shutters and close the gate: the coming night may not be a short one. * This article was published before the unrest in Poland, culminating in the establishment of the Solidarity trade unions. N.A.T.O. in Crisis hy Jan Gcllner According to Admiral R. H. Falls, of Canada, the West is entering "the most dangerous decade since the 1930s". Admiral Falls is not exagger- ating. Since 1967, when the western allies first came out with the notion of "détente" - a gradual lessening of tensions and a rapprochement be- tween East and West - the military might of the Soviet Union has conti- nued to grow in relation to the military capacity of the North Atlantic pact (NATO). In the light of the past twelve years, détente appears as another attempt by the democratic states to find a way to ease the heavy burden of military expenditures, in this regard, détente is related to the concept of "massive retaliation" (frightening the enemy with the threat of an immediate nuclear counter-attack), which, in the 1950s justified the neglect of conventional military forces. Détente particularly suited the countries of Western Europe and Japan, It enabled them to invest a great deal more in the economic and social budget than they spent on defence. In 1979, West Germany set aside about 3.2% of its G N P for defence, and Japan spent only 0,9%. Canada was somewhere in between with a little less than 2%. The United Slates spent 6% of their G N P on defence, and the Soviet Union used up 13%, though some estimates run as high as 15%. And that is not all. Any analysis of Soviet military expenditures must take into account the structure of the Soviet armed forces. The Soviet military machine is a caste-ridden organization. Whereas in Canada a colonel is paid about four limes as much as an ordinary private, in the "classless" Soviet society a colonel receives twenty-five times the pay of a common soldier. Since there are far more common soldiers than there are colonels, the Soviet army has far less per capita outlay than western armies. The same is true for the costs of food, lodging, medical services and pensions. For this reason the Soviet Union can afford a larger army and on top of that, invest a full 50% of the military budget on new armaments. The NATO countries, on the other hand, can afford to spend only 15-30% of their military budget on new weapons. Moreover, because the ruble can 13 [pageend14]buy more industrial products in the Soviet Union than the dollar, the yen or the mark can buy in the democratic countries, Moscow can purchase more military material than the NATO countries. All of this explains why the Soviet Union, although statistically it spends less on defence than NATO, today has 21,000 tanks and 4,500 fighter planes in Central Europe as opposed to 7,000 tanks and 2,400 fighters under NATO, and why Soviet superiority is growing from year to year. To stop this trend, the countries of Western Europe would have to raise their military expenditures at least to the level of the United States (6% of the GNP). That would mean that West Germany, for example, would have to invest almost 100% more on defence, and Italy or Denmark 150%. In fact, however, the western allies - at a NATO conference in Washing- ton in 1978 - decided to increase military expenditures by only 3% a year, after inflation, and it is highly improbable that even this target will be attained. The Soviet Union there- fore, may well increase its essential lead over NATO in the next few years. A Dangerous Decade Do the Soviets have any clear intentions in mind as they try to gain decisive military superiority over the West? Henry Kissinger put it clearly in a remarkable speech to NATO representatives in Brussels, when he said, "Whenever a country has gained superiority in all classes of weaponry, it has always tried, in an opportune moment, to gain some foreign policy benefit from it." It is, of course, pointless to try guessing what this aim might be. That only leads to the same comfort- ing conclusions as it did in the 1930s, when Hitler began to rearm Germany: it won't be so bad, it was said; he'll run out of breath soon; he'd have to be a fool to start a war; rational people in Germany won't stand for it. It is better to keep to the funda- mentals of strategic planning: what counts are the capabilities of the potential enemy (which can be esti- mated) and not his intentions (which cannot). From the strategic point of view, the critical period comes when the military strength of the potential enemy is greatest in relation to one's own strength. In the case of Nazi Germany, that would have been some time in 1940 or 1941. In the following years, a belated but ac- celerated and energetic re-armament of Great Britain could have been expected, and a rapid growth in the American arms industry. The fact that war began in 1939, however, was a result of Hitler's miscalcu- lation. He was certain that Poland would fall into his lap as easily as Austria, the Sudetenland and what was left of Czechoslovakia had. As we know, he was surprised, even dis- mayed, at the British and French ultimatum. Only his pride and his megalomania urged him to continue his attack on Poland. And even if he had held back at that point, he would certainly have pressed on with his struggle for European hegemony a year or two later, when from the German point of view, the military situation would have been optimal. It seems that 1984 or 1985 will be for the Soviet Union what 1940 or 1941 were, potentially, for Nazi Germany, According to experts, Soviet economic and military might will stop growing about mid-decade, and the decline will set in about the end of the 1980s. There are two main reasons for this. First, it is a consider- able burden on the economy to invest from 13%- 1 5 % o f t h e G N P a n n u a l - ly in defence. Even countries under a dictatorship as tough as the Soviet regime would probably not be able to bear it for long. At the same time, the Soviet economy is displaying critical shortfalls, not only in agri- culture - which we hear most about - but also in militarily important sectors such as transportation, the chemical and electrotechnical industries, and so on. And in the end, the Soviet G N P is less than half of the Western European GNP, and only a sixth of the combined NATO countries. It was a miracle that the Soviet Union gained military superiority over the West under those circumstances, and such miracles do not repeat themselves. The second weakness lies in the field of energy. At this point, the Soviet Union is self-sufficient and is able to cover the needs of the Eastern European satellites which - with the possible exception of Rumania - are all dependent on Soviet exports, chiefly crude oil. Yet the Soviet oil industry is already working at full capacity, and the more accessible sources of oil are gradually being ex- hausted. American technology, which makes possible the exploi- tation of difficult sources, is no longer available to the Soviets. Plans discussed years ago for the grand development of the Siberian oil fields - with the help of Japanese technology - have obviously not been realized. It would seem that by the end of the 1980s at the latest, the Soviet bloc will have to import oil from the Middle East, and that will be avail- able only for hard currency, which the Soviet Union lacks. Of course it could remain self-sufficient in oil only if it slowed down or stopped al- together its exports of oil to Eastern Europe, but that would hardly be politically possible, not to mention the fact that it would weaken the Soviet Union militarily. In any case, the East European industrial base, chiefly in Czechoslovakia and East Germany, is too important to it. Thus fears that the Soviet Union wilt try to take over the oil fields of the Middle East are justified. That is one of the reasons why the United States reacted so sharply - even though not very effectively - to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Finally, it is reckoned that if N A T O genuinely increased its military expenditures by 3% per annum, and if the Soviet Union were compelled to lower its expenses to below 10% of its GNP, the West might attain military parity with the East sometime around 1990. But that is only a guess. Along with other factors, however, it indicates that the Soviets will find it easier to realize their aims - whatever they are - in the 1980s (and it will probably be easier in the first half of the decade) than later. The Dilemma of Western Europe The nuclear deterrent is effective, but it is only a defence against nuclear arms, not against conventional ones. That means that North America is probably less threatened than it was in the past, whereas Western Europe is in incomparably greater danger, because against the threat of con- ventional attack from the Soviets, the threat of a nuclear counter- attack is no longer possible. It is un- thinkable that an American president would consent to such a counter- attack and thus throw his country - and the world - into the horrors of nuclear war. It is equally unthink- able that responsible West European leaders would choose such a solution. It would be collective suicide. There is no doubt, therefore, that an attack by conventional weapons can only be averted by conventional weapons. And here the Soviets have a consider- able - and in terms of armoured divisions, an overwhelming - super- iority. 14 [pageend15]It is true that modern precision- guided munitions (PGM) give the West a defensive advantage in contrast to the situation in the Second World War and to some extent analogous to the First. The question, however, is whether this factor compensates for the materia! superiority of the Soviets, which is at least 2 to ! in lighting divisions, 3 to I in tanks and 5 to 3 in tactical aircraft. !n any case, a serious confrontation would be very risky, and that is precisely what the Soviets are proba- bly counting on. It can be assumed that they would rather achieve their foreign-policy aims without war than as a result of winning a war in which they would lose a considerable port- ion of their economic potential. The danger for Western Europe, therefore, is more in its possible "Finlandi- zation", in which it would remain formally independent but essentially an economic and political dependecy of the Soviet empire. As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, control over the human and material re- sources of Western Europe would solve a number of their economic and political problems. How is it that Western Europe, which has the same population as the Soviet Union and twice the GNP, is now exposed to a genuine threat of "Finlaridization"? The answer is that, with the exception of France, which lias at least tried and is still trying to stand on its own feet militarily - Western Europe left its own defence to a considerable extent to the United States. This is perhaps understand- able as far as nuclear defence is concerned. But it is entirely in- excusable that the Western Euro- pean members of NATO have also neglected their conventional mili- tary strength. More than three decades after its establishment, NATO now finds it- self in an unusually precarious position. It would not be easy to make up quickly for the neglect of the past twelve years even if the will to do so existed. As I have already pointed out, Francc is essentially looking after itself, which does not help NATO as a whole. Great Britain, under a new government, is in favour of a tougher stand against Moscow, but of all the countries in NATO (with the exception of Portugal and perhaps Italy), it has the least means of strengthening its armed forces. West Germany, Belgium, Holland, Denmark and Norway have the means, but the governments of these countries have clearly been unable to persuade their citizens that if they value their freedoms and prosperity, they have to contribute more to de- fence than they have been. The West- ern European countries now invest only about half as much in defence as the Americans, who are not direct- ly threatened. Western Europeans should also be aware that the threat is global. For the time being, however, they depend entirely on the Americans to defend the oil routes from the Middle East, either through the Mediterranean sea or around Africa (around which the Soviets have bases now in South Yemen, Mozambique, Angola and Guinea). If the Soviets were to close those routes off - or even threaten to close them - it could force Western Europe to its knees and bring about its "Finlandization" just as effect- ively as the threat of a massive in- vasion across the Elbe or through the Sumava. This is the fundamental problem of NATO. Western Europe is trying to sit on two stools: to maintain an independent foreign policy towards the Soviet bloc (as expressed, for example, in its generally luke-warm reaction to the crisis in Iran and Afghanistan) and at the same time to be dependent on the United States when independence would cost too much money and might even, God forbid, lead to a lowering of their standard of living. The key to solving the crisis of NATO, therefore, lies in the hands of its West European members. So far, it appears that they may have appreciated the extent of the danger - they would be blind if they didn't see it - but that they lack the resolution and the political courage to confront it face to face.

The Vietnam Experience by Vladimir Fleischer In 1954, the Geneva Conference divided Vietnam along the 17th parallel, creating a northern and southern sector and granting in- dependence to Laos and Cambodia. When the communists seized power in Hanoi, they inaugurated their usual purges, and more than two milion Vietnamese fled to the south, including the entire teaching staff of the Hanoi university. Where- as South Vietnam withdrew all its units and war material from the territory north of the 17th parallel, the communists, even before signing the truce and the Geneva Agreement, were already preparing for under- ground activity in South Vietnam. Weapons and ammunition were buried and hidden away, political cadres blended in with the popu- lation and thousands of young men were taken from the South to the North, subjected to political in- doctrination, and trained in sabotage, propaganda and subversion. Then followed a period of communist terror in South Vietnam in which thousands of leading citizens in the villages and settlements were killed. The aim was to wipe out the intel- ligentsia, which was the biggest stumbling block to the spreading of communist propaganda in the countryside. Grenades and mines were exploded in places where they would kill the most civilians - on buses, in movie houses, market- places, schools and churches. After six years of systematically breaking the Geneva agreement, the communists began dialectically to direct their activities in South Viet- nam. In September 1960, the Com- munist Party of North Vietnam set it- self the task of "liberating" South Vietnam, and three months later, the organization entrusted with that job was established, the National Liber- ation Front Today, the term "nation- al liberation" fools no one. It is a common form of military aggression and intervention employed by com- munist states in support of their policy of systematic expansion. For ten years South Vietnam defended it- self against the subversive activities of the communists, their terrorism and military invasion. In 1965, it asked America for assistance, and the first American military advisers 15 [pageend16]with him eight days and nights during the 1968 TET Offensive to keep open 'telecommunications with Washington were sent to Vietnam. The rest is history. How could the Americans, the greatest power in the world, have lost the war in Vietnam? The answer can be discussed under four main headings: the concept of limited war, the American mass media, American public opinion, and the American congress. In 1965, the American presence was limited to 15,000 advisors. At the height of the war, there were more than half-a-million American soldiers there. Their aim, however, was not to defeat North Vietnam, but only to defend South Vietnam against com- munsit aggression from the North. The Americans were not to cross the demilitarized zone and they did not allow the South Vietnamese armies to do so, because that would be an infringement of the Geneva agree- ments. Meanwhile, at a time when no one was supposed to disturb the neutrality of Cambodia and Laos, the communists transported what- ever they pleased along the Ho Chi Minh trail, which passed through both countries. In other words, the American army had its hands tied and cannot be blamed for the defeat. The guilty ones are the politicians who invented the concept of limited war in the first place. The com- munist aggression could only have been stopped at the source, in North Vietnam. And this was never part of the strategy, obviously for fear of how China would react. At the time, we were obviously still under the influence of the Korean experience. And so the Vietnam war dragged pointlessly on, and there was "no light at the end of the tunnel". The American mass media The role of the American mass media in Vietnam was extremely painful. For the first time since the Second World War, television view- ers could watch wartime action right in their living room - and in colour. At the height of interest in the war, there were more than 500 radio and television reporters in Vietnam, 80% of them American, and the good ones could be counted on your fingers. Most of them had a perverse desire to show only the horrors of war and the mistakes of their own army. There were no heroes, only war criminals and their victims. American soldiers were perpetrators of evil. They burned villages, murdered the innocent population and dropped napalm bombs. Did anyone ever see reports on the very successful land reforms, on the construction of a Vietnamese in- dustry. the modernization of the fisheries, the construction of whole villages, schools and hospitals, the introduction of a democratic judici- ary, including the Supreme Court, and genuinely free elections under international control, or the intro- duction of a new type of more productive rice, or the pacification of the countryside? The Tet offensive of 1968, for example, was presented by the American mass media as a catastro- phe, although in fact American and South Vietnamese troops success- fully repelled the Viet Cong, In his book Tet, the well-known American reporter Don Oberdörfer described the event as "a crushing defeat for Hanoi and a blow to their claim that they have any moral or political authority in South Vietnam," Yet it was not until about four weeks after the offensive that the truth began to filter through to some American newspapers, and then it was con- fined to the back pages. And tele- vision remained silent about it. Another reporter, Peter Bishop, wrote in 1978 that in his opinion, this generalized picture of catastrophe presented by the media had more political influence in Washington - that is on the administration - than on public opinion. In his view, the real catastrophe took place in Lyn- don Johnson's Washington, and not in Vietnam at all. As we know, John- son shortly afterwards declared that he would not run another term, thus leaving a political vacuum that 16 [pageend17]congressmen, commentators and critics of the war rushed to fill. Some will still recall My Lai, a Viet Cong base cleared out by American troops. Over a hundred civilians died during the operation, and there was a monster trial in which final blame was placed on the American sergeant who had led the attack. The case kept the American mass media busy for two years. Although I don't wish to condone everything that was done in My Lai, the truth is that many of those civilians were ter- rorists and saboteurs. I remember vividly how, after the Tet offensive in 1968, they brought a beautiful ten-year-old boy to a press confer- ence. Our secretaries stroked his hair and stuffed him with chewing gum and couldn't get enough of him. In reality, he was a murderer trained by the communists. He had on his conscience the lives of seven Saigon policemen, whom he had shot in the back. But has anyone ever heard of Dak Son? It was a settlement of primitive tribes of Montagnards near the Cambodian border. The communists forced them to be porters and when they refused, they attacked their settlement with mines and rockets, and then finished the job of de- struction with flame-throwers. Not only did they burn the village, but they literally fried the women and children who had hidden themselves in dugouts underneath their huts. The result: 225 dead, mainly women and children, 44 wounded and 100 missing, most of them men taken off by the communists. A day later I arranged for a plane to take cor- respondents to the site. Out of 545 in Saigon, only five went, and three of them were Japanese. American correspondents were not interested in seeing what the communists had done: that was taken for granted. And so the American public never learned about Dak Son. American Public Opinion At the outset of the Vietnam conflict, American public opinion supported the government and the army. But gradually, distorted re- porting on television, and the anti- war campaign in the press increased in intensity. Demonstrations began in the streets and on university campuses. The so-called "silent majority" were never heard from on the TV screen or in the columns of the New York Times and the Wash- ington Post. And those on the streets <4 H Saigon during the early-morning hour. from the Embassy area b v were mostly young people. There was a generation gap between those who had gone through the First and Second wars, and those who grew up during the Vietnam War. For that generation, Vietnam became a living memory and a symbol of areas and interests that did not concern America and the consequence of which was not only a military defeat but moral degradation. If that same generation had lived in England in the late 1930s, it would obviously have agreed with Neville Chamberlain when he dismissed Czechoslovakia after Munich as a "distant country of which we know very little." it is no wonder, therefore, that the treatment of the war in the press and on the air helped create a pacifistic mood. And it went even further than that. Abuse was heaped on every- thing that had traditional authority or values: the office of the president, the FBI, the CIA, the police and the army. The family was scorned and wt attacked the U.S. Embassy m v of January H. 1968. is carried away a U. S. Military Policeman cults and drugs were propagated. "Wars of national liberation" were praised, and "wars of imperialist aggression" - as the Vietnam war was claimed to be - were condemned. The Kremlin must have been delighted to hear part of the American public parroting their propaganda. That mood obviously had a great influence on Washington. Johnson's successor Nixon had no choice but to bring the war to a swift conclusion. American Congress In those years. Congress had a Democratic and preponderantly liberal majority. And even so, John- son succumbed to the voices of the streets. At that time, it would have been political suicide to support the American role in Vietnam, But the inglorious role of Congress was most evident during the Paris peace talks. From December 1968 to June 1970. 1 was in Paris more than in 17 [pageend18]Saigon. I was in charge of all the cor- respondents for the Vietnamese mass media as their political and program advisor. For the first six weeks, there were arguments about the shape of the table and who would sit at it, and where. When they finally got down to the important issues, they agreed, for the most part, to disagree. The communists were convinced that the longer the war and the negotiations dragged on, the sooner American public opinion would be fed up and therefore the sooner South Vietnam would fall into their hands. Essentially, they were right. The first real negotiations were the secret meetings between Kissinger and re- presentatives of Hanoi in 1969. By the end of 1973, the agreement - consisting of nine chapters and four protocols, was basically ready to be signed. For a long time, President Thieu hesitated to sign the document, especially when North Vietnamese divisions were still on South Viet- numese soil. He feared, quite rightly, that as soon as the last American soldier had left Vietnam and the prisoners of war were home. America would lose interest in the country. And thus began the slow but syste- matic pressure on Thieu to sign. In November, Nixon sent Kissinger instructions to inform the Saigon representative that Congress would cut off all economic and military assistance if an agreement was not reached. Nixon was willing to meet with Thieu after the agreements were signed to assure him of continuing American support. In his opinion the best solution would be to keep together, get the best possible agree- ment and then on that basis, to con- tinue American military and econo- mic support to South Vietnam, Hanoi sensed that the Americans were having problems with Thieu. They began to place new conditions on agreement, and the negotiations dragged on. Kissinger wrote: "I lanoi was voracious. Supported in their opinions by the evident disagree- ment between Saigon and Washing- ton, and correctly sensing what the American Congress would do in January 1974, the communists felt that everything would drop into their laps, that they could force us to capitulate and that they could demoralize Saigon, In dealing with Nixon, however, they committed a cardinal error. They forced him into a corner. And Nixon was at his most dangerous when he ran out of alter- natives." On December 17, 1973, Nixon ordered the mining of Haiphong harbour and the next day, the Americans resumed the bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong. The reaction of the American media and public was almost hysterical. According to North Vietnamese sources, their losses were between 1300 and 1500 dead. The London Economist wrote that the number of dead in Hanoi was less than the number of civilians killed by the artillery attack on An Loc in April. In twelve days, the communists had had enough and accepted the conditions for returning to the negotiations in Paris on January 2, The same day, the Democratic caucus in the House of Represent- atives voted 154 to 75 to stop all funding for the military operation in Indochina once all American troops had safely withdrawn and prisoners of war had been returned. The resolution contained no mention of a truce, or of maintaining a de- militarized zone or ending the in- filtration from north to south. On January 4, the Democratic caucus in the senate passed a similar re- solution 36 to 12. In other words. Congress was threatening to abandon all its allies in Indochina. Even though the communists were now willing to sign, Thieu still hesitated. And so, according to Kissinger, President Nixon sent this message to Saigon: "I can only repeat what I have so often said. The best guarantee of the survival of South Vietnam is the unity of our two countries, and this would be serious- ly threatened if you were to main- tain your present attitude. The action of our Congress has confirmed my frequent warnings. If you decide to go with us, which I hope you will, you have my assurances that we will provide assistance in the period following the conclusion of agree- ment, and that we will react with all strength if the agreement is broken by North Vietnam." Another dispatch followed on January 16th; "I have decided de- finitively to sign the agreement on January 27 in Paris. If necessary, 1 will do so alone. In that case I must publically declare your government to be an obstacle to peace. The result will be the inevitable and immediate cessation of American military and economic aid, which will not be re- versed even in the event of a change in your government," And so Thieu gave in and signed. (Does anyone recall the similar way in which Chamberlain and Daladier threatened Czechoslovakia from Munich in 1938?) Then began two years of farce as the Paris accords were implemented under the eye of the International Control Commis- sion. The Canadians who were on the originally four-member com- mission left Vietnam in disgust aftei six months. The chief ofthe Canadian delegation, ambassador Michel Gauvin, said that "the key to Viet- nam is essentially in the hands of Moscow and Peking. If the com- munists had observed the conditions of truce, there would be peace today in Vietnam." We know, however, that this was not the case, and that no one stood up against it. The promises of economic and military help began to evaporate. In the end, Thieu proved to be right. He knew that signing the Paris agreements would be his own death warrant. As soon as the last American soldier left South Vietnam, and the last American prisoner of war was re- turned home, the American public and media lost interest in Vietnam. And finally, even the government, under congressional pressure, had its hands tied and could not keep its promises to South Vietnam without a new military intervention, not to mention the fact that it was unable to enforce the Paris agreements. Meanwhile, the communists shame- lessly broke one condition of the agreement after the other. While South Vietnam was gradually denied military help. North Viet- nam was rebuilding its army and re- suming its murders and terroristic activity. For two years, I conscientious- ly provided information about every- thing the communists were per- petrating in Vietnam, but I doubt that anyone was interested. It was only a question of time before the communists would take over the whole of South Vietnam. In January )975, North Vietnam had an army of about 650,000 men and 18 divisions. Of those, eleven were once more in South Vietnam. It was safe to assume that the com- munists would start a new offensive at the end of January or the begin- ning of February. It was also pre- dicted that in those battles, the supplies of munitions and other war materials would be considerably de- pleted, and so there were aircraft with no fuel, artillery without shells and firearms without ammunition. Saigon fell, * 18 [pageend19]Conclusion Were the Americans really naive enough to believe that the Paris agree- ments could honourably end a war that they had never been determined to win in the first place, and at the same time prevent South Vietnam from being swallowed up by the com- munists? In his book, Kissinger says that he genuinely believed it would have turned out wel! if the agreements had been adhered to. Yet it is hard to believe that such an experienced practitioner of "realpolitik" would not have known how it would turn out. America, having gone into the Vietnam war with the good in- tention of resisting communist ex- pansion in the Far East, ended by merely wagging a threatening finger at the North Vietnamese and then leaving for home. That approach, however, has no effect on the com- munists, In that sense I agree with those who claim that the war in Viet- nam was immoral. The war happened because words achieved nothing. If we were not determined to go into that war with the intention of winning it in the shortest possible period, we should not have gone into it at all. As one American general put it, "We will never again fight in a war that we have not been allowed to win." Vladimir Fleischer was sent to the USA in 1947 as a commercial attaché to the Czechoslovak Embassy in Washington. After the Communist takeover in Czechoslovakia in ¡948, he resigned and in 1951 became the editor-in-chief of the Czechoslovak section of the Voice of America. In 1958 he transferred to foreign service and after working six years in Munich, he was named radio and television at- taché in India. In 1967 he was trans- ferred to Vietnam, where he spent the next seven years as a chief information officer in the US1A (United States Information Agency). For his work, Mr, Fleischer received the Medal for Civilian Service in Vietnam, and the "Superior Service Award".

" H, Burnett, winner of the Nobel prize for biochemistry Every political emigré community is vulnerable, and this is particularly true of communities of émigrés from communist bloc countries now living in an open Western society. Mammoth intelligence services are a fact of life in a politically, militar- ily, economically and ideologically divided world. They influence the decision-making of the , highest government organs and play an im- portant role in the creation of foreign policy. The activities of intelligence services are aimed in two directions. é Community The most important task is a system- atic gathering of important in- formation about one's opponents, their aims and activities. The other task involves the active participation of the intelligence services in foreign policy in the form of special, highly secret operations which, in the termi- nology of communist intelligence services are called "active measures". The purpose of these operations is to weaken the opponent by undermin- ing his political, military, economic and mora! unity, by provoking new conflicts in his camp, by discrediting his policies in the eyes of the world public and influencing the formation of his foreign policy by feeding him false information. The Czechoslovak intelligence service is an important component of the Soviet intelligence apparatus. It operates on all continents and one of its permanent targets is the political- ly heterogenous Czech and Slovak émigré community. The first people [pageend20]to leave Czechoslovakia shortly after World War Two were discontented people from conservative, right-wing circles. Following the communist putsch in February 1948, thousands of adherants of the political middle and the non-communist left were driven out of the country. Then after the Soviet invasion of 1968, there was a new wave of emigration, which included communists. The vast dif- ferences between the organizations and their leaders, and their conflicts, provide fertile ground for various back-room games and disinformat- ional tactics, running the gamut from simple falsifications all the way to elaborate intelligence games in which the victims have no idea who the real perpetrator is. Political refugees and exiles who have grown up in and whose minds have been formed under the com- munist social system are particular- ly vulnerable. Totalitarian socialism robs people of their self-confidence and the responsibility for their own lives. At every point where an im- portant decision has to be made - university entrance, or example, or one's choice of employment or a change of residence - the party and government apparatus intervenes in some significant way. The effect of this on people is to deaden their initiative and create a feeling of powerlessness with regard to the all- powerful Authority. During his first few years in an open Western society, the refugee from a communist country under- goes a cultural and political shock. He must adapt to a new environment, discover new sources of security and accept new rules in the game of life. And the most difficult adjustment of all is learning to look after himself, without the help of a state authority. The majority are able to make the change, but others give up. It is from among the second category that communist intelligence agencies find their easiest victims. The basic tactic used by the Czechoslovak intelligence service against the emigre community is very simple: divide and rule. Dis- informational tactics disrupt the unity and deepen the conflicts that naturally exist among emigré organi- zations and their representatives. They try to rob the emigré com- munity of the sympathy and support of Western governments, and to dis- credit it in the eyes of the Czecho- slovak public as a band of character- less carpetbaggers who think only of their own well-being and wealth. 20 Communist intelligence agencies have not hesitated to use even the most drastic methods against those in exile, including kidnapping and murder. In December 1953, the former deputy Prime Minister. Bo- humil Laušman, was kidnapped in Austria. Czechoslovak agents carried out a bomb attack on MatúšČcinák, a pro-fascist Slovak politician who had lived since the end of the Second World War in West Germany. On July 5, 1955, he was opening a package addressed to him in the Miinich Post Office when it exploded, killing him and two bystanders. In the mid-1950s, the anti-emigré section of the Czechoslovak intel- ligence service carried out dozens of disinformation campaigns intended to sow discord among the political exiles. In 1954, they circulated a "chain letter" among the exiles urging them, in the name of a ficti- tious organization called The Move- ment of Exiles for a Return Home, to consider going back to Czecho- slovakia. A month later, Prague announced an amnesty for exiles as a further step in this carefully pre- pared and coordinated plan. It work- ed: several hundred exiles returned to Czechoslovakia, including Dr. Lev Sychravý, who had published a newspaper called Československé listy. The emigré community was literal- ly flooded with counterfeits of all kinds. Not only were documents, letters and various declarations forged and circulated, but entire issues of exile magazines and news- papers were issued, designed, once again, to sow mistrust and confusion among the rank of the émigrés. A new era in "active measures" began with the establishment, in 1959, of a department of active measures within the Soviet intelli- gence service, led by General Aga- yants. In 1963 and 1964. similar departments specializing in black propaganda and disinformation, were set up in East Germany, Czecho- slovakia, Hungary, Poland and Bulgaria. After the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, exiles from the ranks of the communist party be- came the main target, since the regime now considered them a greater danger than the post-February 194H generation, not in the least because of its conception of democratic socialism, which is supported by West European communist parties. One of the main targets of their attack has been Jiří Pelikán, former director of Prague television and Josef Houska, the chief off icer of the Czechoslovak Intelligence Service in 1961-68 now living in Rome, where he edits a Czechoslovak exile publication called Listy and is a member of the European parliament. In 1973, the Toronto based exile newspaper Na- še Hlasy (Our Voices) published a letter allegedly from Pelikán in which the Toronto paper was criticized for its political line. The letter offered help in developing a more proper con- ception of opposition to Stalinism "under the flag of communism with a human face." The letter, of course, was a forgery, but it provoked a bitter public reply by the editor in which he said that Pelikán and his friends de- served to be tried before an inter- national tribunal, as the Nazis were after World War Two. In 1975, a month after an attack on Pelikán appeared in a party publi- cation in Prague, he received a parcel in Rome mailed from Milan. It was a letter bomb, and fortunately he threw it away at the last minute, before it exploded. Perhaps ii was merely a warning. But Pelikán's name is a household word in Czecho- slovakia, he has influential contacts among left-wing and communist politicians in Europe, and moreover, he knows intimately the machinery of political power in Czechoslovakia. And his magazine Listy certainly causes more headaches to the comrades in Prague than Naše Hlasy from Toronto. Another permanent target of de- ception games are writers, reporters and former public figures who have stayed in Czechoslovakia yet refuse to accept the present status quo. The writer Ludvík Vaculík was the target of a crude blackmail attempt several years ago. And when Charter 77, the Czechoslovak human rights mani- festo, appeared in 1977, the State [pageend21]Jiří Stejskal, the chief officer of the Department for Désinformation Security forces began to circulate several false versions of the docu- ment. How can someone in exile defend himself against such forgeries and intrigues? Here is a basic list of ten rules that I would recommend to the attention of anyone who is active in exile organizations, particularly politically active journalists, function- aries and office-holders. 1. The correspondence of exile organizations and publications is an important source of information (names, addresses, the contents of letters). If this correspondence is easily accessible to all "trusted" friends and visitors, you can be sure that copies are already in Prague. 2. Private letters addressed to Czechoslovakia or received from relatives and friends not only pass through the hands of the censors, but also of disinformation experts who systematically gather not only po- litical. but also intimate family in- formation that may not appear to be of any significance. The information thus gained may be used publically, or privately, to blackmail a victim. 3. Be aware that letters from Czechoslovakia - especially those addressed to prominent exiles - may be altered or completely forged. Similarity in handwriting is no proof of authenticity. There are experts in Prague capable of imitating any handwriting. 4. A friend from Prague or Bra- tislava whom you haven't seen since you left Czechoslovakia and who is in the USA or Canada on a "business trip" and brings greetings from friends back home may be an agent (blackmailed and unwilling) of the police in Prague. Be friendly, but realistic. 5. If relatives are allowed to visit you from Czechoslovakia, this is not a sign that conditions are easing, but the consequence of careful analysis. When they return, they will he visited by comrades from the Ministry of the Interior, and they will not be content with a few politically neutral phrases about life in the West. Don't expose your relatives to needless risk. 6. If you decide to visit Czecho- slovakia, remember that the State Security forces can blackmail you, regardless of whether your status is that ofa "normalizeď'emigréornot. 7. Anonymity is the hallmark of forgery. If you receive an anonymous letter, declaration or request, you can be 99% sure that the author is sitting in Prague. An Australian, French or Austrian stamp on the envelope is immaterial. 8. If you receive any provocative letter or document on the letterhead of an existing organization, insti- tution or person in exile, check with the sender to see if it is authentic before you decide to do anything about it. The Prague disinformers often count on mindless, emotional reactions - and they often succeed. 9. The murder of the Bulgarian exile journalist Georgi Markov in England in 1977 signals the begin- ning of a new policy against political exiles from the Soviet bloc. If your name frequently appears on the pages of the exile press, it is also on the list of persons against whom Prague will not hesitate to use the most brutal methods. The murderer is a professional who has modern technology at his disposal. 10. The hands of Prague espionage are far-reaching, but they are not everywhere. Paranoid fear of an omnipotent institution will paralyze your ability to act and expose you to the same risk as carelessness. One of the main aims of active measures is the frightening and silencing of the political exiles. The author of this article is a former major in the Czechoslovak Intelligence Service. In 1964-66, he worked as deputy to the chief of disinformation in Prague. He defected in Vienna, where he was sent as a press attaché in the Czechoslovak Embassy. He was granted political asylum in the USA, and has lived there since November. 1968. His book. The Deception Game, is based on his experiences in the field of communist disinformational techniques. It was published in 1972 by the Syracuse University Press. The author has also published his memoirs, Š p i o n á ž n í o p r á t k y (Deception Games) by 68 Publishers Corp. in Toronto. Rumours of Annexation by Jiří Fabšic Eastern Europe is a permanent source of wild rumours and specu- lations. The latest one, which has received some media attention in the West, concerns alleged Soviet pre- parations to annex some Eastern European countries, and in particular Czechoslovakia. A memorandum to this effect, published by an obscure Czecho- slovak exile group calling itself the Czechoslovak Federal Council, al- leges that the annexation plan was dictated by Brezhnev to Czechoslovak president Husák in 1977, and is sup- posed to begin with a massive Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1984-86. A wide spectrum of party and govern- ment officials and agencies on both sides are said to be engaged in system- atic preparations for the "D-Day". or rather "A-Day". The scenario sounds like political science fiction. If anything, a con- spiracy of such magnitude and con- sequence would be impossible to conceal for so long. Even the most secret of all secrets finds its way to the opposite camp, usually within a matter of weeks. In December, 1940, when Hitler decided to invade Russia, for example, Churchill was tipped off within ten days. As far as the alleged Soviet preparations for the invasion and annexation of Czecho- slovakia are concerned, neither the CIA nor any other intelligence agency seems to have any knowledge of it whatsoever. The m e m o r a n d u m regretably fails to back up its claims with facts. It is too early to say whether the rumour is a product of political neurosis or a slick attention-getter for an exile group, or, even worse, a piece of Soviet psychological propaganda designed to test the ground for the real thing. Perhaps the most telling disproof of the an- nexation thesis is the reality in East- ern Europe today, for even if the Russians were to change nothing in their traditional policy of recognizing the formal (and counterfeit) in- dependence of their European satel- lites, the fact is that Eastern Europe has already become a colonial anachronism in this global age of political self-determination. 21 [pageend22]Czechoslovakia Kafka Lives by Vladimír Valenta When 1 was a child, I always en- joyed listening to people who had returned from long journeys and told stories of their encounters with savages and other dangers that dwelt in those far-off and exotic climes, I fell the same way at a lecture given by Edmonton lawyer Gordon Wright, who described for us at the University of Edmonton his visit to a certain faraway land. It was not an adventure from the jungle, however, but from Kafka's Prague, It was a public trial of a group of people who had signed Charter 77 and were also members of a civil rights monitoring group called The Committee to Defend the Unjustly Prosecuted (VONS). Mr. Wright, whose trip was paid for by money raised by the Edmonton chapter of the Committee to Defend Soviet and East European Political Prisoners and who donated his time gratis, arrived in Prague the evening before the trial began. He also re- turned safely, which is even more important, bringing with him a de- tailed account of the trial and his own commentary on it (he was not allowed to observe the trial himself). What follows are excerpts from both documents. * * * On October 22-23, 1979, one of the largest multiple political trials in the history of Czechoslovakia took place in Prague, On trial were Petr Uhl, Václav Benda, Václav Havel, Otta Bednářová, Jiří Dienstbierand Dana Němcová, The trial was hurried through in two days. It took place under tight security in a small courtroom in the Municipal Court of Prague. Only a handful of close relatives were al- lowed to observe the trial, and they were denied the right to take notes for most of the proceedings. Since Czechoslovak courts d o not keep verbatim transcripts of trials, this samizdat report, compiled from notes and memory by relatives, is the only record we have of what went on in the courtroom. In view of the extreme length of the report, we are presenting here Dana Nímcová. Petr Uhl, Engineer Psychologist V Václav Benda. Mathematician Jiří Dienslbier, Journalist O n a Bednářovi, Journalist Václav Havel. Writer only a brief excerpt from the indict- ment, and then passages from the concluding remarks by most of the defendants. , $ * * After formally opening the pro- ceedings, the judge, Antonin KaSpar, read the indictment; Between the spring of 1978 and the end of May, 1979, [the accused"], out of hostility to the socialist state system of government in the republic and with the purpose of aiding and abet- ting anti-communist propaganda abroad and . . . evoking hostility among the population towards the socialist state system, did establish an illegal organization called the Committee to Defend the Unjustly Prosecuted and after setting out an organizational program and delegat- ing duties, they prepared, in co- operation with other individuals and several active agents of foreign anti- communist centres, a large number of written materials which constitute a crude assault on the security forces, the Prosecutor's office, the judiciary and the Correctional Education Corps [i.e. prison employees], circulated these writen materials in- side the ČSSR and made them avail- able to foreign anti-communist centres which used them in attacks against us in the Western and emigré press, and in programs broadcast by hostile radio stations like Radio Free Europe, In other words, the accused engaged in large-scale subversive activity in collusion with foreign agents, thus committing the crime of subverting the republic as defined by Section 98, paragraphs I, 2a) and 2 b) of the Criminal Code." (The trial then proceeded in rough- ly the following stages: first the de- fendants were questioned individual- ly by the tribunal and the state prosecutor; next, the depositions and affidavits purporting to establish guilt were read, or more precisely, were simply entered in the record as evidence, the defence lawyers making little or no attempt to challenge them; then a handful of witnesses were heard, none of which confirmed anything of substance in the indict- ment; next the prosecutor made a concluding speech, essentially repeating the indictment. Finally, the lawyers spoke on behalf of their clients and then the defendants were each allowed to make a statement in their own defence.) 22 [pageend23]Vaclav Havel: "In January 1977 I was arrested and on the basis of un- truthful testimony by police, 1 was charged with attacking a public official, I spent six weeks in prison and a year later the charges were dropped. I was fortunate, for a large number of witnesses came forward to testify to what had really happened, confirming my i nnocence. Thus I had directly experienced what it was like to be unjustly prosecuted. At the time of the arrest, a committee was formed to help obtain our release." (At this point and frequently there- after, the judge interrupted Havel's speech, always in more or less the same way. He would lean slightly back in his chair, spread his arms wide apart and withacondcscending, "fatherly" smile, would say. "Mr. Havel, please try to keep to the point.") V. II.: "I merely wanted to say that I have reason to believe that the existence of that committee, the fact that my name was well-known ab- road, and the pressure of world public opinion contributed greatly to my release and subsequent dis- charge." Judge: "There, you see, Mr. Havel? Justice was done afterall." (Laughter in the courtroom). V. H.: "In my case, then, it turned out that the police and the judiciary had made a mistake and I realized how easily someone might find him- self unjustly prosecuted, but that in such cases, an effective defence was possible. This realization later led us to the idea of VONS." Judge: "The court is not interested in your personal experience; speak to the point." V. H.: "I wanted to point out why 1 thought the powers-that-be decided to move against VONS. They make the a priori assumption that the state organs can never do anything unjust. Court decisions are considered in- fallible in principle . . . . This as- sumption of infallibility is a very dangerous matter. Anyone who questions it is automatically consider- ed an enemy and anything he may do is treated as hostile. As the prose- cution sees it, if the state can do no wrong, then anyone who criticizes it has logically committed slander. And why does he do this? Naturally be- cause he is hostile to the regime and very probably associated with hostile and antisocialist foreign powers as well." Judge: "Mr. Have), you are aware, are you not, that there exists an extensive system by which court decisions are subjected to mutual re- view?" V. H.: "That is a question. Shall I answer it, or go on?" Judge: "No, no. Just continue." V. H.: "There exists a whole series of illegal procedures which are neces- sarily beyond public control . . . . I have in mind the practical lack of public access to trials, the preventive arrest of persons who are merely as- sumed to be interested in attending given trials. All this runs counter to our constitution and the international pacts on human rights. "The indictment has failed to con- front the main issue: whether or not the actual contents of our reports are truthful , . . If [the court] had per- mitted a concrete and detailed analy- sis of those reports, it would in fact be admitting its own fallibility. And the powers that be are too sensitive to permit that to happen . . . . The point is that the reports issued by VONS contain only basic data per- taining to individual cases. We quote from available official documents and describe the activity for which the persons involved are being pro- secuted in concrete terms. If we say that the high-school student X typed out an essay by Václav Havel and gave it to his classmates to read, it sounds far less damning than if X were to be described as illegally re- producing and circulating an anti- state pamphlet written by a right- winger, Now the indictment refers to the VONS reports as slanderous, insulting, distorting fabrications that were intended to intimidate, misrepresent, libel, and so on. And the only reason it describes them in such terms is because it then appears to follow that we did so out of hosti- lity, otherwise we could never have written such slanderous and sub- versive documents in the first place . . . . If we look at what lies be- hind all these virulent words, we find that there is nothing whatsoever. If they were all eliminated or replaced by sober equivalents, there would be nothing left of the indictment." Judge: "Mr. Havel, please be brief and to the point," V. H.: "There is a law in this country giving everyone the right of com- plaint. The Prosecutor General's Office even has a special department to deal with complaints. The indict- ment, however, accuses us of sub- version for doing just that in VONS . . . . The question of whether or not VONS is an organization was also raised. If that is so, then every working team is an organization, every group of artists, every orchestra, every casual association of people who have come together to ac- complish a common task . . . . "In conclusion, I would like to say one more thing. About two months ago a strange thing happened to me. Two people visited me in prison and offered me the chance to go to the USA. I refused even to consider the offer as long as I and my friends were still in prison, I don't know what would have happened had I accepted, but it is possible that I'd be sitting in New York right now, instead of standing before this court. So to a considerable extent, my presence here today is a consequence of my own decision, and that decision in itself is proof that 1 harbour no hostile feelings towards my country. On the contrary, it indicates that 1 still have faith in justice in this country. And I have not lost that faith even now." Dr. Benda: " I have five points to make. " I. The VONS founding statement was issued in April, 1978 and the Prosecutor General was sent a copy the same month. Criminal proceed- ings were not initiated against VONS until March 1979, and then only for the preparation of subversion, not for the act itself. If our activity were as highly dangerous to society as the indictment claims, the prosecutor ought to have acted the moment he learned of its existence, as the law requires . . . . 23 [pageend24]"2. The right of petition lias conti- nually been cited here [as being in- sufficiently broad to justify VONS activity] . . . but it must be realized that the complaints issued by VONS . . . were based on an entirely different article of the Constitution, one requiring all citizens to share the responsibility for maintaining social- ist legality. "3. It is a natural thing for the organs of justice to make mistakes, and the legislators have taken this in- to account, otherwise our three-tiered legal system [with its courts of ap- peal] and other means of legal re- course would not exist . . . . VONS was a direct appeal to these possibili- ties, and for this reason it sent all its reports to the competent author- ities . . , , "4. The indictment makes frequent reference to our contacts with foreign countries. I would like to point out that the subject of publishing certain texts abroad was never discussed at any VONS meeting, nor was anyone ever assigned that task, nor has this court established anything of the sort. All VONS documents were public, which means that practically anyone could have access to them. It does not follow, therefore, that be- cause they were published abroad, VONS had any contacts with foreign agents or foreign powers, "5. You reproach VONS for at- tempting to damage the interests of the state abroad. Supposing we were to admit that any eventual error in the VONS reports might actually have damaged the interests of our state; is it not clear then that a guilty verdict against us would damage those interests infinitely more than any harm we might have done? "1 am a notorious optimist and I believe that for these reasons we will be found innocent and allowed to walk out of this courtroom as free citizens . . * * * Otta Bednářová: "I don't intend to speak for long, for I can't put it as well as Václav Havel has. Neverthe- less, since I wasn't allowed to do so at the beginning, 1 would like to mention what motivated me to take part in the activities of VONS. In the 1960s, as a journalist, I was given the chance to take part in the rehabili- tation trials , , ," Judge: "Mrs. Bednářová, the court is not interested in that. Keep to the point," O. B.: "I only wish to say that I was a witness to how everything can suddenly collapse . , ." Judge: "Mrs. Bednářová, first you refuse to testify, and now you want to tell us . . O. B.: "I'm 52 year old and I'd some- how like to come to terms with that part of my life when Í remained silent, because I was young . . ." Judge: "Mrs. Bednářová, you are out of order," O. B.: "But I'm a member of VONS precisely because I recognize the monstrosity of verdicts that led to the gallows. I've dedicated my life to prevent something like that from happening ever again. I simply can- not live any other way, regardless of what the cost is to me." Otta Bednářová is cut off by the judge. In his final speech, Petr Uhl brought up the Helsinki accords signed by Czechoslovakia, and talk- ed about the need to amend Czecho- slovak laws according to the Inter- national covenants on human and civil rights that have become part of Czechoslovak law. Petr Uhl: "It is regrettable that Czechoslovakia today is probably the only country in Europe where a trial like this can still take place. I assume that we will be found guilty and sentenced - together - to several decades in prison. I am not a nation- alist, but I love this country, I am not indifferent to its fate and I wish to live here." Judge: "A court is not a discussion forum; we're here to judge your crimes." P. U.: "I do not consider that this court has any authority to judge me. I know that you, sir, will not be judging anything, for the decision has already been made in another place." Judge: "In that case you needn't say anything at all, if you don't consider us a court." P. U,: "I agree, it's pointless." * * * Jiří Dienstbier: "A society cannot be healthy as long as powerful indivi- duals prevent other citizens from taking an active civic stance . . . Judge: "That has nothing to do with . . ." J. D.: "I only wish to say that once, a certain functionary who was being criticized for his participation in the repressions of the 1950s defended himself thus: 'Comrades, ( have made many mistakes, but always with the party, never against it.' He was clearly giving us a recipe for banishing personal responsibility from human life . . , ," Judge: "But Mr. Dienstbier, the court does not know this comrade, nor are we interested , , , ." ,/. D.: "I'd only like to add that he was a functionary in 1952, in 1968, and is still one today. VONS was created as a committee of civic responsibility in the spirit of Charter 77, and it con- centrated on one of the most im- portant preconditions for the re- generation of society. The release of political prisoners would suddenly gain the respect of citizens and im- prove the respectability of the re- public abroad. And it is such a simple step to take. All it requires is the courage to make the decision." Judge: "The court does not need your advice. You arc to restrict your- self to the matter before the court." J. D.: "The indictment considers criticism of representatives of state institutions as subversion, slander, hostility, etc. Socialist society, how- ever, is the relationship of equal citizens. The organs of that society are a function of those relationships, and not of power over society. Nor are the institutions of the socialist state infallible. The trials of the 1950s are incontrovertible proof . . . ." Judge: "I've warned you to keep to the matter before the court." J. D.: "I only wish to say that if there had been public control, the presi- dent of the republic would not have to have spent ten years in prison." Judge: "Mr. Dienstbier, you are an experienced journalist and we know you have a way with words. You shouldn't have to read. Tell us some- thing in your own words." J, D.: "I only wish to say that public control and criticism can protect even the representatives of power themselves, not only from prison, but from the fate of Dr. Urvalek a n d . . . " Judge: "That will be enough. I've warned you , . ," J. D.: "Finally, I'd like to say that whatever happens, I will continue to believe in reason and justice, and in the unity of justice, law and truth. If this conception wins out today, if this court refuses to swell the ranks of the unjustly prosecuted, it would be an important victory for us all - the accused, the state power and all of society. A verdict of not guilty would prove that the state feels strong enough not to protect itself from its own citizens with bars." Judge: "Mr, Dienstbier, the court..." J. D,: "I'm about to finish. It was 24 [pageend25]said here that a hostile campaign has been waged against the republic in connection with this trial, which is the biggest political trial in the last quarter century. There would be nothing simpler than to undercut that campaign by bringing in a verdict of innocent. And I would like to believe that is possible." * * * Shortly after 8:00 p.m. on the second day of the trial, the judge. Dr. Kašpar, brought in the verdict. All six defendants were found guilty and sentenced to the following terms: Petr Uhl, five years; Václav Havel, four and a half years. Dr. Václav Benda, four years; Jiří Dienstbier and Otta Bednářová, three years. Dana Němcová was given 2 years sentence to be suspended for five years. Vladimír Valenta is a film director, script-writer am! actor. He lives in Edmonton. Athena. Comments on the Trial of Uhl et alii by Gordon Wright Analysing the matter from the point of view of a common lawyer one would have to say (1) The indictment is defective on its face, that is, the details given of the charge do not constitute the offense charged. Section 98 makes "subversive activi- ty" an offense. If thai phrase is to be construed to be consistent with An. 19 (freedom of expression and the right to propagate free expression by any means) of Pact I of the Helsinki Accord (which has been part of Czechoslovak domestic law since 2.1 Mar. 1976 - see collection of Laws No. 120 of 13 Oct. 1976) it cannot ex- tend merely to the dissemination of written material. It is clear that now "subversive activity" needs some- thing more ihan words (e.g. terrorist acts, or a conspiracy) to constitute such acts. (2) Neither the indictment nor the evidence set out what it was about VONS that made it "anti-state." The indictment simply assumed that pro- position in the 2nd line, and then passed on to the methods of propa- gation, and commentary on the contents, all of which is irrelevant if the activities were legal in the first place. (3) There was nevei any proof that the defendants acted "out of hostility to the socialist, social and government system of the Republic"; on the contrary all 6 accused were content with the socialist system: but they wanted it to live up to its constitution. (4) The supinity of the lawyers was shocking, even if, up to a point, understandable. It is understandable thai a man should lear to lose his livelihood, which ¡las happened to those lawyers, like Dr. Josef Danisz, who defended their clients vigorous- ly, or, as we would think in the West, normally. So lie should not take on a client if he cannot conduct the de- fence properly. But I cannot sec how a lawyer can take on a client and not defend properly. It is contrary to his oath when he becomes a lawyer. It only lends a facade of respectability to the trial, so that the lawyer is act- ing not for hisclicnt. but for the state, for the opponent. These lawyers evi- dently agreed that thcv could not quarrel with the case as a whole. Their clients were left to try on their own lo take the points noted above (1) that "subversive activity" cannot include the dissemination of infor- mation, true or false, (2) that the requisite intent was not present, and (3) that the work of VONS was not "anti-slate." Not that they got far. Uhl tried to elaborate (1) and was shut up by the judge. Kašpar. So he simply said it was hopeless, he did not recognize the Court, because it was obviously all decided. Havel tried (3) and was interrupted 5 times by the judge. Bednářová tried (2) and was told it wasn't relevant. What the lawyers evidently did agree was thai they could submit that the evidence did not implicate their own cliem. Not all did even that. Benda's lawyer was the worst. He congratulated the prosecutor on the indictment. He said that he was a good socialist, and so the only reason he was pleading not guilty was because his client insisted. 1 le spent much of the time in Court reading a car magazine. Bed- nářová's was the most energetic, taking some lawyer's points about the indictment saying that the material was transmitted to the 'courts and the public,' and 'at home and abroad,' but there was no proof againsi his client that she had had anything to do with sending the material to the public and abroad. The remainder were less than useless. None got at the guts of the case. (5) The indictment sets up a false de- fence for the accused and then, of course, demolishes it. This is that iheir right to VONS is based on the right of petition: but they did not just petition the Courts - they reached the public. Of course that is not the principal defence. Nevertheless (and Benda took this point in his defence) it was the case lhal all ol VONS state- ments were addressed in the first place to the authorities and trans- mitted to them, and later released to the public. (6) The procedure was unfair, and il- legal in many ways. (a) Bias. The bias of the court needs no elaboration. At the end of the case there was little or no consideration of the evidence before the judgment was given. The judgment did not review the evidence and its implication. The judge simply read the first page of the indictment, said it was proved and passed the senteces. (b) At the preliminary inquiry stage the names of the accused were pub- lished, contrary to the Penal Code. (c) The public was excluded from the trial. The trial was intentionally held in a small court room with room for only about eighteen persons other than court officials, the accused, their counsel, and the judges. There were 10 or 11 relatives present. But de- spite the throng of people wanting to attend the trial no one else was let in. The lawyers who had been sent as observers from other countries, cor- respondents from all the big press services, diplomatic corps observers, were not let in. and not a single member of the Czech public (other than relatives) was let in. When Uhl's wife Sabatová was arrested and dragged from the court Uhl's lawyer asked Tor a 'confidant1 to be seated in her stand. The judge, with amazing cynicism, refused this request since, he said, it was an open trial. Later the first day the public was excluded even from the Court House. Later still people were arrested for hanging about in the street in the vicinity of the Court House. Even the Time cor- respondent Barry Kalil was tempo- rarily detained for taking two pictures of the Court House. Yet on both days of the trial there were 5 or 6 empiv seats, even in iliat small court room. (One joke had it that the 5 empty seats were for the ghosts of Slánský et al). (d) The friends of the accused were not permitted to take notes. Thcv were doing this at the beginning. Kašpar told them that they could not take notes without his permission. Sabatová asked for permission. It 25 [pageend26]was refused. She insisted on her right to take notes. The judge ordered her removed from the court room. She was dragged away by the police, taken to headquarters, and ques- tioned by two interrogators. She said nothing. She was asked to submit to a body search and refused, A doctor was called and she still refused a body search. She was put in a punishment cell for several hours. This is a dark concrete cell with no furniture, but containing a Turkish toilet. (The latter proved useful be- cause she got rid of her notes.) Then she submitted to a body search and nothing was found. She was released at 1 a.m. on 24. Oct, into the cold Prague night (temperature about freezing) without a coat and without any money, since her coat and hand- bag had been left in the courtroom. (c) The material witnesses were not called. Only a perfunctory right of cross-examination was permitted. The evidence was mostly read out of the transcript of the preliminary in- quiry, when cross-examination is not permitted. Anything less likely to procure a fair trial is hard to imagine. (0 The length of the sittings. These lasted for 11 or 12 hours each day. It has been proved that no lawyer can function longer than ň hours per day, at the outside, at his best. And this probably goes for the judges as well. (g) No record of the proceedings is available. The record of the Slánský trials, even were available and pub- lished, at the lime. Hut not this one. Moreover there is no record in our sense of a verbatim record. There is only what is called the protocol. Argument ensues as to what goes in iti and the judge rules. But there is no record of the argument. This may be most important. Thus Bednářová tried to say she was drawn into the VONS work because she did not wish to see a repetition of the trials of the '50's of which she had had personal experience. She was told to move on to something relevant. She desired her point to be recorded in the protocol. The judge refused. The protocol will show only that there was an argument between the judge and the accused at that point, but not what it was. Now on an appeal, there- is no record of her defence. The indictment was not made avail- able to anyone officially, other than the accused and their counsel, at any time. Somehow it was obtained clandestinely a few clays before the trial. How can the accused defend themselves when their lawyers are frauds and they cannot give their friends the indictment? (7) Finally the common lawyer asks the question - suppose the mode of irial in Czechoslovakia was by judge and jury, would the result of the trial have been different? Surprisingly the opinion of those with whom I spoke was that ii cannot be assumed that the result would have been different. The reason lies in the apparent ac- ceptance of the official line by the great majority of Czech citizens. But a jury verdict must be unanimous, or nearly so. It is hard to believe that such would have been the verdict in this case. But even if we assume a people so cowed as to make that possible, which I doubt, we certainly cannot assume it for any length of time into the future. My own belief is that trial by one's peers, instead of by officials of the state, remains the single best guaran- tee of liberty, and the people of England have been right to prize this as the brightest jewel of her liberties since 1215, !>lll)!0 V/ISA 26 [pageend27]Conversation with a Former Occupier llya Gera! belonged to the younger generation of successful Soviet journal- ists. He was correspondent for Prav- da, Izvestia, Komstimolskaya Prav- da, and in Riga, the editor of the inter- national department of the magazine Soviet Youth and executive producer in the Soviet radio station Atlantika, which broadcasts programs abroad. He was also one of the Soviet journal- ists chosen to write speeches for top Communist functionaries, including Suslov. Tims Gero! had access to the highest places within the Party, de- spite his Jewish ancestry. In 1968 he was a politruk in the Soviet army in Czechoslovakia and gradually he began to turn away from official society. He started publishing anonymously in samizdat and later he signed an article in which he con- demned So vie! propaganda and anti- semitism. On the basis of that article, he H'flJ placed under house arrest and finally offered the choice of emigration Or internal exile. llya Gerol now lives in Vancouver, where he is a regular contributor to The Province. Writer Jan Drábek interviewed him for Západ. Západ: With such a spectacular career in the Soviet Union, what made you finally turn against it? Gerol: You know the higher a person's position is there, the harder it is for him to come to terms with every- thing. For example I used to buy meat in a special shop with a sign that said "LIBRARY" over the door. It would have been strange if one did not ask oneself from time to time why I couid buy meat in a "library" any time 1 wanted, while most people very seldom had meat on the table at all. The fate of Czechoslovakia also played a large role in this. Západ: While we're on the subject of Czechoslovakia, you were actually there during that fateful August of 1968. Can you tell us something about it? Gerol: At that time I was a politruk in the reserve. We were called up to active service about a week before the invasion. We officers knew very well why we were called, but the rank-and-file soldiers, of course, did not. 1 might even say that about half-a-year beforehand we saw very clearly that an invasion had to come, that the Soviets simply could not allow the Czechoslovak experiment to go on. When we later became a part of such an enormous injustice, it had a terribly depressing effect on some of us. We've been marked by it for the rest of our lives. Západ: It was said at the time that some Soviet units were not even aware that they were in Czechoslovakia. Was that actually true? Gerol: I think that to a certain extent, underestimates the intelligence of the Soviet soldier. Undoubtedly all our troops know where they were, but don't forget that the official reason given for the invasion was to prevent the emigrants of 1948 from invading Czechoslovakia along with the West Germans, Certain misunderstandings could have arisen if our soldiers had started looking about for these West Germans. You must have heard that Dubček asked the Red Army men who came to arrest him where the Germans were. He must have been familiar with the official version. Západ: We have heard that the Soviet leadership had to replace their troops after a few weeks because they had been too deeply infected with the Dubčekian ideology. Is that so? Gerol: I'm afraid that it's dangerous to think that way. The army was re- placed because it had achieved its aim. The country was conquered. The time had come to occupy it, and occupation naturally doesn't require so many indoctrinated people. Západ: What was the indoctrination like shortly before you crossed the Czechoslovak borders? Gerol: For example I personally lectured my unit on the situation in Czechoslovakia. The official version was this: West German units, with the help of emigrants from 1948, were preparing to invade Czecho- slovakia. Dubcek was a devoted Communist, true, but unfortunately he was too much under the influence of those revanchists and emigrants. So we were going to help Dubček out. We had no intention whatso- ever of interfering in Czechoslovak affairs; on the contrary, we were supporting Dubček, For that reason too we had been invited into the country by the Czechoslovak govern- ment. Západ: So no resistence was expect- ed? Gerol: No. On the contrary, we expected that the Czechoslovaks would welcome us. Naturally our soldiers were somewhat surprised when no one waved to them. Západ: So you don't think that any resistence was expected, not even by the highest officials of the Red Army? Gerol: Certainly not. Martin Dzúr, your Minister of Defence, was, as you know, informed of the intended invasion about five months before it took place. He even took pan in the planning of it and it was his job to frustrate any efforts on the Czecho- slovak side to resist militarily. He carried out this task excellently well. Vladimír Kaucký, the Czechoslovak ambassador in Moscow, knew about the plan as well. After the invasion he made a show of protesting, but before that he had been a member of the Soviet committee that organized the invasion. Západ: Did you notice any difference in the way Czechs and Slovaks behaved during the invasion? Gerol: Yes, The Slovaks, I would say, were somewhat more willing to collaborate with us. The reasons for this were artificially induced in the vast majority of cases. Slovak politicians like Vasil Bil'ak had a Jan Drábek f left) talks with llya Gerol 27 [pageend28]far greater influence on the Com- munist party than Czech functionar- ies of that ilk. We must also re- member that the Soviet leadership made a point of heightening as much as they could the differences be- tween the Czech and Slovak branches of the Communist Party, Západ: In other words they did the same as Hitler had done. Gerol: Precisely. The old tried and true methods were used. It is only in the West today that liberals still hesitate to draw the proper com- parison between these two systemsof totalitarianism. Západ: Se vera/ years ago there was a rumour that the Soviet Union was getting ready to annex Czecho- slovakia. Do you think that's true? Gerol: I think it's utter nonsense. Of course I heard the rumour as well, back in Moscow. You hear things like that every couple of years. I can assure you that everyone in high places in the Soviet Union laughs at such things. The thing is that today, it's practically impossible to add any more republics to the Soviet Union, its structure has already been defini- tively and finally set and everyone at the top is well aware that any further changes would he highly dangerous. I know from personal experience that most of the leading authorities in the Soviet Union consider the annexation of the Baltic republics to have been a grave mistake, and that it would have been far more to their advantage to main- tain them as appropriately subjugat- ed allies. Západ: And finally, let's compare the situation today in Poland with the situation in Czechoslovakia in 1968. What do you think will happen there? Gerol: I'm convinced that in the end, an invasion of Poland is inevitable. Not because the Soviet Union wants to invade, but simply because it has no choice. In my opinion the events in Poland are the most significant in the Communist world since the October Revolution. The unrest in Poland has definitively destroyed the final legend - that Communism is the rule of the working people. So the Soviets are well aware of how dangerous Solidarity is, not onlv for them, but for the whole Eastern bloc. Now the Soviets will wait for an official invitation and, unlike Czecho- slovakia, it probably won't be long in coming. And the notion that the Poles will fight back is, in my opinion, just a romantic legend. I don't put much stock in it. Ideology , Like Two Peas in a Pod by Josef Skvorecky There are various ways to anger a bull. According to tradition, the best way is to use a red rag. Marxist- Leninists, and particularly those in power, are angered by any kind of criticism, but the most reliable way to enrage them is to point out certain similarities between their doctrine (and the system deriving from it) and the doctrine and system of German National Socialism. Should the up- start who suggests such a thing be under their jurisdiction, they will refuse to discuss it with him and lock him up. If he happens to be beyond their imperial reach, they will pro- nounce him an arch-reactionary, and, if they happen to be academics, they may inundate him with in- dignant references to all the ways in which the two theories and the practice connected with them are different. It is true that they differ in some ways, but they are alike in one im- portant thing which is the funda- mental pillar of both communist and fascist regimes: the devoted party member, the so-called "healthy core," at whose own core is a certain kind of pathology. The conflict of these "healthy cores" with the world of liberal democracy - or, to put it in the language of personal experience, with the world of decent people, frequently living in indecent economic conditions - is not the conflict of the proletariat with those indecent conditions. It is a conflict that is non- collective, purely individual, and private. They were and are people scarred by private hatreds based either on some personal, deeply negative experience, either political (the execution of Lenin's brother; racism) or family (children rebelling against wealthy parents and so-called arm-chair bolshevism), or on a whole pleiad of causes that produce an inferiority complex: artistic frus- tration (Hitler), unfulfilled sex (all kinds of stormtroopers and their cult of male companionship) or - more often than it would appear-a physical inadequacy or even a physical handi- cap: here the classic example is Dr. Goebbles, to whom we shall return later. Today, in the pinkish atmosphere of western left liberalism, it is not common to examine the work of Freud's student Alfred Adler as widely and as thoroughly as that of the Master, for who wants to admit to himself, or herself, much less to the public, that he or she became a communist (fascist) because he or she suffered from bed-wetting as a youth? And so red liberals prefer to study Freud, whose purpose was - at least in the popular view - merely to cure sexual inhibitions, not political lunacies. They pay even less attention to another student of his, Wilhelm Reich, who demonstrated in Die Massenpsychologie des Faschismus, for example, that the tendency to join radically authoritarian movements could be Iraced back to an unfulfilled, perverted or suppressed sex drive. This conclusion can easily be applied to communism as well, as Reich him- self in fact did at the end of his life when he coined the term "red fascists". Adler atttl Engels Outside academic circles, Alfred Adler is practically unknown today, yet it was he who scientifically explained a phenomenon known to everyone who has ever had anything to do with organisations like the HJ (Hitler Youth), the BDM (the League of Young German Women), the CSM (the Czechoslovak Union of Youth) or the Komsomol (the Soviet Youth Organization): the dis- proportional number of members with physical or psychological handi- caps and malformations. Adler concludes - to put it briefly - that every instance of "inferiority com- plex" (based on some kind of in- feriority of the physical organs, frequently quite hidden) is somehow compensated for in the psychological superstructure of the personality. "Cerebral compensation" can even explai n the birth of philosophical systems and world pictures. Adler, in fact, paints the picture of "ideo- logical man": this creature is dis- tinguished by a strong tendency to hide his inferiority or to present it as a consequence of some form of heroism (a natural limp may be passed off as a war wound, and so on), and he is haunted by a feeling of insecurity, as though he were constant- ly surrounded by enemies (the notorious "party vigilance"). Very often he tries to contain the un- 28 [pageend29]certainty with arrogance or by play- ing the fool, and thus there mav be a smooth transition from a feeling of inferiority to a feeling of superiority and exclusivity, without the person ever becoming aware of it. The fktive view of the world created by his un- healthy mind gives rise to hypotheses and these become dogmas which the patient then clings to, considering them to be real at the same time as actual reality becomes lost from his view. Soon he begins to place exag- gerated demands of fanatical raith and discipline, etc, on himself and others, and shows a tendency to exploit valuable ideas and move- ments to achieve a feeling of self- worth and even of superiority, and also to devalue other people and thus their ideas and movements. Ultimately, he becomes the prisoner of an ideology that has thus emerged from pathological roots. As we know, this is what Fredrich Engels, had already defined as "false con- sciousness". It is wonderfully un- believable how Engels' idea meshes with Adler's conclusions. According to Engels, Ideology is a process through which the so-called thinker passes consciously, but on the basis of a consciousness that is false. His real motives, the concrete forces that are leading him, remain hidden from him, and he persuades himself of motives that are false or only ap- parent. Engels felt that in the final instance, those concrete forces were economic; Adler's opinion was that they were the consequence of an individual's negative personal experience. But the variance between the claims of Engels and Adler is, I think, only apparent, since economic factors are not only a source of false con- sciousness. This is confirmed by a well-known phenomenon, which is that in communist (fascist) parties, - alongside the various "radishes" (red on the outside, white on the in- side) and comrades who were in it for their careers - there have always existed those of whom ordinary people said, "He may be a com- munist (fascist) but otherwise he's a decent sort", and those who earn the curt dismissal: "communist (fascist) swine". Only the latter - if we discount the simple gangsters among them - are the real carriers of false consciousness, in other words they arc ideological in the real sense of the word and their genesis is not in the general social or national misery but in nocturnal incontinence. The "otherwise decent" types join these radical movements out of genuine social or national feeling, but they soon find themselves in conflict with the ideology and end up being liqui- dated or expelled from the party as traitors, revisionists, Rohmists, Titoists, cosmopolitanists, Gang-of- Fourists - the repertoire of expres- sions is almost endless and it all means simply that these unfortunates are quite normal people who have been led for a time down the doubt- ful byways of ideology by their sincere emotions and the critical state of public affairs. If we finally realize that a certain form of inferiority (the painful contradiction between their lack of experience and the wisdom it brings, and the intense desire to improve a world that is always im- perfect and frequently evil) is also a simple fact of youth and immaturity, it will help to explain the mass occur- ence of radicalism among young girls whose breasts are just beginning to sprout and young boys who secret- ly use anti-pimple creams and who then, when their breasis attain their proper proportions and the pimples disappear, are surprised at them- selves for having been so silly. In the final phase of ideology, however, ideological people almost die out and their places are taken by the gangsters. Let us return now to Dr. Goebbels as an archetypical illustration of Adler's iheory. As everyone may know, he was a person of extremely small stature and, moreover, he had a limp, a defect that was obviously congenital but which he later ascribed to a childhood accident. There were clear Adlerian reasons for this, but there was the added factor that as a cripple from birth, he would scarcely have fit into the prevailing racist ideal, where in any case he must have been very uncomfortable with his black hair and beautiful gypsy eyes. It is even said thai die allen Mit- kämpfer derisively invented a new racial category to accomodate him - "nachgedunkelter Schrumpfgermane" - which I translate as "latterly dark- ened shrunkgerman". Moreover he had an enormous head that stood in unpleasam contrast to his almost child-like body. In classical fashion, Goebbels compensated for all these esthetic shortcomings with his brain, and he did so in two fields. The more innocent one was his sexual agility, a field in which he excelled not only because of his status as minister, but also because he made up for what he lacked in height by cultivating the gift of speech, of verbal courtship. the gift of those black eyes and the beautiful, well-groomed hands. He was so successful that these com- pensatory charms hid from young maidens not only his limp, but also the fact that when he kissed them, he had to stand on tip-toe. The other field of compensation was more dangerous, and had tragic consequences for far more people. That was politics, ideology. Several factors were very probably decisive here. In the first place, Gocbbels had volunteered for military service when the First World War broke out, and the medical com- mission, naturally, turned him down. He locked himself in his room for several days and, to his friends, threatened to commit suicide. This frustration, combined with what he as a typical intellectual, saw as the disgusting petty bourgeois environ- ment of his law-abiding and God- fearing family, led him immediately after the war to a passionate study of Marx and Engels and later, of Lenin as well. He never ceased to admire the latter, and if one were to undertake a thorough analysis of his rhetoric, I think that a more than in- significant influence would come to light. The scholars of the Institutes of Marxism-Leninism, naturally enough, do not write about such things, but unfortunately it is an historical fact that can easily be proven by referring to those speeches by Goebbels that have survived. After entering the National Social- ist German Worker's Party, Goebbels joined its ultra-left and violently socialistic wing led by the Sirasser brothers. He became the editor-in- chief of their organ Nazionaisozia/i- stische Briefe, a Nazi periodical that is extremely interesting for the in- sight it gives into a chapter that has been erased from the official history of Nazism, first by Hitler and later by Marxist-Leninists. Goebbels wrote editorials for the NS Briefe that were particularly outstanding for their ceaseless propagation of the notion that the fates of revolutionary Russia and revolutionary Germany were linked together. Sometimes his prognoses were quite prophetic: "We look to Russia because it will walk with us as our closest partner on the path to socialism, because Russia is an ally given to us by Nature against the devil of temptation and the cor- ruption of the West." Or again: "There is far less linking us with Western capitalism than there is with Eastern bolshevism." And further: "If it came to the worst, we would 29 [pageend30]rather die along with bolshevism than live eternally as slaves of capital- ism.'1 According to Strasser, Goebbels at one time even saw in Hitler, whose concern from the very beginning had been not socialism but power, a traitor to the National Socialistic revolution, and at a stormy meeting of Strasserite party groups and trade unions in 1926, he is said to have shouted out in the heat of debater "I move that the petty bourgeois Adolf Hitler be expelled from the party," Lenin or I [¡tier? Very soon, however, he sensed that the future did not belong to Strasser but to the charismatic demagogue Hitler and he quickly became Hitler's intimate friend. Soon after he had suggested the Fiihrer's expulsion from the party, he delivered one of his most refined speeches which, among other things, is an interesting document of how close to com- munism the ideological Nazis (and not the pure gangsters like Goring, and gangsters always win out in the end over ideologues) were at the beginning of the movement. The title of the speech, Lenin oder Hitler (Lenin or Hitler) might tempt one to draw the simple conclusion that Goebbels was presenting commun- ism and nazism as something mutual- ly and irreconcilably exclusive. But that is not the case. The entire speech is infused with admiration for Lenin and his work. Far more space is devoted to Lenin than to Hitler, and Lenin's work is analysed in far more detail. But Lenin's historical achieve- ment, says Goebbels, is communist Russia, and German communists like Thalmann or Rosa Luxemburg are merely minor Russian agents in Germany. Over and against the revolutionary creation of the Russian Lenin, however, an equally valuable or even better creation can only be made by someone who is just as great as Lenin, but who will be thoroughly German. Such a person exists, and his name is Hitler. Just as Lenin carried out a violent communist revolution and thus changed the course of world history. Hitler too will carry out a violent National Socialist revolution and thus he, too, will change the direction of history. Goebbels - unlike most liberal and even many social democratic poli- ticians - understood the historical consequences of 1917 and his speech is full of undisguised sympathy for the bolshevik revolution. He even called it an important step forward for mankind. The Strasser brothers 30 had already warned German poli- ticians not to look at developments in Russia through the eyes of White emigrants, but Goebbels was an even more passionate advocate of co- operation with revolutionary Russia. He saw an alliance with the Soviets as the only possible guarantee of the German national future: social revo- lution in Germany, he felt, would be possible only if Russia were Germany's ally. Hitler's alliance with Stalin, which so surprised a world ignorant of Nazism, was therefore not merely the illogical consequence of some in- comprehensible wheeling and dealing by Ribbentrop, In Germany itself Goebbels dis- tinguished between three main poli- tical currents: the centre, "the bloc of the status quo and reaction; a con- servative bloc that is rooted in the (democratic) system." He included in it all political parties from the Social Democrats to the German National- ists, "for all of them stand under the protective umbrella of democracy, liberalism and capitalism: those values which they consider holy and inviolable." On either side of this "reactionary" bloc stood two revo- lutionary movements: the Com- munists and the National Socialists, "who have clearly recognized one thing and understood it thoroughly: if we wish to have the state of the future, we will not achieve it through reform, but through radical revo- lution, The system of liberal-capitalist democracy is internally so eaten away and so rotten that it can no longer be repaired or reformed. It must be destroyed to its foundations." Thus the common aim of both the Communists and the Nazis was the destruction of the bourgeois- democratic state. Afterwards, of course, there would necessarily be a conflict between these two allies but - listen closely - "this conflict must be carried on matter-of-factly, without demagogy and without a view to momentary advantages. We must get together," Goebbels cried histrionically, "with you of the left. After all, we essentially want the [pageend31]same thing. Our goal is freedom . . . . For us, the central problem of our time is the resolution of social ques- tions. Not social questions in the sense of higher wages and less work , . . Germany will be free the moment that thirty million on the left come to an understanding with thirty million on the right . . . . The social question is not a question of bourgeois sympathy, but state social- ist necessity. We know that our way does not lead through the ballot box, but through a complete destruction of the system, through revolution." For our purpose it is not important that the Strasserite trend, which in that speech still had a recognizable influence on Goebbels, lost out, or that the conflict between Nazism and Communism was, in the end, not merely demagogical but ultimately resulted in one of the greatest blood- lettings in modern history. The long- ing for an unlimited monopoly of power drowned out the rhetoric of social justice, and not only in Germany (what, in fact, is at the bottom of the Sino-Soviet conflict today?) and merely confirmed Lord Acton's old axiom that power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolute- ly. I am quoting all this to show that Nazism, even in some aspects of its theory (and I have not mentioned the party organization, the system of cells, the cell leaders, the informers, etc.) has a good deal in common with Communism, and that in its begin- nings, very much like Communism, it was a radically idealistic reaction to an unhappy, concrete reality in the name of a Utopian ideal. Fascism sees that idea) in the past: in an idealised, medieval organization of society; Nazism even saw it in an idealized form of prehistoric myth. Commun- ism sees it in an idealised Utopian vision of the future. If there is, theo- retically speaking, an essential difference, I don't know. The Triumph of the I'arty If we are aware of these none-too- familiar circumstances, we may understand a number of otherwise apparently illogical things. For example Goebbels' speech at a meet- ing of German film actors and directors in 1933 when he was already Minister of Propaganda, in which he held up Fisenstein's famous film Battleship Potemkin as an example to Nazi directors and declared that Eisenstein (who was Jewish!) was an example of a true artist. Poor Eisen- stein was so upset that he published an Open Letter to Josef Goebbels, and after what we know now of what be- came of Soviet cinematography, and of Eisenstein's own bitter fate, some of its formulations sound consider- ably ironic: "How can you dare ask that your film artists truthfully depict life without first asking them to appeal to the conscience of the world about the thousands who are being tortured to death in your own prisons? Where do you get the insolence to speak of truth at all, you who have raised a Babe! Tower of falsehood and lies?" Eisenstein wrote those words in 1934, when the first huge wave of Stalinist terror was getting under way and when artistic freedom in the Soviet Union was definitively crushed with the declaration of Socialist Realism. But it seems that his indignation was sincere, so sincere that he returned to Goebbels once again, on the occasion of completing Alexander Nevsky in 1938. In an article entitled My Subject is Patriot- ism, he launched an even more fiery attack on the good doctor Goebbels, only to be subjected to the embar- rassment of Stalin's pact with Hitler, in the interests of which his chauvin- istic, anti-German melodrama about the wise czar bravely slaughtering hoards of idiotic Teutonic knights, was banned for eighteen months. Nor should we be surprised by the curious fact that the script-writer of the famous film Das blaue Licht {The Blue Light), in which Hitler's favorite actress and later directress Leni Riefenstahl shone in the main role, and which Susan Sontag convincing- ly interprets as emphatically proto- nazi, was none other than the Hungarian communist Béla Balász. Neither will we consider it incom- prehensible that the German com- munist director Kurt Junghans, after making the swan-song of the socially critical silent film, Takový je život (Such is Life) in Prague in 1929 and who then worked for several yearson the production of an anti-American super-film in the USSR (which was scrapped only after Langston Hughes, who had been invited to lake part, declared that the scenario was utter nonsense and had nothing to do with American reality) return- ed - after 1933-to Germany where, in 1939, he directed an official docu- mentary on the history of the Party (not the Communist party) DieJahre der Entscheidung (The Years of Decision) until at last, he thumbed his nose at both ideologies and ran off to Hollywood, where he opened a photo supply shop. And it will no longer surprise us in the least to learn thai the corc of the notorious Flemish SS-Division Wallonien led by Leon Degrelle that, except for a handful of men, was wiped out after a heroic battle on the Eastern Front, was formed by several hundred former communists and members of the militant socialist organization Jeunes gardes social ist es, and that in the shadow of their apocalyptic defeat. Degrelle declared, "If Europe were once more to become a Europe of bankers, and fat, corrupt bourgeoisie ...then let Communism conquer and destroy everything. Rather let every- thing be blown up than to see here once again the triumph of decay." Nor will a statement made by Musso- lini's official ideologist in the so- called Italian Social Republic, Argento Soffici, seem absurd to us. Soffici said, "If the Axis powers were to lose the war, most real fascists, if they survived, would go over to the communists. Then we will have bridged the gap that has separated both revolutions." And finally, it won't seem too strange to us if, in reading the speeches of Hitler him- self, we discover that much in them is a mere translation of Leninist principles into National Socialistic jargon. One graphic example is the Fiihrer's exceptionally short speech at the Nürnberg Party Congress in 1934 (available in English in the published script for The Triumph of the Will). Mere is an excerpt: "At a lime when the Party had only seven members, it declared two principles. In the first place, it intended to be a truly ideological movement, and in the second place, it intended to be a movement that knew no compromise, that intended to gain total power in Germany and share it with no one. As a Party, we had to remain a minority because we mobilized only the most precious elements in the nation, capable of struggle and self- sacrifice, and they have never been in the majority. But because these men. the best men of the German race, grasped the leadership of the empire and the nation proudly, confidently, daringly and bravely, the people in ever greater numbers joined this vanguard and submitted to its leader- ship . . . . The Party will always be only a part of the nation, it will consist only of genuinely active warriors, of whom greater demands will be made than of the millions of their fellow citizens . . . . The Party will always represent the elite of political leadership. It will be un- wavering in its ideology, as hard as steel in its organizational discipline, 31 [pageend32]supple and flexible in its tactics . . . . Our aim must be for all Germans to become National Socialists. Only the best National Socialists, however, will be members of the Party." All of which is essentially nothing more than a paraphrase of such Leninist inventions as the notion of the party not as a mass government but an elite vanguard of the prole- tariat, his strict differentiation be- tween ideology and tactics, his bolshevisation of the Social De- mocrats into a party ruled by iron discipline, etc.* Three Bullets for Rudi But let us now leave these spheres of high political theory and notorious names. If we look, as the Stalinists would say, "below", we discover that the picture there is very similar. Let us take the political song, for example. Here too the basic laws of false consciousness apply: in other words, reality projects itself into the song-writer's consciousness in a distorted form which he and his listeners then perceive as a reflection of reality. Here are at least two delightful examples, in which false consciousness of reality has utterly changed reality into fantasy. The first is a song by the East German Marxist dissident Wolf Biermann about the West German left wing radical Rudi Dutschke, Drei Kugeln auf Rudi Dutschke. Here is the first verse: Drei Kugeln auf Rudi Dutschke Ein blutiges A ten tat Wir haben genau gesehen Wer da geschossen hat. (Three bullets for Rudi Dutschke A bloody assassination We all saw very clearly Who fired the shots) in the following verses, he identi- fies the three gunmen. The first is the Springer press, the second is a spokes- man for big business and the third is the Chancellor, a former Nazi who Schoss Kugel Nummer drei Er legte gleich der Witwe Den Beileidsbrief mit bei * An example of the compatibility of elements of fascist and communist ideology from the present: Thomas Sheehan, in an article entitled "Italy: Terror on the Right" in The New York Review of Books, January 22, 1981, points out that the Italian terrorist organization NAR calls its ideology "nazimaoism", bases it on the theories of Hitler, Mao-tse-tung, Perön and Quadafi, and its slogan is "Long live the fascist dictatorship of the proletariat". 32 (Shot bullet number three And then sent the widow A letter of condolence) A listener who knew nothing about Rudi and the attempt on his life in 1968, which was not made by any of the three above, but someone called Josef Bachman, will conclude from the song that Rudi died. More- over, he will get a vague impression that there was a group of murderers, probably hired, whose connections lead right back to big business interests. But Dutschke was only wounded, and he died years after the East German bard had sung his fate as an ideologically kindred spirit. There was no widow, and the only one who lost his life in relation to the incident was the would-be assas- sin, Josef Bachman, who hung him- self in prison in a fit of depression. The need of false consciousness to re- place reality with an obsessive fiction was, in the mind of the ideological song-writer, more powerful than reality, more powerful than truth. Authors of ideological songs are not, in any case, concerned about either truth or reality, but about emotional impact. For this purpose, a dead Rucli Dutschke is more effect- ive than a live one, and therefore the more useful Dutschke appears in Biermann's song. A Song for Angela Even more instructive is a song called Lied für Angela Davis, sung by the West German group Bonner Songgruppe. The song begins like this: Sie Hassen dich, weil du des Volkes Zukunft bist. Sie jagen dich, denn du bist schwarz und Kommunist. (They hate you because you are the future of the nation. They persecute you because you are black, and a Communis!.) In the verses that follow, the fate of Angela is identified - note well - with the fate of Joe Hill, Sacco and Van- zetti, the victims of the Klu Klux Klan and the "mass murders of imperialist gangs" etc. In other words, Angela is here listed among dead heroes. Just like Rudi, she is more useful dead than alive, and when the American jury didn't send her to the gas chamber (of course nowadays the death penalty for accessories to murder only exists in the lands of scientific socialism), the Bonner Songgruppe killed her for its own divine ends. It is no less amusing to discover that songs coming from apparently quite opposite ideological camps are, with very minor alterations, sung by both camps, and they resemble each other like those proverbial products of the pod. There are examples from Germany of the 1920s and 1930s, where there were regular exchanges of songs between SA troops and groups of members of the Com- munist Party of Germany. This ap- parently surprising circumstance can be explained by the fact that there was not so much enmity between the two camps as competition: they fought over souls, but the common enemy was liberal democracy, whose "terror" was a common feature of the songs of both camps. Here is an SA song: [pageend33]Wir leben in einem freien Staate, jedoch von Freiheit keine Spur. Statt dessen herrscht in unsrem Lande der Terror der roten Diktatur. (We live in a free state yet there's not a trace of freedom. Instead of this, our land is ruled By the terror of red dictatorship.) And here is the Communist version of the song: Wir leben in einem freien Staate, jedoch von Freiheit keine Spur. Statt dessen herrscht in unsrem Lande der weisse Schrecken, Schrecken - der Terror! (We live in a free state yet there's not a trace of freedom. Instead of this, our land is ruled By White horror, horror - Terror!) The only difference between the two texts is in fact the colour of the last line, and the attempt of the com- munist singers to describe the liberal democratic German republic as an even more hellish place than the SA- men. An ironic footnote to both songs is the genuine terror and the genuine horror unleashed by both ideological movements after their victories. And two more examples, sad, funny, frightening: Communists: Fasse Schritt, fasse Schritt, Hakenkreuz schlag entzwei! (To the left, to the left. Smash the Swastika to bits!) The Hitlerjugend: Die rote Front, schlag sie entzwei! H. J. marschiert, die Strasse frei! (Smash the red front to hits! The Hitler Youth are marching, dear the streets!) SA-men: Sprung auf die Barikaden, der Tod besiegt uns nur, ja nur! Wir sind die Sturmkolonnen der Hitlerdiktatur! (Leap on the barricades, only death, yes only death can lay us low! We are storm columns of Hitler's dictatorship!) And the communist version: Sprung auf die Barikaden, heraus zum Bürgerkrieg, ja Krieg! Pflanzt auf die Sowjetfahnen zum blutig-rotem Sieg! (Leap on the barricades, onward To civil war, yes, to war Raise the Soviet flag for a bloody red victory!) The identity of those and similar songs can be explained both by the vagueness of the expressions and by the actual migration from one group to another, not only of the songs, but also of their singers. In the lyrics themselves, everything is either extremely misty or extremely gene- ralized: hatred, joy, the enemy, blood, battle, sacrifice, terror, flags, hope, glory, victory, etc., all of it verbal ballast that can be used for this cause or that, against this or that, left or right. The fundamental characteristic of ideological poetics is precisely that: the result of the "creative" process is essentially acceptable to all ideologies. Songs make history In the struggle in Germany before 1933, both sides traded not only songs, but also members. In a book written by the composer of songs for the masses and member of the SA Hans Bajer, called Lieder machen Geschichte (Songs Make History) he writes about this: "The bar brawls and street battles between the SA and the Marxists, in which the latter very often outnumbered the former, frequently resulted next day in a large number of subdued Marxists presenting themselves to the Sturm- fuhrer and asking to be admitted to his Sturm. At first they were drawn by their respect for the men who were braver and could fight better. Soon, however, they became infused with the ideas of National Socialism, just like their other comrades in the Sturm, Horst Wessel was a master at attracting the best fellows in the Marxist formations and finding a place for them in his Sturm, much to the anger of the Communists. Obviously, these people brought with them the songs they were used to singing in the Red camp. But after a few alterations to the lyrics, the SA-men were soon singing them as well." The ironic peak of the left-right symbiosis is of course the case of the Internationale. Bajer writes: "One Sunday our Sturm held a propaganda march through North Berlin. One of the songs in our repertoire was a revolutionary song we called the Hitlernazionale. No sooner had we begun to sing it than windows began to open and people leaned out to shout a welcome to their, i.e. the Red, columns. It is impossible to describe how their faces fell when, instead of their own people, they saw our tight columns in brown shirts. The words of the Internazionale were at once sung from the windows: "Völker, hört die Signale! Auf zum letzten Gefecht! Die Internazionale erkämft das Menschenrecht!" But we shouted them down with alt our might with the words of the Hitlernazionale: "Schön jubeln Siegessignale! Schon bricht der Morgen herein! Der nazionale Sozialismus wird Deutsch- lands Zukunft sein!" The whole propaganda march was then concluded with the SA-men singing a very revealing song: Einst waren wir Marxisten. Rotfront und SPD heut sind wir Nazionalsozialisten, Kämpfer der NSDAP (We used to be Marxists, Red Front is ts and SPD Today we are National Socialists, Warriors of the NSDAP.) The ease with which people make these transfers from right to left and vice versa, both in song and in life, finds a more natural explanation in Adler than it does in theories of con- version. The ideological person does not convert, he merely shifts his allcgiance to another equally ideo- logical direction. Many people have an instinctive need to live in a world that is clearly organized, emotionally exciting, and quite simply, ritualized. It is an ancient need, reaching back beyond the dawn of human history, and mankind has worked hard to overcome it through the reflective thought of great thinkers from the ancient Greeks, through Descartes, Kant and Spinoza down to the en- lightenment (enlightened) philoso- phers of liberalism and democracy. And now, paradoxically, in our own Twentieth Century, ". ., perhaps not a single phenomenon from the pre- historic era of the human family is missing. Through the efforts of ideo- logists, all the intelectual fossils are reactivated and are influential once again. Rituals, magic costumes in the form of uniforms, fetishism, taboo, influence of medicinemen, charms and curses in the form of slogans and petrified clichés, the totemistic wor- ship of symbols, etc. etc. A cultural regression is taking place, character- ized by the large role in the mani- pulation of people played by hypnotic, suggestive connotations that reach into the subconsciousness of the object of indoctrination, without their really being aware of it. At the same time, however, these sophisti- cated interventions on the part of ideologists into the unconsciousness of mass man are themselves directed by subconscious forces. We are living 33 [pageend34]through the final phase of the total collapse of the Enlightenment." (Vladimír Karbusický, Ideologie im Lied, Lied in der Ideologie, Kóln, 1973). It is necessary, therefore to dis- tinguish between ideas and ideology. What is the criterion for this distinct- ion? The truth of the socio-critical reflection. A text that is born out of a powerful, personal and therefore direct experience of social injustice or repression contains within it the mora! force of truth. A song deriving from ideological, which is to say secondary "experience", or even one simply made to order ideologically, though its content may not differ from songs deriving from genuine experience, loses the pathos of truth that exists in original songs. There- fore old blues about anonymous lynchings have the power to move people even today, for they contain the truth of concrete reality. Falsehood is the final outcome of all ideologies, regardless of whether they were once born of authentic feel- ings or not. The point is that no ideo- logy was ever born from true feelings. Ideologies are formed by the misuse of feelings and valuable ideas- to solve the lacerating personal problems of certain people who shoot, or at least box their way to the head of ideological power formations or, at the local level, to the head of a hier- archy of functionaries. Because this psychological law is the same for all ideologies, it is hardly surprising that the consequences are always re- markably similar. Philosophy for the Household Backing a Lame Horse or: Have You Road the C ommunis! Manifesto? hy Stanislav Keiniš All of us have a philosophy of life of sorts, some complicated, some simple. The simpler it is, the more people Willing to believe it to the very last detail. Perhaps that is why Marx- ism has found such wide support, and not the least among people who suffer from philanthropism and an inferiority complex from Daddy's fat chequebook. How wonderfully unambiguous and simple is this doctrine! Society develops, it says, because the forces of production and the relationships of production develop. All society is organized around them. Everything else depends on them: politics, culture, poetry. Moreover, society is evil because it is divided into the exploited and the exploiters. The former think everything up, work hard, and are given less and less for their efforts. The latter do nothing except take everything from the others, spoil things for them and in general, act as parasites. The ex- ploited are the proletariat, and the future belongs to them. The exploit- ers are the bourgeoisie and they are the evil on earth personified. How easy it is for frustration, poverty, anxiety and anger, even against one- self, to fit into such a schematic view. Wipe out the bourgeoisie in a grand revolution, and we will have elimi- nated evil from the world. Anyone who criticizes this sche- matic view immediately becomes an enemy of humanity, progress and his own children. After all, the trend towards world revolution is inevit- able, Anything you may do to avoid revolution is reactionary. If, how- ever, you commit crimes in the name of the revolution, you are being progressive, because you are aiding the forces impelling humanity for- ward. A Revolutionary Class? The Communis! Manifesto - and all communist parties and many socialist parlies in ihc world swear by it - says this: "Of all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie today, the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class. The other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of Modern Industry; the proletariat is the spccial and essential product. The lower middle-class, the small manufacturer, the shopkeeper, the artisan, the peasant, all these light against the bourgeoisie, to save from extinction their existence as fractions of the middle class. They are, therefore, not revolutionary but conservative. Nay more, they are re- actionary, for they try to roll back the wheel of history." And so the proletariat, always poorer, always growing in number, swallows up all the other classes until finally all that remains are the proletariat itself and the capitalists. At that moment, its time has come to save humanity. The revolutionary nature of the proletariat, its destiny as the agent of great events and its independent existence is unquestion- ably the most fundamental principle of all Marxist parties in the world. The revolutionary proletariat justi- fies their existence and without it, they quite simply coulo not exist. We shouid ask ourselves, however, if this is really the case? Everything depends on the definition of the proletariat. In a footnote to the 1888 edition of The Communist Manifesto, Engels wrote; "By proletariat [is meant) the class of modern wage- labourers who, having no means of production of their own, are reduced to selling their labour-power in order to live." That needn't be such a bad thing. Almost everyone I know sells his labour-power in one way or another. To a state, a factory, a bank, a uni- versity, a company whose owner is not an individual but a corporation usually made up oT individuals who are also merely selling their labour- power. By that definition, therefore, anyone could be a proletarian - ministers, kings, executive directors of General Motors. We are all prole- tarians, and was Marx therefore right? And because we, the proletar- ians, govern ourselves through our proletarian liberals and conservat- ives, do we then have a dictatorship of the proletariat? Certainly not. The notion "prole- tariat" has a somewhat different meaning. A proletariat is given a wage for his work, but only enough to allow him to survive from day to day. The proletarian can live only as long as he is working. A proletarian, by his labour, does not create any property for himself. This much 1 surmise from Marx's Kapital. This is what Marx calls exploi- tation, It is no wonder he believed that revolution was the only hope for these proletarians. He also believed that their poverty would become worse and worse, and that the relative number of proletarians would increase until they formed an absolute majority of society. But - let us ask again: is this really the case? The Vanishing Proletariat People are not atoms that move in pre-determined orbits. Instead of the gradual proletarization and impoverishment of humanity, some- thing quite different occurred. In countries with the most rapid industrial development, production evolved not in the direction of a further intensification of labour and the increasing exploitation of a growing proletariat, but towards improving the technological standards of production. Hand in;hand with that went an increase in wages from a bare minimum to a level that could 34 [pageend35]guarantee a more or less decent standard of living. The proletariat is a revolutionary class because it has nothing to lose but its chains. But when the prole- tarian begins making more than a minimum wage, everything changes. The proletarian can save money, deposit it in a bank and receive interest. But interest is a form of gain without labour and therefore exploi- tation. The proletarian can buy a car, a television, a house, or he can invest the money and leave the work- ing class completely. He can even be happy. You may perhaps find a real proletariat in some of the develop- ing countries, but not where Marx most expected it. Changes in technology caused a lot of other changes as well, one of which was a transformation of the social structure of populations. There are fewer and fewer workers in the labour force. In the United States from 1958 to 1977 alone the proportion drop- ped from 37% to 33.4%, a process diametrically opposed to Marx's prophecy. On the other hand the number of employees with a univer- sity education grew in the same period from 11% to 15.1%, and the number of office workers from 14.5% to 17.8%. From this it follows that the number of workers today, the inheritors of Marx's proletariat, is gradually declining. Richard Bell- mann, a mathematician for the Rand Corporation, estimated that by the year 2000 only 2% of the work force would manufacture all the good necessary for the material well-being of the whole of society. Others esti- mate the percentage at 3-11%. Marx's revolutionary proletariat has silently vanished into history. The communist parties, that revo- lutionary vanguard of the proletari- at, have even begun to suggest that the dictatorship of the proletariat is no longer necessary. It should go a step further, however: the dictator- ship of the proletariat is unrealizable because the proletariat no longer exists. Progress vs. Reaction? If you construct a philosophy on faulty assumptions, the whole system will be wrong. If you build a state on faulty principles, it may work for a while because people will find ways around it and through it, so that they can survive to collect their pensions, but essentially, it is a bad state, and there is no help for it. In the case of Marxism, the faulty assumption is the doctrine of the proletariat as a "progressive" class and the other classes as "reaction- ary". Everything else - the system of government, the repression and de- struction of people and entire classes and nations, the repression of persona! initiative, the Gulag, the fat cats in the party apparatuses - all that is merely a logical con- sequence of that primary, original error. Yet all communist parties and most socialist parties in the world cling to that error, and that is why they are unreformable. The organization of power in the Marxist-Leninist system is based on the following simple consideration: the world is developing towards the absolute idea of c o m m u n i s m , whether people want it to or not. In the course of this development, individual classes fight with each other. Some classes are reactionary and try to maintain the status quo and impede the development of production and society wherever they can. The only progressive force at the present time is the proletariat, and the most progressive sector of that class is its vanguard, the party. For that reason the party must have the leading role in the life of society. Why let members of non-proletarian parties participate in government? They would only try and roll back the wheel of history anyway and get in the way. Given this iogic, Leonid Brezhnev is a better Marxist than the Prague reform communists were, and the best Marxist of all was Pol Pot and his cutthroats in Cambodia, for they were the ones who most thoroughly solved the problem of supressing the exploiting classes in the interest of progress. Is there really such a thing as a revolutionary class? In order to arrive at some conclusion, let us look at the probable factors involved in the development of society. As we look around us, we realize that social development is in fact the sum total of major and minor changes in various branches of life. Every day, people come up with new ideas, dis- coveries and inventions which are realized and gradually change the world. This is true not only of materia! things, but also of organi- zation, culture, philosophy, relation- ships between people, government measures, everything. Are these new ideas the exclusive property of the proletariat? Was it they alone who proletariat? Was it they alone who invented computors and pocket calculators, who transformed our lives by developing new methods of farming, who solve problems of energy, cancer, memory, who come out with new ideas, put them into practice and develop them further? Who is most important in this whole process, the worker or the organizer of production, the inventor or the scientist, the consumer or the distri- butor, the one who maintains order or the one who collects taxes to build schools with? It is difficult to pin- point individuals or classes with a claim to primacy and the right to call themselves leaders of progress. Membership in a certain class gives no one a patent on rationality, nor does it prevent one from contributing to what we call social progress. The class does not exist whose members are exclusively progressive or ex- clusively reactionary. But that way of thinking is in direct contradiction to the theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism, We have, then, two approaches to the sources and causes of development. The one claims that all people are useful regardless of what class they belong to, and that all have a right to share in the proceeds of labour and decide on how they shall be used. Let us call this point of view humanistic and democratic, humanistic because it adds another dimension to the spiritual and moral aspects of human personality, and democratic be- cause democracy is only worthwile when we attribute to each person their full worth, regardless of class and origin. The second approach is that only the members of one class are useful, and the rest are pests to be ruthless- ly stamped out, who are good for nothing or misguided, unworthy of enjoying rights in short, hopeless incompetents who require leader- ship. There are quite enough systems like that, above all, of course. Marxist systems. But other "new classes" such as managers, intellectuals and Stanislav ReiniS. a member of the editorial hoard of Západ, is a doctor and a psychologist. He is professor at Waterloo University in Ontario. 35 [pageend36]so on arc occasionally held up as a substitute for the proletariat. If we once concede, however, that a single class is most important, then we abandon the essence of democracy and the difference between Marxism and democracy disappears. There is no kinship between democratic and elitist opinions. One cannot be grafted onto the other. People can't be democrats and Marxists at the same time. If they say they are, they are lying to them- selves. Creativity vs. Control Everything that has been said here has many more implications. One of them is appreciating the importance of the human intellect, enterprise and curiosity in the development of society. Only societies that make use of these human characteristics and allow people to realize their ideas without pointless restrictions or limitations can be truly progress- ive. Human creativity, however, requires the highest degree of free- dom to flourish, backed up by a system of human rights, including the right to carry on a business and express one's opinions, even against the bureaucratic system. Each new generation wants to change the world, and it should be given the opportunity to do so. Only that can lead to change, to development. It is no accident that socialist countries are run by old men who can scarcely get through an hour-long meeting without falling asleep. In such societies, change is not a necessity; on the contrary, every change is a threat to stability. Another logical implication is that personal freedom and all the rights connected with it are not just theo- retical fictions dreamed up by philosophers and radical students, they are above all the most iim- portant condition for any progress and development in the contemporary world. A person is most useful to society when he can think freely and act accordingly. It follows from all this that the proletariat is not the chosen class to save mankind, and thai in fact no such class exists at all. An optimist might object: "But surely that doesn't make any difference. Even so, we can still achieve what the Communist Manifesto recommends and thus create a wonderful, happy, conflict- free society. If we transfer the owner- ship of the means of production into the hands of the people, or the state, whether the state is proletarian or not, we will then be masters in our own country and will live for ever without class conflict and poverty. I.et us reply to the optimist first with a quote from the classics. The Communist Manifesto says: "The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by degrees, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to c e n t r a l i z e all i n s t r u m e n t s of production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the proletariat organized as the ruling class; and to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible." If we wish to grasp the causes of all the evil and nonsense that reigns in socialist countries today, we have to begin with that question, for it lies at the root of it all. In the Marxist sense, a socialist or proletarian revolution means that the means of production are ex- propriated and become the property of the proletariat, or to put it a better way, the proletarian state, h is, how- ever, impossible or at leasi impractical for every worker to have a say in everything. Therefore the proletarian state must construct an administrat- ive apparatus which directs the socialist economy under the leader- ship of the Party. In practice that means that the administrative ap- paratus takes on many more functions that traditionally were not the res- ponsibility of the state, or at least not so absolutely. The State and the Party become the exclusive employ- ers, and have a monopoly on the production and distribution of all goods, and on the approval and dis- tribution of informal ion. They be- come the Great Policeman, the Great Personnel Manager, the Great Teacher and the Great Doctor. The State becomes everything: the only judge, the only prison guard and almost the only landlord. That is far more than the greatest monopoly capitalist enterprise in the world could ever get away with. Stifling Bureaucracy This role of the state naturally requires the construction of a monstrous system of bureaucracy, which bears comparison with nothing else in history. Like every other bureaucracy, this one too is deep'y conservative. Like the rotting leaf cover from last year, held together by the mycelium of mutual relation- ships, this system covers and sur- passes everything that might grow and bring forth fruit. The bureau- cracy interprets the laws, and where the laws get in their way, they twist them to suit their own ends. Where the law is insufficient, they create new ones. Here Marxist ideology serves their ends and they apply it; there il does not, and they ignore it. The bureaucracy grows according to Parkinson's Laws and becomes the state. But all that is the entirely in- evitable consequence of what the Communist Manifesto advised us to do, One of flic greatest achievements of contemporary propaganda is that despite the immensely negative experience that mankind has had with socialism for all these principle reasons, and despite the hundreds of millions of victims, despite the stagnation and rot, people and groups can still be persuaded that socialism is essentially good and that all the negative things are the fault of dogmatists, revisionists, Stalinists, Maoists, of Husak, Brezhnev, etc. Then, instead of "state capitalism", naive idealists offer some other, better system where people would feel freer, could develop more posi- tively, where there would be more democracy than in a democracy and more happiness than in paradise. Very seldom, however, do we ever learn what this system would be like. How in fact do these socialists with a human face, these pluralistic social- ists, these Eurocommunists and others really think? What cheeksand balances would they put in the way of the monolithic colossus of the socialist stale administration? For this system has its own inner as- sumptions and laws without which it could not function at all. Il is there- fore uncertain whether it is possible to construct a system in which the state has all the economic power, owns all the means of production, and at the same time, provides free elections, freedom of decision and self-realization. The ability to foresee people's needs, the ability to alter the ac- customed course of things, the ability to look ahead, are. however, common human abilities,and noi the privilege of a few grey-beards in the Stale Planning Department. One of the inalienable rights of man is the right to realize his ideas. That is the essence of democracy. It concerns noi only scientific research or art, but all the other branches of human activity, both productive and non- productive. Without enterprise, without the liberation of the creative forces ofall people who are willing to think creatively, humanity will not be able to solve the problems thai confront it now. 36 [pageend37]Law An Unpleasant Report on American Judicial Practices by O l a U l c Recently, the Associated Press reported this item of news from Baltimore: James McClain, a twenty- live year-old black man, murdered his ten-motith-old son by throwing him down a garbage chute on the eleventh floor. He had freely admit- ted to the act, but the Supreme Court of the State of Maryland retro- actively introduced the rule that the accused must be brought before a court commissioner within twenty- four hours. McClain was arraigned twelve minutes late and therefore the charge against him was perma- nently dropped. An exception? Not at all. It's the rule. One of these rules is called the Miranda Rule, a bulwark of human rights. It was applied, for example, in the case of José Suarez, of 301 Hooper Street, Brooklyn. Suarez was neither under the influence of drugs, nor drunk, nor even particularly agitated, but he took a knife and stabbed his whole family - his com- mon-law wife Maria Torres and their five children. With his knife still dripping blood, he turned himself in at the local police station, showed them the scene of the crime and the dead bodies, described the event and signed a confession. The court as- signed him a defence attorney, who tried to gel the widower to withdraw his confession. When he was un- successful, the lawyer began digging into the records and discovered that the police had failed to inform Suarez. properly of his right not to confess. He was freed by the courts. Washington again: A fellow threw a Molotov cocktail in anger into a house, a mother and three children almost burned to death, and the house was entirely destroyed. A uni- formed policeman appeared at the scene of the crime and the arsonist approached him with the words, "I did it." And he was not found guilty. His lawyer argued successfully that the very presence of the man in uni- form constituted "psychological coercion" and thus the arsonist had been deprived of "his Fifth Amend- ment privilege against self-incrimi- nation". On March 2, 1980, the popular television program 60 Minutes dealt with the case of a young man who had shot his father, his mother and his grandfather and then called the police. The investigators warned him against confessing but to no avail. The murderer repeated his confession both to the District Attorney and before the court. And yet he was found not guilty. The Supreme Court of California decided, by a vote of four to three, that the efforts of the investigators to dis- suade him had not been vehement enough. I could fill the remaining pages of Západ with similar cases. We see all sorts of people and things on television. A professional killer, for example, still in active service but not in prison. The producer Walter Susskind introduc- ed him as Joey. Later, Joey came to Binghamton. N.Y., where 1 live, to give a lecture (November 13, 1980) on his trade, "I've broken more legs than there are people in this hall," he told us. And what about murders? Had he ever gone to jail for them? "What do you think loopholes and expensive lawyers are for?" he said. "What 1 do is business; 1 don't do it because I enjoy it." (Quoted from a newspaper.) There is nothing like plain speaking. The activities of a hired killer may not be pleasant to contemplate, but after all, it's just a way to make a living. Joey was re- warded by his listeners with stormy applause. And Binghamton is not a den of murderers or a Mafia city; on the contrary, we're a quiet town, with a large Slavic population. The Debate on Quality The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, Warren E. Burger, claims that the American judicial process is impossibly formal- istic, capable of being stretched to infinity, with more rights for the criminal than for his victim, and that half the legal profession in any case is not properly qualified to do its job. Yet other important personalities have a rather different view of the matter. In the words of Franklin E. Zimring, a professor at the Univer- sity of Chicago, "It is the worst system you could imagine except for all the others," - in other words, the best system in the world. It is not without interest that the greatest critics of the system and advocates of reform are conservat- ives, and not people like Angela Davis or Jane Fonda. Alexander Solzhenitsyn talked about it in his address to the Harvard graduating class of 1978. He mention- ed the absurd emphasis on the rights of the individual to the detriment of the rights of society. In a country of the Soviet type, an individual has no rights at all, and that is bad. But how much better and more moral is a system in which law and truth are denied to society and the state, when they are strangled in the legal loop- holes of those who abuse their free- doms? In the uproar over individual rights, society has become defence- less. The bearded bard pounded away at this hard truth in his hard Slavic accent, only to confirm liberal circles in their opinion that he is, after all, an incorrigible reactionary with quite expressly fascistic ten- dencies. Even the most progressive of thinkers, however, can not make the horrifying facts and figures go away. E i g h t e e n - y e a r - o l d Eric Thomas was arrested sixteen times in all for crimes committed with a firearm. He was not found guilty a single time. Moreover, between November 1978 and August 1979, he murdered five people. He will, however, be sentenced, according to the New York Times of March 20,1980. Or take Nathan Giles, a black who already has several murders to his credit. He has been sentenced for some of them, but always released shortly afterwards, though the authorities are aware that he is an unrehabilitatable hyena. After his most recent release, he took a twenty- five-year-old girl Bonnie Ann Bush, ripped her clothes off, raped her, shot her and then set her on fire while she was still alive. Several witnesses phoned the police while he was still at it, but the guardians of order did not feet it necessary to intervene. "There's obviously some- thing wrong with our parole system," admitted a spokesman for the New York State Division of Parole. 37 [pageend38]Since 1967 more than three thousand policemen in New York City have been murdered. Not a single murderer was executed. Re- actionary voices, however, have been heard mumbling something about self-destructive priorities. The same standards cannot be applied to the criminal and his victim. One such victim, a Mr, Seth Weis- man, wrote in the New York Tunes: "A several-time criminal who is work- ing now without a licence as a taxi- driver at Kennedy airport, stabbed me. For this he was given a suspend- ed sentence and is still driving a taxi illegally. When I went back to the court as victim to demand an expla- nation as to why this violent criminal was not behind bars, they told me it was none of my business." Why should the state guard and support criminals? If you're so concerned about it and you can't supress your reactionary lust for revenge, we'll see what we can do, but it will cost you something. Miss Elaine C. Summers, a twenty-seven- year-old lawyer, was raped in a park by twenty-year-old Joseph Columbo, Jr. He was given a suspended sen- tence, but the victim didn't leave it at that. She initiated a civil damage suit and won $12,000, of which she didn't receive a cent, and then she brought forth an ancient law accord- ing to which the rapist had to go to jail but on condition that the plain- tiff pay his expenses, which amount- ed to $28 a day in the Hartford. Connecticut prison. And this brings us back to Solzhe- nithsyn's question: Which is better, a state that is too involved in the individual's life, or one that abdicates its responsibilities? The more the crime rate grows, the less crime is punished. In 1935 the state of Illinois, with eight mil- lion inhabitants, had 12,000prisoners behind bars. In 1975, the population had risen by a third, the number of prisoners had decreased by half and the murder rate had risen by several hundred percent. Progressive thinkers tell us that crime is the fault of society and un- bridled exploitation. But there certainly must have been even more unbridled exploitation before the Second World War, and the living standard was notably lower during the Depression in the 1930s than it is today, and yet look at the crime statistics. It cannot be overlooked, for example, that the black popu- lation, that has a higher living standard per. capita than the so- called H i s p a n i c s ( p a r t i c u l a r l y Mexicans and Porto Ricans) has at the same time a crime rate of from four to live times highers. Because white racism is at fault, comes the answer. But is this really the case? How then are we to explain the fact that American citizens of Chinese and Japanese origin break the law far less than the white major- ity? I live half-way between the Port of New York and the Canadian border. It is 500 miles from New York City to Toronto, But compare this distance: the American metropolis has three times as many inhabitants and thirty-four times the number of murders. In gentle Denver in the state of Colorado, more people die violent deaths than in the whole of England. And that is ali peanuts compared to Detroit, a city with a dying automobile industry and the championship in murder. But, as we have already said, we lock people up less and less and when we do punish them, we do it in strange ways. Working Methods In the first place, there is no uni- formity. There are fifty stales plus Washington D.C.. plus the federal courts, and each legal system is different. In Alaska marijuana is legal and in Alabama, you can get life for a single puff. In Alabama Hefhn Mack Lankfort was sentenced to life imprisonment for driving a car under the influence of alcohol and causing an accident in which one person died. In the state of Washington, a driver named Mark Alan Sankey drove through a red light and killed three pedestrians. His punishment: ten days in prison. I have already mentioned the generosity of the state of New York in terms of whom and what they forgive. But this does not apply to everyone, Jeff Reeves, 34, who is blind and without a criminal record, was sentenced to life for selling a single dose of cocaine. According to a report of the justice committee in the state of Louisiana, some judges behave in a very interest- ing fashion. For example Judge William Hawk Daniels of Baton Rouge, the state capital, decides cases "by the Hip of a coin", heads he's innocent, tails he's guilty. Some- times he lets the public vote on the verdict, including minors. Once he let a whole scout troop vote. Judge Daniels also likes to fine people for the amount of money they have in their wallet. The old man with the coin doesn't bother me so much. What I consider a far worse defect of the American legal order (or rather disorder) is its forma/ism. The form of justice is more important than its essence. The point is not to determine the truth, the guilt or innocence of the defend- ant, but rather to preserve the procedural ritual, and the more loop- holes one can find to snatch robbers and murderers from the jaws of the state, the more impressive is the defending attorney's reputation. Are defence lawyers immoral? They are amoral. The never even consider it, "My job is to get my client off, and even if he's the worst bastard under the sun, it's none of my business," I was told calmly by a silver-haired, bespectacled gentleman, one of the most famous hot-shots of his profes- sion who is paid three hundred dollars an hour for his services. In November, 1977 a young man by the name of Steven Masover robbed a local bank. Using a pistol and a bomb, he took three hostages and $78,000 in cash. He fled and was later caught and tried. The jury acquitted him. According to Cali- fornia law, the District Attorney has to prove that the robber intended to deprive the bank of its money perma- nently. That, of course, is an im- possible condition to prove judicial- ly. Anyone can say that he only intended to keep the money tempo- rarily. In California, therefore, it is impossible to find a bank robber guilty. In Syracuse, a university town in New York state, a mechanic ap- peared in court accused of murder. To his lawyer, Francis R. Beige, he confessed not only to that murder but to two others as well. The lawyer found the bodies and photographed them. Then he went to the District A t t o r n e y with the fo (lowing proposal: if you go easy on my client, I'll provide you with information on other murders, for which, of course, my client must never be indicted. If you cannot promise me this, I won't show you the bodies. The question was raised as to whether the lawyer - or "officer of the court", whose function is to seek after truth and justice - has the right to cover some- thing so unsavoury up. The Bar Association's ethical committee looked into the case and came to the conclusion that Beige had behaved with utter propriety. Such proposals made to District 38 [pageend39]Attorneys lead to what is called plea bargaining. Let's say that I had tried to do my wife in with a knife and I hadn't been able to finish the job properly. The District Attorney charges me with attempted first degree murder. My lawyer comes forth with a counter-proposal; I will confess to the misdemeanor of the careless handling of a kitchen utensil. The district Attorney rejects this but is willing to accept attempted manslaughter out of negligence. Now our side rejects this. The men of the law meet a few more times, both of them compromise somewhat, then shake on it, go the the judge with their deal and he brings his gavel down on it and justice will be done. Satire or caricature? Then let us go from hypothetical cases to an actual one. Calvin Jackson, a 26-year-old recidivist, confessed to the murder of nine elderly ladies whom he had strangled or stabbed. The Manhattan police showed no interest in this activity and put together a case based only on charges of robbery with violence, which carries a fifteen-year sentence. Then plea bargaining took place, the prosecution and defence attorneys came to an agreement and the judge confirmed the deal. The agreement was that the mass- murderer would got to jail for thirty days.*Days. 1 don't know about you, but my stomach still revolts at the thought of that cheap haggling and horse- trading. Interestingly enough, the practice is no secret. Jurists neither blush nor apologize for it. On the contrary, the United States Supreme Court, the highest court in the land, considers plea bargaining as an elementary essence of the American judicial process, without which the entire judicial machinery would fall apart. Only ten percent of those charged ever come before a jury. The vast majority of cases are settled by these cute little business deals. Punishment In the first place, the sentences fixed by the court and the actual time spent in prison rarely have anything to do with each other. It is possible to be sentenced to more than one term at once; for instance, to twice ten years concurrently, or conse- cutively, On June 2, 1980, the Mormon patriarch and polygamist Ervil LeBaron was sentenced in Utah to life for two consecutive terms. When he dies, therefore, he will only have served half his sentence. He will have to rise from the dead and go to prison once more. Theory and practice vary widely in terms of the length of sentences. On May 21, 1980, a district judge in Tulsa, Oklahoma, sentenced the recidivist and rapist Robert Eugene King to a consecutive term of 1,700 years. Judge Richard Samueis of M a r h a m , Illinois sentenced a murderer to 2,600 years. Will he have to wait till the middle of the 46th Century before his release? Of course not. In eleven years and three months he will be eligible for parole. In the same state, Illinois, a creature by the name of Richard Speck murdered eight nurses at once and was sentenced 10 a term that can be expressed in the formula 50-150 x 8. He was given from 50 to 150 years in prison eight times over. But accord- ing to a UPI report from April 6, 1976, Speck is already eligible for parole. Inhuman, fascist conditions in American prisons: even the Soviet press supports indignant American liberals. A prisoner writes an average of twelve letters a week. The stamps are paid for from the public purse. But the public purse draws the line at special delivery and registered letters. This barbarity is apparently being studied by the appropriate committee of the UN. More than once now inmates of the Altica prison in New York state have gone on strike. They refuse to leave their cells, type, sleep. Out of three hundred and fifty only a hundred came for breakfast. Only twelve murderers showed up for a basketball game and a few of those went sunbathing instead. The rest protested against arbitrariness and violence. "Tell the people we won't compromise!" declared the killers with raised fists, assuming, quite rightly, thai the state would meet their demands, for instance, for more prompt relaying of their telephone messages. El Paso, Texas: Judge William Sessions declared that prisoners did not have enough room in the prison for their proper comfort and order- ed them to be transferred to the Plaza Motor Hotel at a cost of $22.50 per day per capita, the bill to be payed by the taxpayers. When the hotel's insurance company protested, the judge found another solution: he sent the criminals home. It is truly hard not to think about what Solzhenitsyn said at Harvard and what he experienced in Siberia. Prospects Is there hope for change? Yes. Something is already being done - or at least people are talking and thinking about doing something. "American criminal justice has broken down," the respected column- ist Richard Reeves wrote on February 14, 1981. A new academic discipline has been born - victimology - and a number of states have already passed laws assisting the victims of crime. Congress is debating the reform of criminal law, the necessity of elimi- nating the extremes in judicial practice, the introduction of mini- mum sentences and the cutting back of procedural formulae that benefit the wrong-doer and harm society. The mood of the nation, however, is angry and truly conservative. I've experienced this personally: in February 1981. the deserter Robert R. Garwood was found guilty by a military court of collaborating with the enemy m Vietnam and commit- ting "heinous and disgusting crimes". Nevertheless, the deserter was sent home with $147,000 of accumulated pay for the time he spent in the enemy's service, I wrote an acerbic article in the Binghamton paper, pointing out that in other countries such cases were settled by firing squad, whereas in the USA, betray- ing one's homeland was rewarded more highly than serving it. And I didn't get a single letter or tele- phone call of disagreement. At the local high-school, the young people of this post-Vietnam generation posted the article on the bulletin board and added 180 signatures to it. This is all encouraging, but I don't believe there will be any structural changes, at least not in the near future. The Anglosaxon legal system was and will remain formalistic. The American Civil Liberties Union will continue to struggle for the inalien- able rights of the filthiest murderers and will not shed a single tear for the fate of their victims. It is not in the vested interests of the legal com- munity to simplify and modernize the law or the speed up procedures. Most legislators are lawyers, and they are not about to saw off their own limb on the tree of plenty.

September 17, ¡980, in Sacra- mento, California. Ladies and gentlemen, Human experience is always far richer than human thought. Twelve years ago, when I lived in the small, central European country of Czecho- slovakia, 1 had no idea that I would one day become an American citizen. But in 1968 the Soviet tanks rolled in and within a few hours, an army half-a-million strong hud occupied my country. It was claimed to be a temporary measure, but to this day the troops have not left. At that time 1 shared the opinion of those students who wrote a new equation on the walls of Prague: "Brezhnev is Hitler". I wrote a book condemning the fascist Soviet invasion and as a result I was stripped of my Czechoslovak citizen- ship and sentenced in absentia to eight years in prison. I had the good fortune to be able to serve this sentence in California, where the climate is far nicer than in Siberia. The Soviet invasion was not the first time a foreign army had occupied my country, because I was thirteen when Hitlers army marched into Prague, and it meant execution lor my uncle, the death sentence for my cousin, and concentration camps for my Jewish friends. Seven years later the Nazi army was replaced by Soviet forces. I welcomed this new occupation in 1945 with enthusiasm. 1 felt that it marked the beginning of a new life in a socialist society which, as I believed with the vast majority of the nation, would create social justice and freedom for every citizen in this newly liberated (truly liberated?) land. But that did not happen and I can tell you with absolute certainty that the next seven years under Stalin enabled the majority of people in Central Europe to realize how empty the slogans about the "building of socialism" were. The point is that if you give up your personal free- doms - today we would call them human rights - in the hope of thus attaining "social justice", then you will lose your freedom without ever having attained social justice. Seven years under Hitler and seven years under Stalin is enough to provide anyone with an unforgettable political education, because you learn - not from books, of course - that totalitarian dictatorship is government of the bureaucrats by the bureaucrats and for the bureau- crats. It took me almost ten years to understand this and to shed my Utopian illusions about what had improperly been called socialism, but when I finally made the break, my difficulties as a critic of the system continued to haunt me. Today 1 can look back with a certain sang-froid on the first ten years of my adult life, but where was one to learn about the principles of democratic govern- ment under Hitler or Stalin? And yet you do learn about them in the most personal and persuasive way when you discover that those rights and freedoms are lacking, or that they do not exist at ail. as is the case in totalitarian dictatorship. And here is the reason why I see the Constitution of the United States in such sharp contrast to all the forms of non-democratic government under which 1 have lived. Two hundred years ago this constitution enshrined the principles of western civilization and European culture, defined the democratic system of government and formulated a commitment to humanistic values and a rationalistic faith in reason as a source of truth. The American constitution en- shrined - for the first time in human history - equality and the inalienable right to life and liberty of the indi- vidual, and recognized search for personal happiness as a legally justi- fiable demand and as the proper end of human life. On July 4, 1776, a handful of rebels decided that they should make these principles and the dream they represented the foundat- ion of their future state. What courage, what confidence, what wonderful vision it took to make these untested and untried principles and philosophical conjectures about human nature into the first law of a country that was confronting a far more powerful enemy and turning its back on traditional governments that recognized freedom for ruling elites but not for all citizens. The Constitution was not written as a fundamental law for a power elite, but as a collection of rules guaranteeing a government ol the people and leaving room for develop- ment and change. Never has a consti- tution like it ever been written, be- cause even those most complex demands articulated in past rebel- lions have been incapable of guarant- eeing change for the better if the victors were interested only in pre- serving their own power. The creators of the American constitution were the first people in history who thought about ways of making their revolution permanent and who believed that ii would be to the benefit of both the people and the country if the establishment were cleaned out every four years through a series of mini-revolutions called elections which would have a civilizing effect on those in power and would take priority over violence. Since I have already revealed something of my dark past as a member of a Stalinist political party, lean now tell you the worst: 1 am also a philosopher. Philosophy, or the search for wisdom, is a kind of child- hood disease, something like small- pox. that leaves its mark on your personality for ever. In the philo- sophical context, the Constitution is even more important than if we consider it merely as a legal docu- ment. The Constitution is a monu- mental testimony to Enlightenment philosophy, that is, an intellectual tendency iliat recognized the basic human needs - for life, liberty and happiness - as the mainsprings of human behavior. That philosophy found a justification for rational self-interest and understood the need for personal freedom as an essential aspect of human nature. The indi- vidual's claim to human rights is given to us a priori, that is, it takes priority over the governments and governors that bestow the laws, and that is the revolution of revolutions, because it gives yon the right to re- place a government that disregards those holy principles of human nature, of the individual and (he citizen. Never has a more unstable basis for any state been formulated, and yet the state established on that foundation has survived for more than two centuries. The Constitution became an ex- pression of truth about the human condition, and has reconciled the principles of government with an awareness of our essential nature as human beings and thus it has helped to create a unique form of statehood in which citizens may express a senti- ment which until that time, had been the exclusive privilege of the monarch: "I am the state." Finally, the Constitution is a testi- mony to wisdom; it is the work of wise men who believed in the power of ideas but at the same time knew the weaknesses of human nature. They did not attempt to realize their 40 [pageend41]ideas by driving the unwilling into an enforced paradise; lhey were content with the gradual, conti- nuous change that people themselves must accept and bring about, but only if they themselves desire it. Whereas a revolutionary requires terror to realize his ideas, a reformist requires only a democratic system as a mechanism of change that regulates itself. This system is still an ex- ception, even in the contemporary world, where authoritarian elitism and totalitarianism from left and right is becoming more and more aggressive. The democracies are very vulnerable and today they appear to be just as weak and decadent as they seemed to Hitler when he occupied one country after another. But ask a Polish worker, an Afghan rebel, a Soviet dissident, a Chinese com- munist head of state, or refugees from Cambodia or Cuba where they see hope. The Constitution is not the embodiment of culture and wisdom, it is a symbol of hope for the future, for us born-again citizens. I am fifty-five years old but I have never lived as an ndult citizen in a democratic system, and if today for the first time, I can call the American Constitution my own constitution, 1 do so with a very special feeling. Would I defend il with my own life? Yes. but not because I have just taken an oath, but rather because my search for wisdom has led me to a strange "discovery", which is that the final truths about human existence, if there are any, have been written into the Constitution of the United States of America. The principles of the Constitution are invincible because they are truthful. Ultimately, the truth will conquor, or at least we hope it will. There is no stronger power in the human individual than the power ofapprehended truth. And in swearing my allegiance to the American constitution, I at the same time remain faithful to that most famous Czech, John Huss, once rector of the Prague University, where 1 received my doctorate. This medieval thinker and Czech philo- sopher was martyred at the stake be- cause he advised people to "Hear the truth, speak the truth and defend the truth - until the death."

Business The Undesirable Export of Computers to the USSR hv Miios Such ma According to the magazine Com- puter World, Soviet computers are not produced in sufficient numbers and quality and computers purchased by the USSR from the USA are used for military purposes. The dissident Anatoly Sharansky claimed that he worked with American computers during his military service. The important Soviet nuclear physicist Andrei Sakharov said, "The second industrial revolution has begun and now we see that instead of catching up to the Americans, we have fallen far behind them. The difference between the USSR and the USA is so great that it cannot be measured. We are quite simply living in a different era." The best Soviet computers are at least three years behind the American computers in terms of speed, eight years behind in terms of data storage and ten years behind in terms of peri- pheral devices and software. Along with the qualitative differences, there is also a quality gap. The Soviet Union has 25,000 computers, two- thirds of which are used for military purposes. The United States has 300,000 computers installed, one quarter of which are used by the military. According to experts, the main reason why the USSR is so far be- hind in computer technology is its inability to produce the complex "chip""technology, in which a large number of miniature circuits are placed on a thin silicon chip about one centimetre square. American technicians are capable of placing about 50,000 components on a single chip, whereas the Russians can scarcely place 2,000. The USSR is trying to close these technological gaps by buying and stealing Western technology. In 1972 France (with the approval of the USA) agreed to construct factories for integrated circuitry in Poland. In a subsequent trade deal,an American firm contracted to produce integrat- ed circuits for hand-calculators. The contract contained a clause allowing the provision of all new technology for a period of five years, J. F. Buey, director of Texas Instruments and a well-known physicist claims that the apparently innocent technology for the manufacture of digital watches and hand calculators will provide the Soviet Union with technology that has considerable military ap- plication. Senator Henry Jackson declared that with minor alterations, these factories can create almost the whole range of circuits necessary for military application. (We should not forget that integrated circuits were developed by the American Air Force for use in their Minute ma 11 rockets.) The magazine Warfare-Defence Electronics claimed that at least 50 Soviet spies in the field of electronics, are located in what is called Silicon Valley south of San Francisco and they send daily reports on the latest developments in semi-conductor technology back to the Soviet Union on Soviet satellites. Minicomputers were first used in Soviet MIRV rockets on the basis of Western technology, and they are absolutely essential for the accuracy of those rockets. In September 1976, the CYBFR 73 system, developed by the Control Data Corporation, was sold to the USSR over the protests of the Penta- gon. The CYBER 73 system is capable of carrying out calculations necessary for nuclear weaponry, anti-submarine warfare, radars to track inter- continental ballistic missiles and other military applications. With this technology alone, the USSR would be capable of tracking and endanger- ing American submarines of the Polaris and Poseidon types. Forty years ago. American in- dustrialists attempted to increase profits by selling unused metal to imperial Japan. Admiral Yamamoto did not hesitate to use this metal at Pearl Harbour. Today, a similar desire for profits is driving western industrialists into "lucrative" business deals with the Soviet military complex. Peace makes trade possible. Certain kinds of trade make peace impossible. Those who refuse to learn from history are condemned to repeating its mistakes. 41 [pageend42]Sport Martina Navrátilová: Without a Raquet Západ: About five years ago you decided not to return to Czecho- slovakia. How did that decision come about? Navrátilová: It was a fairly easy decision. In the Czech Tennis Fede- ration a couple of people have all the power of decision over who goes where, who is allowed to travel and who isn't. These functionaries started to become jealous of me and I began to experience a lot of difficulties. Then they no longer even wanted to let me go to America. They said that Martina likes it in America too much. They were right, actually. Západ: You were eighteen years old at the time. It must have been hard at the beginning. Navrátilová: T he beginning was very hard. I didn't know anyone. I was alone. Apart from that I hegan to have many physical difficulties: problems with my shoulder, my ankle, and a lot of others. Everything went badly. Another reason might have been that 1 have a rather ex- tensive game repertoire, a lot of different shots and tactics, and it took me a long time to coordinate it all. Someone like Evert has it easier, because she only has a few shots and her play is basically the same all the time. But then all of a sudden every- thing started coming together. I relaxed, and that was probably the most important thing. Západ: What's your home life like? What do you do in your free lime? Navrátilová: I bought nine acres near Charlottesville in Virginia. It's very beautiful there. It reminds me a little of Řevnice. Most of the property is wooded, And my neighbours keep horses. I'd love to do that one day too, but I wouldn't ride horses until I was no longer afraid of get ting hurt. So I don't have a horse, only two dogs and two cats. The dogs are called Tete and Ruby, the cats are Casanova and Baby Jesus. Hobbies? 1 enjoy cooking. Sometime when I'm at home I go to a movie-house where they show classical films. Recently I saw a film starring Greta Garbo, and Citizen Kane. Západ: How long do you think you'll be among the best tennis players in the world? Navrátilová: Maybe five, seven years. Then i'd like to go back to school, but I don't know yet what I'll study. History, perhaps, or architecture. Západ: When you're not doing well in a match, do you swear in Czech or in English? Navrátilová: In English. Západ: When you're angry with your- self, does it stimulate you or do you get down? Navrátilová: That depends, but usually it helps. That's why I get angry so often. Západ: Why do you think there have been so many good Czech women tennis players recently? Navrátilová: They've been letting them travel abroad more, lately. Maybe they learned something from my case. Západ: You speak English almost without an accent. Navrátilová: Oh no, I still have a slight accent. But mostly people think I come from Texas somewhere. Západ: One last question. What have the worst and best moments been in your life so far? Navrátilová: My worst moment was in 1976 when I lost the first round at Forest Hills. It was my first year here and I was having troubles with my health, and I said to myself perhaps I ought to go back.Then I thought of what would happen to me. And my best moment was when I won the two Wimbledons. Both were equally beautiful, but the first one left the strongest impression on me. * * * A final note. As some of you probably know, Martina's parents and her sister Jana were given permission to go to the United States for two years. They went to Dallas in December, 1979, but it didn't suit them very well and the following summer they all returned to Prague, Martina claimed that her father had trouble with English and didn't like Dallas, but the main tiling was, she said, that he missed his friends. I didn't press her on that point, but I felt somewhat as though I knew the real reason, for most of us know it. Parents coming from Prague to visit their offspring in the West often fee! they have a right to run their lives. And we've grown used to having no one interfer- ing in how we live. Something like thai must have happened to Martina. Václav Táborský interviewed Martina Navrátilová for Západ. Interview with Aja Vrzáňová A/a Vrzáňová won the world figure- skating championships in 1949 and 1950. Olga A-halinová talked to her for Západ in New York. Západ: What were your beginnings like? Vrzáňová: The beginnings were difficult. That was during the war, and we started practice every morning at five thirty in an open-air arena in Prague and there was only one light. It was terribly cold and we were all wrapped up - with scarves over our noses and newspapers in our boots - and we would circle slowly under that one light. It must have looked ridiculous and people going to work across the bridge probably thought we were mad. But it was theonly way we could gel any ice time, because the hockey players, our rivals for the ice, came at eight-thirty. Západ: When did you first win the world title? Vrzáňová: In Paris in 1949. At the time, I had two gentlemen with me whose job it was to keep an eye on me. I was also very sorry that my mother wasn't there with me. They wouldn't let her out of the country. There were three of us in our family, and I was the only one they let out. After the world championship I was invited to take part in an "Exhibition 42 [pageend43]Sport Martina Navrátilová: Without a Raquet Západ: About five years ago you decided not to return to Czecho- slovakia.

Interview with Aja Vrzáňová A/a Vrzáňová won the world figure- skating championships in 1949 and 1950. Olga Mar/inová talked to her for Západ in New York. Západ: What were your beginnings like? Vrzáňová: The beginnings were difficult. That was during the war, and we started practice everv morning at live thirty in an open-air arena in Prague and there was only one light. It was terribly cold and we were all wrapped up - with scarves over our noses and newspapers in our boots - and we would circle slowly under that one light. It must have looked ridiculous and people going to work across the bridge probably thought we were mad. But it was the only way we could get any ice time, because the hockey players, our rivals for the ice, came at eight-thirty. Západ: When did you first win the world title? Vrzáňová: In Paris in 1949. At the lime, I had two gentlemen with me whose job it was to keep an eye on me. I was also very sorry that my mother wasn't there with me. They wouldn't let her out of the country. There were three of us in our family, and 1 was the only one they let out. After the world championship I was invited to take part in an "Exhibition 42 [pageend44]of Champions" tour to various countries like Sweden, Norway, Eng- land and Canada. But the Czech authorities wouldn't let me go to Canada because it was too far West, they said. I was very sorry not to be able to go to Toronto, where the Toronto Skating Club had invited me to their annua! Skating Carnival. So Dick Button and the rest went off to Canada and I had to return to Prague. Zapad: Under what circumstances did you leave Czechoslovakia for good? Vrzahova: I had great difficulty in getting to the next world champion- ships. The officials in Prague told me that one title was enough and that they were sending me to Moscow where I would train Soviet skaters. They promised nic a villa in Moscow and a career as a film star, but my family had to stay in Prague. My mother and I both begged the officials to let me go to defend my title, and we finally persuaded them, but 1 had to sign an agreement to return im- mediately after the championship and go to Moscow, whether 1 suc- ceeded in defending the title or not. That was when I decided to stay abroad. I wanted to work in the sport and skate professionally in the American Revue, since there was nothing like it in Europe or Czecho- slovakia. But because 1 was young and naive, I didn't realize that 1 would be leaving the country for good. In March 1950 I successfully defended my title in London and was then expected to return home at once. There were sixteen Czech figure- skaters and about sixteen officials, I myself had about three gentlemen with me all the time to keep an eye on me and make sure I didn't talk with foreigners. I was living at my coach's house, Arnold Gerschwiler was his name. My guardians were not allow- ed in there, which didn't please them very much because they couldn't watch me as closely as they could the other members of the team, who were living in a hotel. I had been invited to Paris and Sweden and then was to return to England. But the Czechoslovak officials didn't want me to go to Paris and they announced that they were holding a reception for me at the Czechoslovak Embassy in London. Because 1 had already decided to stay in the West, I certainly had no intention of going to the embassy. My coach and I went to the airport (we had to leave through the back garden because there were two men watching the front door) and we flew to Paris. Mrs. Gerschwiler sent a telegram to the Czechoslovak Embassy as soon as we were in the air announcing that I had to go to Paris to represent Czechoslovakia and that therefore I couldn't take part in the reception. At the airport in Paris, there were two men waiting for me who told me that I had to return to Prague at once. My coach explained that this was impossible. I was close- ly watched wherever I went. 1 receiv- ed a glorious welcome in Sweden, but there were two more men waiting for me there who brought me a return ticket to Prague after my performance and wanted me to leave with them at once. 1 tried to get out of it, saying that I had to go back to London for my luggage. At that point, the rest of the figureskating team had already gone back to Prague and they had begun to suspect my intention to re- main abroad. Mr. Švadlena of Rudé právo was very rude to my parents and threatened them in all sorts of ways. Later i met him in Colorado Springs at the world championships in 1969. He avoided me like the plague. When I got back to London, I stayed with the Gerschwilers and never stuck my nose out of doors. The Czechs started putting terrible pressure on me, calling me up and threatening to arrest my parents, saying I'd never see them again and so on. In Prague they confiscated my trophies and other things. I was so devastated by all this that Arnold wouldn't let me take any more tele- phone calls. The house was under constant surveillance, a black limousine kept crawling up and down the street and I got so that I could recognize the sound of its motor - otherwise it was a quiet street. Once, when Arnold had gone off somewhere, I asked his wife to let me go out for a while, just a short walk down the street to the local 43 [pageend45]shop. 1 promised to come right back. As ! was returning, I heard the familiar sound of the motor, two men in black coats jumped out of the car and started chasing mc, shouting in Czech. It was like a bad detective film. I began to run with the men right behind me, I made it to the gate but I was so nervous I couldn't open it. So I hung onto the gate and shout- ed for help. By this time they were on top of me, shouting things like, "You've got to come home with us; you're ruining the whole sport; be- cause ofyou they'll never let anyone out again," and they told me I'd never sec my parents again, that they were locked up - it was awful. One of the men was hanging onto me and the car was right there. It was a situation where a single minute would have made the difference. Then suddenly, the door of the house opened and it was Arnold, who had just come back with two English officials. They ran up to me, took me into the house and I was given political asylum on the spot. The next day there was an official report in the newspapers that I had remained in England. Be- fore that they could have taken me away and no one would have known. My mother was able to leave the country before the news appeared in the papers. My father, unfortunate- ly, got the worst of it. He wasn't able to leave, he lost his job in the Ministry of Finance and was sent to work in the mines for a few years. I lost him in 1978, When I won the championship, they wrote in the Czech papers about how much the system had done for me and they held me up as an example to young people. The day after I left, they began writing that I would die of hunger in the West, that 1 would jump into the Thames in desperation, and that I would be appearing in American revues like a trained monkey. The kind of thing little children would write. Západ: Can you tell us something about your career in the West? Vrzáňová: With Arnold Gersch- wiler's help, I signed a wonderful contract with "Ice Follies", where I appeared as a star for three years. In 1954, I went over to Ice Capades, where I remained until 1968.1 skated for six years in the Ice Capades with Otto and Maria Jelínek, who are my very good friends. Otto Jelínek is now a member of parliament in Canada. Maria has two beautiful boys and they live in Toronto and come very often to New York. We always meet in our Czech Pavillion. Západ: Can you tell us someting about the history of the Czech Pavillion? Vrzáňová: I got into the restaurant business thanks to my husband. He's a wonderful restaurateur. He left Czechoslovakia in 1948 and first established several restaurants in London, In 1959 he came to New York and a year later opened his own restaurant "La Popotte", a very successful French bistro. That's where 1 met him. First we founded the Duck Joint together in 1969, when we got married. Then we bought a house in New York and there we opened the Czech Pavillion. We wanted to create an elegant Czech restaurant with typical Czech food at reasonable prices. Naturally, a lot of our countrymen meet there, including the film directors Miloš Forman and Ivan Passer, and before he died, George Voskovec was a frequent guest. Martina Navrátilo- vá always stops by when she's play- ing in New York. Then there's the hockey player Olda Zábrodský, the Pachls, whose daughter Jarmila was the Canadian figure-skating champ- ion, our good friends Ludmila and Oleg Protopopov, who now appear in "Ice Capades" and many others. Západ: And w hat about your mother? Vrzáňová: Mother's doing very well in Hollywood, where she has a successful singing school. Walking Over the Clouds: an Interview with Věra Komárková In March 1980. the National Geo- graphic Magazine published an interesting article on the successful ascent of the ninth highest mountain in the world - the 8.078 metre Anna- puma I in the Himalayas - by a group of women. One of the members of this expedition was Věra Komárková. who has been living in the United States since 1969. Jan Uhde interviewed her for Západ. Západ: How did you come to take up such an unusual career? It's almost like something out of a Jules Verne novel. Komárková: In Czechoslovakia my girl-friends and 1 had always dream- ed of an expedition up one of the 8,000 metre mountains, and in 1969 we actually began to organize a trip up Gasherbrum II. But then I left for the USA, war broke out in Pakistan and the trip was called off. But 1 didn't stop trying. I must say that now that my dream has come true, I occasionally think about my friends at home, and whether a Czecho- slovak women's expedition to the Himalayas will ever take place. I'm really very happy to be able to add Annapurna to the list of 8,000 metre peaks scaled by Czechoslovaks - and Americans. Západ: It must be quite unusual to look at the world from a height of 8,000 metres and not be looking out the window of an airplane. Isn't it a rather exhilirating feeling? Komárková: My feelings on the summit were really quite special, something I still like to recall. Perhaps it was also the lack of oxygen. I'd love to climb another 8,000 metre peak. You feel like never coming down again. Could that be something like Nirvana? And success also brings with it certain material rewards that help you to pay off the expedition's debt more quickly. Západ: What can you tell us about your beginnings? Komárková: I've always wanted to travel. In 1967 some friends and I thought up a scheme that would get us overseas - to the Olympic games in Mexico. One of our main pur- poses was to climb the mountains along our route. In Mexico, we made a number of nice climbs, in the Huasteca Canyon and on Ixtacci- huatl, a volcano near Mexico City. When 1 moved to the United States, I did very little travelling at first. It wasn't until I started travelling to Alaska on working trips that I took part in several expeditions into the high mountains there. In 1975 we went into the Brooks Range, where we conquored two inaccessible peaks; in 1976 we did the southern peak of Mount McKinley - that was with a women's expedition from Portland. Oregon.

[pageend48]A Conversation with Jiří (George) Voskovec Západ; Mr. Voskovec, before the Second World War you spent years doing political satire in the Liberated Theatre in Prague, so you're a bit of an expert on the subject. What's your opinion of satire in America? Voskovec: You know satire is some- what different in America than it is in Europe, and mainly different than what we're used to in Czechoslovakia. Because freedom of speech has such a long tradition and is taken so much for granted in America - even though it occasionally finds itself in trouble here as well - American satire is far more direct and far sharper than Czech satire used to be. I think that Mark Twain, for example, was extra- ordinarily direct and aggressive in his satire, far more so than we were used to getting away with in Czecho- slovakia. And in the second place, in Bohemia there were influences, dangers from abroad, neighbouring states that might have been offended or insulted, so there were often protests, diplomatic protests, against certain plays. ! also think that the Liberated Theatre may have helped contribute 10 the fact that satire be- came an almost normal, accepted form of expression. But in America, for example, George Kaufman, a greai American humourist and writer, co-author of the plav Guess Who's Coming for Supper that audiences may still remember, al- ways used to say, "Satire is what closes Saturday," in other words, satire is what doesn't make it. It used to be a kind of superstition in the 1920 that if anyone wrote a satirical play, it usually bombed. At the same time, Kaufman was thinking of his own plays, because he wrote a couple of satirical plays, almost po- litical satire, and they usually flopped. But times have changed, I would say, since the fifties and sixties. And as far as comedians who are more or less satirical go, and who might be compared to political satirists of the European type, 1 think that at the moment there aren't many of them, and of those that do exist, my favorite is Mori Sahl. You know, he worked mainly in night-clubs; that's where he began, back in the 1950s when political satire and political comedy first began to appear in those cabarets all over the country. Then there was the marvellous group of actors called Second City which unfortunately I don't think exists any more. For some reason things like this never seem to last very long in America, they fall apart and then one or two individuals continue on iheir own. Second City was a remarkable young company that reminded me a little bit of the Liberated Theatre because they were young men and women, mostly students, that got together and then brought their program to New York where they were enormous- ly successful. Several people from that ensemble went on to become excellent comedians and actors. The best of them, and the one who made the biggest career for herself, was Barbara Harris, a remarkable and wonderful acrcss. She did several musicals on Broadway and several very absurd plays, like that one by Koppit, the line with the long mime. What was it? Oh Mom. Oh Dad, My Dad Hung Himself in the Closet and I'm So Sad or something like that. And she was terrific in it, abso- lutely magnificent. It was a wonder- ful ensemble. Second City. A pity they didn't stay together. Mort Sahl is the only other satirical comedian I can think of who is still performing. Of course there was Lenny Bruce as well. He's dead, unfortunately, died young. He was kind of an angry comedian, very very bitter, but very effective. And he overdid it some- what, occasionally used rather raw language, and then he sort of went to the dogs - drugs and so on. Then, of course, there's the marvellous satirical duo Mike Nichols and Elaine May. They've split up since then and Mike became one of the top directors here, both in cinema and 111 the theatre - a remarkable director. I le made The Graduate and Catch 22. And Elaine May also writes plays and directs, but she very seldom acts. And he doesn't act at all any more. It's a great pity that team Fell apart, because they were phenomena! people. They did very witty and original satire. Not only political satire, although they did that too, but social satire, character satire and satire on current events. It was all done through total improvisation, and in that they were very much like us. That was interesting: they were a couple, a man and a woman, but they worked together very much like Werich and I did. You know, I'm not saying we improvised everything, that's not true. 1 know they say it but it's not true. We would write definite roles for ourselves that we'd learn just like regular parts, and certain sections would be improvised. But these two, I believe, improvised every- thing. I got to know Nichols and for a time there i worked with him, and we talked a lot about the technique of improvisation and I discovered that they went at it very much like we had done, in fact almost identically. Both our teams were freaks of nature, be- cause we understood our partners so well that we could guess what the other would say or do. There was an irrational and extra-sensory connect- ion and communication between us. Západ: You mentioned Catch 22. / recently read a review in which Hašek's Good Soldier Svejk was compared with Heller's hook. Voskovec: Yes, Catch 22. But I also read a review somewhere where they said Catch 22 couldn't hold a candle to Švejk, and it's true and I was glad to see someone say it. Catch 22 is a good book too, but it's nonsense to compare it to Švejk. The greatest and most brilliant thing about Hašek's epic is the figure of Svejk. The rest of it is epic filler, a run-of-the-mill but good picaresque saga. But the figure of Švejk, his talk and his philosophy, his perspective on the world, that is monumental. Západ: Why do you think Hašek's Svejk can still outrage some people, even today when his language is no longer seen as so vulgar? Voskovec: I think such people have no sense of humour. In other words, they are stupid and evil. Big and little Hitlers, tyrants and mini-tyrants. That kind of people that Švejk is cutting down to size. After all. he represents this terrible, enormous undermining of authority, that is, of the establishment, of the rulers, of any false authority. Švejk can never get along wiih any ruler who takes himself seriously. The Good Soldier Švejk is forbidden reading in every army in the world, for instance. That alone should be enough to recom- mend it to people everywhere. Západ: Could you tell us anything about American theatre criticism? Voskovec: Well, we have a special problem here in New York because critical praise is absolutely essential, and there are fewer and fewer critics because there are fewer and fewer dailies. Today we only have the New York Times, the New York Post, and the Daily News, and that's it. three newspapers for a city of more than eight million people. Of course that's got to do with competition from tele- vision, to a certain extent, and there arc economic factors, particularly 47 [pageend49]wages and the fact that a newspaper can't survive unless it has a huge circulation because wages and production costs are so high. And now there is a new thing - television critics, and they are having a parti- cularly unhappy influence on New York theatre. They're outstanding for their enormous arrogance and their awful ignorance. Unfortunate- ly their influence is such that they can kill a play, and that raises the ques- tion as to whether it's worth risking a play in New York, that is, if you're not convinced you've got a real hit. And that is something no one can be sure of until the premiere. The play I'm in right now, The Headhunters, may have a good chance, but if Mr. Barnes from the New York Times, for instance, doesn't praise the play, we can all go and jump in the lake. That's a fact. Zdpad: In the Museum of Modern Art they recently showed all the Czech films that you made with Werich, AH the top American newspapers, includ- ing the New York Times, wrote about it, and the event pointed up the con- nections between American and Euro- pean culture. You gave a speech at the gala opening. I'd be interested to know what you talked about. Voskovec: I just gave a kind of in- formal, improvised talk like I'm doing here now and 1 talked about With Richard Burton in Giclgud's Hamlet how Jan Werich and 1 belong to a generation that really grew up on American films, I talked about how Hollywood was a household word all over Europe, and for us it meant paradise. But particularly among film-makers it was an everyday word. And to us, it was both very close and very far away, very holy, much too holy as we later learned from person- al experience, particularly me, but Jan as well. Have I ever told you about Otto Heller, the late Otto Heller, the excellent cameraman? He had a kind of running joke that he always used in the Barrandov Restau- rant in Prague when he was called away to the telephone. He'd come back to the table and say, "That was MGM, calling from Hollywood. And they told me: Stay where you are, we don't need you. And I'm sup- posed to pass on the message to every- one sitting here," That may have been true, but later he made it to Hollywood himself. I was thereat the time too, so in the end it turned out that they needed us after all. So that was the kind of thing I talked about in the museum. And then I told a long story, that we haven't got time for now. about Orson Welles, who gave us a screen test. But it turned out badly because the test got lost somewhere, even though it was wonderful of him to take trouble with us. There was a change in the management of RKO studios as a result of which we lost out, although it would have been a great "break", as they say, a great opportunity. At that time we were having bad luck in almost everything. We needed all our luck to get away from Hitler. Which was worth it. After that, we had only hard times here together. As Werich used to say, we were "com- pletely unknown from coast to coast". But we always had a lot of fun and it was very interesting from many points of view, I'll neverforget those "bad" years that I spent here with Jan. kwee ¿Werich Caricature of Voskovec and Werich by Adolf lioffmeister Jiří Sýkora interviewed George Vos- kovec for Západ. Mr. Voskovec died in Julv, 1981. 48 [pageend50]Interview with A. J. Liehm Professor A. J. Liehm, one of the main theoreticians of the new »rave of Czechoslovak films in the 1960s, now lives in Philadelphia, where he teaches at the University of Pennsylvania. His most recent work, written with his wife Drahomíra Liehm ová, is called The Most Important Art: East Euro- pean Tilm After 1945. // was publish- ed in 1977 by the University of Cali- fornia Press. It has recently come out in paperback and is available from Sixty-Eight Publishers, Toronto. Miloš Such ma and Jan Uhde talked to Professor Liehm for Západ. Západ: How do you think our best writers stand up in the world context? Liehm: Milan Kundera is recognized today as a first-class European writer. Quite simply, he has managed to become a part of the world litera- ry context. So has Josef Škvorecký, to a somewhat lesser ex tent, although that does not mean that he has a lesser talent, it's simply that his literature is somewhat different. In Prague there are at least two writers who already belong to the world literary context: Ludvík Vaculík and Jiří GruSa, and they deserve to be measured by world standards. So does Pavel Kohout, definitely so, whether you like it or not, and, of course, Václav Havel's status goes without saying. Západ: Do yout think someone like Bohumil Hrabal is translatable? Can he be understood outside Czecho- slovakia? Liehm: Undoubtedly Hrabal is trans- latable. The problem is not in trans- latability, the problem is elsewhere. When Joyce wrote Ulysses, he wrote it in English and it is almost untrans- latable, Almost. You have to find a congenial or kindred translator. When you go from English to another language, it's not such a problem. In most non-English speaking countries, you'll find someone who's up to the task because there are probably hundreds of translators from English. But when a Czech writer writes his Joycean text and you want to trans- late it into English, you're in a far more difficult situation, because there aren't many people who trans- late from Czech, and the chances of finding a congenial translator are therefore so much the less. If Joyce had been born a Bulgarian, or if the English had not forced their own language on Ireland, who would know about Joyce today'? And it's the same with poetry. If, for example, Vladimír Holan or Vítězslav Nezval had been French instead of Czech, the situation would be different. It is simply a matter of the dimensions of a language. Západ: What is your view today of the influence of the wave of Czech films in the 1960s and its significance in the international context? Liehm: There was an influence, but it was prematurely interrupted. If it had managed to go on for somewhat longer, its style and influence might have crystallized more completely. Here I should point out that the Czech wave didn't come out of nothing, for it, in turn, had been influenced by the French nouvelle vague and Direct Cinema, But it still, in my opinion, made several dis- coveries. One of the main discover- ies made by Czech directors in the 1960s was the specific use of non- professional actors and the way they were able to capture the macrocosm of social life through the microcosm of individuals' lives. Their ironic way of seeing things was also quite exceptional. Those influences have not been lost; they keep showing up in contemporary films in various countries. Of course for a creative wave to have a stylistic influence in the world context, it would have to have lasted longer. Or a single director would have to have created more. Godard has undoubtedly influenced the de- velopment of the cinema, more so than Truffaut, but look how long it took him. But when he began, you could see his films almost at once, because the French cinema was world famous. With Czech films, on the contrary, almost four years went by before they got out. A smaller cinema needs more time to establish itself than a large one. For example, it took young German film makers almost ten years to make a mark in America. The Hungarian director Miklós Jancsó - how long did it take him to get through at least to the experts with his pace-setting stylistic changes? Czechoslovak film in the 1960s needed at least another five years to properly define its inter- national contribution. Západ: What do you think is best in contemporary film? Liehm: The most interesting cinema, as a current or as a whole, is un- disputablv the West German cinema. In terms of individual films, I think the best movie of recent years is the Italian film by Olmi called The Tree of the Wooden Clogs. It is a real model of what can be done in film today. It has everything in it, from the radical anti-narrative avant- garde to the film epic. An absolutely encyclopedic film. What interests me, however, is the fact that the best films being made today are subsidized. Olmi's film was subsidized in the end too, be- cause he made it for Italian television. Roberto Rossellini has to take some of the crcdit for this. En the late 1950s, Rossellini understood that the situat- ion was untenable and he gave up struggling with producers and went to the state television network for a subsidy. He got the money, because he was Rossellini. After a while, it was possible to persuade television networks all over Europe that this was the way to give a chance to people who deserved it. Západ: Wasn't that how young German filmmakers moved into the foreground of international interest? Liehm: There it was a combination, because the support came from a number of different sources. But without public support, the new German cinema would never have come into being. I think that every nation, every country, has enough talent to produce good films. But the right conditions have to be created to allow it to happen. For example, the Canadian National Film Board did marvellous things at the beginning. Naturally, the notion of subsidized films always strikes terror into the hearts of Americans, who are afraid of controls. Certainly, controls are there - you can't make a film for television, for instance, that goes beyond the limits of its con- vention, and of course I don't mean esthetic convention. But making good films with a certain degree of limitation is perhaps still better than having absolute freedom and doing almost nothing with it. And that is precisely the situation that exists today in the United States or Canada. In Eastern Europe, of course, the system of control is far tougher and more centralized; it's stale control. 49 [pageend51]But, of course, the pressure is never the same. When the regime is strong, when it knows exactly what it wants and is well organized, then it's very bad for film-makers. But when the state is weak and uncertain about what will happen tomorrow, when its organs are confused or in a state of crisis, at that point its ability to control weakens, while the positive aspects of state subsidy remain. Under such circumstances the film- makers can take advantage of the positive aspects of the whole struct- ure and become almost free. As we know, there have never been made films more critical of the social structures and their function in Eastern Europe than those made precisely in Eastern Europe. But they were always made in those moments of weakness, which never lasted very long. Polish film, that is, the film of a country that has been in a state of crisis for a number of years, has been interesting for a number of years. For example this year's New York Film Festival presented six films from Eastern Europe out of a total of about 18, something that has never happen- ed before at that festival. l.et rnc tell you a bizarre story. Andrej Tarkovsky, who at home in the Soviet Union is silently tolerated as showpiece despite his repeated difficulties and conflicts with the regime, recently made a film called Stalker in English. It's an adaptation of a wonderful science-fiction story by the Strugacky brothers, whose works are easy to find in American paperback editions (I think that story- is called "Picnic by the Highway"). It was certainly the most interesting film to appear at Cannes. In fact this film is hated and misunderstood by its own producer and financial backer. In the USSR, it is only shown in specialist cinemas where it is seen by a couple of thousand intellectuals. Nevertheless, the film was made and it was verv expensive. Something like that is possible only in the USSR - putting vast amounts of money into something you don't want and in fact nobody wants. Západ: Why do they do it? Liehm: They occasionally produce something like that, perhaps for the future, or so they can say that they are doing something for art's sake as well. Stalker recently showed up at a festival in Colorado where people liked it, but it was also said that the film would probably never be seen in America because no distributor would put out the $100,000 for distribution rights be- cause they'd be afraid of losing their investment. Západ: And what about Forman's "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"? That was a non-commercial film that had great commercial success. Liehm: I'm not so sure about that. Naturally, no one thought it would be so successful, but you mustn't forget that Forman made it accord- ing to a book that was one of the top best sellers of the 1960s, almost the bible of a generation. The title was an idiom and the stage version had been performed all over, so the ground was well prepared. But even so its success was a miracle. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest origin- ally had a small budget, about a million and a half dollars, but when Jack Nicholson signed the contract for the leading role, the budget im- mediately jumped to $5,000,000. That's normal in American films. Big name stars automatically guarantee large audiences. Ninety percent of American audiences have no idea who directed a film, but they know who's starring in it. Západ: Is that still the case? Liehm: Yes. American movies are in a different category altogether than European film. They began as enter- tainment, as showbusiness, and no other demands were ever made of them. It was different in Europe. Even before the First World War, but especially in the 1920s, another trend developed - film as art, which never really happened in the Ameri- can narrative film. At the most a re- markable individual would appear here and there, and even he would soon burn out - look at Orson Welles, for example. An even those American movies that have proven to have some art in them were never intended as such in the beginning. This philo- sophy of the North American film industry, that movies are enter- tainment and therefore have to pay their own way, leads in the end to a state in which the great issues, the great problems of mankind seldom appear in them. Západ: I'd like to return to the ques- tion of Czechoslovak film. It seems to me that in the twelve years since the Soviet occupation, nothing new has appeared. Liehm: The "scorched earth" policy that the occupational regime has taken towards Czechoslovak culture naturally applies to Film as well. They managed to destroy everything positive that had been created over the preceding fifteen years. Half the people with talent left the country and very few of those have been able to do what they might have done at home. The other half stayed home, but they couldn't make films as they had done before either. It was not just one, but three generations that took part in the Czech and Slovak film boom from 1956 to 1968, and they were almost entirely wiped out, not physically, but artistically. What seems to me more interesting is the fact that in these past twelve years, not only has a new generation not grown up, but not a single new and genuinely original talent has ap- peared. Not a single new and original talent. So their cultural policies are absolutely negative, capable only of destroying, capable only of fear. And that, I think, sums up the entire last decade in Czechoslovakia. 50 [pageend52]Canadian Fiction Magazine: A Multicultural Anthology hy .tan Uhde In 1981, the literary quarterly Canadian Fiction Magazine published a special issue devoted to short fiction by Canadians who write in languages other than English or French, The issue contains 32 pieces originally written in such different languages as Inuit, MicMac, Chinese, Spanish and Yiddish, all of them translated into English. Such an undertaking is perhaps imaginable only in Canada and, in my opinion, it is a highly desirable project. In this country, we need a tribune for all those "unofficial" languages, a tribune that would reach beyond the sometimes ethnocentric and isolated audiences who still speak and read the original tongue. In this way, the truly multicultural character of Canadian society can be appreciated by all communities. It is beyond the scope of this re- view to comment individually on all 32 contributions. It would also be futile to search for a unifying subject matter or style. The stories are as different as the native languages and experiences of their authors. The anthology contains Indian and Inuit folk tales such as "Don't Let Little Things..." hy Xavier Suther- land and "Legend of Mud-Lane" bv Rita Joe, as well as painful re- miniscences of contemporary or historical collective traumas, such as "Two Stories" by Leandro Urbina and "Some of Us Survived" by Khatchar Der Mesrobian. Neverthe- less, one theme seems to recur frequently: that of a newcomer, an immigrant, arriving in the new country with oppression and de- struction on his heels and the trauma of adjusting to life in a strange, new country ahead of him. The best example of this truly (but not exclu- sively) Canadian theme can be seen in "The Newcomer" by Chava Rosenfarb, translated from the Yiddish by C. F. Thalenberg. It is the story of Baruch, a Holocaust sur- vivor who comes to Montreal from Warsaw via the concentration camps and a one-year stay in post-war Paris. His experiences in his first Canadian job will stir the memories of many. Besides, the prose is excellent and the author's successful intertwining of present and past is a sign of creative maturity. Another story which should not be forgotten is a reminiscence of the Cultural Revolution in Mao's China by Chen Jo-Hs¡, called "The Tunnel". One knows very little about that period, and especially about the ways people coped with it. Chen Jo-Hsi's story is a revelation. Czech and Slovak literature is represented by stories by Josef Škvorecký, Zdena Salivarová and Jaroslava Blažková. Škvorecký is a well-known author both inside and outside the Czech-Canadian com- munity. His "Family Hotel" (from the book The Fine Season) recounts an amorous, adolescent escapade of his favorite hero, Danny Smiricky. Salivarová's prose sheds revealing light on the incredible complexity of relationships between people from different "fraternal" socialist states. Blaíková's "Circe" is an ironic, metaphorical tale of a husband who cops out by turning into a raven, though he fails to escape the ultimate coup administered by his wife, who truly has the last word. These excerpts well represent the Czechoslovak element in Canadian literature. Finally there are the expressive illustrations by the Spanish-born artist Jerónimo, with their Mirócsque atmosphere. They contribute much to ihe anthology's multicultural flavour. Jan Uhde. a member of the editorial hoard of Západ, is professor of Film at Waterloo University. Music A Philosopher on the Podium: Rafael Kubelik The son of the famous violinist Jan Kubelik, Rafael studied violin, piano, composition and conducting at the Prague Conservatory. When he was twenty-two, he was named musical director and conductor of the Czech Philharmonic (1936-1948). After the communist putsch, he left Czecho- slovakia to become musical director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 1950-1953, From 1955 to 1957 he was the musical director of the Royal Opera Covent Garden in London, and since 1961 he has been conductor of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra in Munich. Rafael Kubelik has been guest conductor of all the top American and European sym- phony orchestras, with whom he has made dozens of gramophone records. He has also written several operas and many instrumental and chamber works, Rafael Kubelik is a regular guest conductor of the New York Philharmonic. Jaromír Zástěra talked to him for Západ. Západ: Do you recall where and when you last conducted in Czechoslovak in. and what it was? Kubelik: Yes, it was St. Ludmila in '48 in Prague Castle. St. Ludmila by Dvořák, outside in the courtyard, and then I left the country July 17. Západ: Would you ever like to conduct again in Czechoslovakia? Kubelik: I wouldn't conduct there again unless there were freedom and what they promise and have always promised me when they tried to get me to go back. I insist on that. My doctrine has always been, "Give everyone what you promise to me, and I'll come." Západ: Do you still consider Czecho- slovakia your home? Kubelik: Naturally, You can't lose your home. I left my country so that I wouldn't have to leave my nation. 1 have never abandoned my nation, because I know that the nation is not really the way it must pretend to be. Západ: What are the concrete dif- ferences, in your opinion, between the symphony orchestras in America and in Europe? Kubelik: Orchestras all over the 51 [pageend53]world are gradually becoming more and more similar, particularly in terms of their sound so that today all orchestras arc good and can be used for making gramophone records, and this sound is then "polished" a little, so that in the end, if they all "taste" somewhat thesame.it sounds good on record. Západ: Your Munich orchestra sounds magnificent, perhaps even belter than the New York Philharmonic, but you have your musicians placed different- ly than is usual in America. Why is this? Kube/ik: In fact I've worked my whole life on this arrangement of the orchestra. I've been directing for 44 years, and I'm still searching for the best way of placing the musicians, and after all the experience I've had, I returned once more to the old, classical location of instruments in the orchestra, as it was in the classical periods, under Beethoven, Dvořák and Brahms: with the violins on the left side and the contrabass right be- hind them, so that the treble will be with the bass and not only internal voices interfering with each other. Then on the right side there are the second violins and violas, so that the sound of the other instruments is, as it were, covered across the whole stage with the sound of the violins and other strings, and not, as the Americans have it, with the first and second violins on the left and the counterbasses and cellos on the right. Hut recently I've been shifting things about, because composers like Bar- tók, Stravinsky or Shostakovich conceived of the orchestra in a dif- ferent way than Beethoven, for example, did. so they wanted both violins on the left as they were used to in America where that arrange- ment began some fifty years ago. So I try to be precise and when I'm doing Bartók I play, as you observed, with the American arrangement, and with Bruckner, I use the classical German arrangement. Západ: What do you consider the musical avant-garde today and what do you think of it as a conductor? Kube/ik: 1 don't really like the word "avant-garde" because it's a label for something that in fact doesn't exist. There is only good music, whether it's avant-garde or merely claiming to be avant-garde. What is in vogue today - because music has gone too much in individual directions and everyone thinks he can write what he wants - really means that the avant- garde has become anarchy. And anarchistic compositions are not of that much value to me because they are improvisations without roots or traditions. Spontaneous inspiration and philosophical comparison with one's real subject, in my opinion, is the only possible path for contempo- rary composers to follow. To come out with something that the listener and the human heart needs and can also bear. What is considered pro- gressive today, of course, is a problem of criticism that is afraid to condemn or not acknowledge something that is considered new for fear of having to recant later. That is why critics would rather praise something they do not understand at all, rather than writing well about something they might actually understand and be able to analyse properly. Západ: What about "concrete music" or the electronic music that began many years ago in Germany. Is that avant-garde? Kube/ik: Well of course it gave us new sounds; in that sense it is avant- garde. But because it is dependent on mechanics, I don't trust it. It is not for me; it doesn't satisfy me. It is a very one-dimensional and nar- row, because electronics can never produce a personal sound, the kind that one imagines in his fantasy or requires for his thought. Music is a direct link between the brain and the heart, between technology and sound. But electronics is really a dead material, which may be good for producing a backdrop, which may sometimes be interesting, or for mechanical purposes, but not for a truthful expression of the subjective relationship of man to music, to philosophy, to religion and to nature. Západ: What in fact is your philosophy of music? Kubelik: I find it impossible to imagine mankind without music. Music should mean an ascending path for man, a path on which he finds an improvement of his own personality. It is a hope that one will not be lost in the general poverty in which we all live. After all, we are at war. And so what else can we do? Pray and live for music. Every artist, every musician, should thank the Lord he was born a musician, for it is in fact the simplest way to tile inner peace that man needs. For music is an immensely important substance of introverted or inner beauty, strength and necessity. It is not enough just to listen to music, one must love music, which of course is not enough either, one must draw conclusions from it and improve oneself through them. Západ: So music is a primary source of inspiration for man? Kubelik: Of course it is. Západ: Which of the great composers moved towards God through his work, and how did this appear in his music? Kubelik: Each and every composer has moved towards God, whether he knew it or not. or believed in God or not, that's not essential, but the fact that he created is in itself a way to God, because without that, it's im- possible. Quite simply, there are enormous forces in music, a huge reservoir that we are unaware of and can scarcely even imagine. Západ: So the composer's work is something like an expression of reli- gion? Kubelik: An expression of philosophy. It needn't be a "church" in the true sense of the word, but a pan-world philosophy á la Spinoza. Západ: And what about Janáček, for example. He was a declared atheist, at least so he claimed on his death-bed. Do you think that in his work too, there is that flash of the divine? Kube/ik: Weil, just the fact that he said, with Dostoyevsky, that "in everyone there is a spark of the divine"; that's something no atheist could say. If he used it as a motto and composed an opera around the phrase "in man there is a spark of the divine," then he believed in God, And if he said something different, it still doesn't mean it's true, because everyone has the right to contradict himself sometime. Západ: I'd like to ask you about some of the great personalities in Czech musical culture, as you knew them. What can you tell us about your friend- ship with Bohuslav Martinů? Kubelik: 1 didn't meet Martinů personally until after the war, be- cause during the war he was abroad and I remained at home. Bui before the war, Firkušný and I played his Second Piano Concerto in London. That was in 1938, before I'd met Martinů, Then I met him and per- formed some of his compositions, for example the Double Concerto for Strings, Piano and Tympani was always very successful. My first personal contacts with Martinů were in New York and Chicago. His relationship to music was - here I must use that word again - divine, because it was a kind of sincere link between his pure heart and his clear eye. Warmth radiated from his every movement and his every word. He spoke very little and whatever he said always had inner value, I'll never forget him, not only for his scores. 52 [pageend54]but for his personality and his whole relationship to life. He gave me a great deal. Západ: What I personally value most in Martinů arc the things that from the musical point of view may not necessarily he his most important works, like "The Opening of the Wells" (Otvírání studánek). In this and other cantatas of his, I feel that his CzechneSS was really very alive, even though he spent most of his life abroad. Kubelik: And his Field Mass is also powerful and beautiful and literally swirling with Czech music. Rhythm- ically it is an enormously rich work and harmonically, iťs a direct ex- presión of the Czech atmosphere and what we call the "Czech world". Západ: What was your relationship to Vítězslav Novák and J. B. Foerster? Kubelik: They were in fact indirectly my teachcrs, and when I was at the conservatory Foerster was frequent- ly a lecturer, as was Novák. I had direct contact with Foerster because my father was a great friend of his; he also played his Violin Concerto and wrote the cadenza for that concerto. I myself played Foerster's compositions later, in Prague. I recall my last handshake with him and his wife, just before I left Czecho- ilovakia, when they were recording his Easter Symphony with the Czech Philharmonic. It was a very moving moment because I already knew I was leaving and 1 didn't want to tell inyone, but they somehow sensed it jnyway. I was in touch with Novák quite frequently. He would come to my concerts and I performed almost all of his works. He even came when they performed my Veronika in the National Theatre, and I was proud that he liked it, and also other com- positions of mine that he heard, lie always praised me, but he never understood that 1 also liked Janáček. Západ: Janáček - why do you think his music canght on in America so late, compared to Europe? Kubelik: Sometimes it's a mystery. You need time to get used to his music and you have to have a kind of distance from it. But why do things always come so late in musical developement? Západ: One last question: do you consider yourself a Swiss or a Euro- pean conductor? Kubelik: I'm a Czech boy from the Czech countryside. I wasn't actually born in a cottage, it was a kind of small chateau, Býehory, but I've al- ways considered myself to be a son ol my father, who was born in Michle, the son of a gardener, and I'm a kind of little gardener myself. Zapad: So you are... Kubelik: A Czech conductor. Dvořák in America by Josef Škvoreeký Dvořák spent the summer of 1893 in Spillville, Iowa, a prosperous com- munity of Czech farmers where one could come in direct contact with the essence of America: its pioneering past. The grandparents of all those people with Czech surnames and English Christian names had come here soon after 1850—when the ter- ritory was still virgin prairie in- habited by Indians—as poor, land- less immigrants. Some of them were victims of the political persecutions in Austria after the revolution of 1848. In a mere forty years, literally using nothing but the work of their own hands, they had created a flourishing village including a Church of St. Wcnceslas which had ap- parently been designed in Prague. And from worries about earning their daily bread, they had graduated to the problem of how to outwit the militant women's societies that would report to the authorities any place selling beer, since it had been pro- hibited by the state. I think this transition characterizes very well the dizzying tempo of development in the American economy at a time when people were not yet interested merely in well-paying jobs, but in work that would support them ade- quately if thev carried it out honest- ly. It was to this village, lull of living memories of the pioneer days and the recent Civil War in which thousands of Czechs, some in the manner of Baron Miinhausen, some genuinely heroically, took part, among them the citizens of Spillville, that Dvořák came from Prague, a city where, al- though beer could be sold freely, difficulties were put in the way of im- porting foreign journals. It was this limitation that had ultimately brought Dvořák to Spillville. When he accepted the offer of Mrs, Thurber to direct the National Conservatory of Music in New York, Dvořák began looking for an English teacher, and he found one in Urbanek's music shop, where he used to go more or less regularly to meet his musician friends. It was here that he met a Czech from Spillville, Josef Kovařík, who had just graduated from the Prague conservatory, and came to Urbanek's to read the otherwise un- available American newspapers that someone had brought secretly from Paris. Thus the inheritor of the homo- geneous and classical European musical culture suddenly found him- self in a country where Patrick Sans- field Gilmore gave a concert with an orchestra of 160 tubas, 500 other brass instruments, about a thousand strings, ten field cannons and a massed choir of 20,000 voices, all producing a wave of sound so in- distinguishable that the concert end- ed in embarrassment, it was also a country where the pioneer Theodore Thomas, a musical self-made man, smuggled pieces by Beethoven and Mozart into the terrace Gardens concerts, where the audience smoked, drank and talked during perform- ances of Sousa's marches, Strauss waltzes and favorite arias from popular light operas. And it was a land where a tour by the famous concert singer Jenny Lind was organ- ized by the circus king P. T. Barnum in his own inimitable style. In other words, it was a confront- ation of two different cultures. But culture does not exist without people, and in America, Dvořák was sur- rounded by a group of fascinating personalities of a type unknown to him in Europe. Chief among them was Mrs. Jeanne tic Meyers Thurber, a charming and, according to Hune- ker, a very sexy lady, as we might say today. But Mrs. Thurber used her charms and her husband's mil- lions for exclusively impersonal aims: to realize her dream of a serious American music, which she hoped to bring into being first by establish- ing an American National Opera (and a fortune was lost in that fiasco) and then through the American National Conservatory, which her millions kept afloat until the end of 53 [pageend55]ihe 1920s, She was every inch an American, as Dvořák knew well, but he evidently understood and sup- ported her efforts, nor was he blind to her charms - while observing all the Victorian proprieties, of course. His conflict with Jeannette was pure- ly financial: very soon, she owed him considerable sums of money, for in the collapse of 1893, her husband lost his millions and it took him a few years to get back into financial shape. Behind the conflict over the money can be felt, in the correspondence, the firm hand of Dvořák's wife, with- out whose keen eye for finance Dvo- řák would probably have sold his hest symphonies for the price of a popular song, and would have thrown in the Scherzo capriccioso as a bonus. Jeannette's husband himself would make a good subject for a novel. He was typical self-made man. beginning with nothing and becom- ing a millionaire and owner of a chain of variety stores in the course of a few years. He was one of the originators of an idea that Thomas Baťa, the Czech shoe manufacturer, was later to base his business on. Thurber's shops sold goods that were manufactured in factories also own- ed by him, thus eliminating the middle-man and producing interest- ing results in the field of profit. But the inventiveness of this clever Yankee did not end there. He sold a consider- able number of shares in his compa- nies to his own employees,on theone hand to provide them with social security, and on the other hand to give lliem an interest in the prosperity of his enterprise. This, if I am not wrong, is one of the first examples of a system that was later called "popu- lar capitalism" in the 1960s. And in the third place, Jeannette's success- ful husband was head of the anti- trust movement and the bete noir of the monopolists of his day, After years of wild disputes and struggles, the movement managed to have legis- lation passed that put drastic limits on the destructive power of the cartels and trusts. But that was not all there was to Francis Thurber's Americanism. When his stock companies went bust in the panic of 1893. he threw himself into a study of law at the age of 53, and in a few short years, he became one of the most successful lawyers in New York. It was of such original personalities that the American world of Antonin Dvořák was made up, Among others, there was the frustrated piuno player, the cynical and brilliant music critic. essayist and writer James /¡wicker. Dvořák's colleage in the conservatory and Jeannette's secretary (he claimed I ha i his only duty u«.v to admire her appearance oni loud each morning for an hour), in whose novel Painted Veils Jeannette and Dvořák make their first brief appearance in fiction. He found the music of old Borax (he couldn't pronounce " D v o ř á k " ) more or less unbearable and, perhaps in revenge, he left us a valuable re- port on how the pious Master took an uncommon liking to cocktails in New York, a novelty as yet unknown in Europe, and how, on pilgrim mages around the Manhattan bars, he dis- played a superhuman capacity for alcohol. Then there was Theodore Thomas, already mentioned above, an inti- mate friend of the Garrigue family, who lived a short distance from Dvo- rak's lodgings on 17th Street in New York, Their daughter Charlotte, who was an excellent musician, had mar- ried a certain professor Masaryk a few years before Dvořák's arrival. Jeannette M. Thurber Thomas was the first to present Dvo- řák's compositions in America, and he himself was a piece of Americana: he had come as a boy from Germany with his father, also a musician, and spent years travelling by horseback from town to town in the deep South as "the youngest violin virtuoso in the world T. T." He would put the posters up himself, collect the ad- mission fees himself, and then play. Once he was driven out of town bya religious fanatic in the belief that his virtuosity was inspired by the devil - a story straight out of Mark Twain, Thomas was also Dvořák's good friend. Then there was the charming Adele Margulies. a native of Vienna, who was in fact responsible for Dvo- řák's going in America, Jeannete had asked her to visit either Dvořák or Sibelius during her summer va- cations spent in Vienna, and persuade them to come to America, Adele was not enthusiastic at the prospect of a journey to Helsinki, so she went to Vysoká instead. And finally, there were dozens of colourful musicians of the nineteenth century, virtuosos, charlatans, eccentrics and cosmopolitans. And there were above all the blacks. It does not appear that Dvořák had ever heard them before. He may have once attended a concert in Eng- land of the Fisk Jubilee Singers, the first choir to bring Negro spirituals to Europe. But this cannot be con- firmed. On theother hand his opinion on the black race and their musical qualities is known, and in this he agreed with Jeannette, who was obviously a child of American abo- litionism. Long before the existence of "affirmative action" and without its attendant problems, the con- servatory. during Dvořák's director- ship, gave preference to black students. It was an expression both of efforts to encourage the process of emanci- pation, and of Dvořák's belief that black music was a sure foundation on 54 [pageend56]which serious American composers could create a national music. The conservatory orchestra, whose an- niversary concert Dvořák conducted in the spring of 1893, was - except for a white pianist - entirely black. For the concert. Dvořák arranged ••Old Foiks at Home" by Stephen Foster, a composer who was not black but who, Dvořák believed, wrote in the spirit of black music. According to reviews at the time, the choir of black boys and girls swayed rhythmically during their perform- ance - in other words, they "swung" - and the solo parts were sung by Si ssieretta Jones and Harrv V, Bur- leigh. Here were two interesting personalities, and Dvořák certainly knew them both. After all, he re- hearsed with them daily and Bur- leigh even claimed that he tran- scribed ihe score of Mew World Sym- phony. Sissierctla - very liule is known about her - was apparently a wonder- ful singer (they called her "Black Patti" after the most famous soloist of the time, which annoyed her, for she wanted to be more than just the black shadow of some white magni- ficence) who spent her life and her talent louring with her own minstrel show. As Thomas had with Mozart, she smuggled Schumann's songs and arias from the great operas into the repertoire. And Burleigh? The grand- son of a slave who went blind and was freed because he was no longer of any use. The son of a teacher who, besides a number of modern languages, also had a command of Latin and Greek but because of the colour of her skin never became more than a caretaker in the school where she had hoped to teach. And he himself later became the composer of once-famous songs. I had the good fortune to be able to speak with Burleigh's friend, Mrs. Josephine Love from Detroit, and she was able to tell me several things about this colourful man that I was unable to find elsewhere and which gave a human dimension to the portrait preserved only in a hand- ful of official articles. As an old jazz lover, I was natural- ly interested in the question of whether there might noi be a slender connection here with the black music that conquered the world. A remarkable field for speculation is opened up, for instance, by the fact that Scott .loplin, the first great composer of ragtime, a musical form that is closely related to jazz, was al the Chicago Columbian Exhibition at roughly the same time as Dvořák conducted there at the Czech Day celebration, li is in fact highly likely thai he at least heard ragtime. It is well known that he liked to wander around the Lower East Side and write down what he heard, and there was certainly a lot to hear. Among Dvořák's associates was another colourful American original. Will Marion Cook, Dvořák's Ameri- can student, also a black (his Original middle name was Mercer) who had studied the violin for six years in Berlin with the famous virtuoso and teacher, Joseph Joachim. And now. a young black with a classical Euro- pean musical education found him- self at an American conservatory under the influence of one of the fore- most representatives of that tradition of the time - except that this Master had rather odd ideas. He guided his students away from the notion that they should try to outdo Mozart in areas where Mozart was clearly, un- beatable, and towards the notion that they should study their own popular music, soak upits influences, and then try to write serious music enriched by tlíc spiril of harmony and melodies of the black churches. The first to have taken this mission to heart was another of Dvořák's black students, Maurice Arnold Stratlhoiie. At the same anniversary concert in 1893. Dvořák introduced Stratthotte's Plantation Dances, and although the critics treated it with lhirrv 7. Burleigh condescending irony, it was evident- ly an attempt to realize the Master's theories. Arnold was not successful as a composer and dropped from sight, and I don't even know if the score for Plantation Music was pre- served. Another of Dvorak's ap- prentices who evidently believed in his gospel was Rubin Gold mark, who later became the teacher of Aaron Copland and George Gershwin. And is not Porgy and Bess a marvellous example of the application of Dvo- řák's theories? But above all, there is Will Marion Cook. Once again, I had the good fortune to be able to spend a day with his son. Professor Mercer Cook, in Washington. Apart from personal reminiscences of his father and various printed materials, he also provided me with a manuscript copy of Cook's autobiography - unfortu- nately unfinished. Ii is the kind of manuscript that makes one despair that fate did not allow its author to finish. Il is a jewel of a typically black - or perhaps I should say a typically Shakespearean - mixture of humour and bitterness. And now look at this: six years under Joachim, not quite a year under Dvořák, and this clasicalty educated virtuoso became, a few years later, the author of the first black musical to break onto Broad- way, called C/orinda. or the Origin of the Cakewalk. Will's mother, who made many sacrifices to send her son to Europe to study, commented on the sensational success of the musical with these symptomatic words: "Oh Will, Will. I've sent you all over the world to study and become a great musician, and you return such a nigger!" I would say that Will did not return from Europe "such a nigger." 1 would say that this metamorphosis - which was unpopular at the time among cultivated blacks - must partly, at least, be laid at the door- step of the white Master from Prague. Think of the impact it must have had on the young man, encouraged by his family environment to forget about the "primitive" music of his race and to try to become like the great white serious musicians of Europe, sudden- ly to hear one of the most respected of these European masters recom- mend that his students go and listen to a black minstrel show. And they resisted. They wanted to hear Wagner, while their teacher went - with Jeannettc (he left his wife at home with the children) - to see the Indian drummers in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. I'm convinced - although it is of course impossible to say precisely what was going on in the heads of young, educated blacks - that the attitude of his brilliant composer, unburdened by local American pre- judices and racism, must at least have f,iven them the courage to take a step that the majority of their educated black contemporaries probably felt was a step backwards, against the 55 [pageend57]current of emancipation and back to the primitivism of slavery. It is certain that immediately after Dvořák's three-year stay in America, a move- ment began that led to the famous Harlem Renaissance at the beginning of the 20th century. But Cook's conversion to the Cake Walk is not the only thread linking Dvořák to jazz, In 1919 Will Marion. angered by the Boston Symphony's refusal - on racial grounds - to grant him the position of concert-master, although the position properly belonged to him - revived an orchestra with which he already had been in London before the war, called it the Southern Syncopated Orchestra and took it to Europe. It played music that had all the features of a proto- jazz—ragtime, blues, instrumental vocalizat ions—but unlike the wild proto-jazz of La Rocca's Original Dixieland Hand from the same period, the music was carefully arranged, and the repertoire included Dvořák's Humoresque. Contemporary critics were unanimous in their admiration for the orchestra and its arrangements which, along with a considerable portion of its original repertoire, were the work of Will Marion. Can this not be seen as a further attempt to make concrete the ideas heard in the classroom on I 7th Street? And the point is not whether this was the right road for jazz to take or not: the point is thai Dvořák's student was trying to transform the raw material of folk music inio compositions for large orchestras (his own had fifty members). And. as a matter of interest, the critics were particularly full of praise for the melodic, im- provised solos of Cook's first clarinet- ist, a certain Sidney Bechet. In the twenties Cook lost his orchestra but he, among other ac- tivities, became a profound influence on Ellington who named his son Mercer al ier him. And since we know the master of the Cotton Club. Is it, after all, pure chance that Ellington made a reverential use of the violin - Cook's instrument - in the Black, Brown and Beige suit el And I wonder if Come Sunday, as H. M. Visman alleges, does not even bear an echo of the Larga. Is this too fantastic, loo unsub- stantiated? My friends, I have written a novel, not a scholarly thesis. My aim was to spend some time close to Dvořák and the people around him, and, if I have experienced it success- fully. to also arouse and strengthen renewed interest in our great com- poser who, whether we like it or not, stood at the cradle of something very Wit! Marion Cook American. Nunc ker, who as we know was not very fond of Dvořák's music, declared that his influence on serious American music was destructive in that some day, he claimed, ragtime would he heard from the concert podia and people would consider it serious music. His prophesy, thank God, came true - perhaps for the first time when the glissando of the clari- net which introduced Rhapsody in Blue was heard in Carnegie Hall, music that has been christened by products of the plantation, the black ghettos, and the ragtime pianisis who confused the piano with the drums and the clarinet with the human voice. So much tor the music and the people surrounding Dvořák during his stay in America. Above all, of course, he was surrounded by his colourful family. In Spillville i had the rare opportunity to speak with two ladies who still remember Dvo- řák: Mrs. Mary klimesh and a Swiss- American, Mrs. Lou Bematz. They are a hundred this year and ai the time when Dvořák went drinking beer clandestinely in their native village, they were both twelve-year- old girls, and therefore Dvořák re- mains in their memory only as a grumpy old man reeking of cigars, though he was only fifty-two at the time. But they did play frequently with Dvorak's older children, and to this day they remember them as Anča, Lojzička, Tony and Magda. Their recollections of the oldest daughter Otylka are just as vague as their memories of her father. She was fifteen at the time, but what they recall is interesting. "She would just stand at the window and stare out all the time," Mrs, Klimesh told me. As Dvořák lovers know, the life of the charming and tragic Otylka in Spill- ville is surrounded by a certain rather spicy secret. According to gossip, which has survived there to this day. she wanted to run off with one of the Indians who performed in Spillville at that time and inspired her father to write a string quartet. In any case, with the assistance of those two elderly and discreet ladies, I think 1 have been able to identify the man, of whom Otylka was genuinely not un- fond and it is not out of the question that she was even prepared to kick up her heels with him. Unfortunately he was not a Hiawatha, but even so that possibility is not uninteresting to a novelist. Which brings me to the life of the Master himself. The general feeling is that it is lacking in drama and therefore - unlike the notion that Mozart was poisoned by Salieri - it is not good material for a novel. It is (rue (hut Dvořák had a hard child- hood and youth, but after turning 30 he very quickly settled down and from then until lbe end of his life he rested on his laurels, graced with a large family to whom he clung with moving affection, and was loved by his countrymen in a way that artists of today can only dream of. But there are certain interesting elements here. Music critics have noticed the remarkable stubbornness with which he defended himself when his friend, the cellist Wilian wanted to drop the final bars of his American cello concerto and replace them with a cadenza of his own. Dvorak's stub- bornness springs from the fact - also confirmed by musical theoreticians - that the final bars contain a quotation from a love song that lie composed in his youth for JosefinaČermáková, later the Couniess Kounic. But neither the cadenza nor the quotation Josefina 56 [pageend58]were in the original score of the concerto. Dvorak wrote it in after returning home, when .lose fin a died. The conflict with Wihan ended in a falling out and the concerto was per- formed at its world premier by the English cellist Stern. Skillful musico- logists finally discovered that Rusal- ka's aria - one of the most beautiful anas in operatic history - is a para- phrase of the same youthful love song. And he wrote the opera a few years before his death. The literature on Dvorak rarely points out that the newly-weds had a healthy young boy lour months after getting married. The birth of a healthy child in the fourth month of pregnancy is something rather un- usual. The mother's maiden name was Anna Cermdkovd, and she was the younger sister of Josefina. I think that here we have the elements of a very human drama and a very interesting love story. Dvorak taught both sisters to play the piano. When he began, Anna was eleven and Josefina sixteen, Anna grew up to become a girl that we would call plain today: she was neither un- attractive, nor a beauty. She was also a woman of very clear aims, circumspect and rational. The emotional Josefina, on the other hand, was a celebrated beauty. More- over. she was a successful actress admired, among others, by the theatre critic Jan Neruda, although it is clear to anyone who reads his re- views that his admiration was more for her appearance than her art. The hearts of many young men un- doubtedly burned for josefina, but Josef Skvoreeky, a member of the editorial board of Zäpad. is one of the foremost Czech writers living today. In 1980 he won the prestigious Neu- stadt Prize for Literature. Josef Sk vo- recky is Professor of American Litera- ture at the University of Toronto. Mrs. Mary KHmesh the race was won by Count Kouňic. And so Josefina became a countess, but in fact she had long since - gently but definitively - given her teacher the gate. Meanwhile, the eleven-year- old Anna had grown into a seventeen, eighteen and then nineteen-year-old young lady. Dvořák, according to the testimony of his contemporaries, did not have a way with women. He was so shy that when his landlady held a ball, he always fled and re- turned home long after midnight. At nineteen Anna was extremely talented in music, and she clearly admired her teacher. If' we put together the teacher's bash fulness and his frustration from having been betrayed by Josefina and Anna's ambition, we may offer an educated guess as to who, in all probability, seduced whom. In this age of sexual equality, it is no longer considered a character fault if the initiative to sin conies from the woman, And in any case, it has long been a public secret as to its origin: as we know, it was not Adam who offered Eve the apple. But a sensitive artistic soul is in- capable of holding a grudge against the serpent that turns us down for counts. The motif of Josefina stretches through Dvořák's entire life; he was even a frequent visitor at the Kounic chateau in Vysoká, and everyone knew he was fond ol Josefina, At her funeral, he wepi more profusely than the Count him- self. Two dedications give the ro- mance a grotesque flavour: a love song to Josefina, and the song "Ave Maria" to "My dearest spouse". Dvořák was known 10 use religion to tactical purposes: to the mother of his first female acquaintance, Anna Matějková, he gave a votive picture of the Virgin Mary; to Anna, a da- guerrotype portrait of himself. He gave the father a cigar, but even so, that Anna married someone else. Let there be 00 misunderstanding: neither this article nor my novel are intended as a contribution to musico- logy or history. They are merely - as the subtitle of the novel indicates - an attempt to realize a merry dream about Dvořák. The author was assisted in the w riting of the novel by a Guggenheim Fellow- ship. Interview with Jiří Traxler who used to he a foremost jazz com- poser in Prague, before coming to Canada in 1949. lie was interviewed for Západ by Josef Skvoreeky. Západ: Can non-Americans play real jazz? Traxler: Americans are closest to jazz, and not only geographically. Those who are black are usually, but not always, a step closer to it than the whites. In terms of the under- standing and creative imitation of jazz, the Anglo-Saxons are right be- hind the Americans, and among those, first place belongs to the Canadians who, mainly in the west (Winnipeg, Edmonton, Vancouver) make incredibly good jazz. Anyone who doubts this should listen to the program called Jazz-Radio Canada every Friday evening from 8:30 to 10:00 on the CBC. Of the Slavic nations I would say the Czechs are better than the Poles. As far as the types of jazz are concerned, I prefer jazz arranged for large orchestras, but with lots of room for long solo improvisations. Of course this remains in the same riverbed as the original mainstream jazz and emotionally, it derives from blues. It's obvious that the art and work of Duke Ellington was cast in this mould. By this I don't mean to say that I don't like very different bands like the Casa Lomu Band, or Spike Hughes, or that I don't shiver with delight when I listen to records by Benny Goodman, Jack Tear- garden, Artie Shaw, Glenn Miller. Stan Kenton - the list could go on. Jazz in Czechoslovakia - not Czecho- slovak jazz (you'll notice there is a difference) was and is undoubtedly derivative and frequently imitative, but the inspiration is a healthy one and it's from the right sources. It's sincere, technically excellent and 57 [pageend59]sometimes it's as close to tile original spirit as it's possible for a white Middle European to get. I'm terribly fond of jazz to this day - I mean mainstream jazz - and 1 can best illustrate how other music fits into this in my present world by using that old, worn-out hypothetical question: what records would you take with you to a desert island. Foi the life of me I can't really say, but if I could only take two, then I'd choose Ellington's composition Echoes of Harlem and Rachmaninov's ¡'¡ano Concerto No. 2 in C Minor. Of course I'd Iry and gel them to let me take three, and the third one would be Armstrong's West End Blues. And because I believe you've got nothing to lose by opening your mouth, I'd try to negotiate a fourth record, which would be Honcgger'sPastorale ďété. And that would be enough. Západ: What is your critical opinion of the music that Czech jazz emigrants like Miroslav Vitouš or Jan Hammer Jr. are making today in the USA? Traxler: That's a difficult question. 1 was always - and I still am today - too emotionally involved in jazz to be able to make objective and coolly impersonal critical judgements. In other words, all I can offer you are personal points of view. What Jan Hammer Jr. and Miroslav Vitouš have done recently separately - Hammer with the Mahavishna Orchestra and Vitouš with Weather Report is, for me, a lol less interest- ing than the music iliey made together in Prague as the Junior Trio with Alan Vitouš on the drums. I'm think- ing mainly here of their contribution to the record Czechoslovak Jazz, ¡965. where their jazz interpretation of some folk songs is a milestone on a road that I don't dare predict where it was leading. In a private sense, what makes it interesting for me is that I knew both their fathers: the com- poser-arranger-bassist-singer-pianist -vibraplionist (all in one person) Honza Hammer Sr., and the saxo- phonist-clarinetist Pepik Vitouš, a very sharp looking fellow and a sensitive musician. What their off- spring are doing goes further than 1 personally want to go in jazz. I'm not even sure that jazz is the proper language for what it is they want to express. Moreover, I don't think thai this type of music is played for the listener anymore, and I wouldn't hesitate to say that the musicians themselves get a lot more out of it than their audience. And young Vitouš as a bassist? He's a virtuoso on those long solos on the bass - as you would expect - hut for me ii seems somehow over- done. In mv antedeluvian opinion, the bass should confirm ihe music, and when it Starts getting mixed up in melody, 1 don't like it very much, I've never been a fan of extended bass solos. You know What 1 mean, those pizzicatos in the upper registers where the bass just isn't ihai interesting to anybody lo justify playing it solo for God knows how many minutes. Západ: How do you feel in Canada? Traxler: Wonderful. And I always have, even though at first I had to lower my expectations and raise that to the level of a virtue. Perhaps be- cause I like Anglosaxonsand because I spoke their language from the start, I felt at home here, which is just a manner of speaking because in fact I fell better than I felt at home. Of course it was an enormous change for me. I left Czechoslovakia (illegally), then I left Europe, I stopped being a composer, although not without the occasional attempt, in the beginning at least, to go on writing music, I got married, had a family - and all within two years. Twenty-five years later I was making a satisfying living as a technical illustrator and working with engineer designers and graphic artists in the marketing side of the aircraft industry, and all that time in the same place. Now I've been retired for three years and my wife and I (and our cat) live comfortably and healthily out- side the city in a beautiful hilly countryside north of Montreal. In the summer we tend our garden and my neighbour and I - he's also from South Bohemia - occasionally llv up to Labrador for some trout fishing. I don't miss Europe and I miss Czechoslovakia - especially wiih the situation there now-even less. Where is my homeland? Oh Canada. But there's more than one reason for the way I feel on that score. In the twenty-nine years I've been here, I've had opportunity and good fortune to get to know my new home- land coast to coast. And do you know what? It's only now, that I'm coming up seventy that I've become a patriot. This is a country I'm proud of, and again, there's more than one reason for that. I'll tell you one of them. Not long ago, when I was waiting for a program on nature to come on after the news on tele- vision, they ran a series of political advertisements prepared by all the parties. That was just before the federal election and so naturally they pulled out all the stops. I turned off Jiří Traxler was one of the foremost composers and arrangers of jazz and swing in Czechoslovakia until his de- parture in 1949. He lives in Chertsey, Quebec. the TV because I'd already decided who I was going to vote for, hut when I turned it on, the advertisements were still on and they were giving a speil for the Marxist-Leninist Party of Canada. How about that! A young man appeared on the screen, good looking, very well dressed, and he very briskly condemned I) capitalist imperialism (USA. Canada, the UK, etc.) 2) socialist i m p e r i a l i s m (Russia, China) 3) more orlessevery- thing else in the world, except for his own party. And that was when 1 fell the proudest: to be the citizen of a country (capitalist and imperialist) that allows a Marxist-Leninist (com- munist) party to present iis program on TV at the public expense, that is, for your money and mine. Some might say that this is a weakness of democracy, but I believe - and a lot of people agree with me - that this is precisely its strength and the sign of its ultimate success. Eva Omanová a member of the editor- ial board of Západ, is a writer living in Toronto. 58 [pageend60]Prose Caviar and Other Mouth-watering Delights In Kva I i manova The wife of Vacek, the insurance agent, was making supper. She had been to the market that morning for a pink fillet of salmon, white button mushrooms, green broccoli and a marbled cheese and poppysced cake from the Jewish bakery. The magazine Gourmet lay open before her and she glanced at it occasionally. Vacek had just had a bath and smellcd of Aqua Velva. He was wear- mga shirt he'd got for Christmas and a pale blue lie inherited from a de- ceased neighbour. He was holding his second drink of the evening. "What did I tell you," he said to his wife, "From bus driver to insur- ance agent, and who knows what I'll be a year from now." "It's what I've always said, isn't it?" said the wife. She lay the sauteed mushrooms on the fillet and then rolled the fish around them, "An honest and clever man can go as far as he wants. Maybe one day you'll even be able to do your pure mathe- matics," "Well," Vacek sighed dreamily, pushing his glasses back up on his nose, "I'll bow to your intuition. So far you've always been right. But this job I have now is pretty close to it al- ready. It may not seem like it, but it's all figures and paperwork and organi- zation. You know, Babka, I actually enjoy doing it. I never thought I'd enjoy work, I mean anything that wasn't pure math." He picked up a slippery mushroom and popped it into his mouth. "Go on," said his wife lovingly. "God it's delicious. Way better than Lipert could do." 'Til never be a Lipert,"said Babka modestly, "but one day I just might open a little bistro. Somewhere downtown with a single counter and a few little tables. Can't you just see it, darling? A red arborite counter and wooden bar stools with rattan backs. Did you know that red stimu- lates the appetite?" "When I was ten," Vacek said, "my grandfather took me to Lipert's for ice-cream as a birthday treat. 1 remember him saying to mother, 'The boy's old enough now to ap- preciate a little luxury.' Mom tried to persuade him to take me to a regu- lar ice-cream parlour, but grandfather wouldn't hear of it. Mom always treated food as something essential and she thought of delicacies as a sin," Vacek twisted the corkscrew into a bottle of white Hungarian wine. "They'll soon be here," said Bab- ka. "Do you think they'll like the way I've done the table, darling?" "The table is magnificent, Babka, I was just about to say, I like,the flowers at every place." "I chose red to stimulate their ap- petite," laughed Babka. "Do you think they'll like the fish?" "That's not fish, Babka, it's a-work of art. I swear to God." "I still have to add the broccoli and cover it with Sauce Hollandaise." "Sauce Hollandaise," Vacek smacked his fips. "Just like Lipert's. There were mirrors all over the place and when the headwaiter arrived, you could see him a hundred times over in the glass. He carried silver bowls. God, there was so much silver- cutlery, soup dishes, sugar bowls, saltcellars, all silver. And the sun shone through gigantic plate-glass windows and everything glittered and sparkled like a huge crystal chandelier. Grandad ordered es- cargots and a bottle of Lacrimae Christi, and pistachio ice cream for me." "Escargots! Oh, I love escargots, darling," Babka crooned. "And pistachio ice cream - a pure dream." "At the time I had no idea it would be green, so it was a real surprise. I'd never even heard of green ice cream before, let alone tasted it. They brought everything to us on silver and everyone saw our waiter a hundred times over in the mirrors, and us too. There was a huge fat man sitting by the window, cramming down one course after another, 'Bě- hounek," said my grandfather, and he raised his glass in the man's direct- ion, 'You're a very fortunate young man to encounter Běhounek on your tenth birthday.* The fat man lifted his glass at grandfather in return and 1 asked who he was. 'A famous traveller, journalist, writer and cannibal,' said grandad proudly. 'A cannibal is someone who eats the flesh of his own kind. Běhounek and Nobile ate the famous Swedish ex- plorer Malmgren on an expedition to the South Pole, Just look at him stowing it away.' And then the head- waiter appeared a hundred times in the mirror carrying three hundred tiny roasted birds garnished with miniature tomatoes and white shoots of salsify. " 'Quail,' sighed my grandfather knowledgeably. 'My boy, this is in- deed your lucky day. On your tenth birthday, to witness a cannibal dining on quail. You can't appreciate it now, lad, because you're still too young, but one day you'll remember it.' " "And he was right, darling," laughed Babka. "Do you think our boy will have memories of his child- hood like that? I mean, with no grandfather or relatives and all?" "Of course he will. Maybe not about roast quail, but he'll have memories all right." "They're here already," said Bab- ka, flustered. She rinsed her hands off at the sink, wiped them on her apron and then carefully hung up the apron on a plastic hook. She brushed the hair from her forehead and Hushed with excitement. "This is my new boss," Vacek said, "and his wife Joan." "Fine salesman you have here, Mrs. Vacek," said the boss, and palled Vacek appreciatively on the shoulder. "What a delightful little house," 59 [pageend61]said Joan, looking around. "Thank you," said Babka. She felt pleased. "We do what we can. You have to realize that we came here with nothing." "It must have been hard," said the boss. "Scarcely imagine anything tike that, eh Joan?" "Why did you come with nothing?" Joan asked. "You know, it was after Dubček and all that," said Vacek. "He was your president, wasn't he?" Babka got up and went into the kitchen. She knew that a lengthy explanation would now follow. Still, she continued to hope before each visit that the conversation wouldn't come around to it again, yet she couldn't shake the impulse to apolo- gize for their small house and modest furniture. She wondered what Canadians talked about among themselves. Did they talk about books the way we used to at home, or the theatre, or music? She arranged the canapes in neat rows like a chessboard on the silver plate and between them she placed little bunches of bushy parsley top- ped with black olives. From the living room she could hear Vacek explain- ing the difference between Czechs and Slovaks in his heavily accented English, When she brought the plate of hors d'oeuvres and her grand- mother's damask serviettes to the guests, she noticed the boss yawning inconspicuously. "How lovely," Joan cried. "Please help yourselves," said Babka. "Na zdrávi" said Vacek, raising his wine-glass, "How did you say that?" asked the boss. "Na zdrávi," Vacel repeated. "That's Czech for 'to your health'." "Na zda rvi," said the boss. "Naz-da-ra-vi," laughed Joan, and then she said, "What are those little round things?" "That's Russian caviar," said Bab- ka. "So that's Russian caviar," said the boss, "Looks like ordinary fish eggs to me." He laughed. Vacek looked at Babka, who was just about to say ihey were no! ordi- nary fish eggs, but she caught her longue in time. She went into the kitchen and drank a full glass of sherry. The boss's wife scolded her husband. "Who'd ever pay so much for just plain fish eggs, silly?" she said, and added " The sturgeon is actually an aristocrat among fish, like the Czar." Babka poured herself another glass. She felt that pleasant, familiar feeling of heaviness slowly creeping into her legs. She heard her husband toss off a nonchalant question. "Do you like fishing?" "I can't stand fishing," said Joan. "I've got this mental block about it." "You know how it is," complained the boss. "You can't take women fishing. They get bored. But I enjoy it myself. Matter of fact I'm quite an avid fisherman. I like sitting up there in the bush in the middle of a lake where the mosquitoes can't get at me, and suddenly the water ripples and underneath me a school of those clever little buggers start nuzzling the bait. You know some people think fish are stupid but it's not true. Fish are smarter than people," "You said it," said Joan. "Once I caught a salmon on a gold spoon. A twenty-two pounder." Joan sighed, stood up and went into the kitchen to look for Babka. "They've started talking about fishing again. It's terrible. Men re- member every damn fish they ever caught. Sometimes I think I'd be better off as a fish. At least then they'd notice what I've got on and how much 1 weigh," she said, running her hand over her slim hips. The irri- descent material in herdresscrackled with static electricity. "That's a wonderful dress," said Babka admiringly. "Can 1 touch it?" "Go right ahead," Joan offered. The material was cold and slippery and it clung to Joan's body like skin. For a moment, Babka had the sen- sation of touching a naked thigh. "It really is very beautiful," she said and pulled her hand away. flic shimmering material seemed to quiver. "It picks up a lot of static," said Joan, "Every once in a while I have to dampen my hands and run them over the material to bleed it off, Which reminds me, where's your washroom?" When Joan had left the room, Babka turned off the heat under the rice. From the livingroom, she could hear the boss's voice. "Salmon make the best fishing. They say that fish are cold-blooded, but let me tell you, salmon are passionate little numbers and they can put you through it better than a good woman. I've actually seen guys get erections when lhay had a salmon on the line. It's a sexual experience. That beautiful smooth, sleek body and the power they have when they make their run upstream over the rocks, then recuperate in a quiet backwater, then back into it again, thrashing and leaping, slim as arrows and shiny, up over the dams like they had wings and then back again into the current, holding them- selves in one place with all their might, trembling with the effort, flashing in the sunlight, and then back into the current again inch by inch until finally, somewhere up near the source, orgasm and death. That's what 1 call a sexual experience, by God." "Fish and sex," said Joan, back from the bathroom, "That's all they know how to talk about. Talk" she emphasized. "But when it comes right down to it, how many fish do you think he's caught in his life, not to mention the sex? I'll bet it's the same with you people, eh?" "At our age," said Babka, "perhaps it's not so important." She felt her- self turning red. She'd never talked with anyone about this before. "What do you mean 'at our age'?" cried Joan. "You just heard for your- self, Salmon don't give up until they die. A salmon knows very welt that it's worth a little effort to overcome the occasional obstacle, to try a little, Thai's the whole poini of a salmon's IiTe. Can you imagine how beautiful it is? Swimming your way upstream, salmon all around you, so thick in places you can walk right across the river and not get your feet wet. You can actually feel their rippling muscles and their beautiful wet skin, their strength, and you can see them gasping with the effort, their gills are flushed with blood, red, full of oxygen, their bellies and backs and sides rubbing up against one an- other . . .". Joan closed her eyes in ecstacy and ran her longue over her lips. "Shit," she said when she opened her eyes again, "Have you got some- thing to drink here?" "There's juice," said Babka quick- ly, "or coke." She felt her hand tremble as she took Joan's glass to the counter. "I'd like something a little strong- er, please," said Joan dejectedly. "I understand," laughed Babka, a little nervously. From behind a box of Special K she pulled a bottle of Johnny Walker, half empty. "I keep this hidden away for a rainy day," she said and glanced over her shoulder into the living room to make sure Vacek wasn't looking. 60 [pageend62]"Johnny Walker, a woman's best friend," said Joan, pouring some into her glass until it was brimming. "I'll have some too," said Babka, and when she'd taken a drink, she went on. "So you can cross the river on their backs'?" "That's just a way of putting it," said Joan, "but back in the old days, before the white man killed every- thing off and polluted everything, when the salmon were going to spawn, Indian dogs could run across their backs to the other side of the river as though they were crossing a bridge." "A living bridge of salmon," sigh- ed Babka, "I'd like to know," she continued, taking another sip of her drink, "If fish make love as well. Or is it just some kind of instinctual thing, just for the sake of reproduct- ion? The way you describe it.it seems more like -1 hope you don't mind my saying this - more like a huge orgy, all those bodies,continuousplcasure, ecstacy. no guilt feelings." "Do you believe in reincarnation?" asked Joan. "No, it's too complicated for me to understand." "Haven't you ever had the feeling that you know something intimately and you don't know why, or where the feeling comes from? Something like déjà vw?" "Of course, lots of times. But I never gave it much thought. I just accepted it, without trying to analyse it." "The reason I'm asking is because I want to tell you something in complete confidence. It has to do with your question," "It was a silly question, wasn't it?" sighed Babka. "How can anyone know whether fish actually make love?" "Listen, I've never told anyone this before and anyway, people would laugh al me, but I have a feeling you'll understand what I'm talking about." "More whisky?" said Babka. She re 111 led Joan's glass and her own. "Just imagine this. One spring I was walking in the Bruce Peninsula and the air still smelled of snow, al- though il was already lovely and warm. There was a brisk south wind and the lake and the sky had the same sharp blue colour and the rocks were giving off that kind of moist heat and there was still snow in the shadows. That's my favorite kind of weather, and the wind drives me crazy. I imagine that's the kind of feeling you Europeans must have when you walk through the Louvre or go to Venice, you know, that you belong there, that you're part of that culture. Anyway, the warm wind is like a hundred gentle hands taking your breath away, and you can't help yourself, you have to surrender to it. It's real madness. That day I sud- denly fell drawn up a brook that was swollen with spring run-off. I jumped from one stone to another, and the swift current below me, the melting snow sparkling like ice and here and there a salmon that had wandered into the stream by mistake, think- ing it was a river. The water led me from a sunny meadow into the dark bush, the stream got narrower and in a little pool, where the water was deeper, a lone salmon was writhing on the spot. Every once in a while it would Hip itself out of the water and land on its stomach on a dry rock. It would lie there, flopping about until it would fall back into the stream again and be carried back into the pool. 1 didn't even want to think about how many times it had already tried that, because it was obviously exhausted and it bad bloody scrapes on its stomach. "The stream drew me on until 1 could hardly see it any more, just a dark cut in the grass, the woods opened up and there was another sunny meadow where the water seemed to vanish. I was certain I'd been there before, because 1 knew intimately that soft sensation of water-soaked moss, the raw smell of marsh mangolds, the burning sun, "Then two feet in front of me were two salmon, still glistening and you could feel the strength oozing from their bodies, but their eyes were clouded over, dead. There was;i mass of fish-eggs around the larger body and a creamy, milk-like substance oozing from an Opening on the belly of the thinner salmon." "That's awful," sighed Babka. "It's like the fish really loved each other and went off so they could be alone." "Exactly," said Joan, "but that's not all. I saw myself in their place. All at once I fell like I'd been there before, as though that salmon lying there in the mass of eggs was me, and beside me was the only love of my life. I could still feel the paws of the Indian dogs on my back, the friction of silver bodies and the smell of cold water. I remembered how we lay there in the sun, unable to move, and how we slowly dried out while our breathing became heavier and heavier. But before wc died, I felt an explosion of pleasure, something un- imaginable. like a reward for all our hardships. "You know darling, we fish might even have had our own Shakespeare. Excuse me, I'm going to have to dampen myself again before wc eat." "Everything's cold anyway," Bab- ka apologized. "You'll have to for- give me, but we're having fish for supper. "Don't worry about it," said Joan. "I'll just have vegetables and rice." Towards morning, when their guests had left and Vacek was help- ing Babka clear the table, Babka said, "Do you think they enjoyed themselves, darling?" "I think so, Babka. The boss is really quite nicc, even though politics hores him." "How did you like Joan?" "Well to be frank, she didn't exact- ly . . . you know what 1 mean? She seemed kind of reserved and cool. At work they say she has Indian blood in her." "Not just Indian." said Babka. "Do you know what we talked about in the kitchen?" "You don't have to tell me: children, cooking, clothes and money. But tell me this: why didn't she eat the fish? That really annoyed me. You work on it all day, thinking up delicacies that would put a fancy restaurant to shame, and then she won't eat it. You must have been really disappointed." "As a matter of fact I wasn't, darling. Not everyone's like Běhou- nek." "What's that supposed to mean? I guess you must be pretty tired," Vacek laughed. "What were you two drinking out there, anyway?" Don't wear your pyjamas tonight, darling, Babka wanted to say when they were in the bedroom, but she couldn't bring herself to say it out loud. I'd like to sleep naked with you. feel your skin against mine, rub against your hips, your back, your thighs, your stomach, your feet, your hands . . . "Good night, Babka," said Vacek and he kissed her on the forehead. Then he turned his back to her and a few moments later mumbled, " D o you know that nobody in school believed me when 1 told them I had green ice cream for my birthday? Not to mention Běhounek, When people don't believe you, it almost seems as though it never happened at all. Sometimes I wonder myself whether I'm not just making it all up." "Don't worry, darling, 1 believe 61 [pageend63]you," she whispered, but Vacek was already breathing deeply. Through a crack between the curtains, daylight was already begin- ning to seep into the room, A Greenhorn in the New World by Ludf-k Snepp A big toe stared up inquisitively at me from a hole in my sock. I couldn't resist the lempiation to draw a miniature face on the toe-nail with my ball-point pen. Should I make it smile or frown? Ah, but a poor immigrant can't afford to be a bitter pessimist, so I drew a smiling face. It looked a little like Mr. Abel from Employment and Immigration where they gave us financial assist- ance until we got a regular job. Mr. Abel wasn't very fond of me, which was upsetting because he knew nothing about me. If he had, 1 might have forgiven him. Only today, when I looked at that grinning face on my toenail, did I realize that there were a number of reasons why Mr. Abel was not very particular about me. In the first place, he didn't quite know where to put me. He saw me as an un- necessarily difficult case, that made his job all the harder. He made me feel that before I showed up he had lived a wonderful life, undisturbed except for perhaps occasional digest- ive problems from too much sitting. Yet despite his personal antipathy towards me, he never failed to smile like a born gentleman. On my last visit, when I told him I couldn't even afford to buy food any more, his smile broadened and he retorted confidently: "No one's ever yet starved to death in this country." Perhaps he was hoping I'd become the first exception to the rule, be- cause he gave me no material aid whatsoever. U n f o r t u n a t e l y , my stomach is a barbarian, for Mr. Abel's spiritual consolidation did nothing to appease it. I began to sense how presumptuous it was of me to present myself here, in a foreign country, as what I really had been back home: a writer. Mr. Abel was clearly unconvinced. So 1 opened my briefcase and dumped my nine published books on his desk as proof. His only reaction was a grumbled "OK!" My first impulse was to write him off as an uncultured boor. Later, however, after having made the rounds of many companies without even managing to get work as an unskilled labourer, i under- stood what he had meant. He was worried about my ability to find a place in the labour market. No one here wants what we called a "cultural worker" back home, and anyway, what would they do with him? They just get in the way wherever they are, and everyone suspects they think too highly of themselves. When neither Mr, Abel nor I could find a job for myself washing dishes, he advised me, "For heaven's sake don't tell anyone you've written books," In the interests of my own salvation, therefore, I denied my past, stopped wearing a lie, and got myself a strange cap with a huge peak to make me look like a worker. I was filled with optimism. 1 realiz- ed that Canada, and the whole New World for that matter, is a land of optimism and for good reason. Take my new homeland, for instance: a rich country with everything from bears to gold mines, oil. deep woods and all kinds of indusn v. In addition to a federal government, they have ten provincial governments, which in itself is a sign of wealth. So I became an optimist and hung a smile on my face that I'd copied from pretty shop- girls. And now I wassittingin the cheap- est room 1 could find, at ten dollars a week, wiggling the toe sticking out of my sock. Mr. Abel's picture grin- ned encouragingly at me and I gave some profound thought to how best to invest my last dollar. Should I buy a new pair of socks or convert it into food and postage stamps? I re-read a want-ad looking for a superintend- ant of a family apartment building. They wanted someone honest (and 1 was, so far), a non-drinker (thanks to the state of my finances, I had to be), willing to work overtime (and what else could I do but comply?). As if struck by a positive intuition, I quickly wrote a reply to the ad. I was wonderfully practiced at such letters, for in the past month I'd written more than a hundred like it. Forgetting the hole in my sock, 1 went out with the letter in my hand and a dollar in my pocket. Since I was familiar with temptation and my own weaknesses, I bought the stamp first and only then converted the rest into daily bread and a piece of salami. I spit on the letter for good luck and threw it into the post box. Then I went to the park where I fed myself and the birds hopping around me, and gorged my famished soul on the soul-destroying spectacle of pretty girls. The pre-spring sun bravely re- vealed their graceful shapes and exciting contours. God, how much unused beauty there is in the world, radiating so unfruitfully into space, I almost regretted that the stone age was so far behind us, when a man had the right to carry a woman off to his lair. Only the thought of how Pd groan under the burden, or even the possibility of rupturing myself some- what cooled my unappeased ardour. So 1 was content to watch in quiet admiration as the beauty walked by me, and I consoled myself with the hope, based on wider experience, that wherever I was, I had always managed, somehow. When I didn't hunt down a woman myself, then one caught me. I hoped that in that re- gard, Canada wouldn't be tight-fisted. But even a connoisseur becomes satiated with beauty, so I closed the floodgates, turned my face to the Canadian sun, lay back comfortably on the Canadian bench made of Canadian wood in this tiny corner of an enormous country, so full of potential, and surrendered to in- vigorating slumber. The portrait of Mr. Abe! had al- ready vanished from my toenail and his outlines were swimming some- where in the sewers when the post- office delivered another half-dozen responses to my job applications. Opening envelopes was the most exciting thing in my day. It reminded me of childhood and opening sur- prise packages at the carnival, I lope always rose like grandmother's bun dough, but so far it had always col- lapsed again. No one wanted to take me on. There was no action and therefore no dollars either. I forgave my potential employers for not knowing my qualities. It was their loss. What seriously annoyed me, however, was the fact that every letter began "We are sorry, , . ." i' heard that phrase wherever 1 turned,and it probably echoes across the continent lor all I know. Gentleman bumps into gentleman and says he is sorry; a lousy driver smashes into another car and naturally he is also very sorry; I buy some packaged meat, only to find it rotting inside, and when I take it back, the manager is sorry. I can imagine that even a murderer who hits my arm while aiming at my heart would say he was sorry too, mainly because he hadn't sent me straight to the happy hunting grounds. I cali this socially threadbare expression of politeness "sorryism" and it is essentially a disease. Every sorryist, through long use of this sorry drug, 62 [pageend64]tic CO fries a hypocrit because his sorri• often hides nothing more than a selfish, callous laziness and a great many other short-comings as well. liven today, over a pile of fresh letters, hope rose trrepressibly with- in me, watting to be put into the oven of action. The first letter began with a clear "We are sorry. . ." The same phrase occurred in the next three 1 opened, but still my hopes were not dashed. 1 had genuinely become an incorrigible optimist. And sure enough, the fifth letter began dif- ferently. "We regret.,," it said. That was a good omen. I opened the next letter with trembling hands and read those golden and long-awaited words, "Please come at 2 pm . ..". My idling brain immediately went into high gear. First I began to think about the best way to impress a boss look- ing for an apartment superintendent. Should I don the guise of the blue- collar or the white-collar worker? Should I deny, as Peter did Christ, my sinful past as a pen-pusher, or modestly admit to it? I decided on the golden mean. I knotted my tie with studied carelessness, put on a slightly rumpled suit and left my shoes unpolished. I did, however, put on my last clean shirt. I wore neither a hat nor my working-class cap but a neutral beret. Then I set off to the appointed place on the other side of the city. 1 didn't take the bus. Not that I was being parsimonious, it was just that 1 didn't have the money for it. It was a long and ex- hausting trek. Cars whipped by me in an unending stream, splashing my pant-legs with muddy water from the puddles, because as though on pur- pose, the weather had turned im- possibly cold and wei. 1 forged ahead against the wind and for the first time, 1 realized bow vast this country was. My only worry was that my shoes might give out and I'd arrive for the interview in my bare feet. The shoes held together and so did I, and I even arrived on time, though I was rather sodden. Al last I entered the office, which at the same time served as a model suite. It was equipped with luxurious new furniture, and the only thing betraying its function as an office was a desk and a typewriter. To my surprise and disappointment there were already six couples sitting there, all of them clearly interested in the same position. For an instant, my old pessimism caught up with me, and 1 wondered if my pilgrimmage had been pointless. 1 greeted the others politely and because there was no- where to sit down, 1 remained stand- ing in the corner like a chaste young man. Just as I was wondering where the boss was, a blackhaired gentle- man stuck his head out from behind a curtain leading to another room and called out a name. A young couple stood up and followed him behind the curtain. This freed a place and I sat down. Now, for the first time, I felt exhaustion from the long walk creeping up on me. Unfortun- ately I couldn't succumb to sleep, for they would scarcely have hired any- one who dozed off in mid-day, just like that. So I awaited my turn im- patiently as though I were at the dentists, and oddly enough, just as one's teeth often stop aching in the waiting room, so my nervousness suddenly disappeared and 1 became completely relaxed, apathetic, utter- ly indifferent to whether they hired me or not. The room gradually emptied and before I knew it the black-haired man popped out from behind the curtains and spoke my name. I followed him behind the curtain. He was a congenial, well- nourished man in his fifties, dressed with careless elegance. There was a warm joviality in his face, and his eyes were bright. But my attention was drawn even more to the other person in the room, a woman in her thirties. "Sit down," said the man, indicat- ing a chair by the desk. He was hold- ing my letter in his hand and glanced through it. "So, you're interested in the position of superintendent." I nodded. "Do you know what that involves? We've got a hundred and ten large housing units." "That means work," I declared loudly, as though I were at a trade union meeting back home. "A lot of work," the man correct- ed me. "Do you think you're up to it?" "That's why I wrote you," I said, pointing to the letter in his hands, "Are you good at repairs?" he ask- ed, pointing to the light switch. "Naturally, otherwise I'd never have dared to apply for this job," I replied, somewhat hurt. After al), what was a Czech if he couldn't make repairs? And if he didn't know, couldn't he learn quickly or, at the very worst, bluff? Czechs after all have always found their way in the world. Wc learned to live under German occupation, and we learned to live under the communists, and that was certainly a far greater art than repairing a stupid light switch or a dripping faucet. The man began to speak as though he had a tape-recording inside him. "Your first task would be to ensure that all our tenants feel happy. They pay the rent, they're our customers and therefore they're entitled to feel satisfied. So far, fifteen units are occupied. Ihe rest are being com- pleted and it would be your responsi- bility to gradually get them ready for the new tenants. The entire complex must be rented in three months at the latest. Then your job would be to collect the rents, repair things that go wrong, keep the grounds clean and so forth, in short, you'd be re- sponsible for the proper running of the place," I nodded until my neck hurt. 1 felt like the Czechoslovak First Secretary talking to Brezhnev - all nods and acquiescence. While the man was talking, or rather playing back, his well-rehearsed speech, I stole glances at the woman beside him. She must have been the jovial man's superior and lie was probably simply passing on her wishes. She looked at me occasionally and was obviously satisfied with my talents as a yes- man, for she always looked back al her note-pad, which was covered with figures. When our eyes first met directly. 1 felt a strange anxiety. They were icily cold. In fact, her whole face was icy, her strictly pursed lips and her entire mein. She probably had icy hands, feet and an icy soul as well. But she was very pretty with a slim figure and she must have been on a strict diet and at the same time, played some sport on a regular basis. Her rings and necklace alone would have meant a year of carefree living for my brother back home. But she lacked the most essential thing that makes a woman and woman: warmth, affection, coquettishness, seductiveness with tenderness, When 1 entertained the bold thought of lying in bed with her. I felt chilled to the bone. Perhaps my damp clothes had something to do with it. Yet 1 have always hcen attracted by inaccessibility, reserve and coldness and therefore when I encountered her strange eyes a second time, I filled my glance with all the male art I could muster - admiration, longing, desire and supplication. She looked back at me as though 1 were a poor insolent worm whom she could grind under her heel whenever she wanted. I felt as though I bad been drenched in some refrigerant. The man finished his formal 63 [pageend65]babble by repeating (he original credo: "Remember that our tenants must feel happy here." Then he look- ed at the woman as though he expect- ed her to applaud. She looked some- where right past me and said dryly, "The pay is two hundred and eighty dollars." She had the wit to read the question in my face and added, "A month." Perhaps my face fell in disappoint- ment, or else the woman's conscience had shuddered from the reflection of the pay she was offering me against her own income, for she went on in a warmer tone of voice, "Naturally you'll have the free use of an entire unit, with everything included, tele- phone, electricity and heating, which represents another two hundred and twenty a month, so your pay is al- most five hundred." That sounded better, even though I myself would never have rented a place with three bedrooms for two hundred A forty-dollar room was quite sufficient for my needs. "Now, if you'd just fill out this questionnaire," said the man, hand- ing me a pen and glancing at his watch, I demonstrated how quickly I could read and write and then hand- ed the form back. "Finished already?" he said, look- ing over the form in disbelief, then passing it on to the woman. They had no idea that in the past few months I had used up three ball-points on similar forms. The gentleman looked expectantly at the glacier in the shape of a woman. I knew that my fate now hung in the balance and thai if they said, "We'll write you," the rat-race for a job would start all over again. The lady nodded slightly and the man said, "Could you come back in about two hours. We have a lot of applicants yet to see," and he pointed to a pile of letters and questionnaires, "But - you're from Europe aren't you?" "From Czechoslovakia," I said, though they could have read all that in my letter. Now he nodded his head wisely and declared, "I know - Dub- cek, the Soviet invasion." Mis eru- dition surprised me. I went outside to spend two hours in the miserable weather. I inspected the site as though I were a potential buyer. The houses were done on the outside and the interiors were being finished, but under the bleak sky there were almost no sidewalks anywhere. The grounds around the houses were muddy and churned up by machines, just like back home around those famous high-rise housing estates. But work was in progress everywhere. 1 stopped to watch some fellows laying down a cement block sidewalk, but 1 couldn't talk to them because they were Portugese and didn't know any English. I had a nice conversation with four men who were covering the muddy terrain with a beautiful carpet of green sod. Three of them were Dutch and one was French. Because 1 felt cold in my damp clothes, 1 began to go through the houses in- stead. Inside they were all laid out the same way, with three bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs, and a kitchen, living room and dining nook on the ground floor, along with a second washroom, as they politely describe a normal toilet here. In the basement, there was a huge recreation room and a laundry. In one house I ran into an electrician of German origin and a carpenter whose parents had once escaped from Latvia. Drawn by the sound of singing, I entered another house where I dis- covered three handsome fellows who looked as though their parents had fashioned them according to Michaelangelo's David. They were Italian house painters and they were drinking Canadian beer. They re- minded me of Czech construction workers back home. When 1 told them what an important decision I was waiting for, they offered me a bottle of beer and drank to my luck. The interesting thing was how our Soviet brothers had made us Czechs famous all over the world and among all social classes. Almost all of those workers knew about our efforts in 1968, about Dubček, the August in- vasion and the occupation of our country by the eternal allies of Russia. Proof that in evil there is always hidden at least a modicum of good. After two interesting hours I re- turned for the verdict. On the way back, it occurred to me that on con- struction sites here, the workers speak many different languages, as they must have during the construct- ion of the tower of Babel. The essent- ial difference, however, is that here the constructions are soon complet- ed. Obviously in Biblical times they lacked the powerful motivating factor hidden in the dollar. "It's about time you got back," the jovial gentleman said by way of welcome as I entered the office. "You said come back in two hours," I replied, pointing to my watch. "I'm right on time." The man ignored my defence and made a ceremonious declaration, as though he were decorating me before a massive assembly of people. "We have chosen you," he said, shaking a thick pile of applications. "Thank you for your confidence," I replied, compelling myself to be grateful. "When can you start?" "Whenever you want me to," I replied, hoping it would be soon. "Yesterday would be too late," laughed the man. "Then I'il start tomorrow," I said. The man took three keys out of a drawer and handed them to me, "These are for your house. You can move in today, if you'd like," 1 held the keys in my hand and al- though they were cold, it was a warm feeling to have them in my palm. Suddenly the lady of tee spoke up. "Before all the houses are occupied, it will be your responsibility to make the rounds of the site each evening, lock all the houses, make sure all the lights are out and keep an eye on the construction material stored outside," I nodded willingly, "And this model suite must be perfectly clean every day. It's an example of how every house should look. All the prospective tenants will come here, and therefore this will be rented last. Then I'll arrange to have all this furniture taken away." 1 nodded again. The lady gathered up her papers and turned to the man. "1 have to go now." She closed her attaché case and gave it to me as though 1 were her butler. She nodded goodbye to the man and walked out of the room at a brisk military pace. I, her faithful servant, walked along be- hind in her shadow, with the attache case. The lady stopped beside a brand- new Buick. I opened the door for her and when she had slipped behind the wheel, I put the attache case in beside her. At last she behaved like a normal person and said, "Good luck in your new job." Her ability to laugh sur- prised me. She looked small and lost in that huge machine, and when she turned the key and the motor roared into life, she seemed to me even smaller. I waved goodbye to her and, as though I had given her the starting signal, she shot off on her one hundred and fifty mile journey to the metropolis.
