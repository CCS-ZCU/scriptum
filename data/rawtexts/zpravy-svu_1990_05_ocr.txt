The end of the fourth decade will bring us to the threshold of not only another century but also of another millenium, in our calendar. There is no doubt that the pace and the pulse of our society has quickened and that new and exciting avenues for material gains and spiritual food are being uncovered almost daily. The twentieth century of human history is indeed very dynamic. Pausing at this milestone in human history and looking back, we see a long list of momentous events which caused shock waves and tremors in all branches and directions of our lives. The magnitude and significance of these events makes us gasp for breath and freezes us in our tracks. Where, at the end of the last and, perhaps at the beginning of this century, some may have feared about the future of natural sciences, claiming that they have reached their plateau of stagnation, this world was ushered into a new era, even before the middle of the twentieth century — in the shadow of a mushroom cloud which, in a negligible fraction of time opened a horizon for all sciences — perhaps for the duration of time. This is also a century in which man not only learned how to master air navigation in machines heavier than air, so that at this time one can have a breakfast in Paris and again in New York the same morning, but also achieved — under his control — that he can overcome the gravitational force of this planet and navigate in space. This year we remember that two decades have already passed since that brief but solemn message "That's one small step for a man...one giant leap for mankind..." was sent to this planet, as well as to the whole universe, by a human being who was just depositing permanent tracks of his short stay on a heavenly body, outside of his base — the planet Earth. During these two decades the space travel is almost a daily affair and man is rapidly learning how to cope with the new environment. It is, perhaps, safe to assume that the trailblazers of the electromagnetic waves propagation hoped for a global radio communication, but that they could hardly foresee that, even during their lifetime, they would be able to "tune-in", right in their livingroom and in full color, the most remote abode on this globe, with the help of strategically "anchored” communication satellites. Nor could they foresee that they would witness unveiling of the secrets surrounding the outer planets of our solar system, through the "penetrating eye" of the space probes sent by men into the universe on a "friendly visit". These technological feasts are possible only through integration of technological breakthroughs in many scientific fields. In turn, the progression toward a lofty goal is not without its side effects — good or bad — on the general life, on our home base. There are advancements in the standard of living, including those in our health care, easement of physical burden and 2 SVU WORLD CONGRESSES IN THE CHANGING WORLD Foreword [pageend3]obvious economic gains. On the other hand, over-zealousness in one direction creates problems, mainly with the quality and safety of our environment, which may be another legacy of the twentieth century. There are also other events devised by men, for which this century will be noted. In a relatively short span the humanity has been subjected to two global wars of gigantic dimensions. These not only devestated the construction efforts by humanity, but also resulted in unappraisable human sacrifices. Moreover, they totally reoriented the political and economic structure of the world to follow. Hand-in-hand with these two tragical events were associated ideologies which attempted to gain a complete control of the political, economic and cultural structure of the world. Both of them, pretending to have scientific foundation based on the laws of nature, allowed a few modem despots to rule in their sphere of influence. In the end, as social systems, they both totaly failed far more rapidly than they have risen - and far short of their intended goals. Social scientists, for a long time to come, will strive to analyze the rise, failure and doom of these major perturbations in the history of humanity. The several mentioned examples should illustrate the dynamism of this century, which results in inevitable changes and in accompanying remifications for human society, its life and its environment. The Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences, through her congresses with their multidisciplinary character and their world-wide participation, is uniquely equipped to assume a stand at the crossroads of many extraodinary events — whether rooted in scientific and technological innovations and advances, changes in the international systems and advancements in humanities, social sciences, arts and letters — which are rapidly transforming the physical, social and cultural environment and the conditions of human existance on this planet. We not only bear witness to these profound changes and tranformations taking place around us, but through our professional work in scientific, literary and artistic fields contribute to these changes, and influence their substance, shape and form. The fifteenth World Congress of the SVU builds upon a solid foundation established during previous conferences and agin will serve as a major forum to display the talents and expertice gathered within the Society, holding quality as our prime consideration. The Organizing Committees are confident that the four days of the Congress will be a period of both enjoyment as well as challenge to the participants and that they will find the meeting worthy of their investments in time and expense. We also look forward to meeting many old friends and to establishing new friendships with those who are new to our activities. 3 Stanley J.

[pageend25]Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences There are no statistics, only estimates of the number of Czech and Slovak intellectuals abroad. The first Czech refugees from religious persecution by the Habsburg Counter Reformation during the Thirty Years War (1618 - 1648) arrived in New York (then New Amsterdam): most prominent among them was Augustin Herman, later known as the "Lord of Bohemia Manor". During the eighteenth century Moravian Brethren immigrated and established the Moravian Brethren Church of America, with centers in Bethlehem, PA., and Winston- Salem, NC. But while a great many Czech and Slovak immigrants settled in the United States beginning in the 1860's, before 1939 it was rare for a university professor, writer or artist to leave Czechoslovakia for permanent settlement abroad. Then came World War II. The Nazi onslaught precipitated the emigration or escape of some 20,000 persons: among these exiles, at least one-fourth were intellectuals. At the War's conclusion, some returned to Czechoslavakia. Many, however, remained in the United States, Canada, England, France or other Western countries. A still greater exodus began in 1948 after the February coup in Czechoslovakia. In the decade following that coup, over 60,000 people excaped to the West; it is estimated that about one-tenth of these émigrés, or some 6,000, were intellectuals, scholars and professional people. Most of them found their way to the United States, Canada and Australia, while a few hundred established themselves in Western Europe and various countries in Central and South America, Asia and Africa. In the 1950's it became increasingly difficult for Czechs and Slovaks to emigrate from Czechoslovakia either legally or by illegal crossing of the borders, and the influx of Czech and Slovak refugees into the United States was reduced to a trickle. But after the liberalized Dubček regime was crushed by the invasion of the Warsaw powers in August 1968, another large exodus followed, again largely consisting of intellectuals, some of whom were admitted to the United States or Canada, while this time a majority stayed in Western Europe. During the nineteen-fifties, intellectuals who had managed to leave Czechoslovakia and gain permanent residence in the United States felt increasingly the need to maintain and develop Czechoslovak culture, while in Czechoslovakia history was being rewritten as if Orwell's 1984 had been advanced by thirty years, and the writings of past and present Czech and Slovak 25 History [pageend26]authors were on the proscribed lists. In 1958, a group of scholars led by the late Professor Václav Hlavatý, a mathematician at Indiana University and Dr. Jaroslav Němec of the National Library of Medicine, began to organize these intellectuals all over the world into a society of arts and sciences. In 1960 the Society became incorporated as a non-profit corporation. Its activities, as outlined in its bylaws, consist in supporting and coordinating the educational, scholarly, literary and artistic endeavors of the Czech and Slovak intelligentsia abroad; but the Society's fundamental concept has been broadened into that of an organization open to all scholars, regardless of national background, who are genuinely interested in the advancement of Czechoslovak scholarship. By a ruling the U.S. Treasury-Department in 1962, contributions to the organization are tax-deductible. The Society is known among Czechs and Slovaks as SVU, an abbreviation of its name in the Czech or Slovak languages. From its inception the Society has maintained its non-political character and refused to become instrumental of the cold war. The membership, of course, is opposed to any totalitarian ideology, be it of the right or the left, knowing that culture and freedom are inseparable. 26 The Society has started an ambitious publishing program. Among its first publication was a monograph on the composer Antonin Dvořák, by the composer Karel B. Jirák, late of Roosevelt University. In 1963, Mouton & Co. of the Hague published Essays on Czech Literature by René Wellek of Yale University. In connection with the 300th anniversary of the death of Jan Amos Comenius (1592 - 1670) several English translations of Comenius' works and a volume of essays on Comenius (papers delivered at the Society's 1970 Congress) were published, partly in cooperation with the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures of the University of Michigan. The same cooperative effort also produced a unique bilingual (English and Czech) Anthology of Czech Poetry, edited by Alfred French of the University of Adelaide. In 1971, the Society published, with the cooperation of the University of Michigan, a collection of brilliant essays in the Czech and Slovak languages, Studies in Verbal Art by Roman Jakobson of Harvard University. Several other publications followed: a biographical directory of members (the latest edition appeared in 1984), a number of publications in the Czech language—a novel, poetry, essays and others. Recently the Society has published a monograph on Czechoslovak miliary justice during World War II in the English Language and has instituted a new series of occasional papers. On the occasion of the USA Bicentennial, the Society published a Publications [pageend27]monumental bibliography on Czechs and Slovaks in North America, the result Of the meticulous work of Librarian Esther Jeřábek, a second - generation author of Czech descent. In the summer of 1979, the second edition of Alfred French's Anthology of Czech Poetry was published. In 1980, the Society came out with another bilingual edition of poetry: Jaroslav Seifert's The Plague Monument, with English translations from the Czech by Lyn Coffin and with collages by Jiří Kolář. A bilingual edition of Jiří Orten's Elegies, again with translation by Lyn Coffin was published in 1982. Since 1959, the Society has been publishing in informative newsleter Zprávy SVU (News of SVU); since 1964, it has also been publishing a quarterly for literature, philosophy and the arts, called Proměny (Metamorphoses). Since the Spring of 1980, the Society has been publishing its English language Bulletin for members and others who do not speak Czech or Slovak. In 1983 the Society began publishing its English Language journal Kosmas, Journal of Czechoslovak and Central European Studies. The Journal is published semiannually. 27 The World Congress The Society held its first World Congress in April 1962 in Washington, DC. Since then, the Society's congress has been held at Columbia University, New York University, Georgetown University, George Washington University, Cleveland State University, University of Pittsburgh, Royal York Hotel in Toronto, Northeastern University in Boston. The fourteenth Congress took place at the 4-H Center in Chevy Chase, Maryland. The fifteenth World Congress takes place, once again, at the Royal York Hotel in Toronto, in October 1990.

Other European conferences organized by the Swiss chapter were held at Unterlaken, Switzerland on the theme "The Philosophy of Czech and Slovak History" and a conference on literature in 1978. In 1980, May 15 to 18, the Swiss chapter organized a Masaryk Conference at Interlaken, Switzerland, dealing with the significance of Masaryk's writings and heritage. In 1982, the Austrian chapter organized a "Week of Czechoslovak Culture in Exile" in Vienna, Austria, July 1 through 7. In August 1983, the Swiss chapter organized a European Conference in Bem. The theme of the conference was "We In Europe and Europe In Us". In August 16 - 18, 1985, the Swiss SVU Chapter organized the conference in Thun. The main topic of the conference was "The Threatened Heritage of Central Europe". In 1988 at the European Conference in Bem, Switzerland, the main topic was "Culture and Power". A number of outstanding scholars and artists have been elected since 1960 to be the Society's honoary members. Among them were the late Dr. Alice Masaryk, Prof. Francis Dvomik, the writer Max Brod, Cardinal Josef Beran, Prof. Otakar Odložilík, Prof. Václav Hlavatý, Prof. S.
