ASSOCIATION OF DEMOCRATI C STUDENTS IN GT. BRITAIN No .5 London, June 1953 PRODUCING NEW PEOPLE. From October this year the coming generation of university students in Czechoslovakia will be two years younger than their colleagues in the past, For decades the average age of university students in their first year was nineteen years, now it has been lowered to seventeen years. This is the result of far-reaching legislation, i.e.the "Educational Refom Act" which has been passed by the Czechoslovak parliament in April 1953 and which frankly admits its aims to build Czech education on the Soviet pattern. As a result, the manifold changes in the system will have a great influence on the young people passing through it. Neither educational experts, nor the public were consulted whether or not these reforms are in line with previous developments of the Czechoslovak educational system. The Communist government simply decreed that in the future young Czechs and Slovaks will be brought up exactly like young Russians, in the true spirit of Marx & Co. Nobody is allowed to express any doubts as to the suitability of the Russian model for Czechoslovakia; what exists in Russia is ipso facto the best for. everybody, What exactly is this new machine for turning out young Communists ? The basic unit is the so-called "eight—year school", compulsory for all children from six to fourteen years. After that, every youngster has several possibilities: he can -take up a job, he can become a member of the State Labour Reserve or a member of the Working Youth Centre, he can enter a technical college or, after passing the entrance examinations, he can carry on for three years in the so-called "eleven-year school" (i.e.a continuation of the eight-year school). The last three years at this school are a substitute for a general secondary education, but pupils specialise in the subjects they intend to take at a university level later on. When they are seventeen years old, after passing an examination similar to the General Certificate of.Education, they are deemed to be ready for their university careers. There are, of course, two ways of explaining these reforms. Let us first see the. Communist point of view as represented by Mr.Ernest Sykora, the Minister of Education, in his speech of April 2ą, 1953 Czechoslovak parliament. He said: "Socialism means a radical break with all the old conditions and ideas. The new way of life must be taught in our schools and it must be expressed in an absolute adherence to Marx-Leninism and as an uncompromising fight agpinst exploded bourgeois ideas, and especially against superstition-..'- and obscurantism. The newly created man, the man of our future, cannot be educated otherwise than by a fight against everything old-fashioned, decayed, everything pulling him back. Therefore the sharpening class struggle cannot leave out education, because it also must be deeply politically minded" (Note the stress on Marx-Leninism and class struggle,which hardly justifies the West in thinking that there was seme radical change in the internal policies of Russia’s satellites.) Speaking about the teachers, the Minister said: "The educational system, built on the Soviet model, will no longer tolerate teachers who still ape the bourgeois Western culture and whose teaching is imbued with objectivism, lax political and class feeling and ideology." This situation is a direct reversal of everything that education means in the Viest. The objective approach to scientific problems is regarded as completely unsuitable. The Communist student must base his-whole life on Marx-Leninism and approach every problem in this! spirit. To him a man without an ideology is an inferior impossible.'о being who can no longer be tolerated. But there is another, and a rather prosaic way of explaining this radical reform; of course, it is not so openly admitted by the Communists. Five years ago the Czechoslovak Communist parliament "passed" an act by which the school-leaving . age was raised by one^?orrifteen years. To-day the clock is put back. University students suddenly become, on the average, two years younger. The results are» fourteen years old workers and twenty-one years old doctors, university lecturers STUDENT N E W S FROM BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN [pageend1]-2- and scientists. This is what the "great Communist intellectual", the former Minister of Education, Mr«Zdenek Nejedly said:,"The ^speeding up of the education of our ýourig'generation is just the thing to be desired....Wé should.bemoan every year, every month which prevents our youth'fra factories, fields and'.' mines" I Yes, that: is what they want : more' human machine's and more brains directing them, that' is the meaning of the Czechoslovak educational reforms,. Unfortunately, the Czech'citizen does nót worк.-for . himself. In Communist ■ theory 'the surplus value of labour has a prominent place; to-day it does not exist in Czechoslovakia, it is exported to Russia. It has only recently been discovered that even the remainder can be vastly diminished by the currency reform. PLANNED MASS PRODUCTION ON GRADUATES. In his statistical summary of April 21, the Minister of Einance announced that Czechoslovakia, which in its pre-Munich days load nine universities with 18,796 students, has to-day thirty universities with 56,830 students, of whan 6,349 entered by way of special courses for workers(which in one year cover work normally done in secondary schools in-eight years). State production, dictated by foreign powers, needs a certain number of technical and scientific experts, and the Government decided to get them. The price paid is devaluation of universities. Prom the above figures it can be seen that already 10 per cent of the students do not possess the necessary preparation for university study. Another aspect of this situation is revealed by the frantic search for university'lecturers and «ext-books. Rude Pravo carried the following paragraph in its issue of March 29, 1953i "The Ministry of Education intends to open several new departments in the university academic year 1953-54 and invites applications for the posts of professors,readers, lecturers and assistant lecturers. Candidates'for t he posts of Head of Department should be experts with university qualifications, or scientific qualifications and practical experience. Candidates for the posts of lecturers and assistant lecturers should be senior secondary school teachers or experts in production and technology. Applications concern all branches of technology, economics, planning, production organization and humanities, especially the Russian language and literature. Candidates may also apply for part-time lecturerships0" It means that university posts have to be filled, no matter where the people,, suitable or otherwise, are to be found-.. The shortage of university, lecturers does, not end the problem«, for there is a shortage of text—bools also. The university authorities admit that only about 50 per cent of the total need is met, but they promise to have the remainder ready by autumn. Needless to mention, they .will be translations from Russian« The Big Brother will help again. , whilst the statistics show an impressive growth of universities and students, below the surface we cah discern the degradation of the nation, once steeped in Western culture, to the level of a vassal of a primitive Communist Russia. This war carried on by the Communists against the rising generation in Czechoslovakia is a silent and a steady one. If they are given time, the outcome nay have far- reaching results, not only from the national, but also from the. European, point of .view.' ' • ~ № SCHOOL 0E ECONOMICS IN PRAGUE. In October this year' a new School of Economics is to be opened in Prague. The course of study takes five years and is divided into the following subjects«: political economy, economic planning, economics of labour, industry, agriculture, transport, internal commerce, statistics and finance. The course can also be taken by correspondence« NQ .ONE IS ALLOWED TO EAIŁ IN CZECHOSLOVAK SCHOPIA . The Communist press,commenting on the educational reforms in Czechoslovakia, speaks disdainfully about the old system, and accuses it of allowing the pupils to fail. Quoting Rude Pravo of April 24, 1953: "Generally speaking,the old system was formalistic, superficial and inadequate. How otherwise can one explain that, for example, so- many more pupils failed in mathematics than in any other subject and many pupils leave school without mastering this subject." It is assumed that the fact that children have unequal intelligences is merely : a capitalist lie and that every child is capable of reaching the .prescribed level in education. Now teachers will have to be really careful not to expose this new theory. As in’other matters. Rude Pravo comes in handy. On April 26,1953 it saids "The new school must abolish the unhappy sight of the pupil who failed in the examinations. That was a result of an inferior system of teaching, underestimation-of the child and a lack of interest in its future. We want the children to have more [pageend2]-3“ education, in spite of the school-leaving age being lowered.’1 One cannnot but feel sorry for the teachers who do not understand the Marx-Leninist dognatism. But those who marage to prove that all children are equally intelligent have their future assured. The Minister of Education, Sykora, said: "We must end the unhappy egalitarianism in our wages policy and reward the teachers according to their qualifications and the quality of their work." Good servants of the regime will therefore be suitably rewarded.. ARREST ОF UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS. We have received from Czechoslovakia the news that a number of professors of the pedagogic faculty in Ceske Budějovice (Southern Bohemia) have been arrested and removed to an unknown destination. They are: Dr .Stanislav Pravda, Zdenek Mathauser and Karel Spatný. We regret to say that they are neither the first,nor the last. PURGES IN THE UNIVERSITIES. The beginning of the last academic year in all Czechoslovak universities was accompanied by new purges. They were carried out at secret meetings of the CSM (Czechoslovak Youth Organization) faculty organizations, to which friends and colleagues of the interrogated students were called. True to the Canmunist spirit, gentle persuasion was not disdained (such as "Remember, comrade, you want to complete your studies!) This nudging was done so as to obtain answers that would incriminate the accused persons. When an interrogation is not having the desired result, it is handed over to the SNB (Czech Secret Police)under one pretext or another, for example that the accused harbours anti-State sentiments, etc.etc. The police officer then opens the interrogation on the basia^ of reports from local government offices» party and youth organizations, and suggests expulsion on which the university authorities then make their formal decision. These, authorities, of course, spontaneously agree. There is one way out for the student: the price is close collaboration with the security organs,, and he becomes the eyes and ears of the "protestors". CZECHOSLOVAK GRADUATE GETS A JOB. The science graduates already know their future jobs on leaving their universities. The all-powerful State takes it upon itself to fit them'into the national economy. Of course, as it usually happens in these cases, the graduate is not as a rule consulted on what he would like to do. An illustration of this process is cited by Mlada Fronta (issue of 26,1953an article on the "Department of Architecture of the Prague University. The writer says: "The majority of students are well prepared for examinations and agree with the future jobs to which they have been assigned. Like many others, Comrade Jan Schwarcer volunteered for the place where he would be most useful; v •; today he is already working on a river barrage near Duchcov. However, there are still students who only pursue their own selfish interests and prefer these to the good of us all. And they try to wriggle out of the jobs which are far from Prague or their own universities." There follows a solemn admonition addressed to Comrade Milena Linkova, woman student from Prague, who prefers to be tied to"her mother's apron strings" and, instead of volunteering for a place allotted to her by the State, tried to put forward all sorts of excuses so as to be able to take up a job in Prague which she found herself. (The Communist system being what it is, all her efforts are useless, for the State knows better than the individual what is good for him) The Mlada Fronta contributor ends on a somewhat more cheerful note by saying that people like the selfish Comrade Linkova do not matter« "Our chief strength liея in the fact, taught by our Comrade Stalin (God rest his poor soul) that our youth is led not only by the half-hearted, but by the fighting young Communists,that neví core of the rising generation of Bolsheviks, the destroyers of capitalism and liberators of all oppressed and enslaved peoples." PARTY RULE OVER THE SCHOOLS. The real outlook of Communism on education from which they expect newly fashioned generations is seen from the recent incident in Slovakia, as noted in a Slovak Communist paper. "Pbd Zástavou Socialismu" (Bratislava) condemned in its February issue the indignities to which Czechoslovak teachers and school personnel are subjected, and described a striking example in these words: "...Cases of the mishandling of teachers and school workers still occur at the expense of the whole school. lack of respect for the teacher and for the entire school was shown,for instance, when the chairman of the local party committee in Bernolákove locked the teacher in an office , forcing him to stay and copy seme official papers....................." [pageend3]-4- SOCIAL ACTIVITIES. We bring.a typical example of student life in presentday 'Czechoslovakia. The following; letter, written by Corporal Wiesenganger of the Frontier Patrol, appeared in the Mlada Fronta on January 15, 1953 "Recently our post was visited by the choir of the Prague School of Economics and Political Science. One song followed another, songs about the socialist, reconstruction of our country, alternated with folk, songs, and wo s.pent the afternoon most enjoyably.. Applause was unceasing and we spared bo praise. When the choir had exhausted its repertoire, the C.O.of our post thanked the students and announced that the patrol had. recently caught two "diversionists" attempting to cross the frontier into Western Germany, (A diversionist is anybody who does not agree with the regime. This is a term coined by the Communists, - Ed.) The choir received the news with resounding cheers." The letter then describes the departure of the members of the choir;. "We are walking with the students, about two- hundred yards from the frontier that Separates two worlds. Our eyes wander across it into a country where the fate of young people is grim indeed ..,’ .. Quite possibly the two diversionists whoso capture gave rise to such ovations, were students who could bear life in a, Communist paradise no longer. Instead.of escaping into "a country where the fate of th0 young people .is grim indeed", they wound, up in a concentration camp. That, however, did not stop the student choir from singing about the "socialist reconstruction of the country". The results of this socialist reconstruction are best seen in the recent developments in Czechoslovakia and. Eastern Germany, where the country is being reconstructed in such a way that the workers themselves d.o not-think they can lose much when,marching against the pointed Sten guns'-of the police barehanded. DISTRIBUTION OF CULTuHEc The benevolent State prescribes a cultural diet ; (rationed, of course) to all its citizens, As in other'as pects of the Communist way of Fife, the- individual is allowed, to consume only what is offered to him. Unfortunately for the regime, the Soviet- made culture is so indigestible that demand for it is lacking completely. The authorities therefore decided to. cram it down the people's throat. This is what happens in case the working man wants to enjoy'his national,- music. The following is.a letter sent by a plant manager to the Central Ticket Agency in Prague, and published by the Czech TUG, weekly "prace" on February 5. I953 "On January lj wo ordered sone tickets for our employees to.a-performance of the "Bartered Bride" (the rast popular Czech opora bv Saotana,played ana appreciated all. oyer the world - EdJ when the tickets failed to arrive we telephoned the Central Ticket Agency, in Prague and were told that we could’ Iwo them only if we would buy an equal number of tickets for "late Love" ' "Ljuba.Jarova" and "People, Beware". .(all of recent.Communist vintage - Ed.) ' Our anployeos had already seen.these plays and were not interested in buying any tickets under coercion," ... . j ь Published by the Association of Czechoslovak Democratic students in Gt. Britain.
