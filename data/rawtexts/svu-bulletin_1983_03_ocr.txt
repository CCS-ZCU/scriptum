BULLETIN English Supplement to “Zprávy SVU” Vol. IV, No. 3 September, 1983 SVU Activities SVU INTER-CONGRESS CONFERENCE IN CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS One of the playwrights concerned with the current problems of machines with artificial intelligence was Karel Capek. His play R.U.R. contributed to the introduction of the concept of robots. This term came into general usage in the entire world. In recent years, the technological development of robotics made it possible to manufacture and to use robots. The focus of the forthcoming inter-congress of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences is a review of the meaning and consequences of robotics in the broadest areas of human endeavor, both from an historical point of view and for the future. Participants will be concerned not only with industry, economics and sciences but with many aspects of literature, creative arts, philosophy and sociology as well. All these disciplines either serve the development of society, which reflects the development of machine processes controlled by artificial intelligence, or contribute directly to such a development. The conference will attempt to examine what kind of influence these contributions had in the past, have at present, or may have in the future upon the development of robotics, and also what changes can now be observed, or can be expected in the future, as a result of the impact of robotics as a new dimension of the human experience. The conference will be held from November 4 to November 6, 1983 at the Cronkite Graduate Center, Radcliffe College, Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass.

Mr. President, on June 26 the Czech National Chapel of Our Lady of Hostýn in honor of St. John Nepomucene Neumann, the first American canonized male saint, will be dedicated at the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C. Bishop Neumann was one of America’s distinguished churchmen. Renowned as a confessor, he helped to lay the foundations for the Catholic school system and was the first religious order priest canonized in the United States. He was also very proud of his Czech heritage. Czech culture has been an essential part of European life for over 1,000 years. The finest ideals of Christian and European thought have been promoted and preserved by the vibrant Czech people. When the Czech people began their migration to the new democracy in Amprira, they brought, with them this fine tradition, greatly enriching the spiritual and cultural life of our country. I am proud that Maryland has an established and dynamic Czech American community which reflects the values of family, religion, hard work, and education. We in Maryland are particularly proud that the first known Czech in the New World, Augustine Hermann (c. 1605-96), settled in Cecil County. After arriving in New Amsterdam in 1633, Hermann, a trader and tobacco cultivator, came to Maryland in 1640 and was granted a large tract of land by Lord Baltimore in exchange for his services as a cartographer. In addition , to making maps of an area encompassing over 20,000 acres, Augustine Hermann also founded his own estate, Bohemia Manor, and named the beautiful Bohemia River on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. Czech devotion to education, a tradition dating back to the founding in 1348 of the University of Prague, was manifested in America early by the eagerness with which Czech immigrants sought to educate their families. Wherever public schools were available, attendance by Czech children was high. In Maryland, 1745 marked the founding by the Jesuits of a school at Bohemia Manor where Charles Carroll, signer of the Declaration of Independence, and many members of his family were educated. The desire to preserve the cherished Czech traditions and their beloved ancestral language led Czechs in America to work for the establishment of parochial schools, ones which could provide instruction in both Czech and English. In this capacity, St. John Neumann, the first diocesan priest in the United States, builder of churches and one who established several sister9 hoods in this country for the purpose of providing teachers for Catholic schools, founded the American parochial school system. The State of Maryland was fortunate to have the benefit of his missionary services between 1842 and 1852 where he labored throughout the State founding parishes from Cumberland in western Maryland to Easton on the Eastern Shore. The missionary spirit that characterized this extraordinary man whom we now honor was continued in his nephew, Father John Berger, who in 1872 founded St. Wenceslaus Church in Baltimore. Named for the Czech patron saint Vaclav, St. Wenceslaus Church is the only Bohemian National Church in Maryland. For many years, the St. Wenceslaus Church school taught its children in both Czech and English. Now 111 years old, St. Wenceslaus continues to provide spiritual and educational sustenance both to its neighborhood in east Baltimore and to Czechs throughout the State of Maryland. Czech Americans have made a wide variety of contributions to the vitality of our country. Heavily involved in agriculture from the time of their arrival, Bohemians, it was said, could make crops grow where no one else could. Music was such an integral part of Czech culture that not only were there numerous Czech folk bands and orchestras, professional musicians and composers like Rudolf Friml, composer of the operetta "The Vagabond King,’ but virtually every Czech home had some kind of musical instrument. Anton Dvorak’s symphony, "From the New World,” while thrilling listeners everywhere, held special meaning for Czech Americans as a symbol of the creative and harmonious relationship which had developed between their old and adopted homelands. The ability of Czech Americans to unite on behalf of both their homelands was given expression during World War I when they eagerly volunteered to serve in the American Army and bought proportionately more war bonds than any other foreign-bom group and again in World War II when they were actively involved in the American Red Cross and raised several hundred thousand dollars for postwar relief efforts. Altogether, approximately 400,000 Czechs have come to America since Augustine Hermann first arrived on that historic date in 1633. As we pay homage to the Czech National Chapel of Our Lady of Hostýn in honor of St. John Neumann, we again feel a sense of deep gratitüde for the valuable contributions Americans of Czech descent have made to the richness of our Nation.« [pageend9]Personalia IGOR V. NABELEK - SVU VICE-PRESIDENT Igor V. Nabelek was born on August 19, 1924, in Banska Bystrica, Slovakia. He started his studies at the Slovak Technical University, Bratislava, and obtained his B.S. in electrical engineering and his Ph.D. in acoustics at the Czech Technical University in Prague in February 1948 and 1958, respectively. His professional career began at the Research Institutes of Telecommunications and of Electroacoustics in Prague. He then moved to Bratislava where he was a researcher, head of the Acoustical Department, and the assistant director of the Institute of Physics of the Slovak Academy of Sciences. In 1967 he arrived in the United States with his Polish wife, Dr. Anna Karczewska Nabelek, a scientist in her own right, and worked as an exchange visitor at the Research Department of the Central Institute for the Deaf in St. Louis, Missouri. Between 1970 and 1973, Nabelek was a professor of hearing sciences at the University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland. Since that time, he has been a professor at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee. Dr. Nabelek’s life follows the academic and patriotic traditions of his ancestors. His grandfather, Dr. Frantisek Nabelek, an astronomer and physicist, was a prominent Catholic leader of Moravia, the central part of Czechoslovakia. His uncles Dr. Frantisek Nabelek, Jr., and Dr. Vojtech Nabelek were university professors in Brno and Bratislava; before February 1948, the former was the president of Komenský University. Nabelek’s father Ludvik, a native of Kromeriz, was a physician in Banska Bystrica. Dr. Jan Vesel, his maternal grandfather, was a known Slovak patriot whose whole family suffered from repetitious harassment by Hungarian authorities of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Nabelek’s family was heavily involved in underground activities during World War II. This activity culminated on August 29, 1944 when his uncle, Lt. Colonel Mirko Vesel, in a surprise attack, took over the headquarters of the General Staff of the Slovak Army in Banska Bystrica from the hands of fascist officers. During the following night, at the weekend house of Nabelek’s parents in Donovaly, Dr. Vavro Srobar, Lt. Col. Mirko Vesel, Lt. Col. Dr. Ing, Milos Marko, Major Milan Vesel (Mirko’s twin brother), and Nabelek’s father wrote proclamations to the Slovak nation and to the Slovak soldiers. Radio transmission of these proclamations on August 30, 1944, marked the official beginning of the Slovak National Uprising. Among other statements, it was proclaimed that “only the armed resistance [against Germany] within the framework of the Czechoslovak Republic will put us in the ranks of the Allies.” (General Mirko Vesel died in exile in W. Germany in 1976.) At the start of the Uprising, Nabelek and his brother Ludvik were members of a semi-military partisan unit, operating in the mountains near Banska Bystrica. At the end of October 1944, when the German army penetrated to Banska Bystrica, Nabelek’s unit escorted General Viest and Lt. Col. Golian, the commanders of the Czechoslovak army, through the Low Tatra mountains. After several encounters with the German army, the unit was eventually destroyed, the commanders and many soldiers, including Nabelek, were captured and transfered to various POW camps and Gestapo prisons. Nabelek survived his ordeal in the prison in Banska Bystrica. 10 [pageend10]Dr. Nabelek has published numerous scientific papers and chapters in professional books; he lectured, presented papers, and chaired sessions at international congresses in the USA, Canada, various European countries, and Australia. Presently, he is teaching hearing sciences and conducting research on hearing processes and improvements in hearing aids, room acoustics, and noise control. His wife, a research professor at the University of Tennessee, has done research on the influence of noise and reverberation on speech communication. After the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet forces in August 1968, the Nabeleks managed to arrange the arrival of their two sons to the United States. One of them, Peter, recently received his Ph.u. m geology at the State University of New York, Stony Brook, Long Island, and the other son, Jan, is a doctoral student of geophysics at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Masssachusetts. ★ JAN DRÁBEK SVU member Jan Drábek from Vancouver, B.C., has been appointed Writer In Residence at the University of Toronto for the winter semestej. He is the author of several novels, the best known being Whatever Happen- ed to Wenceslas? (Peter Martin, 1975 in English and 68 Publishers, 1975UA Czech) and Report on the Death of Rosenkavalier (McClelland & Stewart, 1977) which was selected as an alternative by the Literary Guild. The Liste» Legacy (General Publishing, Toronto, 1980) is a novel about World War Ilý while The Statement (General Publishing, 1982) takes place on an island in the South Pacific. Blackboard Odyssey (J. J. Douglas Ltd., 1973) reports on his observations in various European classrooms, and Melvin the, Weathermoose (Holt, Rinehart & Winston, 1976) is a children’s story. He recently finished a novel placed in Europe, The Cucumber Season. Reader’s Digest (February 1978) carried his chronology of the Communist takeover of Czechoslovakia in 1948 in its Canadian and several other editions. His documentary narrative on Czechoslovak contributions to Canadian culture was shown in Vancouver on August 21, 1978, the tenth anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. He has also contributed articles and scripts to various Canadian newspapers, magazines, CBC Radio and Television, Radio Canada International, and Czech exile publications. Mr. Drábek was born in Prague on May 5, 1935 and lived there until his escape to West Germany after February 1948. He studied in the United States at the Washington and Lee University in Virginia and then served in the U.S. Navy (1956-58). He continued his studies at the American University in Washington, D.C. (B.A. in English Literature, 1960), University of Mysore, India (Graduate Diploma in Indian Civilization, 1964) and the University of British Columbia (Graduate Diploma in Education, 1966.) Between his studies he worked as a refugee resettlement worker in Vienna (1961), radio announcer in West Germany (1961-63) and travel agent in New York (1964-65.) Since 1965 he has been living in Vancouver, teaching at a high school until 1976. His wife Joan is a university instructor. They have two daughters. Currently Jan Drábek devotes all his time to writing, using his travels, research trips and interesting life experiences in his literary and journalistic comments on the human condition. ★ 11 [pageend11]SVU member GEORGE KOHLIK was born on January 19, 1913 in Roudnice nad Labem. He earned his doctorate of law from Charles University in Prague in 1945. He later studied economics at the University of Kansas and eventually became the director of special services of the National Association of Credit Management, International Division, in New York. In 1966 he edited the three volumes df the Digest of Commercial Laws of the World, a basic compendium indispensable for any lawyer specializing in the field of Dr. Kohlik’s expertise. He died in August 1982, in Florida, and we belatedly express the Society’s sympathy to his English speaking widow. ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ What’s Your Thing? Here is the continuation of “our things” for your interest. We plan to enlarge this section in terms of both categories and information. The Secretary, all officers of the Society and the editor of this Bulletin (all of whose addresses appear on the first page) will be glad to serve as liasons be-ween SVU members and interested readers. Communication is one of our main aims. LITERATURE Marginalia on Kafka and Hasek Centennials Under the title “Kafka & Hasek: Modern Czech Metaphors,” Dan Fisher from the Los Angeles Times’ Warsaw bureau reported on “the potentially embarassing centennials this year of the births of Prague’s most famous literary personalities.” During his visit to Prague, he had the opportunity to explore current official and unofficial attitudes toward both writers, besides referring to other Western sources. As to Franz Kafka, a new Czech edition of his work will appear, and he reportedly “will be treated more as a German-language author in Bohemian territory” than as a German writer alienated from his living environment. Jaroslav Hasek’s primordial importance is seen as being “the author of a very anti-military novel,” and his Schweik presumably “is only one part of the national type, if a national type exists at all.” A conference on Hasek was scheduled in Czechoslovakia for the end of April, 1983. International symposia on Kafka have been organized in many places all over the world, the first - “Kafka oggi” (Kafka Today) - having taken place in Bari, Italy on March 21-24. Among the participants were such authorities as Gerhard Neumann (Freiburg), Malcolm Pasley (Oxford) and Jost Schillemeit (Braunschweig) who are the originators of the new critical edition of Kafka’s work: the psychoanalyst Peter Dettmering; the organizer, Professor Giuseppe Farese; Eduard Goldstuecker (Brighton); Egon Schwarz (St. Louis), and many Germanists from Italy, Austria and other countries. The second Kafka congress in Europe then convened on May 16-19 in Vienna. 12 [pageend12]The trend in Kafka studies prevailing at this time has been defined as “away from interpretation,” in that emphasis is put on the need of revising the texts and preparing an edition more true to the original than Max Brod allegedly was able to achieve in his time. However, when the first product of the critical editions, Das Schloss (The Castle), appeared in 1982 (2 volumes, Malcolm Pasley, ed.; Frankfurt: S. Fischer Verlag), it became clear that Brod’s edition of this book had been more reliable than presumed. The story that Kafka before his death asked Brod to destroy his unpublished manuscripts is today debated. Yet there is no doubt that Brod took care of them and saved them for posterity: he did carry with him Kafka’s manuscripts when he left Prague in a hurry on March 15, 1939 and sent them from Tel Aviv to the safety of Switzerland during the Suez Canal crisis of 1956, from where they were finally transferred to the Bodleian Library in Oxford. The critical complete edition is planned to come out over several years and will comprise fourteen volumes. Another one of the principal editors is Juergen Born from the University of Wuppertal. He has a leading position in the “Forschungsstelle Prager Literatur” which recently managed to acquire Kafka’s personal library with many first editions of books by other writers of the Prague Circle, especially Brod, Werfel and Urzidil. The relatively recent trend to “read Kafka as he really wrote” is somewhat surprising in view of the fact that the biographical and interpretative bibliography compiled in 1961 had over five thousand entries and kept growing. We do not dare to speculate how much new material will be added during the centennial. Any event, such as the recent discovery of an unknown Kafka letter of - May 1922 to Hans Mardensteig, a coworker of the publisher Kurt Wolff, merits a study (see Die Zeit, No. 31, August 5, 1983.) Another interesting article in the same weekly (No. 2, January 14, 1983) was from the pen of Ota Filip. He contacted several Czechoslovak emigrees in Oslo - the journalist Hana Sklibova, 85, the ex-librarian Anna Kvapilova, 77, and the philosopher Michael Konupek - to discuss their remembrances of Milena Jesenská. The results of his interview appeared under the title “Wer war Milena?” (Who was Milena?) Of course, the Letters to Milena have become famous since the first German edition of 1952. as well as the book by Margarete Buber-Neumann Kafkas Freundin Milena (KaiKa’s Friend Milena; original German edition in 1963; Czech translation published by Sixty-Eight Publishers in 1982.) A more intimate memorial is Jana Cerna’s “Kafka’s Milena as Remembered by her Daughter Jana,” published in English in Cross Currents. A Yearbook of Central European Culture, (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1982, pp. 261-288; see Bulletin IV, 2, May 1983). Some of the above letters were used by the well-known Argentinian composer Alberto Ginastera (1916-1983) who conducted the world premiere of his cantata Milena in Denver, in 1973. That however, is not the only musical work based on Kafka. The best known is Gottfried von Einem’s opera Der Prozess (The Trial), premiered during the 1953 Salzburg Festival. Hans Werner Henze based his monodrama for baritone Ein Landarzt (A Country Doctor ; Berlin 1965) on Kafka’s story, and Ernst Krenek found inspiration in Kafka’s texts for his Five Songs, op. 82 (1937-38). To the list of existing Kafka-based films (“A Hunger Artist”; “The Trial” directed by Orson Welles; “The Castle” with Maximilian Schell) a new one will be added: Danielle Huillet and Jean-Marie Straub are currently filming Kafka’s Amerika in Germany. 13 [pageend13]Max Brod’s principal writings on his friend were combined into one book Ueber Franz Kafka (Frankfurt: S. Fischer Verlag, 1974), and include some of Kafka’s drawings. It is also worthwhile to reread Edwin M. Moseley’s “The American Dream Become Nightmare: Franz Kafka and Others” in the SVU publication Czechoslovakia Past and Present, (Miloslav Rechcigl, ed.; The Hague: Mouton, 1968; Vol. 2, 1012-1021), in which he traces the sources of Kafka’s Amerika. As newer important books on Kafka and his work are published, we encourage our members to let us know about their own research on Kafka and of their participation in his centennial. Not only Franz Kafka the writer has been explored as an unusual and disquieting literary phenomenon of the 20th century. His personality and his human fate have also undergone much analysis. His famous “Letter to his Father” which Kafka wrote in 1919 but never mailed, nor discussed with his father, has become an often reprinted example of the love-hate father- son relationship in the psychoanalytic Freudian sense. For example, the initial paragraph from the letter is quoted as a motto for Jules Bemporad’s (Harvard Medical School) “Franz Kafka: A Literary Prototype of the Depressive Character” (in Silvano Arieti, M.D. & Jules Bemporad, M.D., Severe and Mild Depression, New York: Basic Books, 1978; 394-415.) In this chapter the author analyses Kafka’s literary works, his diaries and pertinent psychologically oriented studies. He concludes: “If we trace Kafka’s fiction from The Judgment to The Hunger Artist we see that the gradual development of the depressive is revealed... In reviewing the actual life of Kafka as reported in his biography and as revealed by himself in his writings, one finds the psychodynamic aspects of the depressive character. The relationship with the dominant other, the inhibition of autonomous gratification, the self-blame, the sense of helplessness, the lack of effective assertion are all there. For the student of psychiatry, Kafka’s works permit a rare and unforgettable glimpse into the inner world of melancholia (415).” ★ In contrast with Kafka, Hasek’s personality usually seems to get overshadowed by his notorious anti-hero Schweik. The discussions about how much of Hasek is to be found in Schweik seem rather unimportant and inconclusive. The popularity of the book The Good Soldier Schweik somehow is not dependent on the author. The Good Soldier Schweik, for example, became the basis of Robert Kurka’s opera of the same name (world premiere April 23, 1958 in New York.) He inspired Bertold Brecht to create in 1944 his Schweyk im zweiten Weltkrieg (Schweik in the Second World War), music by Hanns Eisler, though the theater piece was not performed until 1956 in Warsaw and in 1959 in Frankfurt/Main. Recently a television presentation of Schweik’s wanderings took place in Germany, as part of the series “Sceneries of the World Literature.” Even though the book has been translated into some forty languages, its popularity seems to rest mainly with the post-WWI generations of then young Czechoslovaks who found Schweik’s willful obedience a powerful means of survival and of keeping in perspective the truly idiotic historical events and actions of overpowering and unwanted authorities. “Svej- kovina,” acting and verbalizing in Schweik’s manner, proved to be equally effective and equally exasperating in contact with old-fashioned parents, pedantic teachers, overbearing bosses... and dangerous enemies^ though then the satirical fun often had to escalate to desperate gallows humor. 14 [pageend14]Many insights into Hasek’s characterizations of Schweik are found in the article “On the Integrity of the Good Soldier Schweik” by J. P. Stern Czechoslovakia Past and Present, (op. cit., 972-982.) One important observation by Stern is that “Hasek never allows Schweik’s obedience to result in anything worse than chaos. The possibility of its resulting in a crime is just not envisaged. The situation is not wholly unlike that of Gandhi and the British Raj: like Gandhi’s disobedience campaign, Schweik’s obedience campaign is effective because, each time, the conflict proceeds according to rules recognized by both sides. Where there are no such rules - as in the German occupation of 1939-45 - there, Schweik’s strategy is bound to fail; in that situation, he will either go to the gallows or become a collaborator (981).” No wonder that Schweik’s interpretation has presented problems in Czechoslovakia after 1948. . The literary quarterly Proměny (Metamorphoses) has lately brought out articles on Hasek for those who read Czech. In the first issue of this year, Hana Svobodova’s “Jaroslav Hasek (1883-1923)” was published. The author sees Schweik basically as a plebeian clown who lacks any ideals or illusions and hides cruelty, malice and cynicism behind his “good,” benign mask. She also stresses in Hasek the elements of grotesquerie and absurdity which seem to antedate dadaism and surrealism by the tone of a phony idyl that parodied prevalent national values. That is one way how to see Schweik. A different approach to the topic was presented in the following issue (Vol. 20, No. 2, 1983) by a sample from Frank Marlow’s upcoming book. Sixty-Eight Publishers of Toronto accepted the manuscript for publication this year. All who have had the opportunity to review it - the writers Josef Skvorecky and Jan Benes, Dr. Michael Heim (UCLA) and Sir Cecil Parrot, British translator of Hasek - are appreciative of Mr. Marlow’s original idea and the knowledgeable way in which he organized the book. (See below.) ★ ZEF Frank J. Marlow, past President of the Los Angeles Chapter and past Treasurer of the Society, (see Bulletin III, 2, May 1982), has compiled a book dealing with the proper names, local names and names of objects in Jaroslav Hasek’s classic novel Osudy dobrého vojaka Švejka za světově války (The Good Soldier Schweik). In this book, Rejstřík jmenný, mistni a vecný (Register of Names, Localities and Objects), Marlow’s nine categories of hundreds of names and items are preceded by a lively personal introduction. He has a special relationship to Hasek: he remembers the writer from the time he was a boy in Lipnice nad Sazavou, where Hasek used to live at one time and where he also passed away in 1923. This year marks the 100th anniversary of Hasek’s birth and 60th anniversary of his death. The present Czechoslovak regime has a claim to Hasek on account of his Communist past; he had been a commissar in the Red Army during the Russian Revolution. However, Hasek was first and foremost a fighter against totalitarianism and he soon became disillusioned with Communism. Schweik, the title character of Hasek’s famous novel, had his own method of resistance against Austria-Hungarian monarchy: maliciously simulated stupidity. Throughout the years the novel was subjected to critiques and analyses changing with the winds of political and literary fashion. It finally became one of the world’s most popular; books, as Schweik’s pretended stupidity was elevated into the realms of ap existentialist philosophy that takes life as it comes. 15 [pageend15]The increasing popularity of the Schweik character after World War I was reflected by the dramatization of his story for the theater of Hotel Adria on Prague’s Wenceslas Square. The actors -Noll as Schweik and Longen as Feldkurat Katz — are unforgettable, and the show used to be sold out for years. Recently Channel 28’s Masterpiece Theatre introduced the show “Private Schulz.” The protagonist is very similar in concept to Schweik, but a modernized Schweik, transplanted into World War II. ■ Marlow’s work represents enormous patience and dedication. He has analyzed and grouped a gigantic quantity of material, classifying personal names, place names, professions, nationalities, Austrian military terms, and even names of pubs and coffeehouses, as well as reproductions of previously unanalyzed texts. Marlow recalls that as a student, he would gather witn his classmates to closely study and discuss Schweik. They even elaborated their familiarity with minute details of the book into mutual “exams.” In view of his present work, it is possible to say that Frank Marlow deserves some kind of doctorate in the field of “Schweikology.” ★ LAK The New York Review of Books, XXX, No. 12 (July 21, 1983) contains the essay “Thus Spake Schweik” by the Czechoslovak writer Ludvik Vaculík. Vaculík compares the people currently in positions of authority in Czechoslovakia to Schweik: they are just as maliciously stupid and they act like Schweik would have acted had he been in a position of authority. That again is one way how to see him; yet, it would be out of character for Schweik to seek power. ES BOOKS OF INTEREST Laska, Vera, ed. - Women in the Resistance and in the Holocaust: The Voice of Eyewitnesses. Foreword by Simon Wiesenthal. (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1983; illustrated, bibliography, index. XV. 330 pp.; $29.95 hardbound) We quote the News Release from Greenwood Press (88 Post Road West, P.O. Box 5007, Westport, CT 06881) which describes the newest book of our frequent contributor, Dr. Vera Laska (see Bulletin II, 2, May 1981 for her personal data), author of: “Remember the Ladies,” Outstanding Women of the American Revolution; The Czechs in America, 1633-1977; Franklin and Women; Benjamin Franklin, The Diplomat; Nazism, Resistance & Holocaust in World War H: A Bibliography, and of a column, “American History Reader,” which appears in several local newspapers. WOMEN RESISTERS AND HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS RECOUNT THEIR EXPERIENCES IN NEW GREENWOOD BOOK The Holocaust stands as one of the most infamous chapters of human history. Eleven million people were systematically executed: six million Jews and five million political prisoners, POW’s, gypsies, homosexuals, and others. As it is erroneous to reduce the Holocaust to an exclusively Jewish catastrophe, so too, according to Laska, is it a serious mistake to omit women, Jewish and nun- Jewish alike, from its history. Until recently, history has all but ignored the participation of women in the fight against the Nazis. Laska, herself a resister and concentration camp inmate, has brought together the first representative collection of women’s memoirs of the resistance, of the Holocaust and of hiding to save their lives. The experiences of eyewitnesses from over a dozen nations underground, Auschwitz, Bergen-Belsen and the women’s concentration camp of Ravensbruck, among others, come vividly alive. The women’s stories are drawn from diaries, autobiographies and narratives; several are available in English translation for the first time in this book. 16 [pageend16]In a scholarly and extensive introductory essay, Laska gives the reader the benefit of not only her own observations in the resistance and in Auschwitz, Gross-Rosen and Dora-Nordhausen extermination/concentration camps, but also of the insider’s factual expertise she gained as a member of the post-war War Crimes Commission. Preceding every selection, her introductory remarks place each woman’s experience in a clearly defined historical perspective. Three sections deal with her own ventures, six with Czechoslovakia. This is the first book to focus on women both in the resistance and the Holocaust, making it essential for those interested in women’s European, Jewish and Holocaust studies. It is the first collection of its kind in English. Dr. Laska has produced an extraordinary testament that should be brought to the attention of a wide general audience and those at all levels of academia. ★ Professor Don Martindale (University of Minnesota) has just published Personality & Milieu: The Shaping of Social Science Culture (Houston: Cap & Gown Press, 1983) in which Chapter V, “King of the Hoboes: Joseph Roucek, Portrait of an International Cultural Workman” (pp. 139-155), surveys the career of SVU member, the sociologist Joseph S. Roucek (see also Bulletin III, 2, May 1982). Martindale evaluates Roucek’s influence on Czechoslovak and other sociology in America, his hundreds of studies and more than 50 books, a number of them covering Czechoslovak history and culture, including one on Komensky’s contributions to the spiritual foundations that resulted in the rise of Free Masonry. Dr. Roucek’s work as American editor of many foreign sociological journals has been widely recognized. He is the President Emeritus of the . International Social Science Honor Society Delta Tau Kappa and Professor Emeritus, City University of New York. He also was a motion picture actor and a popular lecturer on Czechoslovak culture and arts. With his wife Božena Slabej Roucek, a relative of General Viest, he presented programs of Czech and Slovak folk art and music. Mrs. Roucek has been also an outstanding singer and classical violinist. ★ Winn, Marie, Children Without Childhood (Pantheon, 224 pp., $13.95) The Washington Post’s Book World of Sunday, July 17, 1983 has a lengthy review, “How Much Should Children Know?” by Elizabeth Crow, editor-in-chief of Parents magazine, of Marie Winn’s book. The author is the daughter of the late psychiatrist, Dr. Joseph A. Winn (see Bulletin IV, 2, May 1983.) Her previous book, The Plug-In Drug, explored the detrimental influence of television on children’s prematurely accelerated development. The new book develops her ideas further. Basically she seems to advocate the need of the natural latency stage which today is not respected. Here are some passages from Elizabeth Crow’s review: In the past dozen years or so, Winn says, infancy and childhood have been telescoped into a precious three or four years of intense parental attention and a few more years of loosening apron strings. Then, at about age ten, all resemblance to the children of the past hundred years vanishes. Asexual children have been replaced by the sophisticated, profane, sexually knowledgeable manikins we see all around us today. These kids know it all, or at least that’s the impression they convey... Another important cause of the loss of childhood innocence that Winn cites is the general belief that children are adults’ psychological and emotional equals and, as such, deserve autonomy and independence. This parental abdication to child-power has had far-reaching effects. Not only is it an acknowledgement of parents’ lack of self-confidence, but this absurd egalitarianism makes any exercise of parental authority appear intolerably unfair... 17 [pageend17]And she offers help. Children Without Childhood doesn’t whine; it’s a dramatic, readable, useful book for parents who are beginning to realize that their jaded children will never become mature human beings unless they intervene, fast. Her message is clear: children must have a long and sheltered childhood — complete with play and protection. They also need parental insistence on manners, thoughtfulness, and adherence to the family’s values, which must be articulated if they are to be respected. “Only through the lengthy experience of being a child,” Winn writes, “of being dependent, of being totally protected and nurtured by loving parents, does the child gain the ability *o be a successful, protective, nurturing Darent himself.” The Washington Post, Book World (Sunday, July 17, 1983) The book was also reviewed in Newsweek (August 8, 1983) by Jean Seligmann, under the title “Growing Up Old.” News Received Press Release May 17, 1983 PRESS RELEASE .AMERICAN EMBASSY PRAGUE, CZECHOSLOVAKIA COMMEMORATION BY THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR TO CZECHOSLOVAKIA OF AMERICAN PARTICIPATION IN THE LIBERATION OF WESTERN AND SOUTHERN BOHEMIA IN 1945 On May 14 and 15 the American Ambassador to Czechoslovakia, Jack F. Matlock, paid tribute, as he did last year, to the American troops who liberated Western and Southern Bohemia from the Nazis in 1945. Accompanied by Deputy Chief of Mission Martin A. Wenick, Army Attache Lt. Col. Dennis Monroe and many other members of the Embassy and their families, the Ambassador and Mrs. Matlock visited Cheb, Kolovec, Rokycany, Litice, Vitejovice, Kasperske Hory, Sušice, Pole, Lnare. The Voice of America announced the itinerary of the Ambassador in advance on its Czechoslovak Service and substantial numbers of Czechoslovak citizens gathered at most locations to join in the commemoration. Crowds were estimated to be larger than at last year’s ceremonies, in some places numbering well over 200 people. Bouauets of flowers and World War II photographs of U.S. forces in Czechoslovakia were among the gifts presented to the visiting Americans. At Cheb, Litice, Vitejovice, Pole and Lnare the Ambassador laid wreaths at monuments honoring American soldiers and delivered brief remarks in Czech. Evoking the time when American troops were enthusiastically received in Bohemia at the end of World War II, he paid tribute to the sacrifices made not only by U.S. soldiers, but also by other nationalities in the struggle against Nazism, pointing out that the fight for freedom and human dignity still continues today. In Kolovec, after the Ambassador and Army Attache placed a wreath on a grassy spot where a monument once stood to American forces, the Ambassador was informed that no wreath was permitted bv the Town National Committee. The wreath, therefore, was removed following, tne Ambassador’s remarks. 18 [pageend18]Vitejovice, May 15, 1983. Ambassador Jack F. Matlock delivering remarks. Next to him are his mother Mrs. Nellie Burrum, and Army Attache Lt. Col. Dennis Monroe. At Rokycany, where a plaque “in everlasting memory” to “our liberators” from the U.S. 9th Infantry Regiment. 2nd Division used to hang on the City Hall wall, the Ambassador was prevented from speaking by someone who did not identify himself but stated that by order of the National Committee he was forbidden to make any remarks. Thereupon the Americans observed a moment of silence in respect to those who fell in the struggle against fascism near where the former plaque once hung. At Kasperske Hory, where there also used to be a plaque honoring U.S. forces, the Ambassador was again prevented from speaking by a representative of the National Committee. The response of the visiting Americans to this prohibition was to observe, as they had done at Rokycany, a moment of silence to honor the war dead. At the Sušice Town Square, the Ambassador was not permitted to speak in Czech near a plaque in memory of U.S. forces. The Town National Committee, however, allowed the Ambassador to explain in English to the accompanying Americans where the plaque once stood. After the ceremony the Ambassador and the Americans mingled with the crowd of several hundred before departure. * + * 19 [pageend19]OUR DEBT AND OUR CONTRIBUTION According to the independent monthly Kanadské listy of Toronto, published mostly in Czech and Slovak, 67,695 Canadian citizens acknowledge their Czech or Slovak heritage. The issue of June 15, 1983 (Vol. 17, No.6) brought out an article, “Our Debt and Our Contribution,” reporting on the 35th Congress of the Czechoslovak Association of Canada. During a banquet on May 28, 1983, over sixty individuals were honored for their contributions to Canada and/or the Czechoslovak community in that country. One of the honorees was Joseph Rudolf Cenek Cermak, a lawyer. He is a member of SVU and of other Czechoslovak societies. His interests are many, such as theater, writing books, journalism, Sokol gymnastics and community activities. We reproduce an excerpt from his speech on this occasion: Perhaps it is because our native land is still in the grip of the most grotesquely perverse system yet devised by man or perhaps it is simply because I realize that success is to such a large degree a matter of luck, genes and circumstances and I sense the fragility of my victories. Some of us present here tonight were chosen for our contribution to Canada. Before we speak of our contribution, perhaps we should speak of our debt. True, we are indebted for the opportunity to enjoy the good things of life - nice homes, cars, cottages, good food, travel. But we are indebted for something on a much higher plane, for something more profoundly essential to the dignity of man - for a chance to fashion our lives in as much freedom as any countryoffers its inhabitants today. We know that freedom is not an unblemished blessing. If I had to define it, I would describe it as the agony of choice. For that agony of choice we are indeed indebted. For the gift of that agony of choice we love this land as much as the native born. The country, which is theirs by birthright, we made our destiny by an act of faith. Our love for it is as irrevocable as theirs, even though a part of our hearts may forever remain hostage to another land - a smail, lovely country in the centre of Europe - which contributed many a magnificent dream and much beauty to the common treasury of mankind. We like to think that we made a contribution to Canada and not only those at the head table and those of us introduced here tonight. How does one measure contribution? There are contributions other than excellence in the professions, business or art and they are perhaps equally important: There have been men and women who paid a heavy price of long, long years of hard and unheralded work in the fields, in the mines, in the factories...
