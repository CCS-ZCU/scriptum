W© had a wonderful time in Pittsburg and the Slet and associated activities were well organized and most enjoyable. The weather was hot, but so was the enthusiasm. We thrilled to see giant billboards around the Pittsburg area advertising the Sokol Gymnastic Exhibition, and a big "Welcome Sokols" greeted all who arrived by plane. We were all impressed with the number of juniors participating in all of the events. Our Juniors, Marla and Whitney, were pleased to meet Brother Cahoy, Phil Cahoy’s father. And, he was kind enough to pose for pictures with both girls and Sister Duffey. (Need you be reminded, that Phil is one of our top USA gymnasts, and got his start at Sokol) When we parted on Sunday, July 3rd, to go our separate ways, we all vowed to make every effort to prepare for attendance and participation in the next Sokol Slet .

V San Franciscu zemřel 6. června 1983 ve věku 68 let Vilém Buršík. Narodil se 19. března 1915 v jižních Čechách, ve vesničce přímo pod hřebenem pohraničních hor. Již to místo zrození, tamní hraničářská tradice a hlavně zlý osud národa způsobily, že Vilém vyrostl ve věrnou^ přední stráž obránce nezávislosti a svobody. Jeho mládí a v muže dospívání spadá do té jasné historie, kdy naši malé, neštastné zemi na^chví- li vysvitlo slunko svobody první republiky. K té době ve svých myšlenkách Vilém §e vracel, a pro její obnovu celý život žila bojoval a pracoval. Ty štastné chvíle naši republiky byly náhle strženy zradou Evropy a diktátem Mnichova, kdy odstoupením pohraničních krajů obrana ze- me byla smrtelně zkriplována a milion Čechů vracejících se ze svých domů a gruntů s uzlíčkem vyhoštění byl obětován iluzi strašpytlů -zachránit mír. Srdce Vilémovo se v té době nejen ztotožňovalo s bolestí^vyho- štěnců a smutkem národa* ale i nadále věřil v prapor Masarykův - že pravda zvítězí, že germánské zlo a pýcha nepovládnou na věky. Když černi, apokalypští nacističtí jezdci vtrhli do země, Vilém nečekal a odešel bojovat za svou vlast. Překročil hranice do Polska, ale Polsko nechtělo jeho pomoc - poraženecká nálada Evropy pořád ještě radila - neprovokovat Hitlera. A tak Vilém se přeplavil do Francie, ale ještě ani tam českoslovenští bojovníci nebyli organizováni, a Vilém vstoupil do cizinecké legie. Teprve po uznání čs. zahraniční vlády Francií, spěchal do jihofran- cou^ského městečka Agde, kde se tvořila čs.~zahraniční armáda. S ní potom odešel na frontu a bojoval jižně Paříže a na řece Loiře. Po porážce Francie čs. jednotky se evakuovaly do Anglie. Tam Vilém dostal tvrdý ženijní výcvik. Z Anglie byl poslán do Ruska, kde u jedné naši brigády stal se velitelem ženistů. S touto brigádou se potom probíjel na dlouhé cestě od Kijeva až do vlasti. Ty boje^na této cestě svědčily o Vilémově neohroženosti a statečnosti^ at už to bylo při tvoření průchodů v minových polí, či v utoku. Konečně-dosáhl cíle, pro který odešel, probojoval se domů a dožil se osvobození• Ale už tehdy vě-v zel v jeho srdci trn nejistoty - zda ta sovětská družba, smlouva o věčném přátelství není jen předstírání a klam, jak uspat národní dbělost a uvést národvv nové, tentokrát rudé otroctví. Vždyt jeho zkušenosti z Ruska mu ukázaly nejen usmívající.diplomatickou tvář, ale i tvrdou ruku Sovětů a bezohlednou moc politických komisařů a policejního bezpečnostního systému - at uz šlo o zbol- ševizování čs, sboru, či instrukce parašutistů— označující cs» purzoa— zii za hlavního nepřítele v budoucím socialistickém statu. Když únorový puč 1948 ukázal tu pravou, bezohlednou tvář rudého imperialismu, Vilém podruhé opustil svou vlast, aby v rozhlasu Svobodné Evropy upozorňoval na toto nebezpečí. , , , Po příchodu do Ameriky Vilém neustal.ve sve národní činnosti. Mezi krajany přes všechny kruté porážky dál sil víru - ze po přejiti vichřice hněvu - vláda se vrátí do rukou českých, ze byli jsme a bu dem a i tu rudou bídu přežijem, Tato víra předávaná z generacd na generace je podmínkou nového osvobození. Ve své^obětavé činnosti na poli národním, Vilém našel plnou podporu u své ženy Elišky a v cele rodině . Čest jeho světlé památce. Alois Šeda.

Sister Mary Frances Meier was so elected. The meeting was called to order by Pres. Sr. Meier at 7*30 P. M. with the pledge of allegiance to the flag. One minute of silence was observed in memory of Br. Bursik and those members who are ill and unable to be among us. At roll call, all officers were present except, Sr. Pres. Duffey and VicewPres., Sr. ZUzana Bursik, both of whom were excused. Minutes of the May meeting were read and approved. Membership Chairman, Sr. Bele, reported no new memberships and dues are slowly coming in. Bldg. Dir., Br. Rozehnal reported that no one showed up for maintenance work on Sat., June 4th. He warned we must find a way to make repairs even if it means hiring outside labor. Sr. Bele made a motion, seconded by Sr. Murphy that Br. Rozehnal be allowed to hire help at an hourly rate up to 17.00. Motion carried. Br. Rozehnal reported a leak in the roof back in January but so far no action has been taken.

All through the streets of Prague the people were singing,rejoicing, but in all this exulting multitude the Sokols were conspicuously absent. They had been called together in the early forenoon by urgent posters in order to complete the victory on the home ground and to protect it. It must be remembered that at this moment in hi r — tory Prague was still militarily in the hands of the Austrian generals and their faithful Rumanian regiments. The most difficult part of the revolutionary action, the taking over of the military power, was entrusted by the National Council to Dr. Josef Scheiner, president of the Czech Sokol Community. Wearing his Sokol uniform and accompanied by DrFranci n Soukup and several other brothers, Dr.Scheiner went directly to the headquarters of the territorial military command on the Mala Strana to negotiate for the takeover. At first the generals hesitated to surrender the control but when they saw that in the meantime other Sokols entered the bull ding, fl adding its courtyard and the halls with their red shirts they realized the inevitableness of the situation and yielded to the demands. Simultaneously other Sokol groups occupied the Prague armordes and began disarming the Rumanian soldiers. Similar actions were taking place in the garrisons in other cities. All over the land the Sokols with virtually bare hands were disarming entire enemy regiments - and this was not always so smooth and without resistance. However the remains of the Austrian army were not the only danger facing the new-born state. There were the internal enemies, the Germans who tried in the last moment to drag out of the country whatever gold they could, as well as the weapons and many art treasures; and the communists who continued to incite the people to violence. The Republic came into being on the ruins of a state that for a long time had no authority and no confidence. Further the new state had no central offices to carry on its authority, and no law-enforcing facilities. The police and gendarmes that were available were despised by the nation as instruments of an inimical government, the army was demoralized, the local army regiments were still stationed beyond the nati ona 1 boundaries, and our own territory was still occupied by Rnmanl an and Hungarian troops, devoted to Austria and its dynasty. The national Council declared that it was taking over the government but in reality had no executive bodies that could enforce their decisions. Who knows if the revolution could have taken place so smoothly and without losses of life and property if there were not present the nation’s mighty arms, referred to by Dr. Pluhař at the Sokol Slet in Brno. The Sokols formed sentry guard units that watched over order in the nation and over national proper y. m three, Continued next page [pageend7]August, 1985________ Sokol San Francisco Věstník Strana - Page 8 Continued Proni previous - four days after the transition the entire national property was in the hands of the Sokol Community . . Practically the entire executive power of the National Council was transferred to the Sokols. The red color of the Sokol shirts gave people a feeling of safety and certainty and inspired the masses to cooperation. Since it was evident that organizing a regular army would require gn1 ta a bit of time, the Czech Sokol Community offered to the National Council for the interim period the formation of voluntary Sokol regiments to bé called Guards of Freedom. The National Council accepted this offer very gratefully and the Sokols were further joined by the students, the Czech Marksmanship Organi zatlon and the Workers Gymnastic Units. The Guards of Liberty were originally intended to merely serve to maintain order but in Slovakia they had to perform actual military duties. As is well known, there the change-over did not go along as smoothly as in the historic Czech lands. The Magyars were reluctant to give up Slovakia and this had to be fought for from city to city, from one garrison to another. Before the Slovak government was established the resistance of the Magyars and the Germans assumed exceptionally threa toning proportions in Bratislava. Zoch, the district administrator end other leaders appealed by urgent telegrams on February 2, 1919 addressed to the Czech Sokol Community asking that 2.000 Sokols Ue sent to Bratislava without delay to help maintain order. A simple appeal through the daily press was sufficient, and within 36 hours 2.480 Sokols in uniform arrived in Bratislava. Their very presence prevented bloodshed and was sufficient to assure peaceful takeover by the new government. But even this did not end the Sokol role as national army. In June of 1919 the Magyar communists invaded Slovakia and occupied a number of cities. Once again the pro-tem government in Bratislava asked the Sokols for help. And once again within two days after the telegraphed request the first division of Sokol volunteers was on the way from Prague to Slovakia. The Sokol Organization ordered immediate military draft and 86.000 Sokols responded. Of these 10.000 were sent to Slovakia. General Mittelhauser (6) in his role as supreme commander evaluated the Sokol intervention June 7» 1919 as follows: "The performance of the unit led by Major Bonneau that day exceeded the command's expectations. The 30 kilometer advance under* a scorching mm, interrupted by two battles was a warlike deed that can only be expected from a pugnacious well-trained army« There was rejoicing in the headquarters in Bratislava that night upon receiving the news about regaining the Nove Zemky where the Sokols first marched in ... thus thanks to the Sokol assistance were joyfully ended three days and three nights filled with anxiety among the general staff. The advance of Magyar communists was halted and Bratislava was saved." It was only after repelling the communist attack on Slovakia that the liberation of our lands was completed and the nnnfd mi nd existence of our Republic secured. This action also ended the Sokol participation in the struggle for liberation.

If you're regularly involved in a sport—even one as apparently harmless as table tennis—sooner or later you’ll probably get hurt. There's a small army of medical specialists now working to design better protective gear and improve treatment procedures, but they're outdistanced by the new public craze for fitness. There simply aren't enough professionals to tape all the ankles, stitch all the lips, and splint all the fingers that are being hurt these days. The responsibility for sports safety rests ultimately with the competitor himself, and in Sports Health (Quick Fox), William Southmayd. M.D. and Marshall Hoffman provide these guidelines for preventing injuries: SPORTSPEAK Do you consider sports lingo, like the fine print in an insurance policy, an uncrackable code? Is jargon like ‘‘duck hook” and “mashie” as foreign to you as foie gras? If so, the following quiz will serve as a guide to “sportspeak,” that labyrinthian language of the armchair athlete. 1) mashie 2) sin-bin 3) slam dunk 4) love PICK A SAFE SPORT—Studies have shown that football is the most injury-prone sport, followed by ice hockey, soccer, basketball, wrestling, and field hockey. Sports that register low injury rates are softball, volleyball, and baseball. TRAIN. BUT DON'T OVERTRAIN—Dr. Southmayd says that 60% of the injuries treated at his sports clinic in New England are due to overtraining. As athletes push their bodies to the outer limits, they ofterq;ross the line between work and overwork. The authors suggest that these symptoms are warnings that an injury is on the way: localizing pain, usually in a joint; stiffness in a joint with a slight loss in motion; swelling: no athletic improvement even with rest; change in the contour of a bone, muscle, or joint; a burning sensation, tingling, and numbness in a limb; unexplained redness of the skin; unexplained black-and-blue marks. STRETCH—Stretching before exercise is critical to lengthen muscles and tendons. It also fills the muscles with blood and makes them pliable. The more pliable the muscles and tendons are. the less likely they are to sprain or strain. Before you stretch, your muscles are like a tight string which can snap easily, but afterward, the muscle-tendon units are like rubber bands. USE STRENGTH TRAINING—Strong athletes are injured less because their ligaments and tendons are heavier and thicker, while their bones are more resistant to breaks. Dead weights and other strengthening equipment should be tailored to an individual's needs and particular sport, but it must be incorporated into every athlete's training regimen. 5) duck hook 6) blitz 7) sheets 8) duster 9)choke 10)TKO a) no score; zero (tennis) b) a defensive play in which the linebackers rush the quarterback (football) c) the lines used to trim a sailboats sails d) name given (circa 1890) to the golf club that is now the #5 iron e) hockey jargon for the penalty box f) to vigorously stuff a basketball through the hoop g) a fast, inside pitch used to intimidate the batter (baseball) h) technical knock-out (boxing) i) a golf shot which veers sharply to the left or right without hardly leaving the ground j) to lose one's composure in a critical situation (any sport) inoqseM rpazjoo 0 fanjooy ipajjoo pg lueuapA :pa.uo3 9-6 bejsjadns ipajjoo 01 :3u u bm (M)OT ‘(!)6 ‘(3)8 W (q)9 (!)G Wfr ‘G)C '(a)? <p)T :sja»suV When injuries do occur and unorganized sports generate twice as many as organized events— immediate attention is required. Under the acronym RICE, the on-site procedures are: RES F necessary to prevent extending the injury. Use a sling or crutch and stop using the injured part the minute it's hurt. ICE—causes the injured blood vessels to contract, thus decreasing bleeding. The more blood that collects in a wound, the longer it takes to heal. COMPRESSION—compression helps limit the swelling which retards healing. ELEVATION- lift the injured part above the level of the heart to use the force of gravity to help drain excess fluids. RICE should be started within seconds of any injury and continued until the injury can be examined by a physician. [pageend10]Advokát Ja me s R. Fr o l ik ATTORNEY AT LAW illuvione cesky FROLIK.
