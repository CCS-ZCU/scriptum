The meeting was called to order by SVU President Miloslav Rechcigl at 5 PM. At the onset he appointed Dr. Jan Skalný recording secretary and Frank Safertal and Svata Kudej verifiers of the minutes. Dr. Clinton Machann was then asked to read the minutes from the 1999 General Assembly meeting in Minnesota which were approved. Subsequently he appointed a Resolution Committee consisting of Blanka Kudej (Chair) and Anton Novačky and Juraj Slavik. General Assembly then honored the recently deceased SVU members by standing. Then followed brief reports by the representatives of SVU Chapters abroad, including that of Dr. Alena Moravkova for the Prague Chapter and Dr. Marie Bobková for the Brno Chapter. The newly established SVU Chapter in Plzeň, Czech Republic was represented by its President Karel Zastera, professor at the University of West Bohemia. Prof. V. Bor- kovec, jointly with Prof. I. Feierabend, then presented the winner, Petra Ticha of Ostrava, a current student at American University, the Josef Hašek Award,. for her páper "Westernization of the Czech Republic". The next item on the agenda was the traditional SVU Presidenťs Annual Report, "State of the SVU in the Year 2000," presented by Milá Rechcigl. He recapitulated the Society's activities in the last two years, svu [pageend1]including last year's successful SVU Conference in Minnesota, held on the occasion of President Havefs visit to the US. He described in detail the efforts of the Board to restructure the editorial and administrativě apparatus of Kosmas in order to bring about a speeder operation and distribution of the periodical, and the launching of a new monograph program. At this point he also introduced the new editor-in-chief Prof. Clinton Machann, thanking him for putting out his first issue in record time — less than four months since he took over. A number of new activities undertaken by SVU háve their foundation in the new project on the "Preservation of Czech and Slovák Heritage in America," under SVU Presidenťs direction, with partial support by the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Notably, the photographic SVU exhibit at the Congress on the life of Czech and Slovák communities in the US are part of this effort, in which leading Czech-American organizations participated. In his remarks, Rechcigl stressed the emphasis on young people which was amply visible by the number of speakers and other participants in this Congress. In his concluding remarks he thanked the organizers for their "job well doně" and also the media, particularly Petr a Věra Bisek, for their help in publicizing the Congress and the SVU aims, in generál. Then came the Treasurer's report, presented by Frank Mucha, on the status of SVU finances which was accompanied by the Auditors' Report recommending that the Treasurer's Report be approved. Mucha's statement collaborated SVU Presidenťs conclusion that the Society is financially sound and well, thanks to the sound management fiscal policy of the Executive Board under Rechcigfs direction. The Trea- sureťs Report was approved unanimously. While this was going on, the Resolution Committee, which worked on the Congress resolution, completed their task and the resolution, based on the originál draft prepared by Dr. Slouka, was presented to the General Assembly by Juraj Slavik. It was a clear and effective statement, written in superb prose, which was then approved by the General Assembly without changing a word. The parting gesture of Rechcigfs Presidency was the presentations of SVU Presidential Citations, awarded to deserving individuals "in Recog- nition for Contributions to the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences (SVU), the Advancement of Czechoslovak Studies and the Zprávy SVU (SVU News), Editor Andrew Elias, 10713 Howerton Ave., Fairfax, VA 22030, tel.

The recipients were: Bruče Robert Berglund (KS), Alexej Borkovec (MD), Věra Borkovec (MD), Petr and Věra Bisek (NY), Marie Bobková (Brno), Pat Krizek DeVoe (MD), Andrew Elias (VA), Jaroslav Folta (Prague), George Glos (VA), Zdenek Hruban (IL), Blanka Kudej (NY), Clinton Machann (TX), Karol Marton (Kosice), Josef A.

Prof. Jan F. Triska, who served in the capacity of Chair of the SVU Nominating Committee, assumed the role of presiding chair de tempore and reported on the outcome of mail elections. The entire slate, as initially proposed, was elected by an overwhelming margin, i.e., Milá Rechcigl, President; Anton J. Novačky, Executive Vice President; Věra Borkovec, George Glos, Blanka Kudej, Josef Machac, Peter Rafaeli, Alexander Tkac, Dagmar Hasalova White, and Petr Zuna, Vice Presi- dents; Frank Safertal, General Secretary; and Frank Mucha, Treasurer. In his acceptance speech, Milá Rechcigl expressed, in the name of the entire newly elected Executive Board, his sincere appreciation to members for their confidence in electing them to the SVU leadership roles for the next two-year period. "As for myself," he stated, "this is not the first time I am standing in front of you at such an occasion and I know exactly what is expected of me. Let me assure you that we will do our outmost to continue the splendid work of our predecessors in an effort to advance Czech and Slovák culture worldwide and foster coop- eration between the men and women of science, letters and art on both sides of the Atlantic. We cannot obviously do the work alone and ask our members for their suggestions, initiatives and offers to help us in this important undertaking. We are particularly seeking the help of young people with the anticipation that they will fill our shoes and také over." Rechcigl is certainly not a novice in the SVU affairs, having served as its President during 1974-76 period already and again during 1976-78. He is credited for putting the Society on solid fiscal foundation and for greatly expanding its membership base and stimulating new programs. Sixteen years later when the Society was facing uncertainty and malaise he was brought back. In the last six years of his Presidency (1994-2000), the Society has witnessed unexpected rebirth and remarkable growth making it the most important organization of its kind in the world. With his unbound energy and initiatives the Society cannot but rise to higher horizons during his next two years as President of SVU. 3 [pageend3]Newly Elected Executive Board Meets With echoes from SVU World Congress still in the air, the newly elected Executive Board (EB) held its first meeting on an upbeat notě. The meeting was held in SVU President Milá Rechcigl's house in Rock- ville, MD at 9 o'clock AM. Rechcigl (MR) introduced two new members, Frank Safertal and Peter Rafaeli, respectively, commenting favorably on their business back- ground and experience which should be of great help to the Executive Board on various problems it will be facing. The first part of agenda was spent on discussing modus operandi of the Board and the division of labor among the officers. A total of 4-5 meetings a year are planned with the expectation that all Board members will attend. There was a consensus that the officers need to respond promptly to all inquiries, be they from within or from outside and that procrastination won't be tole- rated. The same principle applies SVU-wide, including Local Chapters. In order to fully utilize the knowhow and experiences of all 8 SVU Vice Presidents, MR stressed that each VP needs to select and be res- ponsible for a specific project or several projects which would contribute towards SVU aims and objectives. This delegation of responsibility should enhance the SVU operating efficiency. They also need to pian for "succession" , i.e., pian to recruit and find a possible substitute who could easily step into their function. Succession planning needs to be a part of Executive Boarďs key objectives. Average age of EB member is 66 years — age may become an issue as any organization needs to rejuvenate itself. A suitable replacement is being sought for Anton Novačky who for personál reasons is unable to continue his function. MR reiterated that "Accent on Youth" is one of the highest priorities of SVU now and in the future. The entire EB will need to get involved. There are a number of capable people out there, it is just a question of how to find them. The success of the 20th SVU Congress in Washington, DC was due to a considerable degree to the presence of young people. Several young people háve taken lead since then, showing us what they can do. Thus, Anna Vysoka is working on a new young people data base. Karel Zastera, through his initiative, established a new SVU local chapter in Plzeň, and as if this were not enough, he is planning to play a key role in the next SVU World Congress. And finally, Jiri Eichler, who was initially interested in creating SVU Fórum, has volunteered his Services to help SVU redesign its HomePage and, in fact, through his technical help we háve now established a new comprehensive Interactive SVU Web Site of which he is the new Webmaster. In this connection, the Executive Board agreed to name a new Youth Advisory Committee, comprised of Anna Vysoka (chair), Karel Zastera 4 [pageend4]Jiri Eichler, Vlasta Pokladníkova, Victor Gomez, Vladimír Antoš, Heda Hlavova and Mirek Pavka. Another priority item of the Executive Board is the focus on Information Technology. Every SVU Officer has been admonished to think and dream Information Technology in order to spread our message more quickly and more effectively worldwide and speed up the contact with SVU membership at large. In this day and age, the local chapters should háve easy access to e-mail and to the Internet. Use of computers, Internet, satellites, cellular phones, etc, should become routine in SVU vocabulary. EB members had the opportunity of viewing the new SVU Web Site, each commenting favorably on its content and the design. Details of the new Web Site will be discussed elsewhere. EB made two important decisions regarding its upcoming activities. The next SVU Conference and Annual Meeting in the year 2001 will be held at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE, in early August. The dáte will be announced as soon as the details háve been worked out. The next SVU World Congress will be held in Plzeň, Czech Republic on the campus of the University of West Bohemia in August 2002. The Congress will be held under the aegis of the Lord Mayor of Plzeň and the Rector of the University of West Bohemia, both of whom sent letters to that effect. EB reaffirmed the importance of publications. They expressed thanks to Clinton Machann and David Chroust who managed, in a matter of a few months, to put together their first issue of Kosmas, with the hope that the subsequent issue will soon follow. In terms of monographic publications, the Society is committed to publish next year a monograph of Zdenka Fischmann's writings on Czech musicology, to be edited by Dagmar Hasalova White and Judy Fiehler. In a similar vein, The Society plans to publish an anthology on Czech and Slovák Poetry in Exile in honor of Frank Marlow, to be edited by Věra Zanda Borkovec.

They all made a very good impression and, to my knowledge, they enjoyed our Congress as well. Some of you were there. Several sessions were actually organized by young people, thanks to Bruče Berglund and Anna Vysoka. We would obviously like you, as well as other young people, to par- ticipate in our future activities. In order not to lose the momentům we are in the process of establishing, with the help of Anna Vysoka, a speciál database of the interested and promising young folks who háve roots or professional interest in Czechlands or Slovakia. Your input into the database is welcome. Without waiting for its completion, we are considering creating a smaller nucleus of interested young folks who would put on their think- ing caps on how to get young people involved in specific SVU activities. One option may be to establish a speciál section within SVU, a sort of "SVU Yuppies," which may sound corny but it may attract other young people to join. In this connection, I would welcome any volunteers who would like to help us in this endeavor. Apart from Anna Vysoka, several other young people are already involved in SVU activities, including Jiri Eichler of Prague who is help- ing us build a new SVU Web Site and Karel Zastera of Plzen/Prague who has taken the initiative of establishing a new SVU Chapter in Plzeň. The latter will also play an important role in the next SVU World Congress. By joining SVU (dues for students are only $5), young people can benefit a lot. For example, they háve an opportunity: I. to present papers in SVU conferences and world congresses; 2. to submit papers to SVU English periodical Kosmas', 3. to periodically report on their progress, activities, publications, awards, etc., in SVU Newsletter; 4. to get advice on possible dissertation topics; 5. to participate in student essay contests; 6. to consult with many SVU knowledgeable members at universities and other institutions throughout the world; 7. to establish mutually beneficially collaborative relationships with their peers worldwide; 8. to get involved in various SVU projects; 9. to assist in organizing future SVU congresses and conferences; 10. to become active on SVU committees; 11. to meet all sorts of interesting people. 6 [pageend6]You may, of course, háve additional ideas. We welcome specific suggestions on how else SVU could be helpful to students and young people on both sides of the Atlantic, with their studies or research, or with their starting careers. In connection with speciál projects, it would be useful, for example, to prepare student guides, one for students in CR and SR planning to study in the US and Canada; and another for Americans planning to do research in Czech or Slovák Republics. A listing of available grant agencies may be of definite value. Perhaps some of you would be interested in working on projects like this with us. We are also thinking of launching a new SVU Fórum on our Web Site and consider establishing new electronic publication series. The possibilities of your involvement are unlimited and your initiative is encouraged. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. You can e-mail me on: rechcigl@aol.com All the best, MILÁ RECHCIGL, SVU President Beyond Expectations and Our Dreams Echoes and Reflections from the Millennium SVU World Congress Organized by the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences Upon returning from the last scheduled Congress event — a visit to President Jefferson's home at Monticello — I decided to put down some of my thoughts on the six memorable days at the Congress, while my memory is still fresh. Speaking as a whole, the Congress was an unqualified success and the organizers' hope that it might be a pivotal event of the historie year 2000 for those interested in the thing Czech or Slovák turned out to be a fulfilled ■ prophecy. There were around 400 registrants, not counting numerous other individuals who sneaked in without paying, making it a record for any SVU Congress held on the American continent. Only some ten years ago one could hear rumblings among individual SVU members that the Society has doně its thing and that the time has come to cease and desist. I doubt there was a single soul at the Congress who would háve dared to utter or even contemplate such a thought. What difference ten years make! The vigor and vitality of the Society was self-evident in all of the fifty five scheduled panels. Many a panel was overflowing with listeners so that some of them had to stand or sit on the floor. To be sure, some panels started with a few individuals only but as the time went on they began to fill up, even to capacity. Interestingly enough, even in the less attended panels, as the presen- 7 [pageend7]tations proceeded, the listeners and the speakers became so engrossed in the proceedings and in intensive discussions that the number of people in the audience did not seem to matter. The people in the audience were not just passive listeners, many of them contributed to discussion, some- times clarifying points or adding new Information. There was something there for everyone and frequently one had to make hard choices of which of the sessions or papers to attend. The Congress took plače in the Capital of the US, Washington, DC, where the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences (SVU) got its start, where the idea of creating the Society was developed, and where the first Society's Congress was held. The present Congress, 20th in number, was organized jointly with the American University where most of the meet- ings and related activities were held. The Congress was organized under the aegis of both the Czech and Slovák Embassies and Ambassadors Alexandr Vondra and Martin Butora took part personally in a number of events. The Congress started with a bang — a reception at the Slovák Am- bassador's residence in McLean Virginia in the latě afternoon of August 8. When I first discussed the idea with Hon. Martin Butora, I had in mind a relatively smáli group of people attending, 100 at most, considering that it would actually také plače the day before the Congress' opening. However, to our amazement, three times as many people actually came, filling every available inch of, otherwise a spacious building. I was told that this was a record attendance for any gathering in the Ambassadoťs residence. Mrs. Butorova personally graciously welcomed visitors at the dooř which gave us a feeling of hospitality and warmth. Because of the distance from the city, the Ambassador arranged for transportation from and to American University by bus. The culinary skills of their new chef were evident in the scrumptious food served. The official opening of the Congress took plače at American University Washington College of Law in the elegant Morella Courtroom, pattemed after a classical British courtroom. The program started with a musical piece — Dance Suitě by Tylman Susato, performed by Annan- dale Brass, John Wright, conducting. Then followed the national an- thems. When the Czech "Kde domov muj" was played, followed by "Nad Tatrou sa blýská," a site unseen and the sound unheard since the painful separation of the two Republics, there was a visible stir in the audience and one could see an honest tear in the eyes of many. The official welcome was given by President of American University Dr. Benjamin Ladner, who commenced and ended his words with the quotation from Comenius, a reál gesture from an American, followed by the greetings of the representatives of Washington College of Law and the Wesley Theological Seminary where some of the meetings were held. I then had 8 [pageend8]the pleasure of officially opening the Congress, which occasion I ušed to acquaint the audience with the aims of SVU and recapitulate key mile- stones in its history and activities. Then came the presentations by the Czech and Slovák Ambassadors, Alexandr Vondra and Martin Butora, respectively, outlining their views on future cooperation of their govern- ments with Czech and Slovaks in the US. Following a short intermission came the keynote address by Hon. Vaclav Klaus, Speaker of the House, Czech Parliament, on the perspec- tives of the Czech Republics in the next continuum, focusing on the eco- nomic aspects. His presentation was followed by an address by Hon. Pal Csaky, Vice Premier of the Slovák Republic, who discussed his views on the democratization of Slovakia based on tolerance and the rule of law. After a buffet lunch, hosted jointly by SVU and the American University, there was a plenary session on the theme "Czech and Slovaks Who Made a Difference in the Second Millennium." Selected speakers gave presentation on the contributions of such outstanding personalities as Jan Hus, Jan Amos Komenský (Comenius), Rabbi Chatam Sofer, Antonin Dvorak, Johann G. Mendel, Sigmund Freud, Thomas G. Masaryk, Milan Rastislav Stefanik, Stefan Osusky and Jan Papanek. All speakers were outstanding personalities in their own right, coming from such institutions as the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Slovák Academy of Sciences, Charles University, Jewish Museum of Prague, Palacky University, etc. That evening Congress participants were hosted in a reception at the Czech Embassy which was cosponsored by the SVU Washington DC Chapter. This reception which was very successful was attended by an enormous crowd which made it necessary to open the doors into the garden. There was the customary receiving line and later Ambassador Vondra introduced several distinguished guests from the Czech Republic, i.e., Senátor Petr Pithart, Senátor Jaroslava Moserova, and the Chief of Staff of the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs Martin Vavra. The next three days were devoted to individual sessions, discussion panels and symposia, organized by subject, disciplině, or topič. It is beyond the scope of this article to dwell into detail or even to attempt to summarize proceedings of individual panels. There was such a variety that everybody could find something of interest or to his or her liking. A number of people commented that the proceedings of at least some of the panels should be published and disseminated. The SVU Executive Board will definitely make effort in this direction. Of the various panels I would like to make speciál reference to the SVU Symposium on the "Future of Planet Earth: Environmental and Sustainable Development in the Czech Republic and Slovakia." This was a carefully planned symposium with the financial assistance of the Trust of Mutual Understand- 9 [pageend9]ing, and the participation of six leading experts from the Czech and Slovák Republics. The active participants of the Symposium had an oppor- tunity to also meet with the representatives of the National Science Foundation and those of the Environmental Protections Agency and to discus their program and future cooperation with their American counterparts. Apart from the strictly academie program, there were a variety of cultural and sociál events the participants could attend. In connection with the SVU speciál project on the preservation of the Czech and Slovák heritage in America, the SVU staged a historical photo exhibit of Czech and Slovák communities, arranged by States and cultural institutions. It was beautifully doně and Pat DeVoe who did most of the work deserves speciál thanks. Some participants took the advantage of taking part in the arranged and guided tour in the National Gallery of Art. The American University Theater, under the direction of Gail Humphries Mar- dirosian, staged for the Congress participants an American premiere of Josef Topofs "Hour of Love" (translated by Věra Borkovec). It was an extraordinary play written by the foremost playwright of the Czech Republic. There was also a showing of a remarkable Mican's film "All Loved Ones," depicting the life of the Czech Jewish family at the onset of the World War II. Another film with the Jewish theme from the World War II was shown in the panel on "The Holocaust." One of SVU mem- bers, Suzanne Justman produced this very moving, the Emmy-winning, film, entitled "Voices of Children." The Congress program also included an annual meeting of the Society which will be addressed elsewhere. One of the startling phenomenon of the Congress was the omni- presence of the young people, or more precisely the young folks in their twenties and the middle-aged folks in their thirties and forties. This was not just a happenstance. The Congress organizers planned for that by selecting several young people who organized panels by themselves. Anybody who attended these panels must agree that they did an out- standing job. Another striking feature of the Congress was the number of visitors from the Czech and Slovák Republics who made the discus- sions more interesting, more genuine, and more realistic. The fact that the top political leaders from the Czech and Slovák Republics, such as Vaclav Klaus and Pal Csaky, actively participated at the Congress, is an indication that not only SVU commends greater respect than ever before in the home countries but also that Czech and Slovaks abroad are being viewed more seriously over there. A number of greetings were received on the occasion of SVU World congress, including those of President Vaclav Havel, and Minister of Foreign Affairs Jan Kavan, which are reprinted elsewhere. In addition, the Mayor of Washington, Hon. Anthony A. Williams declared August 9, 2000, as "Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences Day" in Wash10 [pageend10]ington, DC. The holding of the Congress was also recognized by the re- marks of Hon. James P. Morgan, a Representative of Virginia, published in the Congressional Record. All in all, the Congress more than fulfilled our expectations. Everyone I talked to generally had good time. The overall mood was excellent and good humor prevailed most of the time. Occasional problems, such as looking for taxis, were relatively minor, in comparison to everything else which was overwhelmingly positive, excit- ing, stimulating, encouraging, and enthralling. There was a feeling of warmth, belonging, and camaraderie among all, be they Czechs or Slo- vaks or anybody else, the young or the old, professionals, political and community leaders alike, irrespective of what side of the Atlantic one lived on Only meetings like this, unassuming, face to face, individuals of good will without preconceived notions can overcome the existing and imaginary beelines or crowlines separating the Czechs and Slovaks abroad from their compatriots in the home countries. Tolerance, humanity and good will were the underlying tone of the congress, exquisitely fitting and contemplatively reflecting upon the generál theme "Civil Society and Democracy into the New Millennium."

Bradbrook: The Liberating Beauty of Little Things Decision, Adversity & Reckoning in a Refugee’s Journey from Prague to Cambridge This book is the story of an academic’s escape from Czechoslovakia to England at the height of the Cold War. It is a poignant a timely reminder of the hardships and life without basic freedoms endured under Communism. It is also a documentary of the politics, sociology and history of those turbulent years in Europe as they influenced and restrained the life of academics under the yoke of Communism. Ten years on from the fall of the Berlin Wall, a younger generation is already beginning to forget what made it imperative for so many individuals to leave their homes in Central Europe, in order to gain freedom and to demonstrate to the communist authorities, the families and friends they left behind and their new hosts, just how important their escape to Liberty was.

Významná životní jubilea manželů Haňkových z Michiganu V Kalamazoo ve státě Michigan letos oslavili v plném zdraví významná životní výročí dva zakládající členové SVU. Dr. Ladislav J. Haňka oslavil v červenci osmdesátku a jeho žena Eva v květnu pětasedmdesátku. Do USA přišli spolu v roce 1951 a prodělali typické a nesnadné začátky nových imigrantů. Ladislav strávil pět let na lowa State University, kde získal M.S. a Ph.D. v mikrobiologii. Pracoval pak ve výzkumné divizi firmy Upjohn na léčení rakoviny. Eva se první léta věnovala výchově dětí a hlavně díky jí obě děti — Ladislav a Jana — mluví dokonale česky. Později také ukočila své vzdělání (B.A. a M.A.) na Western Michigan University a učila pak cizí jazyky na středních školách. V uznání celožitovní výzkumné práce byl dr. Haňka jmenován čestným členem Československé mikrobiologické společnosti (stále Československá!). 17 [pageend17]Paní Haňková měla jednu zajímavou příhodu v dětských létech. Jako tříleté děvčátko byla s matkou přivítat prezidenta T. G. Masaryka při jeho návštěvě ve Ždaře nad Sázavou (tenkrát Město Zdar na Moravě). Náhodný snímek T.G.M. s děvčátkem v náručí se dostal na čs. poštovní známky v roce 1938. A tentýž motiv se dostal na první českou známku nového milénia v lednu 2000 v souvislosti s oslavou 150 let od narození T. G. Masaryka. Ve Ždáru nad Sázavou uspořádal letos v květnu Okresní spolek filatelistů v úzké spolupráci s Městským úřadem velmi důstojné oslavy u příležitosti dnes již slavné známky. Celého programu se zúčastnila paní Haňková s manželem. Tam také důstojně oslavila své 75. narozeniny u své maminky, s kterou byla v roce 1928 vítat pana prezidenta. Mamince už je 98 let, je nejstarší občankou města a pořád je celkem zdravá a čilá. TRADICE ČESKÉ ZNÁMKOVÉ TVORBY 5 40 BOHUMIL HEINZ K' DĚTEM 1938 ČESKA REPUBLIKA SVU Student Award For the Year 2000 This year’s SVU Student Award went to a Czech girl from Ostrava, studying at American University in Washington, DC. The student Petra Ticha received the award for ther páper “Wester- nization in the Czech Republic: Blessing or Stepchild of Demo- cracy?” The Student Award Committee judged the páper to be excep- tionally well-written and well-researched, although the treatment was more journalistic than pretending to be a scholarly analysis. Miss Ticha received the award at the General Assembly meeting from two of the committee members, Prof. Věra Borkovec and Prof. Ivo Feierabend. We all wish her luck with her continued studies at the University. Věra Borkovec also thanked her for her invaluable help as a member of the Local Arrangements Committee for the 20th SVU Congress. VB Uzavierka nasledujúceho čísla Zpráv (január-február 2001) je 9. decembra 2000. 18 [pageend18]In Memoriam FRANK STEINER (1922-2000) Frank Steiner, a longtime SVU member, died September 14, at his home in Scotia, NY after a long illness. Born on April 23, 1922 in Prague, Czechoslovakia, and raised in Vienna, Austria, Mr. Steiner came to the United States in 1939. He earned a bachelor's degree in Chemical engineering from the University of Pennsylvania in 1943 and then volunteered for the Army. After eaming United States citizenship, Mr. Steiner became an interrogator for the Army and was stationed in Stuttgart. He worked for the General Electric Co. in a number of technical and managerial capacities at both the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory and the National Reactor Test Site, Idaho, from 1948 to 1984. Mr. Steiner earned a master's degree and a Ph.D. from what is now known as the University at Albany, where he taught German. He also translated German-language technical articles. He served on the boards of WMHT and 440 State Street, lne. Frank was a member of the board of the Friends of the Schenectady County Public Library, for whom he was a frequent book reviewer and organizer of noontime programs. He was a volunteer for "Mended Hearts" at Ellis Hospital, Proctor's Theater and WMHT. He was also a volunteer for the Schenectady Civic Players. He was a longtime member of the First Unitarian Society of Schenectady. He was a member of the Glens Hills Swim Club and the Schenectady Winter Sports Club. While he was still active, he regularly participated in the SVU World Congresses, usually speaking on some literary figuře of Prague. His unbound energy and enthusiasm will be missed. Survivors include his wife of 52 years, Helen E. Steiner; a daughter, Linda Steiner of South Orange, NJ; a son, David Steiner of Boxboro, MA; and four grandchildren. On behalf of SVU we wish to express to Helen and her family our deepest sympathy. MR £ ? $ OTAKAR KOLDOVSKY (1930 1998) Somewhat belatedly we háve leamed about the passing of our member Otakar Koldovsky on April 5, 1998. He was born on March 31, 1930 in Olomouc of a physician's family. In 1949 he started his studies at Charles University at the Faculty of Medicine and as a medical student joined the working group of Professor J. Křeček at the Institute of Phys- iology of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences. He graduated in 1955 and after practicing as a physician in Karlovy vary he started his Ph.D. studies under the guidance of Dr. P. Hahn in Professor Krecek's department. He studied the ontogenic development of the intestines in rats and human fetuses at the Institute of Mother and Child, for which work 19 [pageend19]he was awarded the CIBA prize in London. Since then he devoted his efforts to studying the utilization of nutrients during postnatal development. In the midst of his fruitful research in 1968, Czechoslovakia was occupied by Warsaw Pact armies. Dr. Koldovsky was among many scientists who left the country. He began his research work in pediatrics in Philadelphia where he also received his nostrification. The last eighteen years he spent in Tucson, AZ where he was in charge of the Neonatal Research unit at the University of Arizona’s Department of Pediatrics. His most promising research tumed to the role of hormones and growth factors in milk. He authored many originál articles, chapters in books and his own monograph, Development of the Smáli Intestinal Functions in Mammals and Man. After the Velvet Revolution, he regularly retumed to his homeland professionally and socially. In 1994 on the occasion of the SVU world congress in Prague, he organized a conference on “Czech and Slovák Contributions to Parental Medicine,” which was later published in Phy- siol. Res. 44 (1995), pp. 339-360. Dr. Koldovsky made a distinct mark on medical research and his contributions will long be remembered. $ JOHN A. NOHEL (1924-1999) John A. Nohel, a well-known mathematician died in Zurich, Switzer- land on November 1, 1999. A native of Prague, Czechoslovakia, where he was born on October 24, 1924. He and his parents were forced to leave their homeland in 1938, emigrating to the US in 1939. He received his education at George Washington University (B.S. in Electrical Engineering, 1948) and at M.I.T. (Ph.D. in Mathematics, 1953), following Service in the Navy during World War II. His 38-year academie career began at Georgia Tech (1953-1961) and ended at the mathematics department at the University of Wisconsin - Madison (1961-1991). At Wisconsin he guided ten students to their Ph.D.s, wrote most of his more than 80 research papers, co-authored or co-edited twelve books, served as department chair (1968-1970), as director of the Mathematics Research Center (1979-1987), and as the founding Director of the Center for the Mathematical Sciences (1967- 1990). He was a member of the Human Rights Committee for Mathematicians since 1977 and served as its chairman from 1979-1981. $ $ $ ZDENEK ELIAS (1920-2000) Zdenek A. Elias died on February 2, 2000. He was a native of Dvůr Králové n/Labem, Czechoslovakia, where he was born on May 28, 1920. He had his classic Czech education but his studies at Charles University were eut short by World War II. He spent the war years in the death 20 [pageend20]camps of Terezin, Auschwitz and Schwarzheide. After the war he returned to Prague, but in 1948 fled again when the communists seized power. After coming to the US in 1949 he joined Rádio Free Europe in its earliest days and for the next 30 years was a broadcast journalist in New York and in Munich, working tirelessly for the liberation of his be- loved Czechoslovakia. Upon his retirement in 1980 he moved to Seattle, WA, which he considered one of the most beautiful places on earth. OSWALD A. HOLZER (1911 2000) Dr. Holzer, 83, died on January 3, 2000, of congestive heart failure, at Věro Beech, Florida, two days after his wife passed away. He was born in Benešov, Czechoslovakia on July 23, 1911 and received his medical degree from Charles University in 1937. He fled to China from Czechoslovakia during the German invasion at the outbreak of World War II where he met his future wife who had returned to China to teach. They married six weeks later in Peking. With the increasing occupation of China by Japan in 1940, they moved to the US. He completed his medical intemship and residency in the US. He was subsequently assigned to American oil fields in Peru and Ecuador by the Wartime Office of Procurement and Assignment for Physicians. In 1948, Dr. Holzer joined the staff of the Florida State Hospital at Chattahoochee. He went into private practice in Melbourne in 1952, and at that time also became a member of the old Brevard Hospital staff. According to his daughter, Joanie Schirm-Neiswender of Orlando, he de- livered over 200 babies in Brevard County in a single year in the 1950's. When he retired in 1974, he founded the Student Health Service at Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne. After donating his salary to the university for 10 years, the student clinic was named in his honor. He was awarded an honoráry Doctor of Science degree by Florida Tech in 1955. Dr. and Mrs. Holzer endowed a chair at Florida Tech in genetic engineering and dedicated it in memory of both their parents. It is called Holzer-Lequear Foundation. This remarkable man will be greatly missed by many of his friends. ¥ W $ Už je tomu víc než deset let, kdy zemřel známý český hlasatel Hlasu Ameriky (VOA) ve Washingtone, politický vězeň a vlastenec, Jaromír Zástěra.
