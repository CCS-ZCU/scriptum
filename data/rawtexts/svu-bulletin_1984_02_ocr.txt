BULLETIN English Supplement to “Zprávy SVU” Vol. V, No. 2 May, 1984 SVU Activities PREPARATIONS FOR THE TWELFTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OCTOBER 26-29, 1984 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO, TORONTO, CANADA Thomas G. Winner, Program Director, reports that the preparations for the Xllth SVU Congress are satisfactorily progressing. So far over 150 papers have been promised for the nineteen planned academic sessions. The strongest sections at this point are Medicine, History, Linguistics and Literature, though this may somewhat change when the final program is compiled. At least one concert, books display, art exhibition and the customary banquet will be parts of the congress. The Royal Hotel York will provide lodgings and conference rooms. The members of the Board are contacting main speakers, selecting additional honorary and founding members, and working on many details that need attention. Dr. Winner is also in charge of the printing of Abstracts. Send him yours if you have not yet done so. Please consult last Bulletin for the names and addresses of the chairpersons/organizers of particular specialties if you need to get in touch with them, or direct the correspondence to: Thomas G. Winner Program Director, Xllth Congress 19 Garden Street Cambridge, MA 02138 A NON-PROFIT CULTURAL ORGANIZATION [pageend1]LOCAL CHAPTERS In Bulletin IV/3, September 1983, we published the directory of eighteen SVU local chapters, with addresses of their secretaries. We are pleased to add two more at this time. The Edmonton Chapter was founded in 1971 but was “dormant” for several years, according to the first President Ivo Moravcik, Chairman of the Department of Economics, University of Alberta. Last fall, Dr. Moravcik was able to “revive” the chapter, and monthly activities were restarted with new enthusiasm. The Secretary is Irena Boulton Department of Comparative Literature University of Alberta Edmonton, Alberta Canada T6G 2H4 ★ On November 26, 1983 the local chapter in Perth, Australia was founded. About thirty Czechs and Slovaks attended the initial meeting and elected Vaclav Vahala, M.D. (ret.); Hana Medlik; Standa Mensik; Mr. Vodesil and Peter Hruby (Senior Lecturer in History and Politics, Western Australian Institute of Technology), as the organizing committee. The first activity on, the same date, was a successful exhibition of multi-media works by sixteen Czechoslovak artists. ★ ★ ★ BIOGRAPHICAL DIRECTORY 1983 Compiled and edited by Eva Rechcigl and Miloslav Rechcigl, Jr. Fifth Edition (Washington, D.C.: Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences, 1983; 193 p.) The Rechcigls did it again. The fifth edition of the Directory - previous issues appeared in 1966, 1969, 1972 and 1978 - is a gold mine of information about SVU (the Czech-Slovak acronym for Společnost pro Vedy a Umeni) and its members. More than half the book is devoted to individual entries on over 1,500 alphabetically listed members: name, occupation, employer, address, telephone, date and place of birth, degrees, fields of competence and recent publications. The members are also classified by subject of specialization and geographic location. There is a listing of about 350 deceased members, including years of birth and death. Bulletin, edited by Zdenka E. Fischmann, Box 134, Corona, CA 91718 Date of issue: May, 1984, Vol. V, No. 2; issued three times a year. Published by: Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences, Inc. Office of Publication: R. Bunza, 75-70 199th Street, Flushing NY 11366 Phone (212) 479-0870. Free to Members. Non-members: $4.00 annually. Single copies $1.50. Second class postage paid in Washington, D.C. and at Flushing, N.Y. 2 [pageend2]In addition to this standard biographical material the directory provides fringe benefits in the form of a description of purposes and scope of the society, its by-laws and organization. The fulfillment of the objectives is documented by a historical review of the 25-year track record. The achievements are impressive: (a) membership fluctuating between 1,300 and 1,600; (b) eleven major bi-annual congresses held in North America, three in Europe and eleven “between congress” meetings; some 1,200 papers presented; film, art and book exhibits arranged; banquets celebrated; (c) eighteen active local chapters spread around the world, programming over 1,500 local activities such as lectures, concerts, theater performances, film showings, exhibitions; (d) SVU publishing sixty books on its own, and sponsoring issuance of another fifteen. Four periodicals carry the SVU name. Two are in Czech and Slovak: bimonthly Zprávy (SVU News) and quarterly Proměny (Metamorphoses). Two are in English: 3-times a year SVU Bulletin and bi-annual KOSMAS, Journal of Czechoslovak and Central European Studies. Frank Meissner, Bethesda, MD ★ In the very first issue of this Bulletin all editions of the SVU Biographical Directory were recommended as the “number one” source to get acquainted with the growth and the history of the Society. The fifth edition continues in the same tradition and adds some refinements. Thus, for example, the chronology of the periodicals, with editors’ periodicity, gives an idea of the dedicated and voluntary contribution of several individuals. The comparison of the foundation and current functioning of the local chapters tells something about the will of many members to pursue the goals of the Society over long periods of time. In the lists of honorary and founding members the indication of the area of distinction or recognition for service is informative. And the special listing of the awardees during the Bicentennial, VUIth World Congress in Washington, D.C., is impressive. The two classifications are especially helpful to identify members by their academic fields and to find SVU representatives in hundreds of locations on all continents. The growing list of deceased members is a reminder of all the irreparable losses the Society has suffered, By the dates of birth, Frank Josef Svoboda (1875-1965, Bohemian born printer, journalist and U.S. Senator from Ohio), Jan Loewenbach (1880-1972, copyright lawyer, writer, dramatist and music critic), Marie Kohn-Herites (1881-1970, concert violinist), and Bedrich Herman (1882-1975, chemistry and poetry) represent the oldest generation. Max Brod (d. 1968, lawyer, writer, journalist, music critic), Arthur John Nohel (d. 1973, analyst, U.S. Department of Defense, and agricultural consultant), Jaroslav Stránský (d. 1973, former Minister of Education in Czechoslovakia and Professor of Penal Law,) and Petr Zenkl (d. 1975, former Mayor of Prague and Vice-Premier of Czechoslovakia) would celebrate their centennial of birth this year. The oldest living member, Andrew Paul Slabey, Protestant minister, born in Slovakia in 1889 died shortly after the directory was compiled. Though we mourn the losses, there has been a recent increase of members, as an Addendum indicates. However, the latest group of some sixty new members, many from European countries, did not make the 3 [pageend3]deadline. Perhaps an additional mimeographed list could be published occasionally, before the next edition of the Directory is due. In any case, they are cordially welcomed by the Society. The last page reprints the resolution, “An Assertion of the Need to Intensify the Pursuit of Free Inquiry and Exchange of Ideas,” which was approved by the general assembly on August 12, 1976. It reiterates the goals of the Society which is “a cultural, nonpartisan and nonprofit organization, dedicated to the principles of free search for truth and knowledge, free contacts among peoples and free dissemination of ideas.” To Eva and Miloslav Rechcigl go our thanks for their dedicated and consistent labor on behalf of SVU.

JOURNAL OF CZECHOSLOVAK AND CENTRAL EUROPEAN STUDIES This English journal of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences (SVU) was started in 1982. Volume 1, Number 1 (Summer 1982) was briefly reviewed in this Bulletin, IV/1. Today we will comment on all three issues that have so far come off the print. Volume 2, Number 1 (Summer 1983) was the last issue prepared by Professor John N. Bradley from the University of Manchester (see Bulletin IV/2) who was the first editor of Kosmas. However, the second volume already was under the editorship of Zdenek Suda from the Pittsburgh University. There are several longer studies that appear serially and should be read consecutively to get the global picture of their contents. Thus Vol. 1, No. 2 brought “A Czech View” by Josef Kalvoda (St. Joseph College) as a counterpart to the prior “Polish View” by M. K. Dziewanowski (University of Wisconsin), in the articles titled “Czechoslovak-Polish Confederation,” which had been proposed in England in 1942 but was never realized. Vladimir Klokocka discussses “Electoral Confrontation Under Socialism” (Part I: “Manifestation Voting;” Part II: “From Monism to Pluralism;” Part III: “Socialist Democracy”) in all three issues; the translation, editorial comments and commentary are by F. M. Barnard. Another serial publication is “Extract from Memoirs” by the late Ladislav Feierabend (1891-1969); the third portion narrates the events of the exile Czechoslovak Government in London, including the 1943 trip of President Eduard Benes to Moscow. Stacey B. Day, M.D., Ph.D., D.Sc. from Cornell University reviews all three volumes of Karel B. Absolon’s The Surgeon’s Surgeon: Theodor Billroth 1829-1894 (1979, 1981) in the Summer and Winter issues of 1982 (see also Bulletin II/l for another review by Miloslav Rechcigl). In addition, Dr. Absolon, SVU Vice-President and a member of the editorial board of Kosmas, contributed with the article “Central-European Surgery in the Fin- de-siecle” to the Winter 1982 issue. 4 [pageend4]Volume 1,2 of Kosmas brought “Letters from Prague 1937” by SVU honorary member H. Gordon Skilling, Professor Emeritus of political science at the University of Toronto. The author continues in Volume 2, 1 with his letters from 1938, evoking the tense but still optimistic atmosphere during the last pre-war summer in the intact Czechoslovak Republic and ending with the reaction of the betrayed nation to the Munich pact. In the very first number, Paul L. Horečky (Library of Congress) introduces the historian who wrote the Chronica Boemorum (Chronicle of the Czech). His name in Latin, German and English is spelled Cosmas — which may seem an error for “cosmos” - while in Czech it takes the form of Kosmas. He was born around the year 1045 and died in 1125. Frantisek Palacky in the 19th century called Kosmas “a virtual Herodotus of his country.” Two modern Czech translations and a German one of his chronicle exist, besides several reprints, mostly of the Latin original. • Piotr S. Wandycz (Yale University) follows “The Polish National Idea m the Nineteenth Century” until the unified Poland gained the independence in 1918. “The Diet of Augsburg of 1530 Revisited: The Dimensions of the Turkish Problem” by Stephen Fischer-Galati (University of Colorado) explains how the existence of non-Christian Turks influenced the religious and political balances between Lutheran Germany, Catholic Austria and directly endangered Hungary. The book Eastern Europe in the 1980’s, edited by Professor Fischer-Galati is briefly reviewed by John Bradley. Radko K. Jansky (Maryville College) explores the early actions of Pope John Paul II in “Karol Wojtyla’s Interpretation of Vaticanum II From the Perspective of Social Sciences.” Literature is represented by William E. Harkins’ (Columbia University) article on “War Stories of Richard Weiner;” Weiner was a Czech writer, today rediscovered as a precursor of surrealism and existentialism, whose first collection of stories, Litice (The Fury), appeared in 1916, a year after he was discharged from military service for a nervous breakdown. Ivan Brychta (Millersville College) made a translation from German of Bertold Brecht’s poem “The Cranes.” And an “Extract from A Married Woman” introduces Hana Demetzova (Yale University, past editor of Zprávy) as a novelist. Rene Wellek (Professor Emeritus, Yale University; past SVU President and SVU honorary member) reviews the German version, Tschechoslowakischer Stukturalismus: Theorie und Geschichte (1981), of Květoslav Chvatik’s book he wrote in Prague between 1975 and 1978, before he managed to get in 1980 to West Germany. The “Two Speeches on Human Rights” apparently were pronounced by Michael Novak (American Enterprise Institute) before the Human Rights Commission in Geneva. Afghanistan, Kampuchea, Chad, Chile, El Salvador and other “hot spots” remind us of the current humanitarian problems in many parts of the world. The not yet mentioned studies in Vol. 1, No. 2, Winter 1982, were the following: “Unexpected Events in Modern Czechoslovak History. A Case For Political Sociology” by Jaroslav Krejci (University of Lancaster) in which the author comments on the Communist electoral success in 1946 and the “Prague Spring” of 1968. John N. Smithin (University of Calgary) explores “Two ‘Contradictions’ in the Economic and Social Development 5 [pageend5]of the Soviet Bloc,” one being the weaknesses and inefficiency of the Soviet-style planned economy and the other the existence of the ruling elite in a supposedly “class-less” society, unwilling to give up their privileges. And Jiri Kolaja (West Virginia University, Morgantown) discusses urban planning hi his essay “Time and Space and Planning.” Kosmas, Vol. 2, No.l has been recently distributed. “The Recognition of the Czechoslovak Government in London” by John W. Bruegel (freelance writer, England) is informative about the complex circumstances surrounding the resignation of President Benes after Munich, his arrival in London and his struggle to establish, at first, a Czechoslovak Provisional Government. A Slovak priest Jozef Ignác Bajza (1755-1836) wrote a satirical novel Rene mládenca príhody a skúsenosti. Henry Anthony Stavan analyzes these “Adventures and Experiences of Master Rene” in an article subtitled “A Slovak Josephine Novel of 1785,” seeing it as a product of the Austrian Enlightenment initiated by the “Toleration-Edict” of Joseph II and connecting it with other novels of that era that basically were inspired by Voltaire’s Candide. “God and Man in Hermann Hfisse’s Demian” demonstrates Helmut W. Ziefle’s (Wheaton College) opinion that literary criticism should examine not only the style, form, language and plot of the analyzed work but also the ethical position of its author. How often do people, after finding you are from Prague, react with “oh, yes - the city of the Holy Child,” even if they get their geography of the country a little mixed up? Msgr. Ludvik Nemec (Rosemont College), in his essay “Infant of Prague,” gives the history of the cult centered around the famous statue, created in Andalusia and brought as a family heirloom to Bohemia in 1556 by Maria Manriquez de Lara. Alexander Tomsky (Weston College, Kent) in his study “Pacem in Terris Between the Church and State in Czechoslovakia” traces the development of the current tensions between the Communist regime and Vatican, through the activities of the “Peace Movement of the Catholic Clergy” created in 1951 and the establishment of Pacem in Terris in 1970. Several short book reviews complement the Kosmas issues. Almost all authors of the Kosmas articles are SVU members. A new International Editorial Board is readied for the next issue. It is still possible to order back numbers to have the journal complete from the first issue on. ASSISTANCE WANTED University of Vienna, 1918 - 1938 I would appreciate hearing from individuals who studied at the University of Vienna during the years 1918 -1938 for a book dealing with the academic life of Vienna between the two World Wars.

Personalia MILIC ČAPEK - 75 Dr. Čapek was born in Třebechovice, Czechoslovakia. He earned his degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Charles University in Prague (1935) and continued his studies at the Sorbonne (1940). His American connection started in 1941 with more studies at the University of Chicago and an instructorship at the University of Iowa. In 1946 he taught physics in Nebraska from where he returned to Czechoslovakia to teach at Palacky University in Olomouc. However, he left Europe again in 1948 and was active in the United States since then. He is Professor Emeritus (Philosophy) of Boston University and currently is a member of the Center for Science and Culture at University of Delaware. His numerous publications reflect his specialization in “pure” philosophy, as well as philosophy of science and of nistory. Among his books are A Key to Czechoslovakia, The Territory of Kladsko (New York, 1946), The Philosophical Impact of Contemporary Physics (Princeton, Van 7 [pageend7]Nostrand, 1961 and 1969) and Bergson and Modern Physics (Dortrecht: Reidel, 1971). He edited The Concept of. Space and Time. Their Structure and their Development (Dortrecht: Reidel, 1976). This year Milic Čapek lectured on “Bergson’s Theory of the Mind-Body Relation” at the Medical Branch of University of Texas at Galveston in February. In March, he read the paper “The Open World of Contemporary Physics” at Claremont, California, and participated at the symposium “Beyond Mechanism” at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana. His latest articles, published during 1983 and 1984, can be found for example in Transactions of C.S. Pierce Society CIX, 2 (“Eternal Recurrence -Once More”); in Abstracts of the 7th International Congress of Logic, Methology and Philosophy of Science at Salzburg, Austria (“The Status of Future Events”), or in Hegei and Sciences, Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Sciences, vol. 64 (“Hegel and Organic Philosophy of Nature”). His “Time-Space rather than Space-Time” appeared in Diogenes, No. 123 (UNESCO, Paris) jointly with the French version of the study. Professor Capek has been SVU member since 1958. He edited, with Karel Hruby, the Society’s T.G. Masaryk in Perspective (see Bulletin III/l, 1982). ■A- A ★ SPECIAL APPOINTMENT Rev. PETER ESTERKA, SVU member, has been recently named to the executive committee of the U.S. Senate Advisory Council on Religious Rights in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, chaired by Sen. Charles H. Percy (R-Illinois). He was born in Dolni Bojanovice in 1935 and escaped from Czechoslovakia in 1957. He studied at the Lateran University in Rome, receiving his S.T.D. in 1967. He teaches theology at St. Catherine College in St. Paul. In 1968 he became a U.S. citizen. ★ ★ ★ .GSLAV G. POLACH - 70 Dr. Polach, expert on international law and international economics, was born on April 20, 1914 in Ostrava. He earned his degree of Doctor Juris in 1938 at Masaryk University in Brno. After Munich the young Czechoslovak patriot went into the underground, helping the military men, especially those from the Air Force, to escape via Poland. Several politicians and prominent cultural personalities also were helped by this organization, and he soon found himself on the Gestapo list. He was sent to Budapest to assist those who tried to join the nucleus of the Czechoslovak Army in France by escaping through Hungary and Yugoslavia. The whole group was arrested in Hungary as spies, but Dr. Polach was released and since 1942 served in the Czechoslovak exile Air Force. After the war he shortly worked in Czechoslovakia but left the country in 1948 and studied in the United States, receiving in 1962 his Ph.D. in Economics from the American University in Washington, D.C., his permanent home city. His career led from the research at Resources for the Future to various appointments with the U.S. Department of Treasury. As Senior International Economist he was mainly involved in international policies 8 [pageend8]regarding energy, commerce between the West and East, and problems of non-military use of atomic energy. In 1976 he worked with the U.S. Presidential Council for Natural Resources, Subcommittee for Nuclear Energy. He also taught economics at University of Maryland. Dr. Polach is the author of numerous publications in his fields of expertise. Among other important studies was his contribution to the book Energy in the World Economy (1971) and his pioneering work Harmonization of the Laws in Western Europe. He was the principal writer of the official report “The Implications of the Iranian Crisis for the World Petroleum Situation” of 1979, and so on. Dr. Polach was one of the founders of SVU, working specifically on the first version of the by-laws and other legal-organizational aspects of the Society. He was a member of the Board in various capacities, one being that of the Chairman of the Publication Committee. He and his wife Eva, retired librarian of the Libary of Congress, initiated the English series of SVU Occasional Papers, editing several during the Bicentennial year. ★ ★ ★ BRANISLAV A. STEFANEK (1923-1983) The sociologist and, for over thirty years, editor of the Radio Free Europe in Munich, Branislav Stefanek tragically died in a car accident on October 2, 1983, shortly before his sixtieth birthday on December 22. He was born in Bratislava and earned his doctoral degree in 1948 at Komenský University in the Slovak capital. He left Czechoslovakia after February ‘48 and joined RFE where he became one of the most respected Slovak language workers. His greatest interest focused on problems of democratic systems, European federalism, relations between Czechs and Slovaks, Masaryk’s humanism, and cultural history of Slovakia. In his democratic orientation he was influenced by his father, Anton Stefanek, sociologist, professor and rector of Komenský University, a close collaborator of T. G. Masaryk in the creation of the Czechoslovak republic and eventually the Minister of Education in Prague. To his father’s memory Branislav Stefanek published a study, “Anton Stefanek, 1877-1977: People and the Nation through the Eyes of a Sociologist” (1977, in German). Besides other literary contributions and frequent lecturing, Branislav Stefanek was the editor of the yearly Slovak issue of Proměny (Metamorphoses). The paper he read at the Third SVU European Conference, August 1983, appeared posthumously in Proměny (21/1, 1984) under the title “O politickej kultuře Cechov and Slovákov” (The Political Culture of the Czechs and the Slovaks). He critically explores the historical differences between the two ethnic groups that joined in 1918 to form the Czechoslovak republic, a state too small to be able to defend its sovereignty against aggressive totalitarian systems. He sees federalism of western democratic nations as a possible guaranty for the future. However; he postulates humanitarian principles, ethical responsibility and respect for the fellow man as the givens for the modern survival of the idea of political liberty. ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ 9 [pageend9]What’s Your Thing? Here is the continuation of “our things” for your interest. We plan to enlarge this section in terms of both categories and information. The Secretary, all officers of the Society and the editor of this Bulletin (all of whose addresses appear on the first page) will be glad to serve as liasons between SVU members and interested readers. Communication is one of our main aims. LITERATURE Max Brod (1884-1968) Centennial In his autobiography, written in 1960, Max Brod (b. May 27, 1884) called himself a polemicist against his will, labelled himself a member of the generation “in spite of all” and declared that all this was due to the influence of his native city, Prague. With a considerable bitterness he said that many of those earlier polemics he had been involved in appeared to him completely pointless after the experiences and tragedies of the Second World War. Nevertheless, he still remembered with nostalgia the special atmosphere of Prague where the past and the present had existed side by side, and where three nations - the Czechs, the Germans, and the Jews -- rubbed elbows during his formative years, creating a cultural ambiance of extraordinary richness and of a very special flavor because of many inherent tensions and conflicts. Personally he found the solution to his identity in Zionism. But being a man of inner conflict, even his Zionism was complicated by his uncompromising pacifism and the “love at a distance” for the ethical and compassionate, humanistic elements of all cultures. He left Czechoslovakia in 1939 on his way to then Palestine and was able to revisit his native city in 1964. As a person, Brod represents the very antithesis of a narrow specialist, being a Middle-European intellectual in the best sense. Though he was by profession a lawyer, he was absorbed by literature, philosophy and the arts since his Gymnasium days. He had that rare capacity for enthusiastic discovery of new spiritual values and an equally enthusiastic desire to share them and to promote them in a very unselfish way. This quality earned him such epithets as “a mediator,” “teacher,” “a chalutz of the spirit,” and similar descriptive evaluations of his unceasing search for permanent cultural values that bind the humanity through love, faith and hope, no matter the temporal conditiqns of strife and hate. Somehow Brod found time and energy to write his own poetry, novels, plays, dramas and several philosophically oriented books, receiving the State Award for Literature in 1930; to be a member of many debating groups at the time when Freud’s and Einstein’s world-shattering ideas were emerging; to study music and philosophy all his life, inclining in the later years to the ethical position of Martin Buber; to be politically active, especially in Czechoslovakia after 1918, on behalf of the Jewish political party; to make possible the posthumous editions of Kafka’s major works 10 [pageend10]which the author wished to have destroyed but Brod saved; to start a new life in Israel when he was 55, working with the famous Habimah Theater in Tel-Aviv, writing and lecturing profusely. Brod wrote in his autobiography that his happiest years ended with the First World War, when he was in his thirties. Those happy times were followed by growingly uneasy twenty years of the Czechoslovak Republic, while the storm clouds gathered. The last thirty years of his life meant the Holocaust, which he witnessed with despair from Palestine, and the birth and struggle for existence of Israel. Peace certainly proved to be the most elusive ideal, sought after by the pacifist Max Brod. While he exclaimed: “By right I do not live anymore. By right I was killed long ago. Everything that happened to me and what I achieved after 1939, I consider it only an extension, a generous gift..his literary and musical output belie his words. Among other difficult tasks, he did make a cautious peace with Europe’s German speaking countries, where his latest books were published and where he visited on lecturing tours by official invitations, restoring contacts with surviving old friends and making new ones. His unexpected death on December 20, 1968 surprised all his admirers. He accepted SVU honorary membership in 1964. ★ ★ ★ LAW It is always interesting to have news about SVU friends who seldom call attention to their accomplishments,, tor whatever reasons‘they have. Angela Kozak-Jira, living in retirement in Santa Barbara, kindly sent a copy of a work described below, with the wish to make it available to students of Slavistics and of women’s position in medieval Bohemia. It is her doctoral dissertation which was awarded the first prize and was published by Charles University in Prague in 1926, under the auspices of the Ministry of Education, the law students association “Vsehrd,” a number of women’s associations and the Czechoslovak League for Peace and Liberty. A special merit of this publication was the author’s incorporation of original, never before used sources. Angela Kozak-Jira reportedly was the first woman in Czechoslovakia who graduated as a Doctor Juris (1923) and later became the first woman public notary in Europe. Her dissertation, written in Czech, carries the title, “Právni postaveni zeny v českem právu zemskem” (The Legal Status of Women in Czech Lands Law). Dr. Jira explains that the Slavic law conceded women more equal rights with men than they had under Roman or Germanic laws. Especially widows or adult daughters who left the home gained complete legal independence and even could become guardians of minor sons or brothers. The chapters discuss such topics as the determination of the coming of age, guardianship, different ways of entering into marriage, dowry and trousseau, widowhood, property laws, rights of inheritance, statutes concerning civil law suits by women and criminal cases of rape or kidnapping, all with a careful documentation. We even find out what kind of personal seals Czech women used. Dr. Jira often uses the archaic terminology of the old laws in the text, achieving a stylistic unity which should interest the linguist. 11 [pageend11]Her husband, Dr. Jaroslav lira, was also a lawyer though he added library science after immigration to this country and worked at the U.S. Library of Congress, Legal Division. Still in Prague, in 1946, he initiated the prosecution of crimes committed by the Soviet military personnel in Czechoslovakia and this led to his dismissal and indictment after February 1948. The family Jira escaped to France, lived in Canada for a year and settled in Washington, D.C. in 1951. Since 1974 Santa Barbara became their retirement home, where Dr. Jaroslav Jira died on April 27, 1983 at the age of 78. SVU lost in him one of the earliest members who was the first Chairperson of the Committee for the by-laws of the Society. ★ ★ ★ SMETANA YEAR All preliminary information about The Smetana Centennial: An International Conference and Festival of Czechoslovak Music, held at San Diego State University on March 29 to April 8, 1984, was included in Bulletin V/1, January 1984. With some minor, last minute adjustments it was successfully carried through, due to the tireless efforts of SVU member Jaroslav Mraček, Professor of Music at SDSU, and his dedicated helpers. The project took three years of planning. The event was recognized by the United States President, Mr. Reagan, who sent the following telegram: Telegram I AM DELIGHTED TO SEND MY BEST WISHES FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE AND FESTIVAL OF CZECHOSLOVAK MUSIC BEING HELD AT SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY TO COMMEMORATE THE CENTENNIAL OF THE DEATH OF BEDŘICH SM.ETA NA .

The lovers of Czech music had the rare opportunity to enjoy many familiar but seldom played works, even if the general public found some of them less accessible. We have to protest, however, about the translation “Smetana means sour cream” in one newspaper article. We certainly know that it is just “cream,” as in creme de la creme, sweet and rich. ★ As if the conference and the concert series were not enough, there was more to the event. A great amount of care was expended on the handsome programs, name tags with Svabinsky’s Smetana portrait, printed Abstracts. The San Diego press published several interviews with Dr. Mraček, the composer Husa, the conductor Berglund, and others. Karel Vrba came from West Germany and filmed the events for TV. The San Diego sculptor Oldřich Rokyta created a bust of Smetana for the centennial. There was an exhibit of Smetana and Czechoslovakia related documents and artifacts. In addition the Historical Society of Carlsbad, California, lent their replica of King Karel IV’s Crown, to be viewed during the conference. The crown was 16 [pageend16]a club project of the Del Norte Gem and Mineral Society to express their recognition of the tie with the original Bohemian Karlsbad (Karlovy Vary). The Czechoslovak Ethnic Day on the campus of SDSU, on the afternoon of April 7, offered typical Czechoslovak music and dances; James C. Opička was the M.C. for this part of the Festival. To be continued. ★★★★★★★ ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★■*■★★ TECHNOLOGY Robotics In connection with the SVU Inter-Congress Conference in Cambridge (see Bulletin IV/3, September 83), whose theme was Robotics, a number of New England newspapers quoted Professor Josef Kalvoda’s conclusions that “Computers Won’t Replace Teachers in Social Sciences.” He acknowledges that computers are extremely helpful for the quantitative and statistical aspects of social sciences and that they allow students to work independently and at their own pace. They also stimulate the research of learning processes. However, the interaction student-teacher is essential in the classroom, as are also books and other printed materials that go beyond the mere storing of information. We wish to add that computers probably will not replace the human mind in other fields either. As Lee Dembart in Los Angeles Times reports, the British international chess master David Levy made a bet in 1968 that he would beat any computer chess machine for the next ten years. He did, and then extended his challenge until 1984. In April, a four-game match in London resulted in the score of: human 4, computer 0. ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ Publications of Interest Maria Bauer, Beyond the Chestnut Trees (Woodstock, N.Y.: The Overlook Press, 1983; 224 pp., $15.95) Once in a while one finds a book that strikes many intellectual and emotional chords, because df complex reasons. Maria Bauer’s book is one of them. It is an autobiography that transcends the individual life and becomes a more universal representation of a historical segment lived by a very particular generation. The story of the Kahler-Bauer family spans the echos of Austria-Hungary, the reality of the Czechoslovak Republic and the forced flight into the safety of the United States, where another reality starts. It is said that one is as many persons as many languages one speaks. We can see how Maria Bauer’s mother’s insistence that her three daughters learn languages “to be at home anywhere in the world” prepared them for life abroad, though she could not have anticipated the vicissitudes of the permanent exile, since 1939, for the whole family. 17 [pageend17]The framework of the book is an ingenious descripion of a seven-day trip to Prague of the Foreign Service Women, some year during the 1970’s. Maria Bauer mostly isolates herself from the happy tourist group and explores her native Prague “in search of the past.” She has no problem with her Czech and manages to find a number of her schoolmates, a former maid and some other acquaintances who bring her up on the fates of other individuals and of the country during the war and at present. The author is very candid and open in her personal reminiscences and the vivid'conversations she has. She experiences some reverse cultural shocks and moments of being almost overcome by her emotions. Yet, the general tone is one of a very realistic, down to earth acceptance of all life brings. There is more humor than bitterness about the change from upper class riches to poor emigrants, and about such things like the fact that the family Svinare castle, where the grandmother lived until she was expelled by a Nazi general, is now a collective farm and the family villa in Prague, Pod Kaštany 18 (Under the Chestnuts, Number 18), was donated to the Soviets after February *48. She finds out that some of her contemporaries died and some have made successful careers. She exorcises some family ghosts and finds answers to old unfinished business. Maria Bauer belongs to the Masaryk’s Republic generation and remembers seeing the President regularly horseride past their house. She was a nineteen-year old student when she became the multilingual guide for the foreign visitors during the still remembered Baroque Art Festival in the summer of 1938 and fell in love with an artist. At that time she also met - in the mansion of the friends Petscheks - her future husband Robert, an antiNazi refugee from Vienna who later accompanied the Kahler family during their adventurous flight from Paris to Portugal where the marriage took place in a refugee camp in July 1940. Her connection with Woodstock, the art colony in a countryside that reminds her of Bohemia, started in 1941. There her mother dedicated herself to sculpture and later to painting, and her father died there in 1951. The magic Overlook Mountain, according to Indian legends, draws back those who have experienced its invigorating “vibes.” (Now we also know the origin of the name of the publishing house that has accepted her book.) Though the Bauers lived in Cincinnati, New York, Washington, D.C., Iran, India, and so on, Woodstock is their haven and permanent home. it is necessary to read the whole book for many more details and associations that are very real to Czechoslovak and other European emigres. To others, Maria Bauer is an interesting, intelligent, educated, mature and brave woman who knows how to survive. She describes herself as having felt like an observer since her childhood and says:- “As an adult - a refugee and later a diplomat’s wife in foreign cultures - I have been a perpetual outsider and now, back in my native city, that feeling of not belonging is with me again.” But during her visit to Prague she also realized: “lam free of my youth, released from the past. Through memory, which is compassionate, I shall relive the good moments with renewed enjoyment and the sad ones will not hurt so much anymore.” On the flight back to New York, Maria Bauer reflects on the pragmatic, workable philosophy of life and the unavoidable aging which comes after the fruitful struggle for existence. She concludes the book with this 18 [pageend18]message: “And the worst fear of all - that of death - loses its edge as mortality becomes a reality, because reality, no matter how harsh, is always easier to bear than the fear of it.” This attitude has served to Maria Bauer, and to many of us, though we perhaps did not formulate it so clearly as she did. ★ ★ ★ The journal East Central Europe has published a special double issue for 1983 entitled The Jewish Question and Other Aspects of Modern Czechoslovakia edited by SVU member Stanley Winters, Professor of History at New Jersey Institute of Technology.

The event is noteworthy for several reasons. It is the first major display of Jewish art to be showcased at the Smithsonian, after which it will travel across the United States for two years. It represents a highly significant and rare cultural exchange from East Europe to the West'. And, most important of all, it will give Americans their first opportunity to learn the fascinating story of Jewish life which has flourished for more than a millenium in Prague, capital of historic Bohemia and now the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, the oldest continuous Jewish community in Europe. The inauguration was surrounded by much publicity and many related events: concerts, receptions, movies, an entire companion exhibit on Image and Reality of Jewish Life in Terezin, lectures, guided visits for special interest groups, advertising in national and local media, Voice of America broadcasts... 19 [pageend19]Most importantly, the exhibit was accompanied by an outstanding catalogue which is the subject of this review. This beautiful catalogue not only describes the extraordinary origins of the Judaica artifacts on display, but also takes us through some of the highlights of the 15 years of tireless and delicate negotiations between a group of dedicated Americans and their colleagues in Czechoslovakia. 1. A Very Personal Review For me, the only survivor of the Meissner clan from Trest, a small town of 5,000 located on the Bohemian-Moravian border, the Precious Legacy brought back many memories. Trest (Triesch in German) had a Jewish community for over 300 years. It was gradually shrinking from about 400 souls in the 1890’s to about 70 souls in the late 1930’s, as opportunities lured members away to jobs in Prague, Vienna, Berlin and even in the United States. About one-fourth of the congregation was associated with the Meissner family. I am one of the 4 or 5 known survivors of the Jewish Community in Trest, simply because in 1939 at age of 16,1 “skipped town” and went to Denmark to work as a farm hand. From Denmark I was scheduled to go to a Kibbutz in Palestine, now Israel. In 1943 I escaped to Sweden, and ended up serving in the Royal Air Force (RAF) in England. That is how I survived World War II. In the meantime my folks, just like the vast majority of Czech and Moravian Jews, were sent to Terezin (Theresienstadt), a transit camp which the Nazis masked as a “model” ghetto for propaganda purposes. I have a collection of some 200 letters and post cards, which my parents sent to me from the Fall 1939 to mid-1944. In Fall 1944 my parents went to the gas chambers in the extermination camp of Auschwitz. These letters describe how - step-by-step - the Germans deprived Jews of basic human rights, how internees of concentration camps struggled to maintain a cultural and religious life, often in secret and at great peril. Over 77,000 Czech Jews were annihilated, either in Terezin or in death camps in the East; of 15,000 children sent to Terezin, only 100 survived. I promised my American born children to translate and edit these letters as part of their Precious Legacy. The Smithsonian exhibit, with its accompanying catalogue, gave me the needed impetus and inspired me to write this review with personal side remarks and an epilogue which enumerates recent measures the Communist regime is taking against the remnants of the Jewish communities in Czechoslovakia. In a way, they are finishing what Hitler failed to do. 2. The Catalogue In this attractive book, a true labor of love, a group of fellow Americans tells us why and how the displayed artifacts were miraculously accumulated and left behind, how they were discovered and what meaning they have. The book is divided into five major chapters, which are filled with numerous paradoxes. , 20 [pageend20]The first major paradox is that what the Nazis intended to be the epilogue to an “extinct race” has now become a link in a long chain of continuity of Jewish Tradition, beauty and faith. In the introduction, S. Dillon Ripley, Secretary of the Smithsonian, and Mark Talisman, the Editor and Vice-Chairman of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council, tell why and how the exhibit came about, and who was actively involved. The subject is sweet and bitter, just like much of the history of the Jewish people. In Bohemia and Moravia, the western provinces of what is now Czechoslovakia, there was a peculiarly morbid twist to the extermination of Jews during World War II. Before transporting their victims to annihilation in concentration camps the Nazis ordered leaders of Jewish congregations to send to the Jewish Museum in Prague all artifacts and sacred objects from their homes and synagogues. These objects were to be the foundation of a “museum to an extinct people,” showing how the Nazis solved, once and for all, the “Jewish question.” They almost succeeded by making six million Jews perish in the Holocaust. Yet, due to a chance 1968 visit to the Jewish Museum in Prague by Charles Vanik, retired Congressman from Ohio, this largest collection of Judaica anywhere has now been made available to the world at large. It took fifteen years and mountains of patience and endurance to put together the unlikely joint venture. The four Czechoslovak partners were Project Judaica, of the Ministry of Culture of the Czech Socialist Republic, the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, the National Committee of the Capital of Prague, and the State Jewish Museum in Prague. Their American counterparts are the Smithsonian Institution Travelling Exhibition Service - SITES; Philip Morris as national corporate sponsor, and the B’nai B’rith Klutznick Museum in Washington, D.C. In the first chapter Linda A. Altschuler (Director of the B’nai B’rith Klutznick Museum) and Anna R. Cohen (U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council) take us back to 1906, the year when Solomon Hugo Lieben, a religion teacher in a Prague high school, set up the Organization for Founding and Maintenance of a Jewish Museum in Prague. Lieben married Stela Kurzweil, daughter of the rabbi in Trest, the reviewer’s hometown. Lieben’s purpose was simple enough: preserve Judaic artifacts from synagogues that have fallen into disuse as Jews moved from rural areas to cities and from provincial towns in Bohemia and Moravia to Vienna, the capital of the mighty Hapsburg Empire, to Prague, to Berlin and other places offering better employment opportunities. Over the next four decades, the collection in the Prague museum grew slowly and became the source of much pride to Czechoslovak Jewry. The unexpected boost came in the early 1940’s. In 1939, the Nazis overran Czechoslovakia. As Jews from 160 local communities in Bohemia and Moravia were deported to concentration and death camps, their possessions of historical or artistic value were shipped to Prague. The Nazis intended to establish a Jewish museum for 21 [pageend21]“research” on the extinct race and propaganda after the war. Several Jewish curators temporarily were spared from death to catalogue and preserve tens of thousands of objects that flooded into Prague. Only one of these scholars survived to tell the story of how the collection of Judaica was accumulated that by 1945 filled eight historic Jewish sites and more than fifty warehouses throughout the city of Prague, which was spared from wartime destruction. In the second chapter, Professor Hillel J. Kieval of Brandeis University, takes us on a millenium tour of the oldest continous Jewish Community in Europe. He describes early persecutions and expulsions, the “golden Middle Age”, bubonic plagues during the Rule of Rudolph II, the making of a modern Jewish community self- government, following the Edict of Toleration in 1781; assimilation by Jews of German cultural patterns; contributions of Jews to socioeconomic development in the 19th century; rapprochement between Slavs and Jews in the early 20th century; a second Golden Age during the first democratic Czechoslovak Republic of 1918-38; the 1942-45 Holocaust; the Socialist Czechoslovak Republic of 1948 and the present. The third and fourth chapters, written by Vivian B. Mann, Curator of the Jewish Museum in New York, analyze such Jewish institutions as the family and home. Ms. Mann shows how through the ages learning, worship and benevolence have been the hallmarks of Jewish community life in Bohemia and Moravia. Individuals assumed these obligations, in private worlds of home and work as well as in the public arenas of synagogues, schools, and communal organizations. The interdependence of sacred tasks is demonstrated in every forum: alms boxes on entrances to synagogues, worship including a component of traditional learning. Ms. Mann demonstrates the richness of the Prague collections, which consisted of ceremonial objects associated with public worship; the great variety of Torah scrolls (the first five books of the Hebrew Bible); the wide range of artifacts from social welfare organizations that assisted the poor, cared for the sick, the orphaned and the bereaved. Several exhibits relate to activities of the unique Jewish Burial Society (Chevra Kadisha) of Prague, which rendered “technical assistance” to other similar entities that were being set up in other parts of the Western World. Jewish homes are shown as settings for daily worship and Sabbath and festival observances, as well as continuous celebrations of divine Providence. Events in the life cycle of a Jew — birth, coming of age, marriage, death - are used as bonds of peoplehood and strengthening of ties to God Almighty. The fifth chapter, written by Linda Altschuler and Anna Cohen, wraps up the entire legacy of tragedy and transcendence. It shows how a religious tradition, that celebrates freedom and sanctifies life, inspired Czech Jews to withstand successive trials and tribulations. Yet, no precedent could have prepared this venerable community for the unparalleled catastrophe of the Holocaust. In 1939, prior to the Nazi occupation, some 118,000 Jews lived in Bohemia and Moravia. 22 [pageend22]Before the deportations began in late 1941, only about one-fourth were able to escape to Palestine or the West. At the end of World War II there were fewer than 10,000 Jews left in Bohemia and Moravia. Over the next 2 years or so, this beautiful book is to accompany the Precious Legacy on its scheduled stopovers: Bass Museum of Art, Miami Beach.

LUERS HONORS PRESIDENT TOMAS G. MASARYK On Wednesday, March 7, William H. Luers, American Ambassador to Czechoslovakia, laid a wreath and delivered brief remarks at the gravesite of Tomas G. Masaryk, the first President of the Czechoslovak Republic, in commemoration of the 134th anniversary of his birth. The 15-minute ceremony in the village of Lany, about 20 miles west of Prague, began at 11:00 AM and was attended by Mrs. Luers, members of the Embassy staff and a group of Czechoslovak citizens, including relatives of the late President. The wreath of red and white carnations bore a ribbon with the dedication “Od amerického lidu” (“From the American people”) in both Czech and English. Following is an English translation of the Ambassador’s remarks: Today we commemorate the birth of President Tomas Garrigue Masaryk one hundred and thirty-four years ago. Few men in history have contributed more to the welfare and enlightenment of their country and the world. His deeply-held faith in democracy and in the ethical basis of politics are convictions that cross national boundaries and inspire peoples everywhere. His achievements in many fields never fail to remind us, Czechoslovaks and Americans, that with knowledge and determination men can bring ideals into life to create a better world. It is with great respect and humility that on this grave I lay a wreath from the American people in the memory of the first President of the Czechoslovak Republic, Tomas Garrigue Masaryk. ★ ★ ★ 23 [pageend23]CZECH CULTURAL TOUR SVU members Mary and Mike Skalicky from Texas will guide a special cultural tour to Czechoslovakia that offers visits to Konopiště and Karlštejn castles, Karlsbad and Marienbad, the church of Kladruby, St. Barbara’s Cathedral in Kutna hora, as well as Tabor and other Southern Bohemia cities, besides the exploration of Prague’s architectural and other treasures.
