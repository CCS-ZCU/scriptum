[pageend1]VESTNIK Pag e -2- The following article is from the Sokol Minnesota "Slovo" - February, 1984 a visit to sokol san francisco By Vic Hubal As long as Betty and I were going to be in the San Francisco area in March anyway, I’d sort of agreed to Sister Joan Sedlaček’s suggestion to visit Sokol San Francisco (San Mateo). For that reason, and because I was interested in catching an activity at another ASO unit, I called and made arrangements for a specific night, but later had to cancel. Having failed on the first try, we decided to gamble a visit on a Saturday afternoon, a time that ordinarily is risky in finding anyone around in most units. Our luck held, however, and we came upon Sister Blanche and Brother Jim Duffey, finishing up some small business, and were graciously shown about the Hall. It's a fine building, purchased from its former tenants (a Russian fraternal society) in 1967 for what has proven to be a real bargain. The Hall includes an attractive, well- maintained interior with ballroom space for the unit’s monthly dances as well as rental income, and below that, an apparatus room for some of the unit's gymnastic programs.

They are the sort of people every unit has had to have, over the years, to lead and inspire. Sister Blanche is a mine of information on her unit, and, among other items, mentioned how, in order to avoid a repetition of a band not showing up for one of their dances, the unit now stores musical instruments in an off-stage room and relies on the old assumption: "Co cech, to Muzicant" - if you get enough Czechoslovaks at a dance, at least half of them can play the instruments. Besides, for Sokol San Francisco, there's always Kamil Skupas, who loves to play at the dance and never misses even though it means he has to fly in from Denver, Colorado where he works for United Airlines. Behind the Hall, there's a large "yard" - big enough for the kind of gymnasium addition the unit could use to make its program ideal, and it's Sokol San Francisco's good fortune to have a considerable amount of money in the bank with which to give serious consideration to moving ahead with this project. Perhaps a number Of years ago one could have assumed unqualified success for a unit so favorably disposed; a unit located in a beautiful climate, having a population of energetic, health-minded people in the surrounding area, some fine leadership, a mortgage-free building, and the space and funds to begin expansion. That ought still be the assumption. But for Sokol San Francisco, and for a lot of other units, a new factor has been added to the equation, the fact that the public Sokol hopes to attract to its membership is not longer structurally what it was 50 or more years ago, and it's a fact that has to be dealt with - the sooner, the better - or a trend already evident will certainly worsen. I refer to an uneasy statistic that is woven into the annual ASO Directory of Units listing which shows that about 12% of the units meet only an average of 5 or fewer times a year. About 32% of all units meet in sites that are other than Sokol Halls or Czechoslovak-American buildings - half of these are members' homes. If these were units planning on an expansive future, the picture would brighten, but, for the most part, they aren't. The tendency to dismiss such evidence as alarmist or devisive, by whomever, will not change the growing reality at the unit levels. Having said this, may I personally add that I still feel there is great hope for the future of the organization. Its principles and goals are the finest in human relationships, its people do not accept adversity by quitting, its long record speaks for itself. But all of these by themselves are not enough unless the kinds of adjustments (and anyone who feels there can be no tampering with the status quo hasn't studied the history of Sokol very thoroughly) needed to move into the year 2000 and beyond are undertaken. Is it possible that instead of asking ourselves: "Will Sokol survive?" we ought to be asking "What requirements are acceptable if Sokol is to survive?" One of the special qualities of participating in membership in the ASO is the feeling of the light, but wise, hand of top leadership. Each unit, because of its unique nature, is given the right to reasonable autonomy. But the present reality of a need to appeal to a society far different than that present many years ago, in this Unit President's opinion, should make consideration of possible solutions one we can't ignore for very long. A^ Big Thank_ You to all of my friends for the many get well cards sent to me during my illness. I am presently doing very well, and will soon be joining you at Sokol. Many thanks from JIM DUFFEY [pageend3]Ju l y-Au g u s t So k o l San Fr an c is c o Věs t n ík Pag e -A WELL, SUMMERTIME is just around the corner again, and soon the kids will be out of school and looking for pastimes to occupy their time. Because of that, now might be a good time to remind motorists to take the time to watch out for kids at play when they drive and parents to take a few accident prevention measures around the house. When all those kids hit the great outdoors for a summer’s fun, they’re going to be riding bikes and skateboards and skates, playing in and near busy streets, forgetting to watch for oncoming cars, wanting to help with the backyard mowing and getting into everything in and around the house. They’re going to be depending on us to help them out, first to watch out for them when they forget to check both ways; and secondly, to give them safety tips that can prevent accidents from happening. So let’s look at some of summer’s activities now, and figure out some ways to minimize mishaps. BICYCLES. Did you know that more bicycles than automobiles are purchased each year in the United States and that more than 85 million adults and children will be riding them? Did you know that seven out of ten bike riders are aged five to 16, and that one fatality occurs every 11 hours, with four injuries an hour? Those are the facts, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) which keeps tabs on injuries and deaths being reported to emergency rooms across the country each year. And the statistics keep mounting, as “pedal power” sweeps America onto wheels for transportation, recreation, exercise and sheer enjoyment. The young, in particular, lack the experience and concern for safety so necessary to their own self-protection. The following safety tips should be imbedded firmly in any youngster’s mind before he or she is allowed to take off alone on wheels. Helping your children learn, remember and follow them, could save a life. • Ride single file near the curb with the flow of car traffic. (Children should not ride in traffic until they can understand and obey traffic rules such as stopping, caution and yield.) • Don’t ride double; that’s how accidents happen. • Signal for turns to let drivers know what you’re doing. * Walk the bike across SUMMERTIME SAFETY intersections, with the traffic light if there is one. Avoid congested intersections and heavy or high speed traffic whenever possible. • No horseplay. ® Avoid riding in wet weather, when visibility is a problem and tires tend to skid. • Keep all parts of your bike properly adjusted and in good operating condition. This includes brakes, tires, wheels and other equipment. • Finally, be alert to surface conditions. Sewer grates, potholes, and rocks can easily throw even skilled drivers. Drive slowly enough to avoid unexpected obstacles such as car doors suddenly opening or cars backing out of driveways or parking lots. SKATEBOARDS. As skateboards have grown in popularity, so too have the number of accidents attributed to them. CPSC has found, however, that most accidents are caused by the riders, not by faulty equipment. Of a projected 375,000 accidents each year, only about one to two percent will be the result of equipment failure. So kids have to be urged to use a little extra caution. • Using the boards away from heavy traffic areas is one good idea, as is going to a special skateboard park to ride. • Protective gear such as helmets, kneepads and elbow guards can minimize the risks and prevent most injuries. • Hotdogging should be discouraged to cut down on serious injuries that can and do occur. PLAYGROUNDS & PLAY EQUIPMENT. CPSC estimates that more than 100,000 people are treated annually in hospital emergency rooms for injuries associated with playground equipment, including some deaths. [pageend4]Ju l y-Au g us t So k o l San Fr an c is c o Věs t n ík Pag e-5 While older children may be able to fool around with little risk, they should be reminded that whatever smaller children see them do, they will try. Encourage your children to follow these safety tips on and around playground equipment: • No roughhousing around the equipment; no shoving, pushing or fighting. • Sit in the center of a swing. • Don’t twist the swing chains and never swing empty seats or walk in front of moving swings. • Never walk up the slide from the front. • Don’t slide down the sliding board on your stomach or back, but always sit straight up with your feet out in front. • Young children should always be supervised when using playground equipment. When purchasing playground equipment for home use, make sure there are clear, detailed instructions for assembly included. Equipment should be stable and come with anchoring devices to hold it firmly in the ground. Cap exposed screws or bolts. Avoid equipment with open-ended hooks, particularly “S” hooks; moving parts that could pinch or crush fingers; sharp edges or rough surfaces or rings with a diameter of more than five inches but less than 10 inches, since they may sometimes entrap children’s heads. For children, a playground is anywhere—at school, down the block, at a friend’s house, or in the backyard. Since adults can’t always be around to assist children to learn playground safety behavior, it’s important to select the right equipment, install and maintain it correctly and consistently, and most importantly, show and remind children how to use it safely. Likewise, toys and games, sports equipment and swimming pools, all summer favorites with kids, must be selected and used with proper safety precautions to prevent accidents. POWER MOWERS. As the grass creeps higher each week during the summer, many parents are tempted to let Junior or Sis take over the yard chores. Keep in mind, though, some important safety tips that can be applied to any mower operator, child or adult. Mowers can be dangerous, accounting for more than 51,000 accidents every year. Besides cutting grass, rotary power mowers also cut fingers and toes with high speed blades that can also propel objects through the air with flesh-piercing velocity. Hot exposed mufflers on power mowers can burn unwary users; gasoline used in power mowers can result in fires or explosions, and electricity (which some mowers use) shocks—sometimes fatally. There are two facets to mower safety: Before Mowing: • Know your mower, its operations, hazards and safety features. • Make sure electric mowers are properly grounded with 3-wire cord plugged into grounded 3-wire outlet. Examine cords for cuts and fraying to prevent shocks. • Fuel up before starting—out of doors. Wipe up gas spills. • Wear sturdy shoes and close fitting clothes. • Never allow young children to operate equipment and keep them clear of the area during the time you’re mowing. • Rake lawn to clear it of wires, cans, stones, sticks and other debris. • Avoid mowing wet grass. While Operating • Brace yourself and mower while starting. • Mow at lowest speed possible. • Keep hands and feet clear of mower blade housing and attempt to unclog discharge chutes only after mower is shut down and blade stops. • Avoid pulling mower toward you. With a walk-behind power mower, mow across a steep slope—never up and down. • Make sure operator and those in yard stay clear of mower’s discharge at all times. • Never leave a running mower unattended; shut it down when crossing gravel driveways or emptying grass catcher. PESTICIDES AROUND THE HOUSE. With kids and pets running in and out of the house all summer long, vigilance has to be the key if household poisoning accidents are to be averted. There are many things in every home young fingers will try to explore: the charcoal starter fluid left down by the barbeque grill, the gasoline you use to start the mower, and all those pesticides and chemicals you have around to kill the bugs on the roses, the dandelions in the grass, and the ants and other creepy-crawlies that seem to be trying to invade the house en masse. They are effective and useful products that make our lives easier, but they are also poisons! Several steps can help you minimize the risks involved in their use. • First, take the extra time and effort required to follow proper safety measures when buying, storing or applying pesticides and disposing of leftover chemicals or empty containers. • Put them away as soon as you bring them home and immediately after each use, to avoid accidents, which are frequent and especially prevalent among children under age five. Usually poisoning accidents in this age group occur because of parental carelessness. • A locked cabinet in a well-ventilated utility area is the best place to store pesticides and the only reasonably safe place. • Exert caution when using them. Wear protective clothing; clear children, pets and their toys from the area before use; follow label instructions; avoid overapplication when treating the lawn, shrubs or garden, since the excess run-off or seepage may contaminate water supplies, leave harmful residues on your vegetables and fruits grown in the garden or damage your plants. After using them, dispose of containers carefully and safely and wash well to remove any residue of the substances from your body. GLASS WINDOWS AND DOORS. You’ll probably hear those doors slam a million times before the summer is over and the kids are back to school. Make sure all of those popular glass patio sliding doors or windows you might have display decals or ornamentation on them to remind your youngsters (and you) that the glass is there. That simple step could prevent a serious accident one day. You also can put furniture or planter boxes in front of the glass to discourage kids from running through the area and remove scatter rugs in nearby areas to prevent accidental trips and falls. When you need to replace the glass, plastic or safety glass are the best solutions. Safety is a no-nonsense business, whether it’s teaching your child bike safety, watching out for youngsters when you’re driving, or doing lawn and garden work without poisoning or maiming yourself or others. Finally, remember that kids forget! So it’s necessary to remind them often of household rules on safety. Once you think they have the basics down pat, take time to observe them in action whether it’s riding a bike or careening down the sidewalk on a skateboard; then tell them again. It’ll be a better summer for everyone if it’s a safety-conscious one.
