A number of abstracts of the papers have arrived. Anybody wishing his/her abstract to be published should send- it to her by the end of June, as the abstracts go into print in July. Details about the Congress will be announced later. This seems to be an opportune moment to introduce Zdenka Pospisil. She came to the United States from her native Czechoslovakia in 1949 and became a citizen in 1954. She majored in art at the University of Oregon (B.A. 1951 and M.S. in Art Education 1952). She wrote on Kwoma Sculptures for her M.A. in History of Art at Yale and earned a Ph.D. there in 1972 with a dissertation entitled Tyrolese Wrought-Iron Crosses, a study of the stylistic aspects of a provincial art form. She is currently reworking her dissertation for publication. Dr. Pospisil has been a recipient of several honors and grants. She has made several study tours to Europe and Africa and done research on the Hopi Indian Reservation, in Austria and Northern Italy. She has presented papers at various international congresses on African primitive art and Central European and Mediterranean architecture and has taught these specializations at the Southern Connecticut State College since 1963. She also taught Czech at Yale for a year (1965-66). She is a member of A NON-PROFIT CULTURAL ORGANIZATION [pageend1]African Studies Association, Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, and several other professional organizations besides SVU. We thank her for accepting the time-consuming task of organizing the scholarly program of the Eleventh SVU Congress.

Getting, Jr. -- SVU Vice-President Milan P. Getting is an American-born Slovak. His father was an important Sokol organizer, editor of Slovak Sokol (Slovensky Sokol), and promoter of Czecho-Slovak cooperation. After the creation of the independent, Czechoslovak Republic in 1918 he was a press officer in Bratislava, the press attache at the Czechoslovak Embassy in Washington, D.C., and consul in Pittsburgh. His son was born on November 19, 1908 in Pittsburgh. He studied electrical engineering at the University of Pittsburgh, graduating in 1931 with a B.S. He started to work with the Allis-Chalmers Company while a student, and eventually became one of its directors. His work in the field of electrical engineering has taken him all over the United States and abroad as well. He has a string of patents to his credit. After his retirement in 1972 he has continued to work as a consultant. He belongs to several Greek letter fraternities and has been active since 1942 in the Calvinist Council of Elders in Bethlehem, PA. Like both his parents, Mr. Getting has been involved in ethnic activities at the University of Pittsburgh, American Service Institute and in organizations helping Czechoslovak refugees. He was elected Vice-President of SVU for 1981 and 1982. *** ZEF Henry Kucera — SVU Vice-President Henry (Jindřich) Kucera was born on February 15, 1925 in Trebarove, Czechoslovakia. He studied Slavic Languages and Philosophy at Charles University, Prague, and was very active in democratic student organizations. For this reason he was expelled from the university in 1948 and left his country. He received a scholarship to Harvard University in 1949 and earned a doctorate in Slavic Languages and Linguistics in 1952. After short stints at the Harvard Russian Research Center and at the University of Florida he moved to Brown University in Providence, R.I., where he has been a member of the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures since 1955.

His son said Pospisil was caught trying to hand food through a barbed wire fence to Jewish friends. The septum of Pospisil’s nose was perforated, a ring inserted like the. ring in the nose of a bull, and - so the son has been told — the Jewish doctor who was receiving the food was forced to drag Pospisil, who wore a placard stating in German, “I am a friend of Jews” while non-Jewish prisoners spat upon him. The son said Pospisil was hospitalized at Buchenwald after being tortured another time, and later survived a confrontation with a general who betrayed him to the Gestapo as an organizer of the underground. With the help of a friendly Gestapo agent and forged papers, he obtained transfer to Olomouc and eventually was released to a type of house arrest. In Olomouc, Pospisil teamed with Leopold Brane, a Gestapo agent working with the underground, to help save the lives of Jews and others, including Pospisil’s son. “I was accused and arrested twice by the Gestapo and he saved my life, too,” the son said. Pospisil refused to join the Communist Party in 1944, and after some brushes with Communists, Pospisil became a leading figure against the party after the war, the son said. When the Communists seized power in 1948, Pospisil was arrested again, but he escaped to West Germany, where he worked with American military intelligence before coming to Eugene (1951). Pospisil’s wife and his son Leo also escaped at separate times, but another son, Lubomir, was trapped in Czechoslovakia, where he died in 1965. In Oregon Pospisil taught German language classes and worked on a Master’s degree in political science, which he received in 1956. ★ ★ ★ “Tajemství Macochy” (The Secret of Macocha Cave), the world’s first speleological documentary film with sound, was completed in 1934 in Czechoslovakia and premiered in Brno. It concerns the studies of Prof. Karel Absolon and his associates in the Moravian Karst. He and his research team were caught in action by the cameraman O. Zika. The first part concentrates on their research between 1909 and 1913; the second part documents explorations between 1920 and 1933. The narration is in Czech, with German subtitles. Emil Coufalik of London, James Hedges of Pennsylvania, and the late Otto Ondroušek have recently published a report (NSS Bulletin 44:3-5, January 1982) on the film, which was shown on the occasion of the celebration of the centenary of the birth of Karel Absolon, speleologist (1877-1960) and in memory of the film director Josef Lachman (d. 1948), who was Absolon’s friend and the creative force behind the film. Hedges and Coufalik have also coauthored an article on the “Karel Absolon Centenary” (NSS Bulletin 39:3-8). The film offers views of the Macocha Cave and other caves .and subterranean rivers and shows human and animal bones, stone age artifacts, and other anthropological finds. Demonstrations of exploration methods and equipment also figure in the film, a fine record of Absolon’s approach to speleology and the secrets of caves. ZEF ★ ★ ★ 3 [pageend3]When the Los Angeles Chapter celebrated his 70th birthday last year, he expressed his life philosophy-with the following quote from the poem The Plague Monument by Jaroslav Seifert (New York: SVU Press, 1980; pp. 46 and 47 of the bilingual edition). To nejhorsi mam za sebou - rikam si -, jsem uz star. To nejhorsi mam pred sebou, jeste ziji. Ale kdybyste mermomocí chtěli vedet, byl jsem stasten. Někdy cely den, někdy cele hodiny, někdy jen par minut. To štaci. The worst is behind me - I tell myself - I’m already old. The worst is yet to come, I’m still alive. But if you must know, I was happy. Sometimes a whole day, sometimes a whole hour, Sometimes only a few minutes. That’s enough. (English translation by Lynn Coffin) ZEF ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ What’s Your Thing? Here is the continuation of “our things” for your interest. We plan to enlarge this section in terms of both categories and information. The Secretary, all officers of the Society and the editors of this Bulletin (all of whose addresses appear on the first page) will be glad to serve as liaisons between SVU members and interested readers. Communication is one of our main aims. SOCIOLOGY Joseph S. Roucek - 80 Among SVU members of long standing we find personalities who have contributed in many varied ways to the cultural milieu of their country of choice. One of them is Professor Joseph S. Roucek, a sociologist with an interest in international relations, political geography, history, education, and the problems of minorities. His published oeuvre amply documents the breadth of his knowledge. Joseph Roucek was born on September 20, 1902 in Slany near Prague. After coming to this country in 1921 he studied at Occidental College, Los Angeles (B.A. 1925), the University of California and New York University (Ph.D. 1927; M.A. 1937). He became an American citizen in 1927. His teaching career at several colleges and universities centered mainly on sociology and political science. The University of Bridgeport was his academic home for many years, but he retired in 1972 from CUNY where he had taught since 1967. Dr. Roucek has dedicated much of his energy to lecturing all over the world, and not always on dry scholarly topics. With his wife, an authority on the folk music and peasant arts of Czechoslovakia and the Balkans, “The Rouceks” traveled with programs offering, for example, a talk with slides on “Czechoslovakia, Its Glory, Its Romance, and Its Tragedy” by Dr. Roucek and a lecture on native arts by Mrs. Roucek, while both joined forces in Czechoslovak folksongs. Music, indeed, is another of Dr. Roucek’s talents. No wonder Professor Don Martindale of the University of Minnesota published a biographical appreciation of Dr. Roucek under the title “King of the Hoboes: Portrait of an International Cultural Workman” (International Journal of Contemporary Sociology, Vol. 16, 4 [pageend4]No. 1-2, January-April, 1979, pp. 222-242). No wonder Dr. Roucek expounded thoughts on the academic environment in The Hidden Professoriate (ed. Arthur S. Wilke, 1979) under the title “Authoritarianism and Permissiveness in American Higher Education: A Memoir” using the pseudonym Joseph S. Pilgrim. He sets up two models, the Utopian and the Cosmopolitan university, and finds serious faults with each, raising many questions about the quality of teaching in the United States. His bibliography is extensive. Dr. Roucek has authored, coauthored, contributed to, and edited more than a hundred books and has had countless articles published in a variety of learned periodicals, often in translation. His work on many international journals and encyclopedias in the fields of sociology, education, social sciences and so on has helped to earn him the office of International President of Delta Tau Kappa, the International Social Science Honor Society, which he has held for years. To give the reader a feeling for the scope of Dr. Roucek’s activities and interests, we mention a few of the publications carrying his name in various capacities: Contemporary Roumania and her Problems (1932); Balkan Politics (1948); Contemporary Sociology (ed., 1958); The Unusual Child (ed., 1962); with Kenneth Lottich, Behind the Iron Curtain which received the ACEN (Assembly of Captive European Nations) Book Award for July 1965; Czechs and Slovaks in America (1967); Social Control for the 1980’s: A Handbook for Order in a Democratic Society (ed., 1978). We wish the best to Dr. Roucek, SVU member and assiduous cultural worker, on his eightieth birthday. ZEF ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ MODERN HISTORY Hlas Ameriky -Saigon (Voice of America - Saigon) by Vladimir Fleischer (Toronto: 68 Publishers, 1980; 380 p., $10.00) This book by a Foreign Service Officer and former Voice of America staff member represents a substantial contribution to the fast growing literature about the Vietnam trauma. It begins with a perceptive foreword by Douglas Pike, since February 1981 Director of the Center for Southeast Asian Studies at the University of California, and Fleischer’s former colleague in Saigon, and continues with a short account of how the author was suddenly transferred from the U.S. Embassy in India to Vietnam. Then comes the core of the book, edited transcripts of some 300 broadcasts made by the author for the VOA to Czechoslovakia covering the years 1967-74. They form a fascinating diary of attempts at partially offsetting the Communist propaganda message beamed to people behind the Iron Curtain. The menu of topics covers an enormous spectrum of life and death in Vietnam: agriculture, agrarian reform, university, elections, deserters on both sides of the fence, press conferences, reactions to the 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, TET offensive, Kissinger’s shuttle diplomacy, terror against civilians, mass graves, body counts, military reporting... Fleischer sums upthelesson of this information battle by noting that the Vietnamese war differed from other wars in only one respect: for the first time TV cameras brought all the horrors into our homes in color. The sustained display of horrors could not offset the information about the many solid achievements made in South Vietnam. In the end public opinion had to turn against its own government, against the policies of four American presidents. [pageend5]Fleischer, a pathological optimist, believes that the Vietnamese War will enter history not as a lost war but one of the lost battles in the struggle against Communism. I hope and pray he proves right. The timing of publication of this volume is near perfect: it arrives in the midst of the controversies raised by Charles Wick, Director of the International Communication Agency (ICA), about “sacrificing credibility for propaganda in ICA’s Voice of America broadcasts.” Is there a contradiction between VOA credibility and VOA adherence to the foreign policy goals of the Reagan administration? What are VOA and ICA supposed to be doing? ICA exists (and is supported by taxpayers) to present the point of view of the U.S. government persuasively and effectively through the various media and the personal diplomacy of public affairs officers stationed throughout the world. Its mission cannot be carried out by heavy-handed and unethical means. No one in the Reagan administration said it could. But neither can it be carried out by confusing the origins, methods and goals of VOA with private broadcasting systems. While scanning the transcripts for content, one also inevitably comes to suspect that one issue Fleischer wants to debate is whether VOA should engage in propaganda. Since propaganda is a concept that has been discredited, let me remind readers that it is a rather innocent word: it simply means “what should be disseminated.” I agree with Edmund Demaitre of VOA who notes that there is nothing wrong with propaganda as a means of disseminating ideas, though some propagandists, such as Doctor Goebbels, resorted to questionable methods. All great religious leaders - the prophets of the Old Testament, St. Paul, Buddha, Mohammed, Luther and Calvin -were propagandists. So were such philosophers as Bacon, Voltaire and John Stuart Mill, who sought not only to understand the world but also to change it. If VOA ceases to serve as a vehicle for ideas that should be disseminated, its continuing existence is a waste of the taxpayers’ money. (See: Propaganda or Not?, Washington Post, November 21, 1981, A19). Reading Fleischer’s exceedingly well written vignettes, I was reminded that the Soviet Union expends more resources on international broadcasting than any other nation: $0.7 billion a year on Radio Moscow alone, which broadcasts 2,000 hours weekly in 82 languages over 285 highpowered transmitters. Moscow does not temper its broadcasts; explosive statements and extreme distortions of the truth form the basis of its programming. The Soviets also operate a “semi-official” station, Radio Peace and Progress, which broadcasts more stridently than Radio Moscow, and several “covert” or “liberation” radios such as the Voice of Free Turkey and the well-known National Voice of Iran, which broadcasted inflammatory and radically anti-American material during the hostage crisis. An additional $0.3 billion is spent annually by the Soviets to jam incoming Western broadcasts. Hungary and Romania have not jammed Western broadcasts since the early 1960s; yet, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria - and occasionally even Poland — continue to jam RFE/RL and VOA. The current controversy over the form and substance of ICA’s countervailing activities makes one regret that Fleischer’s excellent case study is written in Czech. It should be promptly translated into English to give a broader spectrum of interested lay persons, patriotic Americans as well as professional historians, access to Fleischer’s core hypothesis: that Vietnam was just a battle in the war on Communism. Reviewed by Frank Meissner ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★óA*AAA*A^A**^**AA [pageend6]The author is very aware of her Czechoslovak roots. Not only did her parents and their close friends speak Czech - especially in emotionally intense moments - and find release in singing Czechoslovak folksongs; they found a Czech babysitter-nurse for Helen - Milena Herben, wife of the journalist Ivan Herben, a founding member of SVU. The Herbens, political non-Jewish exiles, were an important link with the old country while they lived. Her father’s feelings toward the Czechoslovak First Republic were also important. He was a well-known swimmer and water polo player before the Second World War. He represented Czechoslovakia fifty-four times, participating in the Olympic Games in Amsterdam (1928) and Berlin (1936) and in two European swimming championships. He was an officer in the Czechoslovak Army at the time of Munich and shortly was stationed in Terezin before it was transformed into the “model ghetto” and he became a resident on his way to Auschwitz. According to his wishes, the Czechoslovak anthem was played at his funeral. ZEF ★ ★ ★ Benjamin B. Ferencz, Less Than Slaves: Jewish Forced Labor and the Quest for Compensation (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1979, 249 p„ $15.00) This book brings to light a hitherto little explored facet of the Holocaust, namely the problem of compensation or restitution (Wiedergutmachung) for the labor of the Jewish concentration camp inmates. Joseph Borkin in The Crime and Punishment of I.G. Farben (New York: Free Press, 1978) dealt extensively with the use of slave labor at one German company. This volume widens the scope to hundreds, concentrating on such giants as I.G. Farben, Kruppp, BMW, Messerschmidt, Telefunken, Siemens, etc., all of which were in dire need of manpower during World War II. Originally a Hungarian from Romania, Ferencz served as American prosecutor at the Nuremburg trials and then director of the world wide restitution action on behalf of Jewish survivors. His presentation of the painful procedures, the procrastination of officialdom, the remorselessness of the German companies and their lack of humaneness even after the war makes one wonder about the decency of the human race. Even in Goebbels’ words the treatment of the Jews was “quite barbaric.” Most went directly to the gas chambers. Auschwitz commandant Hoess made a competitive sport of it, boasting he could accomodate two thousand people at a time, while Treblinka was limited to two hundred. In the summer of 1944 alone 400,000 Hungarian Jews went “up the chimney.” Yet of the hundreds of thousands of slave laborers, only 14,878 had received a total compensation of 51.0 million DM by the end of 1973 (when the German Mark stood at 36.98C), i.e., a total of roughly seventeen million dollars. About half this amount came from I.G. Farben, ten million DM from Krupp, and seven milion DM from Siemens. The procrastination and haggling that plagued the negotiations more befitted Billingsgate fishmongers than sophisticated technocrats. The head of Dynamite Nobel, millionaire Friedrich Flick, left millions to his heirs, yet gave not a penny in payment for Jewish labor, claiming that his company was “short of cash.” 7 [pageend7]Biographical Questionnaire Mr. Mr».____________________________________________________________ Last Name First Name Middle Name Miss Present Position (e.g. Assoc.

The children’s opera Brundibár (The Bumble-Bee) - libretto by Adolf Hoffmeister, music by Hans Krasa - was one of the most popular and inspiring productions to emerge from the tragic circumstances of the camps. Recently on the Day of Remembrance, April 19, 1982, in conjunction with a Holocaust Memorial Service, the Temple Beth Hillel of North Hollywood presented Brundibár in an English version prepared by Joza Karas and his late wife Milada. Judith Berman, a young musician and member of the Temple, was the director of the Brundibár project and its music director and conductor. Along with many talented coworkers, she put together an impressive performance by the Temple Beth Hillel Religious School children. The younsters sang and acted with enthusiasm, thus honoring the memory of the unfortunate Terezin children of whom only one hundred survived. One of the original singers, Dasha Lewin, was present and was interviewed on local TV. Excerpts of the Temple performance accompanied the interview. Mrs. Lewin, past president of the Los Angeles SVU Chapter, recalled how encouraged she and the other performers felt when they sang about the children’s victory over the evil Brundibár. The evening closed with a Czechoslovak-German film, Brundibár, in which the opera was sung in Czech and survivors connected with the work were interviewed in German, against the background of Terezin. Among them was Adolf Hoffmeister, Jaromir Bor, Rudolf Franěk. The film came from the Yad Vashem Memorial in Jerusalem. ZEF ★ ★ ★ Children of the Holocaust is an important book that has appeared in several new printings since 1979. “Conversations with Sons and Daughters of Survivors” was selected and edited by Helen Epstein, Professor of Journalism at New York University. The book is dedicated to “the memory of my father and for my mother,” both survivors of Terezin, Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen. Kurt Epstein and Franci Solar, nee Rabinek, met after the war in Prague, where Helen was born. After February 1948 the family left for the United States and settled in New York. The author’s own family history is interspersed among the stories of those she interviewed. In fact she interviewed her own parents in 1974, when she became a consultant to the William E. Wiener Oral History Library. Three years later she started to interview the children of survivors for this book. Personally, writing the book meant that she had to open “the iron box inside me” and explore all the hidden, confusing and frightening feelings connected with the fact that her parents survived the Holocaust; professionally, it meant thorough research from which Ms. Epstein draws clinically valid conclusions about the specific atmosphere and unusual interpersonal relationships within the families of survivors. She has contributed not only to the history of the Jewish people but also to the formation of self-help “second generation” groups that are working on resolving the emotional traumata transmitted from parent-survivors to their children and even grandchildren. q [pageend9]KOSMAS Journal of Czechoslovak and Central European Studies vc1. i, No. 1 (June-July 1982), pp. 160 CONTENTS EDITORIAL AVANT PROPOS......................................John F.

After the announcement of the payment at Christmas of 1959 a wave of antisemitic actions swept over Germany; close to seven hundred cases were reported. The book, based on primary sources, is written in a detached, scholarly fashion. Surprisingly the index is sadly deficient, but both author and publisher are to be congratulated for bringing the subject to our attention. Vera Laska Regis College Weston, Massachusetts ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ BOOKS OF INTEREST Geoffrey Moorhouse and Kees VandenBerg: Prague (Amsterdam: Time- Life Books, 1980, pp. 200) Prague is another masterpiece in the successful Time-Life Books series on twenty-five great cities of the world. The cover picture provides a dramatic introduction: the Gothic spires of St. Vitus Cathedral, founded in 1344, pointing skyward above a phalanx of red flags in a May Day parade. It is followed by some 200 pages of text and photographs. The first chapter is called “The Pawn of Europe” and is accompanied by “A Gentle Awakening,” a pictorial essay on Prague in the early morning hours. Then comes “Living from Day to Day” with photographs from the playground of Slapy. Chapters 3 and 4 provide a historical guide to “A Millenium of Changing Fortunes” and what the people of Prague are doing about “Preserving the Magnificent Past,” with another pictorial essay on' the legacies of the Hapsburgs. The fifth chapter deals with the “Grand Devotion to Arts” with an essay on the School for Champions, or the “care and feeding of famous gymnasts.” The closing chapter-analyzes the functioning of society “Under the Communist Yoke.” The authors give superbly shrewd and tragically humorous insights into the little pleasures as well as trials and tribulations that make up the subtle art of day-to-day survival in Czechoslovakia’s capital. Let me give you the flavor of the content by rephrasing and summarizing a few passages on the private entrepreneurship that pervades even a socialist society. One thing that the average Prague resident shares these days with the average Westerner is his determination to make money. But since private enterprise is officially forbidden, it is difficult to gain financial profit legally. The average wage for a skilled person is about 16 crowns ($1.50) an hour. A single pay cheque would not enable him to live at the standard to which most people outside the countries of the Third World have nowadays become accustomed. Public transport and rents are much cheaper than anywhere in the West; yet many foodstuffs and most consumer products are significantly more expensive. Consequently, many Czechs and Slovaks go in for “moonlighting”(»?e/oMc/i); they undertake illegal private work in addition to their official labors. The melouch form of private enterprise, both during and after working hours, is possible because the country faces a chronic labor shortage. This makes it necessary for a large proportion of the city’s women and elderly people to work: over 80% of women of child-bearing age are in full-time 11 [pageend11]employment, and about 9°7o of the labor force are persons who have exceeded the official letirement age. When explaining the slow economic progress, authorities constantly blame lack of manpower. Yet moonlighting contributes to the low productivity of many enterprises because workers take it easy on their regular jobs to save energy for their melouchy. Bribery”, major and minor, is rampant and constitutes another means of boosting incomes. Plumbers, electricians and other skilled workmen --employed, like everyone else, either by the municipality or directly by the State - are supposed to be equally available to anyone who needs them. In reality, it is difficult to have any kind of maintenance or repair work done unless one is willing to pay substantially more than the official rate for a job. Skilled workmen expect to receive a private bonus - in advance --before they even consider performing their functions. It is a common practice to provide a smir (lubricant or “consideration”) for officials if one wants to get on the waiting list for apartments, for appraisers of a deceased’s estate if one needs to have an item undervalued, for examination tutors if one hopes for a succesful outcome to one’s child’s studies. And liquor or a carton of cigarettes reduces the waiting time for socialized medical and dental services in state-run hospitals and outpatient clinics... The visitor to Czechoslovakia will inevitably be exposed to the temptation of black market trading in foreign currency at two to three times the official rate. To be sure, private trafficking in money is highly illegal. Yet in practice the government tolerates it. To lay their hands on at least some of the Western currency, the authorities have created a special mechanism: the large chain of duty-free stores known as Tuzex. Special Tuzex coupons --the sole currency recognized in these stores -- can be obtained only in exchange for foreign currency. Any Czech or Slovak who takes foreign currency into a bank within ten days of acquiring it and exchanges it for Tuzex coupons is covered by an amnesty, with no questions asked. If for any reason a house is searched and foreign currency discovered, there is a harsh penalty for the offense. The range of stock advertised in the Tuzex catalogue is remarkable, even though sloppy administration ensures that some of the advertised items are out of stock. There are first-class Bohemian leather goods and glassware, Spanish wallpaper, Swiss watches, Scottish tweeds, West German sausages, French cars, Italian washing machines, Scandinavian chainsaws... enough to equip a house from top to bottom. In Prague there is even a Tuzex shop specializing in blue jeans with a queue of people waiting at any time of day. Tuzex was initially intended for people who received hard currency from relatives living abroad, including the over 150,000 who left after the Prague Spring of 1968, and the many Czechs and Slovaks who work abroad temporarily. Technicians helping to build a sugar refinery in Syria or a plant in India receive part of their wages in Tuzex coupons. In due course they return as relatively rich men. That is one reason why assignments abroad are much sought after. Another set of potential clients is the ever growing number of two-wage families, who have no legitimate way to spend their “discretional income” in a society that underemphasizes consumerism. They tend to rely on visitors from abroad to help convert their surplus cash into Tuzex coupons. In short, an ever growing cross-section of the population has gained access to Tuzex, a grotesque form of privilege, which is increasingly resented by those who cannot afford it or lack the nerve to accost foreigners. 12 [pageend12]The authorities are embarassed by this manifest inadequacy of the socialist economy; Tuzex stores have discreet signs. To make them too obvious would only increase resentment. Yet more Tuzex shops are being opened simply because that outpost of capitalist enterprise is too good an earner of foreign exchange to be passed over. Furthermore, the Russians have their own network of Tuzex shops under the name of Beriozka (which means “birch tree”). In short, Prague is a bitter-sweet book. Bitter, because its numerous vignettes document the moral depravity and inherent malaise of socialist societies; sweet, because the very same vignettes show how the indomitably rebellious spirit of the Czechs and Slovaks is daily being turned into protest against the regime, paradoxically enough in the free market place. The photographs are an unmitigated pleasure. At $14.00 Prague is a delightful bargain. Reviewed by Dr. Frank Meissner ★ ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ ★ ★ News Received From the Eugene Register-Guard, Eugene, OR, March 17, 1982, p. 2B we have received an obituary under the title “Former Czech Underground Leader Dies at 83,” which we reprint in an abbreviated form. It refers to. Leopold Pospisil, SVU member and father of the current President of the Society, Leopold Jaroslav Pospisil, Professor of Anthropology and Law at Yale. We express sincere sympathy to the Pospisil family. Leopold Pospisil was born on August 21, 1982, in Steinabruckl, Austria, the son of an Austrian national railroad official. He was reared in Olomouc, Czechoslovakia, and was graduated from a local school which combined aspects of high school and college. Pospisil was drafted into the Austrian air force in World War I at age 17 and was shot down while serving in Italy and France. Later, as a civilian, he pioneered glider aerobatics. He received a law degree in 1922 from Charles University in Prague and was married the following year to Ludmila Petriak of Olomouc, where the Pospisils lived until after World War II. Pospisil built a career as a civil and criminal lawyer and became a national officer in Sokol, an organization that combines athletic development with promotion of democratic ideals. He also became president of Zora, Czechoslovakia’s largest manufacturer of candy, chocolate and cookies, where he pioneered profit-sharing by workers by issuing stock to those who merited it. Pospisil’s son said Pospisil Sr., a friend of Eduard Benes, the Czechoslovakian Republic’s second president, was offered Yugoslav citizenship in 1938 after the conference of great powers in Munich in which Czechoslovakia was stripped of its western provinces. “We should have left Czechoslovakia for Yugoslavia, where my father was supposed to organize the Yugoslavian air force to resist the Nazi putsch,” the son said. “That was the plan and it was about to materialize when my father received an order from the president to remain in Czechoslovakia to organize a Czechoslovakian underground.” In 1938-39, Pospisil headed “Center,” the resistance group in the middle of the sausage-shaped country that was able to spirit away more than 100 Czechoslovakian fighter pilots to Poland, where they made their way to Great Britain to fight the German air force in the Battle of Britain. Pospisil was arrested by the Gestapo in the summer of 1939 as an anti-Nazi leader and was taken to the Stepanov temporary concentration camp, then to Dachau and, finally, to Buchenwald. 13 [pageend13]Besides teaching at several other universities in the capacity of visiting professor, Professor Kucera has been a recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Ford Foundation Fellowship, a Howard Foundation Fellowship, a Senior Fellowship of the National Endowment of the Humanities and a scholarship of the American Council of Learned Societies. He has authored or coauthored nine books and textbooks, and contributed mere than 200 articles, essays, and reviews in English and Czech to various publications. He has been a member of SVU for many years and has acted as Vice-Pesident for the period of 1981 and 1982.

He escaped from the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia in October 1939 and was interned in Bratislava for illegal entry into the then autonomous Slovakia only to escape again through Hungary, Yugoslavia and Romania to Turkey. Trying to reach Palestine, he was captured by the British on a Turkish ship and interned for six months in Haifa. In 1941 he entered the Free Czechoslovak Army and saw action at Tobruk. In 1942 he was sent as an officer to England and served at Dunkirk (1944-45). He married Irene Levy in 1944 and in May 1945 they returned to Czechoslovakia.

Box 28317, Tempe, AZ 85282, ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ SUCCESSES OF ARTISTS WITH CZECHOSLOVAK ROOTS Jiri Kylian - Choreographer Jiri Kylian was born on March 21, 1947 in Prague. He began studying at the Prague Conservatory of Music at the age of 15, moved on five years later to the Royal Ballet School in London, and joined the Stuttgart Ballet as a dancer in 1968. He soon discovered a strong interest in choreography, an interest encouraged by the late director of the Stuttgart Ballet, John Cranko (1927-1973). He became the artistic director and principalchoreographer of the Netherlands Dance Theater, a modern dance company, in 1978 and gained considerable recognition throughout Europe and the United States. When choosing music for his ballets, Kylian has paid much attention to Czech composers. Janacek’s Sinfonietta enjoyed a highly successful world premiere on June 9, 1978 during the first Spoleto-USA Festival at Charleston, SC. Kylian then choreographed Janacek’s Glagolitic Mass, which was premiered on June 5, 1979 in Florence. And the world premiere of Martinu’s Field Mass occurred on June 13, 1980 during the Holland Festival at Scheveningend. He has taken all three ballets on tour. He also choreographed Stravinksy’s Symphony of Psalms, Berio’s Dream Dances, Haydn’s Symphony in D, and Schoenberg’s Transfigured Night. His latest ballet, which has been in preparation for a long time, is based on Australian aboriginal music. The company, which has been in existence since 1959, includes many American dancers. Kylian’s dancers are all well trained and very willing to adapt themselves to his choreographically and musically exacting style, which has been described as “a happy mixture of the classical tradition and the modern, basically American vocabulary.” Kylian says that he “would prefer to think he didn’t have a style” as he likes to change from ballet to ballet. Yet little by little his approach to dancing, an approach that treats “man as a part of nature,” is becoming so well known and appreciated that Kylian is called not only the “wonder-boy of European dance” but also “ballet’s brightest hope.” Mikhail Baryshnikov is reported to have said,“Kylian? If we could get him, I’d give him our ballet theater!” And the exigent Los Angeles critic Martin Bernheimer nominated him for his “cheers” for 1980 (Los Angeles Times, December 28, 1980) with these words: 15 [pageend15]CHOREOGRAPHER OF THE YEAR: Jiri Kylian, whose vibrant inventions with the Netherlands Dance Theater reminded us that hmletlc novelty need not look like hand-me-down Balanchine, watered-down Robbins, reheated Tudor, recycled Bejart, or any ungodly permutation of the above. For a lengthy.review of Kylian’s work see, for example, Walter Terry’s “Ballet’s Brightest Hope” in Saturday Review, July 1981. ZEF ★ ★ ★ Charles Biederman - American Abstract Painter Charles (Karel Josef) Biederman wak born on August 23, 1906 in Cleveland of Czech parents. He spoke Czech at home and was shocked when he entered school and found out he did not understand the other ch.ldren. Ever since he has “lived in America as an outsider,” though eventually becoming a highly original and self-willed American artist. He has visited Prague on several occasions and is proud of his heritage. In 1926 he joined a commercial art studio in Chicago and made enough money to study at the Art Institute of Chicago, working as a bus boy or a janitor when low in funds. During the Depression an artistic career appeared an elusive prospect, but he persevered. His abstract style separated him from most of his native colleagues. A one-man show in 1936 at the Pierre Matisse Gallery and a number of other European exhibitions earned him great praise; critics described his work as “vigorous,” “vital” and “brilliant.” In Paris he met many of the most famous artists of the twentieth century, from Picasso -to Mondrian. Returning to New York in 1937, he lived in Chicago again, and in 1941 he setled in Red Wing, MN with his wife Mary, a teacher. He spent almost ten years writing a controversial study entitled Art as the Evolution of Visual Knowledge (1948). His other books are Letters on the New Art (1951), The New Cezanne (1958) and Search for New Arts (1979). Recognition came slowly to Charles Biederman, but his reputation has grown. His 1980 exhibit at the Grace Borgnicht Gallery of New York was a sell-out. A recent issue of Twin Cities magazine (February 1982) has devoted a lengthy article to him by Deanna M. Bendix, with photographs by Glenn Hagen. It is based on a visit to the artist’s studio in Red Wing.
