Respectfully submitted, Helen 'iirphy [pageend2]NOVEMBER, 1983_______________ SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO VESTNIK_________ STRANA - PAGE Continued from last month- President Masaryk, a confirmed admirer of Tyrs, was deeply interested in the Sokol, and took his membership seriously. Immediately after the war the Czechoslovak Sokol Community renewed the old fraternal contacts with the existing Slav Sokol organizations. The Organization of Slav Sokols was revived, but the Russian Sokol was represented in this organization only by foreign-exiled units. The warm friendship between the Czechoslovak Sokol and the Yugoslav Sokol was strengthened and deepened by their common struggle. When the peace conference refused to permit the corridor between the two states, they issued the motto, "We shall build a corridor of Hearts." When the Yugoslav banks because, of existing religious animosity refused to make a loan to the Ljubljana Sokol the Czechoslovak Sokol extended this loan to the tune of one million crowns by means of personal and organizational contributions. A-heavy blow fell upon the Sokol when King Alexander's intervention placed all Yugoslav Sokols subservient to the state government. After soirs painful considerations the modified ugoslav Sokol was accepted in the Association of Slav Sokols. This admission materialized only due tdxhopes and assurances that the arrangement was strictly temporary. This was especially true when there was hope that its present leaders would remain at the head, supporting the belief that they would continue to carry on in the spirit of Tyrs. At the same time friendly contacts were continued between the French and the American Sokol. The organization grew and became stronger and stronger. In 1932, by its Ninth Slet, the Sokol celegrated the one hundredth birthday of Dr.Miroslav Tyrs, but this time without Dr.Scheiner. This outstanding follower of Tyrs under whose leadership the Sokol reached its culminating success, adding basically to the liberation of its country, and gaining for himsalf and the new nation the respect of the civilized world, this noble leader died in January shortly before the Slet. Two years later he was followed in his demise by Jindra Vaniček. These two men were two leaders of the generation, men who had written the most glorious pages of Sokol history. The new generation was stepping forth into very difficult times. The Ninth Slet coincided with the period when the world wide economic crisis culminated in our midst to such an extent that the Sokols were considering postponing the Slet. But once again Sokol determination was victorious. The Slet itself helped to revive the exonomic life and together with several socially- oriented actions of the Czechoslovak Sokol Community it helped to increase employment and reduce poverty. One year after the Ninth Slet Hitler took over in neighboring Germany. The first victim of Nazism was the Lužický (Lausitz) Sokol, which was dissolved immediately after Hitler’s rise to power, and its leading members imprisoned. The Sokol responded to the growing threats from Nazi Germany by increased activity, especially in matters of training for armed and civil defense, both actions carried out in close Continued next page — [pageend3]NOVEMBER, 1983____________ SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO VESTNIK______________ STRANA - PAGE Continued from --- page - cooperation with the army. When the Sokol defense units we re called together in April 1937 aa a review of preparedness and reliability, 530.000 participants responded; the junior girls responded to a total of 98.53%* It was in such a climate that the Tenth Sokol Slet was being held. As a prelude to this event and indication of its mood, arrangements were made for a relay race with 130.000 runners entering. The final preparations for the Slet were interrupted by the occupation of Austria by Hitler, the May mobilization and Henlein's ultimatum. (8) But all' this only strong, thened the Sokol determination to express by the Slet their will to defend themselves, to defend the freedom and independence of their nation. The awareness of the danger and the will to oppose it solidified the Sokol and the nation into one compact unit.A look at the Sokol District in Austria which was forced to march in the Slet parade carrying the despised Haken- kreuz banner, only served to strengthen the defiance and determination so characteristic of the Slet as a whole. This Slet expressed the soul of the nation, its faith and its will. For the entire period that followed, the Slet served as a symbol and source of strength. When the conditions were at their worst, when after Munich there was nowhere a single spark of hope, we were strengthened by the heart-warming memory of the Tenth Slet. We saw again and again our junior girls gymnasts whose ranks did not waver when a thundering gale knocked off the roof over the grand stands close to where they were standing. Nor did they tremble while standing exposed to the icy cloudburst tnat followed. Yes, they were an inspiration carrying out their exhibition of 15.000 without preliminary rehearsal and without a single flaw. We knew that this youth will endure and will not disappoint us, come what may. The Tenth Slet was the most beautiful and most powerful of all preceding Slets. Jules Romaine called this Slet "The divine service of liberty and the mystery of democracy." Within less than three months after Slet came Munich.(9) As a result of this blow the Sokol lost 5^-8 Units and 3 Districts that disappeared completely, and others that were reduced territorially. The Sokol was completely dissolved in Slovakia. In the still remaining territory the activity in the gymnas-j a came almost completely to a halt, and was replaced by social welfare and care for fugitives from the occupied territories, while the majority of the Sokol halls were changed to temporary living quarters. After resolving this problem the most important task of the COS was to raise self-confidence and to turn despair into efforts to secure and protect lives in their crippled land. As a shining ray of hope and joy in these difficult times came the assurance of the Yugoslav brethren who in large numbers offered to help in the defense of our boundaries. To be continued next month — [pageend4]NOVEMBER, 1983 SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO VESTNIK STRANA- PAGE In a recent issue of the S. F. Věstník the minutes reported that Peter Gaffey spoke to us regarding Czech composer Cernohoesky. At that time, he also announced "The Smetana Centennial: An International Conference and Festival of Czechoslovak Music" to be held March 29 - April 8, 1984, at the San Diego State University. It has been suggested that there may be enough interest among our members and other Slavik groups at the Universities in our area to charter a bus. We’d enjoy hearing from any interested parties, as an undertaking of this kind requires a great deal of advanced planning. The trip would not have to include the entire week. We have available the address of the Director of the Department of Music at San Diego who has further information regarding the plans for this gala event. Let us hear from you! This would be a terrific cultural Sokol experience!

At first Rosicky thought that the airplane might have been sabotaged by the Germans, but this suspicion was refuted by all the Czech pilots and by the captured German airman who said that there would not have been enough time to damage the Brandenburg because the Czech occupation of the airfield had been so quick. After a tour of the airfield, Rosicky decided that there was so much valuable material in the warehouse that he would have to extend his stay on the airfield beyond the one night allotted by the Military Command in Prague. Since he did not trust the Volkswehr to refrain from attacking before he could get all this material loaded and shipped out, he wired to Plzen for two armed military groups to guard the airfield and to help with the loading. He then went to the local railroad station and asked the station master to provide him with a train. The station master said that he could not comply because no railway wagons were available. Colonel Rosicky went away but he soon returned with a company of Czech soldiers who occupied the rail station and set up a machine gun at the entrance. The station master soon found the necessary equipment. Meanwhile, reports were coming in that two regiments of the Volkswehr were preparing to attack the Czechs at the airfield. However, on 13 November the train left for Prague without further trouble. Thirteen complete airplanes were brought out by train, as well as three tankcars of oil, two and a half tankcars of petrol, one wireless radio station, an entire technical shop, aircraft tires, a large number of new aircraft engines, tools, a large supply of flying clothes, and seven horses. In addition, ten airplanes were flown from the airfield. Nine of these arrived in Prague: one pilot lost his way and had to make a forced landing in Bavarian territory. The following aircraft are known to have been obtained at Cheb: Brandenburg C-I, Albatros C-I, Loh- ner two-seater, Berg fighter, Phoenix fighter, Albatros D-V, Austrian Avi- atik fighter, and Fokker D-VII. These aircraft and the brave men who bad undertaken the courageous expedition to Cheb, served as the foundation of the new Czechoslovakian Air Force. The airfield -at Cheb would later become the home of a flying school for Czech fighter pilots. [pageend5]NOVEMBER, 1983 SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO VĚSTNÍK s t r a n a -pa c e Do It Yourself Get instruction If your schedule is irregular, choose a sport that’s ready when you are. Though some can be tackled with a how-to book, professional instruction will help make you asafeand skilled competitor. HORSEBACK RIDING- You don't have to own a horse to enjoy one. Trail riding is a delightful pastime, moderr ’ly priced and available in most communities. If you're really interested, take lessons and develop the skills for highly competitive sports on horseback, such as show riding, jumping, hunting, racing, steeplechasing, or polo. JOGGING— Everybody's doing it, but that doesn't mean it's easy. At the very least, begin with a physical examination and some of the many excellent books about running. Get the proper gear and start with modest goals. CROSS-COUNTRY SKIING— This great new sport can be pursued in any climate that produces a modest few inches of snow. Set your own pace—it can be leisurely or athletic. Rental equipment is widely available, so you can try before you buy. SWIMMING— Still the most effective sport for weight loss and general fitness, but it should be puisuedonaregularbasis. if you don't know how. it’s never too late to take swimming lessons, available at most community pools WINDSURFING— An exciting new sport that blends surfing and sailing into an affordable activity that can be enjoyed inland. Instruction and rental equipment are now available in many lakeside resort areas. ARCHERY— Skill is acquired from practice, not strength or endurance, so everyone can participate. Archery can be applied to hunting, target shooting, or as an organized sport through archery associations. Equipment ranges between the modestly priced and the expensive, and it must be properly suited to the archer. Instruction is often available through community education programs. CASTING, BAIT AND FLY— Apply your skills to sport fishing or to target shooting in tournaments. Start with standard equipment and instructions outlined in a variety ot books available from the public library. WEIGHTLIFTING- Can be competitive, but more often used for body-building and recreation by both men and women. Most health clubs, schools, and community sports programs have equipment and instruction available. Try it out before investing in your own gear. SKATING— Don’t let the kids have all the funl Ice and roller skatingare popular exercises for adults, and those who want to make them a sport can readily get instruction tn speed or figure skating. Inexpensive and available everywhere. There are some sports that require instruction because of the physical requirements or special skills involved. Don't let the need for lessons stop you—often that's the best way to really develop an interest. DOWNHILL SKIING— Exhilarating, suitable for all ages, and a great excuse for a vacation if snow doesn't grow in your climate. Instruction and rental equipment are available whereverthere's a ski lift, and competition can be keen if you adopt skiing as your serious sport. FENCING— A bit hard to find, but elegant as always and aggressively competitive. Competition in this beautiful sport begins the first time you pick up a foil, but skill will carry you into highly formalized bouts. Speed and grace are what counts in fencing, not physical size or strength. GYMNASTICS— Your body may creak these days, but it's capable of.more than you think! Join a gymnastics class, start modestly, and watch the flexibility return. Opportunities for adult competition are limited, but it s great exercise and provides personal challenge. HAND-TO-HAND SPORTS— Judo and karate are no longerviewed as just professional sports, but are increasingly enjoyed by both male and female amateurs. Contests of attacking and defending, both are highly competitive and provide good exercise and recreation. DIVING— Adult competition is limited, but don't disregard the challenge of developing an admirable skill. An instructor is needed at first to demonstrate the dives and judge your execution—after that, it’s hard work and practice. [pageend6]NOVEMBER, 1983_____________ SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO VESTNIK__________ STRANA - PAGE 7 Call a Friend Join a Team For sports that require a competitor, it's often best to schedule a regular time with your opponent. You'll both develop skills by playing more often TENNIS— Long overlooked, butnowmakingup for it. tennis is one of our fastest growing sports. The reasons? It's inexpensive, great exercise, very competitive, and available indoorsand out nearly everywhere. Start with modest equipment and someone to teach you. then work your way up. BADMINTON — More than just a backyard game, badminton is as fierce as tennis when properly played. The advantage is that it can be played on a grass court, since the bird doesn't hit the ground. Invest in good equipment, use a lawn roller on the backyard court, and take it seriously' GOLF— The many public golf courses have taken this sport of skill away from the country club and made it available to all. It can be time consuming, and you’ll need a set of clubs, but the investment is worthwhile for this lifetime activity. TABLE TENNIS— A game or a sport, dependingonhow you play it. All that's needed is a table, an opponent, and plenty of practice to convert this basement activity into strenuous competition. You can test your skills at the tournaments often sponsored by community centers. ENCLOSED COURT GAMES— Racquetball. Handball, and Squash provide physical exertion and good competition. The games are easily learned and can be enjoyed even before the players develop real skill. Equipment and court feesare modestly priced. The advantages and rewards of team sports still apply, whatever the age pf the players. Join a team sponsored by your church, community center, or place of employment and join the fun! VOLLEYBALL— Six players are required for this net game that can be leisurely orferocious. All ages are welcome, since players are basically stationary, and the skill is in directing the ball with the hands. BOWLING— Everyone loves to bowl, and the best competition is found in team play. You needn’tbean expert to begin; the skills will develop with practice. BASKETBALL— Familiar and still fun, basketball appeals to everyone. It's a vigorous sport, however, so find teammates of similar ability. BASEBALL— Every community offers a variety of teams for baseball and softball competition. Join one suited to your skills and start practicing! SOCCER- If you’re in good shape orwould like to be, soccer may be just the sport for you. Vigorous and competitive, soccer for adults may be harder to find in your community, but it's worth the search. ROWING- Off the campuses, the sport of rowing is little known. However, it's such excellent exercise and so well suited to all age groups that you may find enough interest to start your own rowing club. You'll need a crew of nine plus alternates to divide the cost of buying and maintaining a racing shell. ICE HOCKEY— Though professional play can be brutal, ice hockey easily adapts to the more leisurely pace of community rinks and ponds. Teams are often formed through community recreation programs, or you can always get an impromptu team together at the skating rink. WATER POLO- lf there's a pool in your backyard, organize your friends into water polo teams for sport and recreation. It's a goal game that involves gettingtheball to the opponent’s goal through the defensive players. Check an encyclopedia of sports for rules. TOUCH FOOTBALL— A backyard favorite, usually played informally with at least six players. Rules call for seven linemen and four backfield men. Touching rather than tackling, is the method used to stop a ball carrier's advancement, so it can be played by mixed age groups of men, women, and children.

ERANCISCO VESTNIK_______ STRANA - PAGE A SUCCESSFUL EVENING — The dinner-dance on October 22, 1983 commemorating the founding of Czechoslovakia was well attended. We had a nice group from the European Singles Club with us for the first time. The program featured Prof. George Svobada from the University of California at Berkeley. He spoke both in Czech and English. He was born in Bratislava and later taught History at Charles University in Prague. "Social Struggles in Bohemia During The 18th Century" was written by Prof. Svoboda. He is at this time, the Slavic Librarian at U. C. Berkeley. Our next feature on the program was Christine Cannata. The dance she performed - The Butterfly Polka - is a dance reserved for Prima of the National Folk Dance Company to perform as her exclusive solo. It is considered one of the most difficult dances to perform. Beautifully done, Christine. Thanks to everyone who donated pastry, and to all who helped to make this event the success that it was.
