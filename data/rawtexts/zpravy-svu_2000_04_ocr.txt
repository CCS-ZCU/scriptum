It is being convened under the aegis of both the Czech and the Slovák Embassies, in close cooperation with the American University where the academie meetings and other activities will be held. As you will find out for yourself, it will be an extraordinary event, featuring speakers from both sides of the Atlantic. With its centrál theme, “Civil Society and Democracy into the New Millennium,” it may very well be the pivotal event of the year 2000 for those interested in the thing Czech or Slovák. Our aim is to look at our society with its pluses and minuses from various angles, with perspective on the future in the new Millennium. Apart from the major themes, the program will comprise numerous discussion panels and symposia, covering practically every aspect of human endeavor from the arts and humanities to sociál and behavioral Sciences, and science and technology, including a series of sessions documenting the Czech and Slovák presence abroad. Following the ceremoniál opening, there will be a speciál plenary session addressed to “Czechs and Slovaks who Made a Difference in the Second Millennium.” In it, leading scholars will discuss the contributions and legacy of such world figures as Hus, Comenius, Mendel, Freud, Dvorak and Masaryk. An innovative feature of the Academie program, which will extend for three full days, is the participation of young people who háve organized five remarkable sessions, one entitled “The Next 100 . . . 1000 Years: The Younger Generation Speaks Out” and four sessions on “New Perspectives in Czech and Slovák Studies.” The Academie Program will be accompanied by exciting sociál and cultural activities, including the US premiere of Josef Topol’s play, “Hour of Love,” two receptions at the Czech and Slovák Embassies, respectively, a banquet-cruise on the Potomac and a bus excursion to Monticello, the residence of President Thomas Jefferson. I would like to thank the organizers for putting together such an out- standing program and for making all the necessary local arrangements to make this Congress a memorable happening. I look forward to seeing my old friends and making acquaintances with our new members and guests, and wish everybody a genuinely good time.
