The most common form of torture is public flogging and the enforcement of a variety of hum- iliating actions ranging from pelting with stones while the victims stand naked, to ma- king them eat excrement. CITING^ EYE-L1T]\1ESS_EVIDENCE_, Lewis said that punishments devised by the Red Chinese masters included live burials, running over with motor vehicles, and the use of prisoners for target practice after marking their chests with black ink. Some rélig- ious adherents were made to work as draught animals for ploughing for the crime of rec- iting their sacred Buddhist prayers. Those who do not dio by torture often choose to commit suicide. (16/TR/FCI) PEKING- ׳ S ״TIBETAN VILLAIN” IN USA (New York/TNA) - When in 1973, Mr. Tenzin N. Tethong was appointed Acting Re- presentative of H.H. the Dalai Lana in New York, there were sone discordant voices in Tibetan circles about his being "too young". He was then in his early twenties. But it secns he has been doing his job quite successfully during the last three years. He conceived the idea of Tibetan folk artists touring Europe and North America, and sue- cessfully negotiated the deal with Konzuka International, who finally sponsored the tour. The recent Chinese protests against what they called the US Government s clear support of the "treasonable activities of Tibetan exiles in the US", brought Mr. Teth- ong and his one-man Tibet Office into the linelight of publicity in the US and the world. THE WASHINGTON POST interviewed the young diplomat: "Yes, I am the bandit, the reactionary, •the traitor". The slight young man smiled enigmatically. The timbre of his heavily-accented voice is soft and he,neither sounds nor looks like a "counter-revolutionary". But, according to the People s Rep- ublic of China, that is what Tenzin Tethong is. Specifically, the Chinese are upset that Tethong is allowed by the United States to run something called "The Tibet Office". Representing the Tibetan exiles, the Office here works to keep Tibetan culture alive and to draw attention to ;;hat it calls China s "brutal suppression" of Tibet in an in- vasion in the 1950's. TIjE_ CHiriESE have accused the US Government of "conniving with and supporting the Tibetan traitors activities in the United States". A Foreign Ministry statement ■ in Peking, said; "Any foreign forces that attempt to make use of the Dalai (Lama) trai- tors to achieve their ulterior objectives are doomed to failure". The Chinese demand- od that the State Department suppress such "treasonable activities", but the United States replied that the Chinese had a lot to learn about the US political system ־,which ..permitted "free expression of political ideas". It all sounds very sinister and there is the impression of a massive organis- ation busy somewhere in a large suite of offices, churning out anti-Chinose propaganda. Actually, the entire operation is handled only by Tethong, alone in his small room in a Manhattan office building. Ho produces a newsletter about developments in Tibet and appeals for funds to help Tibetan refugees and cultural organisations. The office is also responsible for a tour of the United States by a Tibetan song and dance ensemble which was criticised in the Chinese statement. All this strikes Tethong as faintly ironic: "The Chinese have done more to call attention to our cause than anything we have done" - he says. TETHONG S OFFICE - the only American arm of the main India-based Tibetan exile organisation, was first set up ten years ago in Second Avenue, New York, near the Unit- cd Nations. Then, a small, staff of Tibetans petitioned the United Nations for action on Chinese suppression of the Tibetan religion and culture. The United Nations passed resolutions condemning China, but with the admission of the Chinese to the world body two years ago, there was virtually no interest• in pursuing the Tibetan exiles' cause. SENSITIVE: The Chinese are extremely sensitive on the Tibetan issue. Tibet was a quasi-independent, isolated area ruled by the theocracy of the Dalai Lama until the I95OS, when the néw Communist Chinese Government decided to "integrate" the area into the "Nev; China". The Tibetans revolted, and, after an armed uprising in I959 was suppressed by the Chinese army, the Dalai Lama fled the country for exile in India. Nearly 100,000 other Tibetans have since followed... "The Chinese are always touchy about Tibet because they know what they have done" - said Tethong. "After 1959 they saw that brute force would not work., so they tried other methods. Now, it is cultural genocide.

Educated in Indi,an schools, he worked in a number of Tibetan exile organis- ations before coming to the Nov; York office in 1973• "It is very hard for us" - Tethong said. "In Tibet we were all raised in a very communal atmosphere. Now we •are scattered, there are only ten Tibetans in the whole of the US. We work to keep our culture, our language and our country alive. I miss Tibet very much. Our hope is that the present generation of Chinese leaders will soon die and changes will come. Perhaps then something may be worked out. And then we can go home again".

LOST SPONSORSHIP: It originally was sponsored by the National Council of Churches, which ceased doing so in 1971? leaving the Rev. Mr. Hruby to scrounge for backing among individual supporters, which still include the Lutheran World Federation, the United Presbyterian Church and US Orthodox church bodies. "It s difficult", he said. "But thank God, we survive". - He s regularly attacked in the Communist press, as ho was this past summer by "Tribuna" in his native Czechoslovakia where his mother, 89? still lives and whom he hasn t been able to visit since 1949• "I ve always been kept on the run from Hitler, Stalin and their successors", he said. The message he got this week about the firing of the Moscow priest, the Rev. Gleb Yakunin, from his menial job - after being earlier suspended from priestly funct- ion - involved the same priest that co-authored the letter of appeal to the World Coun- cil. Observed the Rev. Mr. Hruby: "The struggle costs". (g .W. Cornell/942/RCDA) USSR: ^.rosÖ0W־ÖRTHÖDOX~PRIESTS DUDKO AND YAKUNIN REM0vĚĎ~EROM OFFICE־־ (New York/FCl) - RCDA - Research Centre for Religion and Human Rights in Closed Societies - in the US, received a message regarding the recent dismissal of two dissident Orthodox priests in Moscow: Rev. Gleb Yakunin and Rev. Dimitri Dudko. This message was received by telephone by the RCDA Press Service s counterpart in Kuesnacht- Zuerich, "Glaube in der 2. Welt". It read: MOSCOjy PRIESTS Gleb Yakunin and Dimitri Dudko have been dismissed. Each of them informed thereof by church wardens of his congregation. Yakunin s letter to the Fifth General Assembly of the World Council of Churches came as a particular surprise to that church gathering in Nairobi and resulted in an intensive conflict of opinion on the position of the Church in the Soviet Union. Dudko was dismissed from his parish in 1974 because of his "discussion hour", with the congregation. The great support the public has shown him led then to his reinstatement as the Pastor of a parish outside the 40-km zone of Moscow. Yakunin was suspended as a priest already in I966 because of his documentation of the situation of the Church. Most recently he served as a church rea- der in a church on the outskirts of Moscow. When the faithful in Rev. Dudko s congregation learned about his dismissal, they protested vigorously. Yakunin s removal proceeded in a quieter manner. Both priests demanded more detailed information. Both were told the same thing, i.e., that it was a natter of an "order from Moscow". (These words describe instructions by the State, not the church authorities.) The summary dismissal puts the priests in financ- ial and legal jeopardy because they can noví be arrested as unemployed (for parasitism).

(London/FCl) - "They Killed Kennedy" * *), by Michael Spearman, is, as the title suggests, an attempt to point to the real killers.., His argument is as follows.: Prior to the assassination, there were many East-West confrontations with Khrushchev and with Mao: over the Chinese invasion of India, over Berlin, above all over the missiles in Cuba, and so on. President Kennedy either called the aggressor s bluff or supported the would-be victims. Whenever he was challenged, he stood firm, so the logical out- come of a confrontation with imperialists of the Kremlin or Peking brand, was tantamount to asking for liquidation. The "They" are then on target. There are points and lines of reasoning there with which one need not agree, but the contents of the book are thought-provoking and worthy of consideration.
