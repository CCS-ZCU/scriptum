Preparations are being made to bring to trial a group of human-rights activists dubbed ”Dr. Jiřina šiklová and Company” in connection with the seizure of ’’contraband” at the Austro-Czechoslovak border last April when the Czechoslovak authorities detained two French nationals and impounded their car. Their car was said to contain ’’special technical systems intended for use for subversive activities and large sums of Western currency to be handed over to Czechoslovak citizens for the purpose of subverting their country.” The ’’large sum” was in fact ^,000 West German marks, and the ’’subversive” material in the car consisted mostly of books and periodicals and a small duplicating machine (Czechoslovak Newsletter, Vol. VI, No. 5/6, 1981, p. 2). In the light of this we are reproducing the full text of a communique issued by the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted (VONS), even though some of its content has been overtaken by more recent events. The communique is a cry from courageous people who are fighting for their natural rights and feel defenseless before a monstrous police machine that is turning the clock back to the darkest days of Stalinism. VONS Communique No. 26^- For at least a year we have observed a progressive hardening of legal and extralegal repression directed against citizens who are active in various spheres of nonconformist activity. Its targets come from an unusually wide spectrum of 1 [pageend1]2 people from every level of society* In this context it should be recalled that last May indictments were handed down against fifteen citizens, eight of whom are still in detention for subversion of the republic and face penalties of imprisonment for three to ten years» In July Jiří Gruntorád was sentenced to four years in jail, and Rudolf Battěk to seven and a half years = At the end of September a Catholic priest, Josef Kordik, and six Moravian Catholics are due to go on trial. Still in detention and awaiting trial are Jan Litomiský, František Lízna and Jaroslav Duka. What characterizes all these cases is complete judicial arbitrariness. Each of them has been charged with criminal acts under some article or other of the Penal Code- There have been increasingly frequent instances of brutal physical violence during interrogation, arbitrary breaking into homes, consecutive periods of 48- hour detention without cause, seizure of personal correspondence, and systematic surveillance by plain-clothes men. Here we mention only some of the most flagrant cases: Zbyněk Beníšek was repeatedly beaten and throttled into unconsciousness; Vlastimil Třešňák was tortured into unconsciousness by being beaten and burned with a cigarette lighter; Petr Pospíchal was beaten three times in the fall of 19^0; Václav Malý was brutally beaten last December. Only last week Karel Freund was viciously beaten under interrogation. This week the police in East Bohemia detained Karel Soukup and Andrej Lukášek, a Catholic priest. Soukup was systematically beaten ,and tortured for four hours in a manner beyond anything we have encountered sc far. We also have information about several other people who were beaten during interrogation but who for understandable reasons are afraid to publicize their experience. The violation of the privacy of the home and 48-hour detentions have become sc commonplace recently that it has become impossible for committed citizens to invite a few friends in without risk. Breaking into homes is usually accompanied by unlawful searches and seizures of property. There is no defense against such acts at the present time. On the contrary, any attempt to point to the unlawfulness @f such acts is answered with cynical derision. We have reason to fear that the police will not be shy about resorting to extreme violence ^nd arbitrariness. Fifteen VONS members are presently under indictment, either in custody or on parole. Eight have gone to live abroad as emigres. Under thes® circumstances it is virtually impossible to arrange meetings of the remaining VONG members. In this situation we do not know whether we shall be able to continue our work or for how long. September 20, 1981 Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted Who Is Jiřina Šiklová? The forthcoming' trial in Prague is being called the ”Dr« Jiřina Siklová and Company’’ case. Dr. šiklová, née Heroldova, was born in Prague on June 17, 1935* Her father was an ophthalmologist, her mother a teacher. She studied history and philosophy at Charles University, Prague, and, like many another innocent and idealistic youngster, joined the communist party when she was 18. After graduation she worked for a while as a teacher, and in i960 became an assistant professor in [pageend2]3 the university’s faculty of philosophy. In after sociology had been restored to respectability, she received the degree of candidate of sciences in sociology. She was active in student associations, especially during the Prague Spring of 1968, when she lectured in West Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Britain. After the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion and the fall of Secretary General Alexander Dubček, Dr. Siklová left the,communist party. She was employed as a cleaning woman in the university library. Later she secured a job in the documentation center of Thomayer Hospital in Prague, where under her maiden name of Jiřina Heroldova she and others published a number of papers on gerontology, social work, and family relations. She was arrested on May 7, 19^1. A creative and idealistic person, Jiřina Šiklová even under the most difficult circumstances has helped others who lost their positions after 1968. She was active in the preparation and distribution of samizdat materials. ’’She helped to spread free culture and information.” According to recent reports, Dr. Šiklová has been beaten and her health has suffered in prison. Rudolf Battěk*s Sentence Reduced A Prague appeals court on October 8 reduced the prison term imposed on Rudolf Battěk by two years. Battik, a sociologist who signed Charter 77 and is a member of VONS, was sentenced on July 28 to seven and a half years in jail on charges of subversion. He is one of Czechoslovakia’s leading human-rights activists, whose prosecution generated many protests in Western Europe and the United States. RELIGION UNDER ATTACK Six persons, including two Catholic priests, were given sentences on September 29 in Olomouc (North Moravia) for the clandestine publication of Catholic literature. A large crowd, including many young people, gathered at the courthouse to catch a glimpse of the Rev. František Lizna and the others as they were brought to trial after a two-year delay. Lizna, who was brought in handcuffs from Litoměřice Prison, 200 miles away, was greeted with cheers. During the trial the prosecution concentrated on the charge of ’’illicit trading” (Art. 118 of the Penal Code) and accusations of ’’embezzlement of socialist property” and acting for gain. In an attempt to mask the denial of basic religious literature to Czechoslovakia’s believers, the prosecution made a point of mentioning titles officially published in the country, such as a children's catechism, a papal encyclical, and the journal Teologický sborník (Theological Review), though only in connection with the price charged for them. The indictment against the defendants claimed that 55 titles had been produced in Olomouc between 1977 and 1979 and that a total of 8,000 copies had been sold. Jan Krumpholc, 54, from whose home police confiscated two truckloads of paper [pageend3]4 and homemade books on September 10, 1979, was given the maximum penalty of three years’ imprisonment. At first accused of making a profit of 6,000 crowns from selling religious literature, Krumpholc was alleged in the verdict to have gained 25,^00 crowns from its sale. Krumpholc served eleven years in labor camps during the 1950s on trumped-up political charges that were quashed during the Prague Spring. Rev. Rudolf Šmahel, 31, was sentenced to two years in jail for ’’contravening currency regulations.” The police had confiscated 5,OCX? West German marks given him by a German priest to help the publishing work. Lizna, *40, Josef Adámek, 6?, and Josef Vlček, 6l, were each sentenced to twenty months in prison. Jan Odstrčil, 57, received a ten-raonth suspended sentence and was fined 5,000 crowns for "embezzling state funds” by supplying the paper, intended for the Olomouc curia, for the production of the illicit religious literature. All the defendants have denied the charges that they were acting for profit and have appealed their sentences. Allowed to make a brief statement after the verdict was handed down, Lizna, a Jesuit, confined himself to thanking those who had given him support in the court and his colleagues in the dock for contributing to the spread of Christian literature in Czechoslovakia. His closing words were: "Christus vincit, Christus regnat” (Christ is the victor, Christ reigns). Police Agent Ordained In an unprecedented act, Julius Gabriš, bishop of Trnava (West Slovakia), who was designated by the Vatican to become the first Slovak primate, refused on September 25 to ordain a Bratislava theological student by the name of Lompart, who was known to have been acting as an agent of the Slovak security police. Despite Gabriš’s refusal, however, Lompart was ordained by Jozef Feranec, bishop of Bánská Bystrica. It is feared that Bishop Feranec was forced to ordain Lompart under pressure from the security police. When Lompart returned to his native village to celebrate his first Mass, angry villagers prevented him from doing so. KNA, the West German Catholic news agency, reported that it was not known whether Lompart had succeeded in his saying his first Mass elsewhere in Slovakia. Czech Primate Intervenes in Jesuit*s Trial As a consequence of a letter from František Tomášek, cardinal archbishop of Prague, Josef Kordik, a 33-year-old Jesuit priest charged with "obstructing state supervision of the church,” was given only a twelve-month suspended sentence by a court in Louny (North Bohemia) on September 28. KNA, the West German Catholic news agency, reported that the cardinal’s letter made it emphatically clear that Kordik had acted within the letter of the law and that the charge of contravening religious regulations was groundless. Observers in Czechoslovakia, according to England’s Keston College, believe only the cardinal’s intervention prevented Kordik from receiving a maximum two-year jail sentence. [pageend4]5 THE PEACE CAMP Western pacifists would shun the conditions considered normal in the ’’peace camp,” the countries dominated by the Soviet Union. In part this would be because many ’’peace” groups are infiltrated by persons under orders from Moscow to foment anti-American and anti-Western attitudes. Criticism is aimed only at democratic Western governments and NATO. Accusations of militarism are made against the United States, which has abolished compulsory military service. In East Germany, on the other hand, the obligatory military education of high school students has been increased* Eleventh-grade students are now required during their vacations to undergo twelve days of military training to acquire ’’the knowledge, ability and skill of a motorized rifle bearer in the national People’s Army,” the Western press has recently reported. In Czechoslovakia, however, military education begins even earlier — in nursery school! Alexander Belan, head of the military education department of the Slovak Ministry of Education, wrote in the August 1980 issue of Učitelské noviny (Teachers* News), the ministry’s journal: ’’Elements of military education are a special chapter in the educational work of nursery schools and kindergartens, where they form part of rational, ethical, esthetic and physical teaching. They must be a part of the daily curriculum, especially in children’s games.” Military education has been introduced as a separate subject in the seventh and eighth grades in the 1981/82 school year ”to strengthen socialist patriotism as well as students’ proletarian and socialist internationalism,” according to a document on the development of the Czechoslovak education system. Military education is thus not only an element in grade-school teaching but also ”an organic component of the educational process in high schools.” Official data on Svazarm, the paramilitary youth cadet corps, in Slovakia show that there are 64,000 boys and girls under 15 in its 2,719 units. A total of 8,200 military ’’mass events” were held in 1980; 83?OOO children under the age of 15 received regular military training, especially on the shooting range. More than 700,000 young people take part in 13,000 to 15,000 military sports events each year, according to Major General Egyd Pepich, chairman of the Slovak Committee for Cooperation with the Army. (Slovakia’s population was 4,988,000 on November 1, 1980.) Such examples of the military training of young people in the ’’peace camp” are of little interest to the West’s pacifists. Yet the Western public should be aware of this so that there should be no repetition of the 1930s and the underestimation of the militarism of Hitler’s Germany. Tanks and weapons alone do not attest to the enormity of communist militarism. We can only warn — in the interests of our own country and in the interests of world peace. Translated from České slovo [Czech Word] (Munich), No. 9 (September 1981) [pageend5]6 DANGERS OF DECADENT ART Distant echoes of Hitler’s crusade against entartete Kunst (decadent art) were to be heard in the words of Vladimir Baskakov, director of the Moscow Institute of Film History and Theory, in a lecture he delivered to the conference on ’’The Screen and Ideological Struggle” in Prague, reported in Záběr CThe Take], No. 7 (August 1981), the biweekly of the Czechoslovak film industry. Baskakov told his listeners: ’’Film is a powerful force in the development of people and also in the deformation of their views. . . . This is why film is so important in the present ideological struggle between the socialist and capitalist worlds, between communist and capitalist culture. ♦ ♦ . It is the obligation of the skilled workers in the film industry to unmask the reactionary remnants of bourgeois mass culture that sometimes reach us in the guise of the attractive films that are so popular with audiences.” ”It is not enough,” he continued, ’’just to write reviews. Systematic analysis in professional magazines is needed to uncover all the tricks and lies that confuse audiences. Reviewers must be alive to all the diverse non-Marxist views and revisionist esthetic concepts that penetrate our films from the bourgeois world. . . . Heightened attention has to be paid to films made in the socialist countries. Theirs is the most dangerous impact. Their revisionism or even antisocialism constitutes the most direct threat to our socialist culture. They smuggle in bourgeois thinking to us. In contrast, some really progressive films made in capitalist countries are critical of the bourgeois system and life style, culture and decadent art.” Film should not be regarded merely as entertainment, Záběr warned. "The use of ’modern’ idioms offers an opportunity for refined bourgeois ideological manipulation of the masses, especially young people who welcome everything new, Tand] for dissemination of bourgeois philosophy, including some extremist ideas of the New Left that are corrupting the unity of the communist movement all over the world." Its final warning was against the "seemingly progressive" bourgeois culture that serves as "an artificial and specious link with socialist culture but that actually creates a new nonconformist, revolutionary art that will not lead to the transformation of the world on a socialist basis." A.C.E.N. PROTEST The representatives of Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Rumania, united in the Assembly of the Captive European Nations (ACEN), convened at a plenary meeting in New York and passed a resolution protesting the attacks which the communist governments of their countries direct against the Polish independent trade union Solidarity- Declaring that the governments imposed by the Soviet Union on the captive [pageend6]7 nations in no way represent their feelings and their wishes, and as true representatives of these nations in the free world, they reject the falsehoods of the communist propaganda and wish to make it clear that all the captive nations, although they cannot freely express their feelings, follow with greatest sympathy and interest the fight waged by Solidarity, seeing in it a harbinger of changes which may bring a better future not only for Poland but also for all the nations under Soviet domination. Hew York, September 22, 1981 NEWS FROM NORMALIZED CZECHOSLOVAKIA Festival of Slovak Radio and Television Plays la a commentary on the Festival of Slovak Radio and Television Plays held in Piešťany (West Slovakia), Nina Hradiska wrote: ’’Ridiculously little attention was paid to language- . . . Czech turns of phrase were used instead of appropriate Slovak expressions, and style was bland. If Slovak radio and television plays are to attain a higher standard, » . . they must become bolder, especially in satire. . . . Arts and sciences do not move forward if there is no experimentation.” Unwelcome American Homage Representatives of the United States embassy in Prague went to Sušice (West Bohemia) on May 6 and laid a wreath on the monument to the liberation of the town by American armed forces in 19^5- Little more than an hour later, despite protests by townspeople, the police removed the wreath, Informace o Chartě 77 (Charter 77 Information), No. 8, 19&1, reported. Ladislav Antes, who served with the Czechoslovak Army units in England during World War II, tried in vain to stop the police action. He and another resident of Sušice, Michal Cernega, wrote to the United States embassy in Prague to complain about the incident. American Commemoration of the Slovak National Uprising Colonel Robert Piper, military attache at the United States embassy in Prague, laid a wreath on the monument to fallen British and American soldiers in Helpa (Central Slovakia) on August 28, the eve of the anniversary of the Slovak National Uprising. Allied armed forces parachuted into territory controlled by members of the Slovak uprising in the fall of 1944 to serve as a liaison with American bases in Italy from which arms and medication were to be flown in. After Nazi troops had crushed the uprising, the Americans and British retreated into the mountains and lived in the village of Helpa, the ancestral home of one of the Americans. On December 26, 1944, fourteen American and British soldiers were captured there by the Germans, who executed them in Mauthausen concentration camp in January 19^5* [pageend7]t 8 Nuclear Power Program The only nuclear power plant presently generating electricity in Czechoslovakia is the one in Jaslovské Bohunice (West Slovakia). Another plant is being built in Dukovany (South Moravia), and the sites for two more are being prepared in Mochovce (West Slovakia) and Temelín (South Bohemia). If all goes according to plan, Czechoslovakia will have a nuclear capacity of 3,500 megawatts by 1985, expected to generate 15,000 megawatts a year, or some 1?-l8 percent of the country’s total consumption. That percentage is due to rise to 38-2+O percent by 1990 (RFE Research, Czechoslovakia/16, August 20, 1981). Railroads Czechoslovakia’s total rail network was 13,1^2 kilometers (8,161 miles) in 1979* Since 1950 only 18 kilometers (11 miles) have been added, although some 500 kilometers (310 miles) of single track have been converted to double track. A total of 2,989 kilometers (1,856 miles) were electrified by 1979* Czechoslovak Railroads in 1980 carried 286 million metric tons (315 million US tons) of freight, close to the system’s present maximum capacity. Further electrification and construction of new lines are bedeviled by insufficient funds. Plans for a new line across the country from Kosice (East Slovakia) through Znojmo (South Moravia) to České Budějovice (South Bohemia) have been shelved indefinitely (RFE Research, Czechoslovakia/16, August 20, 1981).
