The Editors o/Uncaptive Minds mourn the death of Tom Kahn. Kahn devoted his life to the struggle for human rights and democracy. He was also one of the most ardent supporters of Solidarity in the United States. As Assistant to the President and later International Affairs Director of the AFL-CIO, Kahn helped orchestrate Western efforts to sustain the independent union during the bleak years of martial law. Tom Kahn was unstinting in his encouragement to others, and the Editors o/Uncaptive Minds gratefully remember the guidance he gave both the Committee in Support of Solidarity and its successor organization, the Institute for Democracy in Eastern Europe. His death is a sad loss for all. Uncaptive Minds editor Eric Chenoweth remembers Tom Kahn in the following article. [pageend6]THE GALLANT WARRIOR: IN MEMORIAM TOM KAHN When the history of the Cold War is written, its heroes will not be only military men — those whose bravery and strategy usually win wars. Rather, the Cold War's heroes will include the intellectual warriors whose testimony and moral clarity kept alive the simple idea that it was necessary to oppose communism and that by doing so there was hope of freeing hundreds of millions of people from communism's grip. In the West, they were few who carried the banner of anti-communism, who proudly accepted the sobriquet “cold warrior,” and who developed the strategy and tactics for this war of ideas. It is surprising to realize how few there were. The struggle against communism was — and in Asia and Cuba remains — the single greatest and most prolonged human rights struggle of modern history. Only the resistance to Nazism in this century and the abolitionist crusade against slavery in the past century are comparable in moral scope. Yet, it was not so long ago that the intellectual and political elite in the West — the Establishment — scoffed at such moral certitude. There was, to be sure, no doubt as to the necessity of overthrowing the dictatorial regimes of Chile and South Africa, and of using all manner of economic and diplomatic means to that end. But for the Soviet Union, the East Bloc, China, and the dozen other communist countries — countries where victims were counted not in distinct thousands but in the millions — the Establishment seemed prepared to explain, at length, the necessity for accommodation, exchange, trade, investment, peaceful dialogue, and treaties of all sorts. 5 by Eric Chenoweth “We few, we happy few, we band of brothers... ” Shakespeare, Henry V, Act IV, Scene III [pageend7]UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 To advocate a hard line towards communism during the '60s, '70s, and even early '80s required intellectual courage — especially for those on the left of the political spectrum. Tom Kahn had such courage. He was a gallant cold warrior, a man who relished political battle and who never shied from a fight over right and wrong, especially when it came to defending democracy and promoting its spread. Although a polemicist with a rapier tongue, he argued with a style and grace that won the respect of all but the most boorish. And while a man of intellect and brilliance, he shied from the term intellectual. For Tom Kahn, the world of the intelligentsia was too removed from reality. He was a man of action, of engagement in the politics of his time; his was a world where ideas had consequences. Tom Kahn died on March 27, 1992 from AIDS, at the age of 53. Bom in September 1939 into a world on the brink of war, he died, too young, with the Cold War won and the world moving away from the precipice. In an unusual life, he did much to make that happen. 6 Tom Kahn was a committed social democrat to the end. Unlike many who devoted themselves to anti-communism, he began and ended his political career a man on the left, whose political impulses were usually radical. At the core of his beliefs was a commitment to extend the boundaries of democracy and freedom. At a time when most people believed that communism had become a permanent fixture on the world scene, this commitment led him to advocate a policy of actively promoting democratic change in the communist world. He began as a revolutionary socialist in a group called the Independent Socialist League (ISL) led by Max Shachtman. Shachtman was a former leader of the communist and Trotskyist parties who had split from his past associations to become perhaps the most fervid and certainly the most central anticommunist theoretician on the international Left. In a significant contribution to Marxist theory, he described the Soviet Union as a new form of class society, a “bureaucratic collectivist state.” Milovan Djilas, writing from his experience within such a system, would later render a similar judgment in his book The New Class. Max's followers were known as Shachtmanites within the American Left and in various radical circles world-wide. The Shachtmanites were a unique band; they were devoted socialists whose reputation was founded on their ardent anti-communism. In his essay “Max Shachtman: His Ideals and His Movement,” Tom Kahn describes the first time he saw the man who became his mentor: It was shortly after the Hungarian uprising when, at the invitation of some friends, I found myself in a dingy and smoky room packed with several hundred people. [pageend8]t h e g al l an t w ar r io r They fell quiet as the speaker was introduced and moved to the podium — a bald, clean-shaven man who, I remember thinking at the time, looked like Nikita Krushchev....Max had an incredible voice. It was capable of a kind of music — Beethovian. It would sneak up on you in soft whispers, gently threading your uncollected thoughts together, and then burst forth, with powerful resonance, filling up the room and tingling your spine. I still remember the portrait of horror Max painted that night — of rolling Russian tanks, of defenseless Hungarian workers and students fighting back with stones, of a heroic people's crushed hopes, and of our democratic socialist links to those hopes. Freedom, democracy — they were not mere abstractions; they were real and could therefore be destroyed. Communist totalitarianism was not merely a political force, an ideological aberration that could be smashed in debate; it was a monstrous physical force. Democracy was not merely the icing on the socialist cake, it was the cake — or there was no socialism worth fighting for. I do not remember whether that was the night I signed up. But it was the night I became convinced. Tom never lost his conviction that anyone who considered himself on the Left was duty-bound to oppose communism ferociously. The Shachtmanites did not connect communism to the Left — as did many European social democrats and “Third Way” socialists — but rather to the “anti-left.” As Tom described this view, communism was not in any way egalitarian; it was “a reactionary world force” and “a new form of class society even more brutal in its exploitation of the masses than capitalism had been in its most primitive phases.” It was easy for the Right to attack communism, but the Left always faced the problem of defining communism on the political spectrum. Weren't the means of production nationalized and thus socialized? Shachtman's theory of the “bureaucratic collectivist state” cut the Marxian Gordonian knot. As Tom Kahn explained, [Communism] was indeed anti-capitalism: it destroyed private ownership of the means of production. But it was not socialist. Whenever the means of production are nationalized — taken over by the state — the key question becomes: Who owns the state? In communist societies, in which the Party allows no opposition, the state is in effect the property of the Party. The Party and its apparatus thus come to constitute a new ruling class, in Marxian terms, by virtue of their particular relationship to the means of production. Workers cannot exercise social power through ownership of the means of production — they are propertyless. This Marxist anti-communism was not merely a theory. For the Shachtmanites, it was a struggle. And thus anti-communism became their major field of activity. In their intellectual work, particularly in the journals The New International and New America, the Shachtmanites made a major contribution to stripping the communist movement of its intellectual respectability on the Left 7 [pageend9]8 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 Tom Kahn's earliest political engagement was in domestic, not international, affairs, above all in the civil rights movement of the '50s and '60s. Segregation and discrimination were the most salient injustices in America. The struggle for equal rights became the principle field of activity for radicals and liberals alike, and especially for the Shachtmanites, who at that time had joined the respectable Socialist Party in a move towards more mainstream social democratic politics. Tom Kahn and his friends devoted their youth to the struggle for equal rights and opportunities for blacks and other minorities in America. Tom, although slight, often put himself in physical danger as he manned barricades and organized marches, thus risking imprisonment and the hostility of white law enforcement officials. He was one of the few whites to attend the prestigious black institution Howard University, where he participated in the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). In Washington and New York, he helped organize some of the most important battles in the civil rights movement — including the Freedom Rides, the Sit-In Movement of the SNCC, and the Marches for Integrated Schools. The highpoint of Tom's career as a civil rights activist was the 1963 March on Washington, for which he was first assistant to Bayard Rustin, the March's organizer. The March on Washington, which had been conceived by the civil rights and labor leader A. Philip Randolph, was a revolutionary act of non-violence. The March forced passage of the Civil Rights Act and other legislation that began to fulfill the promise of America's democracy for its minority citizens. Today, the March on Washington, particularly Martin Luther King's “I Have a Dream’ ’ oration, is one of the most widely recognized symbols worldwide for the non-violent struggle for democratic rights. For Tom Kahn, the March and the subsequent civil rights victories — notwithstanding the difficulty of achieving equality in practice — reinforced his belief that change was possible through a radical application of democratic principles, an idea he took to his work in promoting democratic institutions and opposing totalitarian regimes. — a respectability that had earlier led such publications as The New Republic and The Nation to support the Moscow purge trials and the Popular Front. In the civil rights movement, Tom had his first significant experience with communists. The American Communist Party sought, both openly and clandestinely, to influence and manipulate the civil rights movement to its own ends, which were generally undemocratic and always in the service of the Soviet Union. [pageend10]t h e g al l an t w ar r io r 9 The American Communist Party was, however, waning fast. In the wake of Krushchev's revelations at the 20th Party Congress and the suppression of the Hungarian Revolution, the American party lost half its membership. But a more significant threat to democratic values was appearing on the horizon. The war in Vietnam and America's engagement in it were to throw the whole country off kilter, giving rise to the New Left. After the '60s, the liberal left would never be the same. The traditional political coalitions built in the New Deal and the early years of the Cold War came apart. The party of Truman became the party of McGovern, 1972's version of Henry Wallace. In this political maelstrom, Tom Kahn was continuously engaged in the war of ideas — ideas of great consequence for American political culture and foreign policy. The key issue for Tom Kahn was the Democratic Party's retreat from anticommunism, and, simultaneously, the newly victorious Republican Party's adoption of a defeatist policy of coexistence. Both policy shifts signaled a disengagement from democratic principle and policy. If one believed in democracy, Tom held, anti-communism was a necessary corollary, for communism posed the single greatest threat to freedom. And if one was anti-communist, one had to advocate policies adequate to the task of containing, and ultimately defeating, the Soviet Union and China. In response to Joseph McCarthy's red-baiting congressional hearings, the liberal left became more and more “anti-anti-communist.” To be anti-communist was somehow to be anti-liberal, and certainly to be boorish. The liberal left distanced itself from the central issue, which was not McCarthy's brand of anti-communism, but communism itself. The phenomenon of “anti-anti-com munism,” was, however, nothing compared to the phenomenon of Radical Chic. Spawned by the New Left, Radical Chic was enamored with all things revolutionary, anti-capitalist, anti-establishment, and Third World. Here, radicalism took a new direction. The old CP was unacceptable; Stalin was passé. The New Left found what Kahn called a “new pole of attraction” in Cuba, Vietnam, and later Nicaragua, countries whose leaders had “more charisma than could be found in the plodding gerontocracy of the Soviet Politburo.” The New Left, led by the organization Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), became the center of the anti-war and counter-culture movements of the '60s and '70s. The SDS was an elitist organization that advocated a radical egalitarianism. The students rejected the “working class” and its institutions (such as the AFL-CIO) as reactionary. The New Left's revolution would be led by a vanguard of students and intellectuals. George Meany was the enemy, Herbert Marcuse the icon. Not surprisingly, the New Left came to adopt many of the same intellectual habits of the revolutionary vanguard that took power in Russia in 1917. Tom Kahn, as director of the League for Industrial Democracy (from which the SDS originated) became one of the most prominent and most articulate critics of the new student movement. In the pages of Commentary, Dissent, [pageend11]10 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 The experience Tom had gained in taking on student radicalism was to serve him well in the next stage of his career. In 1972, fresh off the failed presidential campaign of Henry “Scoop” Jackson, the last of the Democratic Party's great cold warriors, he was appointed Assistant to the President by the AFL-CIO's most noted cold warrior, George Meany. He also served in that position under Meany's successor, Lane Kirkland, until his appointment as Director of the AFL-CIO's International Affairs Department in 1986. Tom's association with the trade union movement made perfect sense. For him (and the Shachtmanites), the AFL-CIO was America's mass social democratic institution. While communists and Third Way socialists had tried unsuccessfully to radicalize the American working class, the AFL-CIO had gone about the business of improving the living and working conditions of American workers — raising them to the highest level in the world. But there was something else for Tom Kahn: the AFL-CIO was also the only major liberal American institution to remain unwaveringly anti-communist. From the early '30s on, AFL-CIO leaders like George Meany, Jay Lovestone, and Irving Brown took the lead in combating Soviet attempts to subvert free trade unions — and, indeed, democracy — throughout the world. Tom Kahn joined the AFL-CIO during the salad days of detente, the bipartisan policy which Nixon and Kissinger initiated, Ford and Kissinger continued, and Carter and Vance extended. It was a time of communist advances throughout the Third World, and, in the wake of Vietnam, of growing American disengagement abroad. Alone among America's major liberal institutions, the AFL-CIO fought the political tide. It was not easy going. The Democratic Party and other liberal institutions were growingly hostile to the foreign policies and military expenditures needed to match the Soviet Union's expansionism and military build-up. The Nixon and Ford administrations were engaged in efforts to negotiate “peaceful coexistence. ’ ’ The business community lobbied heavily for detente policies that would open up trade and investment opportunities. During this time, Tom Kahn helped craft much of the AFL-CIO's foreign policy and its domestic strategy for maintaining a credible anti-communist stance. When Gerald Ford refused to meet with Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Kahn recommended that Meany invite him to the AFL-CIO and provide him with a Partisan Review, and other prominent journals, Tom scourged the New Left and, later, its political cousin, the New Politics movement of George McGovern. Tom lambasted the New Left's and New Politic's elitism, their abandonment of the American labor movement, and their abandonment of anti-communism, once the hallmark of the liberal left coalition that brought such cold warriors as Tinman, Kennedy, and Johnson to power. [pageend12]t h e g al l an t w ar r io r 11 national forum, one Solzhenitsyn used to give a stirring call for freedom. As editor of the Free Trade Union News, Kahn kept readers abreast of the struggle for democracy and free trade unionism in the communist world. In 1977, when the Carter White House would not meet with Vladimir Bukovsky, exiled in a trade for Soviet spies, George Meany had Kahn organize a national tour for him, which ended at the AFL-CIO convention. “Tell the truth about the ‘workers’ paradise,“' Meany told Bukovsky. Kahn built political alliances for the AFL-CIO to conduct its foreign policy work. In 1977, with the League for Industrial Democracy, he launched an international campaign to defend the first free trade union in the Soviet Union. SMOT, and its leaders, who had been thrown into psychiatric hospitals. In 1979, Kahn helped organize, with Freedom House, the International Sakharov Hearings and the countcr-Helsinki Conference, both of which helped give voice to opposition to the US's policy of not bringing up human rights issues at follow up conferences of the Helsinki Final Act. These were just a few of the efforts undertaken to defend human rights activists in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Most importantly, Tom was a rare ally and friend to the growing number of Soviet, Eastern European, Cuban, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Angolan, Chinese, Ethiopian and other dissidents from communism — people who were arguing desperately against the accommodationist policies of detente and for a serious US human rights and foreign policy. In the climate of the 1970s, these dissidents were shunned by government officials, politicians, and Establishment policy specialists. Tom Kahn was the person for them to see in Washington to get help and advice. Like the dissidents, Tom believed detente could only reduce the chances for achieving peace and for advancing the democratic interests of workers. While the Sovictological community spent its time trying to “understand the Soviet Union,” he wrote, The Soviet system is what it is. If we do not understand it well enough, we should try harder. It may be that it is not our understanding of the Soviets that should be changed in the interest of peace, but rather the Soviet system that needs to be changed — and that strategics for peace should have that as an objective. Tom's views on foreign policy and the Soviet Union came to be associated with those of the influential “nco-conservatives” affiliated with the magazine Commentary. Previously colleagues in liberal and civil rights struggles, the neo-conscrvativcs broke with the liberal left and the Democratic Party. While agreeing with many of the nco-conservatives' foreign policy prescriptions, Tom did not change his views on domestic policy and was discomfitted by the neo- conscrvativcs' break with the American labor movement, an institution they had supported in the culture wars with the New Left. But such disagreements did not, in Kahn's view, argue against maintaining a common anti-communist [pageend13]12 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 front. Liberal-left critics thus vilified neo-conservatives and social democrats like Kahn with equal ferocity. It was a lonely time for anti-communists on the Left. With the election of Ronald Reagan, liberal anti-communists like Tom became lonelier still. But 1980, as Tom Kahn wrote in a speech that December to Social Democrats, USA, was also “the year of Poland, glorious Poland, perhaps the central event of our lifetime.” It was in the Polish struggle that Tom Kahn would again distinguish himself. While not alone in hailing the workers' rebellion that gave rise to the Solidarity free trade union, Kahn immediately saw in it the initial buds of a democratic flowering throughout the Eastern bloc. Events in Poland confirmed Tom's growing belief in the potential of the dissident movement. His foresight stemmed from his continued adherence to the theories of Max Shachtman, whose Marxian anti-communism rested on a Marxian dialectic. In this view, the advance of democratic rights had tempered the revolutionary dialectic under capitalism; workers could exercise their power through the ballot box to gain control over the means of production, or at least to influence the distribution of wealth. But under communism, workers were completely powerless — for communism to change there had to be nothing less than a social revolution, one that stripped the Party of its control over the state and over the means of production. Reform of such a system, as advocated by most Sovietologists, was impossible; the only strategy for change in the Soviet bloc lay in “changing the Soviet system itself,” something inconceivable to the Sovietological community, much less the foreign policy community. At the heart of such a revolutionary change would be the working class, which at some point would rise up to unshackle the communist chains. By 1980, after sixty-two years of Bolshevik repression and Soviet expansionism, the Shachtmanite scenario seemed a little far-fetched. But then in August 1980, the Polish workers' movement exploded on to the scene and seemed to give validity to the theory. Just as Tom and Shachtman before him had predicted, the Workers rebelled and sought to gain democratic control over their lives through their own self-governing organization. Here was the first stage in the revolutionary movement that would topple communism. While some, fearing disruption of the status quo, were shocked at the developments, Tom argued tirelessly that peace and freedom depended on the success of the Polish workers, and, by extension, of the democratic forces in the Soviet bloc. In his December 1980 speech to the Social Democrats, Tom laid out a foreign policy argument that guided his actions during the next ten years: ...serious American efforts should be directed not merely to frustrating Soviet expansionism but at attacking its roots in the totalitarian structure.... I believe our ultimate objective must be the dismantling, by non-nuclear means, of the Communist system. Others may disagree but they are then obliged to describe [pageend14]THE GALLANT WARRIOR 13 The theory was the basis for creative action. There arose a whirlwind of activity by the AFL-CIO, as well as by the social democratic organizations that looked to Tom Kahn for leadership. Lane Kirkland, who had succeeded George Meany in 1979, proposed to establish an AFL-CIO Polish Workers Aid Fund at the end of August 1980, even before the formal establishment of Solidarity; he assigned Tom Kahn the task of running it. Tom devised a strategy to support the Polish workers and organized a number of activities and demonstrations. The AFL-CIO raised $300,000, which was used to purchase printing presses, typewriters, computers, and other necessary equipment for Solidarity. The AFL-CIO's work was not highly popular with the Establishment, particularly the Carter White House. Secretary of State Edmund Muskie pressed the AFL-CIO not to send money or equipment, for fear of provoking a Soviet invasion. The AFL-CIO, already saddled with a reputation as a hopelessly retrograde and reactionary anti-communist organization, changed neither its policies nor its actions. It believed in the strength of worker organization and its centrality to democracy; there was a basic trade union imperative to help fellow workers. For the AFL-CIO, that principle was called solidarity. The question whether or not the US should provide aid to Poland gave rise to a friendly but nonetheless consequential debate between Commentary their own view of the end for which this and unborn generations are asked to sacrifice. All else is twilight talk. He added: For if we do not, we are in effect saying to generations of young people that the preconditions for real peace are unattainable, that they have nothing to look forward to but interminable international tension and continual military buildups threatening human survival.... It is one thing to tell young people that the road to peace and freedom is arduous and long; it is quite another to suggest that it stretches to nowhere. Tom understood that such a policy was potentially dangerous, but he argued that such a risk was necessary. In 1983, at the height of the anti-nuclear movement, he defended this risk in a speech entitled “The Soviet Myth”: We must try to further the cause of liberty in communist countries by various means, including assistance to those behind the Iron Curtain who are struggling for a greater measure of freedom... [and] we must accept the fact that if we do these things we risk increased tension in the US-Soviet relationship.... Capitulation to the Soviets will bring relaxation of tension — but it is the relaxation of the graveyard. Tension attends creativity. [pageend15]UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 14 editor Norman Podhoretz and Tom Kahn in March 1981. The neo-conservatives had provided the intellectual spark behind the Reagan administration's reorientation of American policy away from detente, but they were nonetheless wary of the Polish revolution. Reflecting this unease about the situation in Eastern Europe, Podhoretz argued that the Soviets would not allow Solidarity to continue and thus any efforts at trying to help Solidarity or Poland would only end up helping the Soviet Union. It would also, he continued, detract the US from the essential task of rebuilding its military defenses and strengthening its foreign policy stance. Podhoretz concluded, finally, that the Soviet Union would not implode from the outer edges of the empire in, but rather explode from the core out. Kahn, on the other hand, put forward the thesis that Solidarity provided a model for revolutionary change in the communist world. It thus was imperative that the West support Solidarity so far as possible and heighten the dilemmas it posed for the Soviet Union. That could be done, in Kahn's view, by increasing the cost of intervention to the Soviets and offering the Polish government real incentives not to crack down on the democratic movement. Such a policy, he concluded, would induce an implosion of the Soviet bloc, beginning at the edges and eventually reaching the decrepit core. The imposition of martial law seemed to end the debate in Podhoretz's favor. Poland was subjugated once again, even if the popular social movement was repressed by its own jailers and not by Soviet forces. The aid that was provided to Poland was absorbed into the Soviet bloc; the printing presses sent to Solidarity were confiscated and used by the reestablished official trade unions. Kahn and Kirkland nevertheless believed that Solidarity had done irreparable damage to the foundations of communist rule. Time would settle the debate in Kahn's favor, they believed. So the AFL-CIO redoubled its efforts to help the underground movement that survived martial law's first blows. The large printing presses that had been confiscated were replaced by hundreds of mimeograph machines and small offsets that could better escape police detection. The AFL-CIO urged the US government to put maximum pressure on the Polish and Soviet regimes, through means such as calling in the Polish debt, and thus compel them to relegalize Solidarity. The Establishment could not have disagreed more with such an adventurous policy. A coalition of anti-anti-communist liberals, obsessed with the danger of increased Soviet-American tension and nuclear war, and the business community, intent on protecting its large investments in the Soviet empire, lobbied against too hard a line toward Poland or the Soviet Union. And this view was shared widely in diplomatic and foreign policy circles. In time, even the anti-communist Reagan Administration weakened its policy of strict sanctions against Jaruzelski's Poland. Tom Kahn was the architect of the effort to keep the pressure on the communists and to continue support, both moral and material, for Solidarity. Whenever the administration wavered, the AFL-CIO increased its own efforts to [pageend16]THE GALLANT WARRIOR 15 broadcast messages of support on Radio Free Europe. When the administration threatened to reduce support — openly allocated but clandestinely provided — for the Solidarity underground, the AFL-CIO went to Congress. (Contrary to Carl Bernstein's Time magazine report, there is little evidence that there was much, if any, covert activity to provide financial and material support to Solidarity, either directly or through the Vatican.) Islands of resistance multiplied within the Soviet bloc and challenged the totalitarian structures. The communist regimes were forced to respond to both growing political opposition and economic backwardness. Tom worked tirelessly to organize political and financial support, from both sides of the political spectrum, for these islands of resistance. Eastern Europeans and Soviets, exiled to or visiting Washington in the 1980s, found Tom Kahn to be one of the rare believers in their cause — and their prospects for victory. He played a key role in winning congressional backing for the creation of the bi-partisan National Endowment for Democracy. Tom also lent his backing to numerous initiatives — including the Committee in Support of Solidarity and the Institute for Democracy in Eastern Europe — to help the democratic forces in the East. As International Affairs Director for the AFL-CIO from 1986 to 1992, Tom provided assistance to struggling democratic trade unions being formed in the East. Besides Solidarity, free trade unions in Hungary, Lithuania, the Soviet Union, and Bulgaria received support from the AFL-CIO. These workers' organizations have been a critical element in the democratic struggle against entrenched communist elites. Despite the long AFL-CIO tradition of such support, some of its affiliates followed the position prevalent within the European labor movement that the AFL-CIO ought to deal with the official trade union structures on the grounds that they were the only game in town. The AFL-CIO held firm, however — and still does. In the end, the rebellion against communism was universal. In country after country, the whole of society — workers, students, intellectuals, and even disillusioned members of the communist ruling class — joined together to lay the sick and tired beast to rest. Despite the role the working class played in toppling Eastern Europe's totalitarian regimes, Shachtman's theory, even as updated by Kahn, overstated the case. Indeed, students, intellectuals and a ‘ ‘white collar” coalition often took the lead in bringing communist rule to an end. Even so, Tom Kahn elaborated the theory that proved correct: that peaceful and democratic revolution could force change within the communist world. He argued that reform, whether Gorbachevian or any other variety, would prove insufficient to change the ultimate structure of the regime. He asserted that a democratic solution required the dismantling of the system itself, which would only be possible by supporting democratic forces in the Soviet bloc. While Kahn's views were not widely embraced in the West, they mirrored those of [pageend17]16 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 oppositionists in the East, who, after their attempts to encourage reform had failed, concluded that the system had to be transformed for any real change to occur. In the end, there was a democratic revolution — one that took political power out of the hands of the communist party and that, more slowly, is trying to take economic power — ownership of the means of production — away from the party and its vast structures. Tom also argued, like many other cold warriors, that the preconditions for real peace lay not in disarmament agreements, but in changing the system that posed such a danger to the free world. The end of the Cold War has shown how profoundly correct the cold warriors have been in this regard. Within six months of the fall of the Soviet Union, Boris Yeltsin signed an agreement with President Bush to slash nuclear arms by two-thirds, in a fashion that leaves Russia in an inferior strategic position. After the end of the Cold War, Tom looked forward to returning his attention to the battles for justice and equality. After being unfairly tagged a nco-conservative, he enjoyed every opportunity to take on international capitalism head on for its exploitation of cheap labor in Asia (especially China), Latin America, and even the new markets of Eastern Europe. Domestically, he worried about the disparity between rich and poor, and especially the plight of the large number of black Americans left behind by the civil rights revolution. He believed these issues threatened the democratic fabric of the country. In any case, for Tom it was time to return to bread-and-butter issues after an ideological war that had turned various maxims on their head. Max Shacht- man had theorized (in the '40s) that only the downfall of communism would allow the genuine struggle for democratic socialism to take place. 'And Tom stood by his mentor to the end. His last article — which he was not able to finish because of the advance of his illness — was titled “Was Max Right?” “In every last detail,” he answered. Few Cold War figures matched Tom Kahn's intellectual clarity in the anti- communist struggle; fewer still maintained such clarity while holding true to a radical or social democratic philosophy; and even fewer still connected words and ideas to actions. Throughout, Tom suffered the vitriol of that part of the Left which betrayed its democratic heritage. It didn't matter: he led a happy band of warriors. And unlike many who undertook the good fight, he saw the end of the empire that had so long oppressed so many. Like King Harry and Exeter at Agincourt, he should be remembered in the annals. [pageend18]17 OPPOSITION, DISSIDENTS, DEMOCRACY Jakub Karpiňski is a sociologist and a historian of postwar Poland. The following article is an extended version of a paper presented at a conference on government and opposition in post-communist societies, which was held March 25-27, 1991 in Timisoara, Romania. Most countries of Eastern and Central Europe are now governed by those who, in communist times, made up the opposition. How did this come about, what have been its consequences, and what does it mean for politics in this region? Opposition to communism took various forms and was conducted within various social groups. Private enterprise carried on despite repressive measures (in particular, in the Polish countryside), university teaching free of ideology in disciplines subject to ideological pressure, cultural and religious expression unfettered by the diktats of the state — these were some of the forms opposition assumed; the degree to which such activities were restricted by state control varied from country to country. One form of opposition was — as the West called it — the dissident movement. This movement consisted of overt expressions of discontent by people who took pains to ensure that their names and their public stances were known to the authorities and to the public at home and abroad. In the latter stages of communism, oppositionists whose names were recognized in the West enjoyed a measure of protection from police repression, and were thus better able to continue their opposition activities. If two people were engaged in the by Jakub Karpinski [pageend19]18 same activity, the one who was unknown was more vulnerable to repression than the one who was more famous. In the Soviet Union and in many countries in Eastern and Central Europe, dissidents created a peculiar sort of community, bound together by a network of contacts partially hidden from the police. The combination of hidden and overt activities was very characteristic of the dissident movement. Well-known dissidents would sign declarations critical of the government, while others in the opposition clandestinely typed out texts and mimeographed or (later) printed them, and still others, shunning publicity for themselves, kept track of human and civil rights violations. Publicly visible activities brought fame at home and abroad, while the secret work of creating the technical basis for dissident activities and for disseminating information brought no such rewards. Dissidents, in addition to forming their own community, established their own sub-culture, with strong norms, rules of conduct, initiation rights, and an internal hierarchy. Initiation into the dissident movement demanded an act of courage: the courage to take a public stand and suffer the consequences — arrest, police interrogation, imprisonment, deprivation of employment, and many other forms of abuse. These were tests of fortitude, and some did better on them than others. The later stages of the dissident movement produced a number of groups and institutions whose membership was made public, such as editorial boards of independent journals and committees to defend the persecuted. But even after such organizations came into being, opposition activity continued to be dominated by informal networks. Authority was personal — it stemmed neither from formal position nor from elections, and was not even tied to membership in a particular opposition group. The dissident movement had its internal hierarchy, which, as is often the case with complex activities, did not leave much room for equality. Some individuals had more influence than others, and their opinions carried more weight — the principle of “one man, one vote” did not apply. Access to information and to the means of taking action, including funds (mainly from the West), and the opportunity to select the information and ideas to be disseminated, were privileges enjoyed by some more than others. This inequality provoked complaints of cliques and accusations of elitism, while those who were the targets of such remarks replied that whoever was not with them was marginal and unworthy of public attention. There were deliberations over who could or could not be trusted, over who was or was not “one of us.” The distinction dissident leaders drew between “one of us” and “not one of us” made them targets of accusations of elitism and isolation. What was important in the dissident movement was publicity; one's formal position in independent organizations counted less. The dissident-organizer UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 [pageend20]OPPOSITION, DISSIDENTS, DEMOCRACY 19 needed the skills of an impresario: he had to gain the trust of public figures, particularly artists and writers, and convince them to lend their names in support of a given dissident cause. In drafting public declarations, one had to choose a cause — decide what should be criticized or defended — at the given moment. The selection of causes from among a plethora of possibilities was the responsibility of the movement's informal leaders; it was also they who defined who was “one of us” and who was not. If a group refused to submit to this hierarchy and selected a cause without prior consultation with the informal leaders, it could be accused of disrupting the opposition's unity. In selecting causes for support or targets of criticism, dissidents were engaging in politics of a sort. At the same time, they proclaimed themselves to be against (or above) politics, denying that they were politicians and claiming merely to be reacting to evil and defending higher values. The problem, however, is that there are many higher values, and defending some might infringe upon others. When one's possibilities of action are limited, one has to choose, and the choice of a cause to defend or an evil to attack is often far from obvious. Good dissident politics required one to choose causes that were morally unambiguous so as to attract the support necessary to bring a given cause to the attention of the public. But it was also thought that dissident appeals should be “realistic” and not excessively “provocative.” For this reason, demands for national independence or for the withdrawal of Soviet forces were sometimes considered inappropriate and premature. Attempts were made to reconcile morality and realism — a difficult task. The habit of moral certainty, the conviction that one's own actions and decisions are right, resulted in difficulties when the communists were no longer the enemy, and when the moral superiority of the former dissidents ceased to be taken for granted. It was important in the dissident movement to tell the truth: to call a spade a spade. This flouted the conventions of public discourse, but it was hardly a discovery. The intellectuals' desire *o lend depth and complexity to the picture of the world was absent from the dissidents' declarations. The dissidents' role was more political, the intellectuals' more inquiring. But many people forgot this and assumed that dissidents and nonconforming intellectuals were one and the same. They weren't, though from time to time they came together to sign appeals and protests. The dissident movement played an important role in smoothing the path to democracy. It contributed to the growth of pluralism and was a part of civil society under communism. But there are few activities whose consequences are exclusively and unambiguously beneficial, and the dissident culture, in its role as harbinger of democracy, was no exception. Modem democracies see to it that rules of action are formally codified and regulated by law. The informality of the dissident movement, its loose networks of contacts, and its [pageend21]20 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 informal leadership were not the best preparation for democracy, especially democracy on the scale of a state. The dissident movement was sometimes known as the “democratic opposition.” This better described the movement's aims than the means used to achieve them. As long as no elections were held within the organizations created by the dissidents, the internal structure of the opposition could hardly be called democratic. The dissident movement tended to favor personal authority over democratic procedures. Democracy is usually understood to be a system that tolerates pluralism. The emphasis the dissident movement placed on unity, and its tendency to indulge in black-and-white moral rhetoric, were inimical to the expression and clarification of differences. Thus, to some extent, unity and uncompromising moral stances have hindered the attainment of democracy. Dissident protests did not concede that the other side might be partly right, as is usually the case in political life. It was simple: dissidents were in the right, and it was often assumed that whoever was not “one of us” was morally in the wrong. In 1980-81 in Poland, and later in other countries, opposition movements were formed under the banner of solidarity and unity. Many oppositionists argued that the struggle against a totalitarian regime demanded unity in one's own ranks, and that differences and pluralism had to be subordinated to this need. It was claimed that political parties no longer had a constructive role to play. If, however, people less closely connected with the established dissident movement attempted to create a broad movement of their own, they were accused of populism (a word with decidedly negative connotations in Eastern Europe). In particular, calls for national unity were deemed populist when they were made without being cleared by the important dissidents. The dismantling of communism was acknowledged to be a difficult task, and it seemed profitable in the meantime to try to reform or at least soften the system so as to bring it closer to the threshold of democracy. The opposition's public declarations, while often close to anti-communism, sometimes mentioned only the need for a better standard of living. Some simply wanted the system to be less awful; others, like Marxist revisionists, claimed that it was basically sound, although in need of some adjustments. In many countries the opposition held talks, to varying degrees official or secret, with representatives of the government. These talks, at which both sides made concessions, laid the groundwork for the transition to democracy; later, the rapidity of this transition exceeded even the participants' expectations. The segment of the opposition that participated in the talks tended to be less anti-communist than the rest of the opposition. Furthermore, these people were less anti-communist at the talks than they otherwise were. The rhetoric of the [pageend22]OPPOSITION, DISSIDENTS, DEMOCRACY 21 now former dissidents started to be more strongly marked by realism; the uncompromising moralists of the past suddenly became conciliatory politicians, negotiating with the devil they had until recently condemned. The negotiations, when they came to light or were rumored to be taking place, prompted accusations of betrayal. Outsiders assumed that the selfappointed representatives of the opposition were entering into secret agreements on behalf of the entire opposition. This, if true, was difficult to reconcile with the opposition's previous moralizing rhetoric, and led to further recriminations. One could, of course, use moral arguments both to defend and attack negotiations and agreements with the communists. Supporters of the talks emphasized the need to compromise, thereby contradicting their previous hostile stance to collaboration and reconciliation. The talks with the government benefited their participants, and other less-fortunate members of the opposition resented this. And, while the differences between the dissident negotiators and the communists gradually became blurred, the diverging trends within the opposition became more pronounced. Some members of the former opposition saw themselves as noble and tolerant partners in the negotiations with the communists; others reaffirmed their anti-communism, and in so doing attacked not only the communists in power, but other members of the opposition on account of their communist pasts. The chivalrous and tolerant stance towards communists was not generally accompanied by tolerance towards the diverging groups within the opposition. The communist nomenklatura was gradually losing its access to official positions and its hold on the mass media; economic perks and easy credit were becoming harder to obtain. These privileges were now passing to some of the former dissidents, who were finding it easier to get along with their communist partners in negotiations than with other oppositionists. The dissident movement had been a form of opposition that highly valued visibility to the outside world: it acted mainly by making statements to the public at home and to world opinion; it was largely elitist; most of its members were recruited from the intelligentsia; and its leaders were people whose names had come to be recognized at home and abroad. In accordance with the meaning of the term “dissident,” there were apostates among the dissidents: some had a communist past or were children of communists who wanted to break with the world of their parents or at least improve it. If the dissidents had acted alone, the government might have succeeded in isolating them; insofar as they contributed to the transition to democracy, they did so with the backing of a mass movement — sometimes, as in Poland in 1980-81, a well-organized mass movement that was beginning to create its own internal democratic structures. Later, however, this movement's internal democracy collapsed, partly because of the need for secrecy under martial law. Open, democratic institutions were replaced by underground, conspiratorial structures. When the repression [pageend23]22 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 of martial law abated, the dissident policy of public declarations and negotiations was readopted; in time, these types of action completely supplanted underground activity. People felt — and not only in Poland — that the revolution, or the mass movement, had been stolen from them. Tensions arose between Solidarity — the mass movement, whose leaders had been elected -- and the dissidents who were the movement's self-appointed leaders, experts, and advisors. While the dissidents tried to reconcile politics with morality, some perceived a close link between the opposition and the church. In many communist countries religion was a way of escaping from communism: the church spoke a different language from the party-state authorities, and in important matters its actions were not subject to the control of the communist regime. In Poland after 1956, the Catholic Church was the only major institution largely independent from the communist authorities: it had its own highly formalized hierarchy and its own communication and education network, enabling it to influence almost all of society. From 1980 onwards representatives of the church hierarchy in Poland were present at negotiations between the government and the opposition and took part in them as mediators, moderators, witnesses, and underwriters (which role took precedence was not always clear). And the church did more than merely assist the negotiations: it was also a party to them. The exceptional role played by the church had some unfortunate political consequences. In Poland today, most political parties invoke the social teachings of the church. This does not contribute to pluralism. Pro-religious and pro-church declarations unite political groups that should be rather busy clarifying what sets them apart. In some cases of the transition to democracy, the first free democratic elections were a good opportunity for creating and strengthening political parties. In Hungary, the opposition demanded that parliamentary elections precede the election of the president. In Poland, the first free parliamentary elections of the post-communist period weren't held until 1991; the composition of the parliament installed in 1989 was determined by the “round-table compromise” between communist-led and dissident-led coalitions. The parliament elected at that time hardly constituted a fair representation of the electorate. One of the groups within the former opposition demanded that the president be elected by universal ballot and not by an unrepresentative parliament. But the campaign for the presidency was conducted before well-developed political parties had emerged, and this further reinforced the personal character of Polish politics, to the detriment of the institutional dimension of democracy. Politics Europe today is marked by a divide between right and left, as in France or Great Britain. The left is more sensitive to the needs of the disadvantaged and underprivileged, and tends to favor state control of major industries together with the expansion of the state bureaucracy. The right is more [pageend24]OPPOSITION, DISSIDENTS, DEMOCRACY 23 interested in encouraging private enterprise; as one British minister put it, the right believes that “the government of business is not the business of government.” Neither the adjective “socialist” nor the left in general are popular in Eastern Europe. This can be attributed in part to the use of these words by the communists over many years, and the recent renaming of communist parties “socialist” or “social-democratic.” Former opposition activists once openly sympathetic to left-wing views now do not wish to be seen as belonging to the left. The words “socialist” and “left-wing” are considered insults, and politicians prefer to be known as “centrist” rather than “left,” “democratic” or “liberal” rather than “socialist.” Communists now call themselves “socialists,” socialists call themselves “liberal democrats,” and those who call themselves “socialists” explain that they are proponents of the social teachings of the church. This aversion to the words “socialism” and “the left” will probably diminish with time. If parties that espouse socialist ideas have a place on the legitimate political spectrum in Western Europe, then they will also have a role to play in Europe's eastern parts. Especially if they are democratic, which implies anti-communist. fl- This paper describes some of the obstacles on the road to democracy in East-Central Europe, obstacles not directly connected with communism. The dissident movement, despite its “anti-politics” and its moral rhetoric, certainly contributed to the establishment of democracy in this region. A description of those features of the former opposition which hindered the transition to democracy might have been of some use.

He was interviewed by Uncaptive Minds in July 1992. interview with Aleksa Djilas PLUNGED INTO SLAUGHTER It is widely believed in the West that the disintegration of the Yugoslav state and the accompanying bloodshed were inevitable results of the collapse of communism there. Defenders of the former Soviet Union often cite Yugoslavia as an example of what can happen when the central communist authorities loosen their grip on the East European and Asiatic hordes. What is your response to this view? UM DJILAS Yugoslavia's disintegration was not inevitable. But the probability of it breaking apart following the disappearance of communism was greater than it staying unified. The post-communist political scene would have had to have been dominated by genuine liberal democratic leaders for Yugoslavia to remain a united country. There were politicians who fit this description, but they were overshadowed by nationalist demagogues. These people exploited national symbols and myths, positive stereotypes of their own people and negative stereotypes of the other nationalities, in order to mobilize the masses for political action. And because nationalism has been the dominant political ideology in south-eastern (as well as central [pageend27]26 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 UM DJILAS and eastern) Europe since at least the 19th Century, it's not surprising that the demagogues have been successful. The collapse of communism was inevitable. Consequently, it was impossible to keep the “hordes” on a tight leash forever. But, although communism was doomed, the countries it dominated were not doomed to populist nationalism: the option of liberal democracy was also open to them. One must concede that the communists achieved considerable success in keeping nationalities problems under control. During World War n, the communist partisans suppressed nationalist conflicts; and at the war's end, they created a federal system that prevented power from being concentrated in the hands of any one group. Yet the Yugoslav communists also prevented the development of a tolerant and civilized political culture, not to mention an independentjudiciary, free press, autonomous universities, and the other institutions of a liberal democratic society — institutions that form a bulwark against national hatreds and conflicts. What are the causes — both immediate and underlying — of the conflict in Yugoslavia? I have already mentioned the most important underlying cause: the weakness of liberal democratic culture in relation to nationalism. Let's take a closer look, concentrating on the central conflict in Yugoslavia: the one between the Croats and the Serbs. The national ideologies of these two groups make many valid claims, but also many dogmatic over-simplifications and chauvinistic demands. What are some of these claims? The Croats are justified in pointing out that they have the right to self-determination — i.e., an independent Croatian state — and that no one has the right to change their borders by force. They also assert, correctly, that Croatian participation in the Yugoslav partisan army during World War II was sufficiently large to offset any collective guilt that could be imputed to them for the massacres of Serbs, Jews, and Gypsies committed by the Ustashi [Croatian fascists], who in any case never enjoyed the support of a majority of Croatians. Furthermore, Croats are quite honest when they say that only tiny groups of extremists in Croatia would like to see a repeat of the 1941-45 Ustashi attempt to liquidate the Serbs. But Croats are wrong to believe that they can exercise their right to self-determination without regard for the rights of their [pageend28]INTERVIEW: D J I L A S 27 Serbian minority. They don't seem to understand that Serbian suffering at Croats hands was so enormous — the word “genocide” isn't devalued in describing it — that any expression of anti-Serbian sentiment, any measures directed against the Serbs (and both were numerous from the day Franjo Tudjman's party came to power in 1990) were bound to be interpreted as a return to the Ustashi period. The communist constitution of Croatia did not define the Serbs in Croatia as a minority, but as a “constituent nationality.” Croatia itself was defined as a state of both Croats and Serbs. The constitution was supposed to show that post-1945 Croatia had nothing in common with the anti-Serbian policies of fascist Croatia; it also was meant to acknowledge the massive Serbian participation in the partisan struggle in Croatia. The significance of these passages in the constitution was mainly symbolic: they never implied that Serbs in Croatia — who account for about 15 % of the population — should have,as much say as Croats. The post-communist Croatian parliament drafted a new constitution in which the Serbs were defined only as a minority. This, combined with Serbophobia in the media and the dismissal of many Serbs from their jobs, began to make them feel like second-class citizens. The passions of Serbian extremists were stoked. And in Belgrade, the Milosevic government was cynically planning to exploit the struggle Serbs in Croatia were waging for their rights. Milosevic's true objective was the conquest of Croatian territories inhabited by a majority of Serbs — and any other lands it could take. It is characteristic of any nationalism to prefer to take a piece of a neighboring country rather than to ensure that its people are treated well in that country. Serbian national ideology holds, with considerable justification, that, owing to their sacrifices in the two world wars, the Serbs contributed more to the creation and preservation of Yugoslavia than any other group; that, largely because of the genocide they suffered at the hands of Croatian fascists, they sustained the greatest losses in Yugoslavia during World War II; and that because so many Serbs live outside the borders of Serbia, they stand to lose the most if Yugoslavia disintegrates. But Serbs forget that there can be no democracy without the right to national self-determination, and that the attempt to forcibly redraw the borders of seceding republics will only result in protracted armed conflict. Serbian national ideology is not more territorially expansionist than its Croatian counterpart, but it has been more aggressive in practice. This can be attributed to the Serbs' [pageend29]28 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 UM DJILAS alliance with the Yugoslav Anny, which, even when it did not fight by their side, gave the Serbian militias a great deal of arms. Serbian nationalism has no small touch of megalomania, an element of which is a belief in the superiority of the Serbian martial tradition. There may be something to this, but it doesn't mean that the other peoples of Yugoslavia can't or won't fight. After all, the outgunned Croat militia has fought with a great deal of success against the Serbs. To what extent is the West responsible for the situation in Yugoslavia ? The main responsibility for the catastrophic events in Yugoslavia is ours. If we Yugoslavs had been able to approach our national differences in a mature way and with a sincere desire to achieve compromise, the West would have helped us in every possible way. Of all the East European countries, we would have been the first to be admitted to Europe: economically, politically, culturally. It seems we preferred suicide to happiness. However, the West is responsible to some extent. It was excessively confident in the stability of Tito's regime, and after his death in 1980 it unconditionally supported his successors. At the same time, it has contemptuously discouraged the democratic opposition, both in Yugoslavia and in exile. If the West had provided at least a measure of support to the genuine liberal democrats in the past, I believe that they would have been in a better position to combat the nationalists once communism collapsed. Furthermore, the West was too lenient with the Slovenes when they disregarded all its warnings not to move so quickly towards secession. They achieved international recognition with relative ease following their proclamation of independence. The West has also been insufficiently critical of Croatia, which has expelled Serbs from many different regions of its territory, and which is conquering parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In general, the West is right in opposing Serbian aggression, but wrong in not seeing that many Serbian fears and demands are justified. Moreover, the West does not have a comprehensive plan for solving the Yugoslav crisis; it just reacts to events for the most part. Admittedly, it would be difficult to formulate such a plan, but without one, it will be impossible to work toward a stable peace. [pageend30]N T E R V I EW: DJI LAS 29 UM DJILAS Germany and Austria have played a very negative role in the Yugoslav crisis. It seems they have not yet overcome their traditional nationalism. The German and Austrian media often use negative stereotypes to portray Serbs — sometimes even with racist undertones. Germany, I believe, is trying to impose its own hegemony on central Europe. The West advised the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina to introduce elements of federalism into the state. Yet it recognized the new country despite the Bosnian government's complete disregard of its advice: Bosnia and Herzegovina remains a centralized state dominated by Muslims. If the West had postponed recognition until the country was federalized, the violent conflict might have been avoided, or at least it might have been less intense. The West's recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina pushed many of that country's Serbs toward extremism. The Bosnian Muslims are in a desperate situation, and the West is right to try to protect them. The siege of Sarajevo or the expulsion of Muslims from their homes are intolerable outrages. But why do expulsions of Serbs go virtually unnoticed in the West? Concerning the fighting, the Serbs are no doubt responsible for the most destruction, but the Muslim leaders bear the most political responsibility for the outbreak of hostilities. It was they who pushed Bosnia toward secession without guaranteeing respect for Serbian rights. Most people in the West are ignorant of the historical background to the conflict. During World War II, about 20% — according to conservative estimates — of the Serbian population of Bosnia and Herzegovina was wiped out, mainly by the Ustashi and their Muslim allies. While it's true that most Muslims didn't join forces with the Croatian fascists, it's also true that very few of them joined the partisan movement. Moreover, the Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina supported the Ustashi more than in Croatia itself, and likewise were less likely to have joined the partisans. In fact, until the final stages of the war, the partisan forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina consisted mostly of Serbs. To what extent is Milosevic responsible for the fighting? The leaders of all the nationalities that make up Yugoslavia are equally responsible for the civil war, but — to paraphrase Orwell — Milosevic is more equal than the others. But it's difficult to say [pageend31]30 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 UM DJILAS whether things would have been much different without him. To me, it often seems he is merely the executor, the implementer, of a megalomaniacal nationalist program which has been fleshed out sections of the Serbian intelligentsia since the late 1960s. I have been a sharp critic of Milosevic since his rise to prominence in the late 1980s. He has been very slow in recognizing the need for democratic change, and I don't know of a single democratic reform he has initiated. Under Milosevic, Belgrade, which once had the strongest liberal democratic dissident movement in Yugoslavia, began to lag behind Ljubljana, the Slovenian capital, in progress toward democratic change. The Serbian leader has pronounced authoritarian tendencies and promotes people on the basis of loyalty, with little regard for their intellectual or moral qualities. Furthermore, his party has almost total control over state television and over Serbia's largest newspaper. But in spite of all this, Milosevic is not a dictator. The way the West demonizes him often borders on the ludicrous. The same Western newspapers and political leaders who once idolized Tito, a genuine communist dictator, now portray Milosevic as a tyrant. Yet opposition parties are legal and very active, often mounting strikes and demonstrations demanding Milosevic's resignation. And there are independent newspapers and magazines in Belgrade, and television and radio programs often bitterly criticize him. How do you envision, if you can imagine it at all, a resolution to the conflict in Yugoslavia? The fighting, I am afraid, will go on for quite some time, although the intensity will vary. We are far from achieving a stable peace, because such a peace presumes borders that everyone can agree upon, and at the moment no one sees eye to eye on this matter. The “ethnic cleansing” will also continue. Serbs will continue to leave or be expelled from areas under Croatian or Muslim control, Muslims from areas under Croatian or Serbian control, and so on. At times this “cleansing” will be achieved by force, but usually by discrimination and other forms of oppression, which are often invisible to outsiders. Western pressure should be able to put a halt to gunpoint expulsions, but the other forms of oppression are much more difficult to combat. Similar processes have been occurring everywhere in central, eastern, and south-eastern Europe for more than a century. Many towns from the Baltic to [pageend32]INTERVIEW: DJ I L A S 31 the eastern Mediterranean were once home to a mix of religious and ethnic groups, but are now homogeneous. It's a tragedy, of course, but there seems to be no way to prevent it. The only “medicine” is a liberal democratic political culture. But such a culture doesn't come into being overnight. Since in all likelihood “ethnic cleansing” of one kind or another will continue, the West should accept it and formulate a plan that grants each of the three groups in Bosnia-Herzegovina a fair share of territory. Of course, determining what constitutes a fair share will be extremely difficult, but it shouldn't be too hard to decide that a group that makes up one third of Bosnia-Herzegovina's population — the Serbs — doesn't deserve two thirds of its territory. Serbs who have been expelled from certain parts of Croatia should be granted other parts of that country. This territory need not necessarily become a part of Serbia: it could remain within the borders of Croatia as an autonomous region. Finally, the West should not accept a centralized Bosnia-Herzegovina. Such a state would inevitably be dominated by Muslims, who in time would rid the country of most Croats and Serbs and transform it into an Islamic state. [pageend33]Juliana Geran Pilon's The Bloody Flag is a timely study of nationalism's dual nature, of its capacity to draw people together or drive them apart. As the countries of Eastern Europe experience unprecedented unrest in the course of their move to market economies, Pilon offers a reminder of nationalism's alarming destructive potential. There is a real danger, she warns, that the defeated elites of the old order will attempt to harness nationalist energies for their own ends. If they succeed, the world may witness the rise of new authoritarian regimes to replace the old Communist ones. Crucial to Pilon's work is an examination of post-Ceausescu Romania, where sizeable minority groups increase the risk of nationalist conflict. Tire best hope for Romanians, and for all the peoples of Eastern Europe, is toembrace the positive aspects of nationalism while rejecting the negative. The political system which can allow them to do that, Pilon argues, is the classical-liberal model—a model which makes possible the harmonious coexistence of different nationalities by protecting the freedom of individuals to pursue their interests.

UC, Rutgers—The State University, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 New from Transaction Publishers and the Social Philosophy and Policy Center "The Bloody Flag is the first serious study of the question which is currently very much on everyone's mind: As the ideological vacuum left behind after the collapse of the Communist regimes in East-Central Europe seems to be filling with nationalism—and as economic conditions there approach those of the Weimar Republic—-is there a chance for a successful transition to liberal democracy? Are these new forces destined to be destructive and ugly, or can they be constructive and healing?" Vladimir Bukovsky, author of To Build a Castle: My Life as a Dissenter In the aftermath of the collapse of Communism, the future of Eastern Europe is uncertain. The resurgence of nationalist passions among the newly liberated peoples of the region is powerful evidence of their need to reestablish a strong sense of identity after suffering for years under totalitarian regimes. The Bloody Flag Juliana Geran Pilon [pageend34]RUSSIA 33 interview Gleb Yakunin has been 3 dissident both within the Soviet state, for which he was imprisoned five years, and within the Russian Orthodox Church, which banned him from carrying out his priestly duties. Currently, he is a member of the Russian parliament and a leader of the Russian Christian Democratic Union. The following interview was conducted by Marcin Przeciszew- ski and published in the June 11-17, 1992 issue of the Polish weekly Spot- kania. with Father Gleb Yakunin THE ORTHODOX CHURCH AND POLITICS Father, you are one of the founders of the Christian democratic movement in Russia. The Christian democratic tradition, however, is foreign to the spirit of Russian Orthodoxy, which never developed a social doctrine. With this in mind, how do you view the future of Christian democracy in Russia ? MP YAKUNIN ' A significant Christian political movement never arose in Russia not because such a movement is contrary to the spirit of Orthodoxy, but because the idea was smothered first by the Bolshevik revolution and later by a half century of the Orthodox Church's collaboration with the communist authorities. Yet at the beginning this century, there was much interest in social thought among [pageend35]34 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 Orthodox philosophers — Nikolai Berdayev and Sergei Bulhakov, for example. This interest developed in parallel to the growth of Christian social thought in the West. Today, democracy in Russia — though it has only taken its first steps — is in a crisis. The democrats themselves, seduced by power, are not meeting the challenge history has presented them. Many of them have betrayed the idea of democracy and are calling for extremist solutions. The voices demanding a return to some form of imperialism are growing louder and louder. This development clearly shows that if the struggle for democracy in Russia is to continue, a political movement faithful to Christian ideals is necessary. Thus Christian democracy in Russia is indispensable and — I believe — has a bright future. MP What is the Orthodox hierarchy's relationship to the Christian democratic movement? YAKUNIN The church authorities, who until recently were under the total control of the KGB and the communist party, are today the heirs to the party's political line. Patriarch Alexi II has stated in official declarations that the Orthodox Church should not take part in political life. Theoretically this is the correct position, but at this crucial historical moment, I believe the Church should take part in the reform effort. Since the Church so actively supported communism, it should — if only to expiate its guilt — support our fledgling democracy. Yet Orthodox clerics who participate in the Christian democratic movement risk expulsion from the Church. MP But priests in the Catholic Church are also prohibited from direct participation in political life... YAKUNIN The situation in Russia is completely different. For over 70 years the Orthodox Church was subjected to sharper repression than any other organization. By the time of the Second World War, almost all the legitimate bishops had been murdered, and most of the active faithful had been shipped off to camps. In 1943, Stalin “reestablished” the Orthodox Church, but that church was fully at the state's service. Which is how it remained until recently. The church hierarchy helped carry out the party line. It kept silent after the invasions of Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan. Just as in the [pageend36]INTERVIEW: YAKUNIN 35 days of the Czar, the Orthodox Church was fully unified with the state. So let's not say that the Orthodox Church has no tradition of participating in politics. The only issue is whose politics. The council of 1918 decided that every cleric had the right to participate in politics, provided one important condition was observed: that any political activity undertaken was not done so in the name of the Church. I hope to see the day when politics can be entirely entrusted to lay people. Right now, however, I think it is too early for that. MP Ar a member of the Russian parliament, you have seen the archives of the KGB. How many bishops served that organization? YAKUNIN So far, only the metropolitan of Vilmas has openly admitted to collaborating with the KGB. The files, however, are merciless. They indicate that all the bishops were full-time KGB collaborators. MP Can you specify what forms this collaboration took ? For the most part, it consisted of writing systematic reports on priests. 'Every bishop was also obligated to follow the KGB's orders in making decisions about personnel. It was die KGB — the Fotit th I tepartment. to be precise — which decided when and where to transfer priests and which ones to send abroad The Fourth Department, however, did not have too much freedom < f action It was directly controlled by the Central Committee's Department of Propaganda and Agitation. It was in this depu nine it. manned by experts in die suppression of religion, that lbs most important decisions regulating the affairs of the Moscow Patriarchate were taken. Thus the Moscow Patriarchate was in fact a subordinate office of the Central Committee. YAKUNIN MP It is interesting to look back at the eermt m o’ ef'ls of the Orthodox Church from this perspective? . Ecumenism was highly desirable for the Soviet authorities. Their aim, of course, was not to further the cause of dialogue and cooperation between different churches, but to penetrate Western in- YAKUNIN [pageend37]36 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 stitutions under the cover of inter-faith contacts. When under Khrushchev thousands of churches were closed and the Church's activity was the most severely restricted, the Patriarchate of Moscow was permitted to make more foreign contacts than ever. And every cleric sent abroad was an agent of the security forces. Take the Metropolitan of Leningrad: his involvement in ecumenism was highly praised in the West. He had free access to the Pope's advisors. But I am absolutely certain that his activities were simply necessary for the KGB. He was subordinate to the Moscow Patriarchy, which was the only channel the KGB had at its disposal for penetrating the Vatican. MP Do you think its possible to reform the Orthodox Church? YAKUNIN First of all, the most compromised bishops should be removed from their posts. Metropolitan Pitirim, for example, who heads the publishing operations of the Patriarchate. He was given this function only to ensure that nothing was published. In general, we must rid the Church of all those who were faithful servants of religious oppression, all those who brought so much evil into the internal life of the Church. We must also go back to the principles of the conciliar Church. The Orthodox Church, at least in theory, is supposed to be a community governed by councils, in which the voice of the laymen has great importance. Unfortunately, this was forgotten during the communist years. The Church was governed by a centralized hierarchy because such a structure guaranteed the Church's unquestioning obedience to the communist state. MP What vision for Russia's future does your party, the Russian Christian Democratic Union, have to offer? One of the chief aims of our party is the elimination of the imperial mentality in Russia. We want to show that Russians don't want to dominate other nations. Freedom, after all, is one of the main aspirations of Christianity. In the sphere of economics, we don't have our own, separate program. We support the principles of economic liberalism. Of course, a social safety net is also necessary. YAKUNIN [pageend38]INTERVIEW: YAKUNIN 37 What do you think of the social teachings of the Catholic Church, in particular, the encyclicals promulgated by the last few popes? MP YAKUNIN We need Christian social thought. The Orthodox Church has always suffered from wide-spread obscurantism among its ranks, one of the consequences of which is a specifically Russian fatalism. It has resulted in extreme social passivity. Orthodoxy, when lacking in social doctrine, has easily succumbed to the secular authorities. This is why Leninism was victorious. Paradoxically, communism's triumph can be explained by the deep religiosity of the Russian people. The Bolsheviks replaced genuine religion fairly easily with a surrogate faith, communism. And they were able to do so because religion had not embraced the social dimension here. The Catholic experience in this area is very valuable to us. I hope that Russia's future will belong to Christianity, and I hope that the Christian religion will wield more influence in the social and political spheres. [pageend39]DIE. FIGHT. STARVE. KILL.

[pageend40]RUSSIA 39 LIBERATION BEFORE WOMEN'S LIBERATION Cathy Young is the author of Growing Up in Moscow (Tick- nor & Fields) and a regular contributor to The American Spectator and Reason. For years, our image of Russian or Soviet women was that of the Amazon of heroic labor, epitomized by the stem, muscular female figure in the famous sculpture “The Worker and the Collective Farm Woman.” Now that the myth of Soviet women's equality has crumbled with the rest of Soviet mythology, this stereotype has given way to another equally simplistic one: the Russian woman as a near-helpless victim of male chauvinism, scarcity, and oppression. Yet Russian women have not been passive bystanders in the extraordinary events that have transformed the former Soviet Union. From the time when mathematician Tatiana Velikanova co-founded the Initiative Group for the Defense of Human Rights in 1969, when numerous obscure women took the risk of typing up samizdat manuscripts and later kept the flame of dissent alive after most male human rights activists were arrested in the crackdowns of the 1970s, to the days of the August 1991 coup, when women stood at the barricades in spite of repeated admonitions to leave or assisted the White House defenders in more traditionally feminine ways by bringing them hot tea and sandwiches, women were actively involved with the forces of change. The first political group in Gorbachev's Soviet Union to openly call itself an opposition party, the Democratic Union, was started by a woman. Valeria Novodvorskaya, 38 at the time, had been an underground political activist since she was 18, spending about three years in prisons, camps, and special psychiatric hospitals when still in her early 20s [see the interview with her in this issue of Uncaptive Minds}. by Cathy Young [pageend41]UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 40 There is little about Novodvorskaya's activity that could be seen as connected to her sex — except, perhaps, for her self-conscious and determined marginality: this woman leader is also the ultimate, outsider. This quality also extended to the Democratic Union (whose female membership may have been the highest of any political movement in Russia). Founded in 1988, when the idea of a multiparty system was still anathema to most reformers, the group rejected any compromise with the system; it acted as a gadfly, flaunting its defiance of every law restricting freedom of speech or assembly. While Novodvorskaya's belligerence and her penchant for hyperbole and theatrical gestures have alienated many who largely share her views, more mainstream Russian liberals speak of her with a mix of irony and respect. If nothing else, the Democratic Union deserves credit for first challenging such once- sacred cows as socialism, the Lenin cult, and the October Revolution. For those women who have participated in Soviet and then Russian electoral politics, the riding has not been so smooth. In the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies, the proportion of women dropped from a quota-allotted 33% in the pre-Gorbachev era to 15% in 1989 — and many of those women occupied seats reserved for official organizations. In the Russian parliament and in the major city councils, where all races were open, 6% to 7% of the membership is female. Looking at these numbers. Nation editor Katrina Vanden Heuvel expressed alarm in a May 1989 piece in The Washington Post over the declining share of power women hold in the Soviet system — a strange way of looking at the situation, since the presence of women in pre-glasnost Soviet “legislatures” was as decorative as the legislatures themselves. In fact, the seats reserved for women in the Soviet Congress were more harmful than beneficial to women's political fortunes: the women naznachentsy (“appointees”) usually supported unpopular establishment positions, thus fueling voter bias against female candidates. However, there has been a deeper bias as well. Under the old Soviet system, with its official pretense of gender equality and its fear of independent social activism, there never was any examination of stereotypes about women. Moreover, in the early years of glasnost, some people saw traditional sex roles as part of the rediscovery of “universal human values” trampled by the Bol- s< ; v :;s The view that women did not belong in political life was openly voiced by a few commentators. Even a prominent woman journalist, Evgenia Albats, argued in a March 1990 column in the weekly Ogonyok that a society in so profound a crisis could not afford to worry about such luxuries as gender equity in political representation. Moreover, Albats wrote, the absence of basic goods and conveniences made running a household such a heavy load that greater female participation in politics was impossible — except at the expense of families and children. (It apparently did not occur to her that men might be asked to share in these tasks.) [pageend42]LIBERATION 41 Such views illustrate the obstacles that women in politics have had to confront. Some, such as St. Petersburg parliamentarian Marina Sallier, have tried to deal with this through campaign ads promising to be especially sensitive to the needs of women — sometimes appealing to male voters' concern for their wives, mothers, or sisters. On the other hand, Balina Starovoitova, the only woman named among the country's ten most popular politicians in a 1990 poll, has succeeded by making it clear that she expected to be held to the same standards as men. One way in which the 46-year-old Starovoitova differs from many of her male counterparts is that she got into politics more or less by accident. Having travelled extensively in the Caucasus as an ethnographer, she had strong proArmenian sympathies on the Nagorno-Karabakh issue; copies of her letters of support to two Armenian writers were circulated among protesters in Yerevan, making her an instant heroine. On a trip to Armenia after the 1988 earthquake, Starovoitova was urged to run for the Congress of People's Deputies from a Yerevan district; though an ethnic Russian, she won with nearly 80% of the vote. One of the first to join the democratic parliamentary opposition, Starovoitova became a leading spokeswoman for a variety of human rights issues, from Lithuanian independence and the ending of Soviet support for Cuba to the rights of prisoners and military reform. Since 1991, she has served as Boris Yeltsin's chief advisor on ethnic issues. A number of other dynamic women have emerged in Russian politics — from Bella Denisenko, a Novokuznetsk doctor who became a plucky spokeswoman for Siberia's striking miners, to the abrasive Tatiana Koryagina, an economist who gained fame as an anti-corruption democrat but who has increasingly allied herself of late with authoritarian forces. There is little to set them apart from men as a group, except for a difference in political background. Many of Russia's current political leaders, including, of course, Boris Yeltsin, previously held high positions in the communist party establishment. Very few female politicians followed such a path, partly because far fewer women rose through the ranks of the old Soviet hierarchy. Also, for whatever reason, nomenklatura women have been far less likely than their male counterparts to reinvent themselves as democratic politicians; they are more likely to be found in the communist opposition. Perhaps the greatest infusion of women into Russian politics came in a very American way: through involvement in grassroots citizen groups. Some of these groups have had a distinctly “female” touch. After the Chernobyl accident, tens of thousands of women rallied to demand the shutdown of dangerous factories and the cleanup of polluted areas. They were undoubtedly helped by their image as mothers trying to protect their children. A more radical version of maternal politics was offered by the Committee of Soldiers' Mothers, founded in 1989 by women whose sons had been killed [pageend43]42 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 in military service, either in Afghanistan or in peacetime as a resul t of hazing or negligence. The Committee evolved into an anti-draft group. Strongly opposed to all Russian army actions aimed at suppressing independence movements in the non-Russian republics, it has prevented military units from travelling to areas of conflict. Many other women volunteered for such grass-roots pro-reform groups as the Moscow and Leningrad Popular Fronts, and eventually moved into leadership positions; some were later elected to political posts, while others attained considerable influence behind the scenes. Among them is 40-year-old Vera Kriger, who says she became an anti-communist after she tried to file a complaint against the director of the day-care center where her small daughter had become ill because of staff negligence. “I was told that if I wanted party appointees punished, I was aiming too high,” she recalls. “This remark showed me everything in a new light... If the party was shielding such directors, we had to fight the party.” Kriger became a volunteer in the spring 1989 election campaign, and eventually helped form the Moscow Voters' Association to recruit and support prodemocracy candidates. Her own 1990 bid for a district council seat failed; but, as one of the principal coordinators of Democratic Russia, a bloc of liberal and radical parties and citizens' groups that helped elect Yeltsin, she was instrumental in organizing conferences and rallies, in building networks and links to activists in other cities. Typically, Kriger does not think that women in politics have different motivations than men — except that, she suggests, they may be more committed, more persevering. “I think the need for real change is felt more keenly by women,” she says, “because women in this country have to bear such a burden... ” Her own family —- husband and 5-year-old child — live in one room in an apartment shared with other tenants: “My husband says, ‘Let's have a second child.’ Now there's a woman's issue for you. Even if we weren't involved in politics — where would we put a crib in here for another child?” Few political women in Russia believe, in contrast to many of their American counterparts, that women are uniquely equipped to handle “caring issues” of importance to mothers and families. What is needed, says St. Petersburg journalist and democratic activist Elena Zelinskaya, is to create “a climate of opinion” where any politician, male or female, will have to pay attention to these issues. Starovoitova, too prefers to see women's concerns as a “shared responsibility”: “I, as a woman deputy, am very interested in the problems of the army and the penitentiary system; I would very much like to see some men take an interest in the conditions in maternity wards.” So far, Russia has nothing that can be called a women's movement, and it's not clear what such a movement would be like. A Western-style battle to liberate women from domestic roles and ensure equality in the workplace might seem alien to Russian women, most of whom have always had to put in a full [pageend44]LIBERATION 43 day's work and then do most of the work at home — a double burden many came to see as a negative product of “liberation.” Calls for women to return to hearth and home have been joined by some prominent female intellectuals, to the dismay of Western feminists. This nostalgia, however, is balanced by the influx of individualist and feminist ideas from the West — and by the fact that, according to surveys, no more than 20% of Russian women would like to stay home full-time. Women's par ticular vulnerability to rising unemployment is becoming a subject of concern, though not enough to provide the impetus for any concerted action by women. In her recent book, How We Survived Communism and Even Laughed, Croatian journalist Slavenka Drakulic writes that in ex-communist countries, where totalitarian regimes did their utmost to strip everyone of individuality, it is hard for women to see either themselves or men as a class, as a gender. This may be even more true of Russian women. Besides, as Zelinskaya says, “The main task today is to normalize life, to make sure that women, and every one else, have three square meals a day, decent forking conditions, decent housing. Then, people will decide for themselves how they are going to live.” For now, the specific problems of women, painful as they are, pale before the greater task of keeping Russian democracy alive and putting the economy back in shape. Without placing women's issues on the back burner, the political women of today's Russia certainly realize there can be no women's rights except on a foundation of individual rights and liberties for all.

She has lived through three prison sentences, a spell in a psychiatric prison hospital, and numerous arrests. In 1988 she was a co-founder of the Democratic Union. After the break-up of the Union in April 1991, she headed the party's revolutionary faction. The interview below was conducted by Anna Žebrowska and first appeared in issue 14 of the Polish weekly Polityka (April 1992). THE PROFESSIONAL EXTREMIST Did your last spell in prison come about because of an insult aimed at President Gorbachev? No, that was treated as a misdemeanor. When I was last imprisoned, back in the spring of 1991, it was for the usual charge under Article 70 of the Penal Code: “Incitement to overthrow the social and political order of the state by force.” I wasn't let out until that disastrous attempt at a coup. How many times have you been arrested? with Valeria Novodvorskaya AZ NOVODVORSKAYA AZ [pageend47]46 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 Five times before perestroika, nineteen under Gorbachev. Of those nineteen, seventeen were so-called “administrative arrests” that lasted fifteen days each, and the other two resulted in prison sentences. NOVODVORSKAYA You began your private war against the government at the end of the 1960s. How did that come about? In my first year at university, I founded an illegal anti-Soviet organization. It had a dozen or so members. We copied samizdat texts and also wrote and distributed our own leaflets. We were so successful in keeping our work secret that the KGB was unable to lay its hands on any of the others after I was arrested. I was caught because I had decided on a rather desperate measure: I distributed leaflets at the Palace of Congress during an opera performance. NOVODVORSKAYA That's quite a place to pick for anti-Soviet activities. AZ NOVODVORSKAYA Both the time and the place were perfect. It was December 5, the anniversary of Stalin's constitution, and the opera was October. The unity of time, place, and action was like something out of classical drama. Up on the stage, the chorus was exalting the revolution; during the interval, I stood up on the balcony and let loose a cascade of leaflets calling for an armed uprising against the communists. I was nineteen years old. I received a three-year prison term in Kazan. AZ You come from a loyal family of professors and doctors, and you were educated at a Soviet school where the accepted role models were the heroes of the Young Guard and the like. And I soon grew to loathe them wholeheartedly. It was so primitive, so unsubtle. Just a small grain of criticism planted here and there was enough to produce results exactly the opposite of those intended by Soviet education. Fortunately, I always had good books at hand: histories of ancient Greece and Rome, Polish history, philosophy. They inoculated me against Soviet propaganda. NOVOuVORSKAYA [pageend48]INTERVIEW: NOVODVORSKAYA 47 AZ Most members of the intelligentsia read those same books, but when a protest against the invasion of Czechoslovakia was organized in 1968, only seven people turned up at Red Square. In those days, a person had to be awfully courageous to decide to fight, and knowing the certainty of defeat in advance made that decision all the harder. NOVODVORSKAYA Even today the people who decide to fight political battles are few and far between. If they weren't so rare, the old party nomenklatura would not still be in power, nor would the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Poland and the Baltic countries still be an issue. Even the dissidents wanted at first only to revise socialism. They didn't think of it as a regime imposed by force, and they didn't think of the government as an occupation force. But I always saw myself as an heir to the White Guards. The Democratic Union revived it and took up the battle once more from the point where the White Guard left off, defeated, in the 1920s. You didn't need courage for that. For someone who feels free internally, there is no greater pleasure than waging war against those who want to enslave us. You don't think about your chances of victory. To judge by your name, you must have some Polish blood. AZ NOVODVORSKAYA In the late 16th and early 17th century, my ancestors were in the service of the Polish monarchy. The family estates were near Smolensk, so with time we became russified, though we remained Catholic. Nonetheless, I have a definite dislike for the Russian crown. I must say, however, that Poland lost much of its appeal for me after the round-table agreements. It was a great blow when Solidarity agreed to a compromise with Jaruzelski; we thought it was the end of the world. AZ But thanks to that compromise, Solidarity finally came to power and the transition was accomplished without bloodshed. NOVODVORSKAYA Power is not worth a penny if it's achieved through compromise with the enemy. Power should be taken in the classical noble way: by arms. The bloody uprisings against foreign invaders are more glorious chapters in Poland's history than the round-table accords. [pageend49]48 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 Thank God we still have Fighting Solidarity. Over the past few years, in fact, we've used quite a lot of their material. They have very good instructions, very professionally prepared, on how to prepare for martial law — where to hide weapons and money, how to organize a network of safe houses, and so on. All those Fighting Solidarity publications are now in my KGB file; they were seized last time I was arrested. AZ Could I assume, then, that the situation in Georgia comes closer to your ideal of political action? NOVODVORSKAYA It's quite true that the Georgians are more advanced than the Russians in the fight for freedom. We can only praise the opposition intelligentsia for daring to take up arms against a tyrant. Nothing but good can come of it for the country. AZ What about the victims, the casualties? NOVODVORSKAYA Casualties should be accepted with joy: they are the price of freedom. Stalin exterminated 66 million people. Those victims were useless because they went to their deaths without fighting, without dignity — like cattle to slaughter. If those 66 million had gone down fighting, Russia would be a civilized country today. A free country gives birth to a free people, but an enslaved country produces only generation after generation of slaves. There's no point in counting casualties when freedom is at stake. There's no golden mean. You have to be an extremist; in a despotic country only extremists are normal, decent people. AZ How many people share your views? NOVODVORSKAYA The Democratic Union and the Anarchists' Union, a related organization, have about 2,000 active members. That number hasn't changed for several years. It seems there are no other free people in this country. We publish two journals, Uchredzityelnoye Sobranie in St. Petersburg and Svobodnoye Slovo in Moscow. We are not a legally registered party, nor do we intend to register ourselves or pay taxes to a government we do not recognize. Our aim is to spark a popular movement that will bring about the creation of a [pageend50]INTERVIEW: NOVODVORSKÁ YA 49 provisional revolutionary government. After that, it would just be a matter of introducing technical measures sucji as free elections and democratic governmental reforms. AZ What do you think your chances of success are ? I'm pessimistic. We're fighting a lost cause. In contrast to the Poles, the citizens of this former empire want neither freedom nor democracy. They're a pathetic bunch of miserable little rabbits who are scared of everything and run around chasing their own tails. Go and ask the man on the street what he wants; he'll say milk, sausage, and vodka. No one would think to ask about the 50 remaining political prisoners or about withdrawing our troops from foreign countries. The press goes on about surviving these difficult times. But no one pauses to ask whether there is any point in surviving at all with a mentality like ours. Or whether we even deserve to survive. They just don't care. NOVODVORSKAYA I had expected to find you basking in triumph. Gorbachev is gone, the empire has collapsed, both the flag and constitution you used to bum in public are now only relics. AZ But nothing has changed! Instead of Gorbachev, we have another party boss at the head of the government, a man from the provinces with an inferiority complex that wasn't conquered until he had pushed his way to the top. Gorbachev is polite and doesn't drink; Raisa has taught him good manners. Yeltsin is much less polished but just as incompetent in running the country There you go insulting the president again! If that remark is published, you'll probably end up in jail again. NOVODVORSKAYA AZ You must publish it; these aren't the heresies I speak at public meetings. Even if some higher power — and in this country of terrifying inertia it couldn't be anything else — were to sweep away the entire government, the people would go out the next day and elect one exactly the same. A government is a reflection of the nation's conscience, and this nation has too long been used to being ruled by a strong hand. NOVODVORSKAYA [pageend51]50 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 AZ But you can't change the nation. You can, and we must. We must change this nation completely, alter its genetic make-up, otherwise we'll never make any progress. Otherwise, no attempt at reform, privatization, or liberalization will ever come to anything. The Alma-Ata accords were another tragedy for the republics. In 1922, whole nations were forced, at gunpoint and with much bloodshed, to join the USSR. In 1992, they are so afraid of independence outside the old empire that they are now rejoining of their own free will. They'll each take their little scraps of paper about sovereignty and nail them to their individual bits of barbed wire. And the West, which ought to refuse all help for this experiment, just accepts it. Once again, the West is prepared to feed the totalitarian hydra. But they'll realize that the hydra still has many surprises in store for the world NOVODVORSKAYA Your remarks do not strike me as particularly patriotic. AZ Do you think the reason I have allowed myself to be dragged off to prison regularly over the past 22 years has been hatred for my country? Fantasies about Orthodoxy and autocracy, about a nation parading around in embroidered Russian blouses are no measure of patriotism. Patriotism is the courage to speak bitter and unpopular truths. Until we recognize the scale of our shameful deeds in the past, our national disgrace, until we learn to love freedom and democracy more than sausages and the quiet life, Russia will not experience a renaissance. NOVODVORSKAYA AZ Where do your hopes lie ? All my hopes lie in the fact that this country of ours, with its centuries-old tradition of despotism and serfdom, was able to produce the Decembrists and the Narodniks, despite utterly hopeless conditions and contrary to all logical expectations. Only Russia had Raskolniks, who preferred to be burnt alive rather than submit to the will of others. Perhaps it is still possible to inspire the nation with a great idea, and if that idea fills the nation's soul, then we will be saved. It is not enough to believe in promises to build super- NOVODVORSKAYA [pageend52]INTERVIEW: NOVODVORSKAYA 51 markets. People must believe in something that isn't for consumption. AZ Meetings of the Democratic Union have not yet met with much sympathy or understanding. Only a very few people have seen clearly enough to accept our program of democratic revolution. Others denounce us to the KGB and advocate prison or psychiatric hospitals for us. Some of them would like to see us lynched or shot. Our meetings are instructive. Yesterday, for instance, communists and Yeltsin supporters took turns shouting us down, but then they started shouting at each other and forgot why they came to our meeting in the first place. Most passers-by don't bother to stop. They're usually in too much of a hurry to go stand in line somewhere. n o v o d v o r s k ay a AZ You spent some time at Lefortovo prison. What is it like? It's our showcase prison. It even has carpeted corridors. There are individual cells, but unfortunately without mirrors. So prisoners are not able to comb their hair or powder their noses properly. Each cell has a barred window, a cot, a table, and a chair. I was able to sit and write my anti-Soviet articles quite comfortably. NOVODVORSKAYA AZ How did you manage to smuggle them out of the prison ? NOVODVORSKAYA It was possible, but at the moment I think it better not to reveal the method. I have only three convictions based on Article 70 to my credit so far; I want five — five stars, like a luxury hotel. So I might still need to use my smuggling techniques. [pageend53][pageend54]53 RUSSIA A VISIT TO KALININGRAD Krzysztof Kopczyňski is a journalist and a lecturer on literature at Warsaw University. He wrote this article after visiting Kaliningrad in June. A field trip to Kaliningrad should be made an obligatory part of every high school education in Europe. Russia's westernmost city, Kaliningrad is the best place to gain an understanding of how Sovietization wiped out history. It is also a place to see how Russia, a great power, is struggling against the forces of modern democracy — forces which many residents of Kaliningrad view as humiliating. Until 1945 Kaliningrad, as well as the region which surrounds it, belonged to Germany; the city was called Koenigsberg, and it was the capital of East Prussia. It had beautiful architecture and a good university, and its most famous native son was Immanuel Kant. The war, and the subsequent destruction of whole areas of the city by the victorious Soviet army, reduced over 90% of the city to rubble. On these ruins, a new city was built and named Kaliningrad, in honor of Mikhail Ivanovich Kalinin, one of Stalin's close collaborators. His statue still stands in front of the main railway station, while Lenin watches over town hall. The Germans who used to live here are now free to visit, but those who come often leave in tears, vowing never to return to the nightmarish place their once beautiful-city has become. In accordance with Stalin's strategic designs, the remaining fifteen thousand kilometers of Eastern Prussia, now known as the Kaliningrad oblast, were annexed not to Lithuania but to Russia. For 45 years, it was one of the most closely guarded and inaccessible territories of the Soviet Union, because it was the headquarters of the Baltic Fleet and home to a number of othci®military units. by Krzysztof Kopczynski [pageend55]54 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 The nature and pace of the changes which are taking place here are best understood from the perspective both of the oblast's neighbors along the Baltic coast, and of Moscow. Russia's new defense doctrine — announced on June 20th by Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi and later confirmed by Yeltsin — states that the “Russian- speaking population” in all the territories of the former USSR, including the Baltic states, must be defended. It would thus seem that Russia has no intention of withdrawing its forces either from the Kaliningrad oblast or from the port cities of Klajpeda, Riga, Liepaja, or Tallinn. Sources in the Russian military say that Moscow is willing to lease these ports, but none of the Baltic countries wants to make money in this manner; on the contrary, they would far rather finance the withdrawal of Russian forces. Latvia recently offered to build, with Danish financial help, apartments in Russia for Russian officers. Moscow, however, rejected this discreet offer, thus undermining its own rationale for not withdrawing its military forces: lack of housing for officers. In fact, many of these officers — in Vilnius, for example — buy apartments from the state and sell them for a sizable profit, using the proceeds to buy much bigger apartments in the heart of Russia, where prices are much lower. There is no denying. however, that the material situation of the Russian army's officers is generally not very good. In the Kaliningrad oblast, the inadequate living conditions of army officers are particularly sorely felt. For dozens of years the army had provided the residents of these territories with a standard of living much higher than average in the Soviet Union; one in five of the oblast's 900,000 inhabitants was employed by the armed forces in one capacity or another, and virtually everyone else was at least indirectly dependent upon this “industry.” Now all that has changed, and the army is suffering a painful humiliation. The traditional hierarchy has been toppled: even a high-ranking officer has lost his importance in comparison with a small businessman (the latter, incidentally, more often than not a member of the nomenklatura). Rumors are rampant about the persecution of Russian soldiers in Latvia and Lithuania. Whether true or not, they arc widely believed by career soldiers with no prospects foi the future. The Lithuanian authorities do not deny that there have been anti-Russiar incidents. But they claim that no concerted, organized action has ever beer taken against Russian soldiers. Nonetheless, Russian military men in Kaliningrad feel besieged, citing, for example, the attempt to include Lithuanian residents of the Kaliningrad oblast in the June 14 referendum on the withdrawal of the Russian army from the territory, or the exclusion of supplies for Russian forces stationed in Kaliningrad in a 1991 agreement between Russia and Lithuania allowingsfor tariff-free transport of supplies across Lithuanian territory. Another issue is the possibly inflated number used by Lithuanian authorities for the Kaliningrad forces. In the end, however, the number of soldiers [pageend56]KALININGRAD 55 in Kaliningrad and the Baltic countries boils down to whether you believe the assurances and data the Russian authorities have been providing. (The Russians claim there are 55,000 military personnel in Kaliningrad; Lithuanian claims range as high as 250,000.) The West seems to downplay this issue, believing that no pressure is necessary for the removal of Russian forces from foreign soil. However, the higher ranks of the Russian officer corps appear to be convinced that neither a referendum, nor treaties, nor Lithuanian “provocations” will change anything. In their view, the Russian army won't go home until it is in the Russian national interest to do so, and not a moment sooner. A map alone provides convincing evidence that Russia is not interested in demilitarizing the Kaliningrad oblast. The disintegration of the Soviet empire has deprived Moscow of (at least exclusive control of) twelve of the largest naval ports along the Baltic and Black Sea coasts. Some of these ports — such as Tallinn — also played a crucial role in the civilian Soviet economy, making their loss all the more costly to Moscow. Withdrawal from Kaliningrad would leave St. Petersburg — which is subject to ice blockage — as the only Baltic port exclusively controlled by Russia. Under these conditions, the Russians would have to cede naval dominance in the Baltic. The Kaliningrad oblast borders two countries, Poland and Lithuania, but it is almost completely dependent upon the latter. Lithuania supplies 80% of the oblast's electricity and fuel needs. (Kaliningrad produces a little oil, but not nearly enough to satisfy its own needs). Some 18% of the oblast's foodstuffs come from Lithuania. Most importantly, the highways and railroads that link the oblast with the rest of Russia all run through Lithuania. Russia, however, supplies the Lithuanians with crude oil and natural gas. During the August 1991 coup attempt, Russia shut these supplies off. At the moment, the two sides are living up to their agreements. Nonetheless, these mutual dependencies — which were deliberately established by the Soviet authorities — give Moscow the potential to blackmail the Lithuanians should any problems arise. The Russians are already strong-arming their Lithuanian partners on everyday disagreements over prices and the fulfillment of contractual obligations. The authorities of the oblast, well aware of their dependence on Lithuanian transportation links, are exploring the possibility of building a highway to Belarus via the northeast counties of Poland. The recent visit by Ruslan Khasbulatov reveals the prominent place given Kaliningrad by Moscow politicians. Khasbulatov, the conservative head of the Russian Supreme Soviet and one of Yeltsin's premier opponents, travelled to Kaliningrad for three days, where he toured a Sovkhoz, a cannery, a sewagetreatment plant, and a health spa. His trip also included meetings with Kaliningrad council deputies and representatives of business and the intelligentsia, and an appearance before sailors of the Baltic Fleet. The Kaliningrad newspapers covered the visit in detail, frequently quoting the Moscow V.I.P. Of [pageend57]56 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 particular interest was his declaration that Kaliningrad should become Russia's maritime window to the West, while remaining a citadel of Russian might. “Russia is here! This is Russia!” Khasbulatov also came up with a new name for the oblast: Western Russia. These statements met with a warm reception. There is another name for the oblast that is being heard more and more often: the Free Economic Zone. The neutrality of this designation sharply contrasts with Khasbulatov's blustering about a “citadel,” a comment that the liberal Kaliningrad newspaper Yantamoy Kray noted, with considerable understatement, “probably didn't go over well with every European politician.” (Liberal politics, by the way, are not particularly popular in Kaliningrad; the circulation of Yantomoy Kray is about a tenth that of Kaliningradskaya Pravda, the old communist standard-bearer.) Neither did Khasbulatov's comments go over well with Yuri Matochkin, the Yeltsin-appointed chief administrator of the Kaliningrad oblast and a co-author of the free economic zone plan. Those comments, together with the attention lavished upon Khasbulatov's visit, strengthened the standing of the conservative local council and its chairman, Yuri Syeminov, at Matochkin's expense. Much to Matochkin's chagrin, the elected authorities in Kaliningrad are more conservative than those appointed from Moscow. Bringing Western-style democracy to Kaliningrad requires struggling against the democracy that already exists there. And that requires support from the center — Moscow. Kaliningrad lags behind the rest of Russia in economic reform also. This is not how it was meant to be. Yeltsin made the oblast a free economic zone on July 14, 1990, but for the past two years very little has changed. Western businessmen as well as the oblast's inhabitants have been told to look forward to a prosperous future — and to wait in the meantime. As is often the case now and in the Soviet past, the main problem has been the lack of clearly demarcated responsibility and the willingness to assume it. For example, when Khasbulatov was asked why the Free Economic Zone had not been put into effect, he replied that, though personally he supported it, everything depended on the presidium of the Russian Supreme Soviet and the government. Decisions concerning internal matters of the oblast are increasingly being referred to outside authorities. For instance, it was once possible to get permission to launch a publication from the local authorities, but now one has to go to St. Petersburg. Not only has nothing been put into practice: until June of this year, not a single law or regulation spelling out what the free economic zone means had been passed. A joke sums up the local people's attitude toward this unrealized scheme: Of the three words in “free economic zone,” only one of them is true — “zone” (it also means “labor camp” in Russian). Some laws were recently passed, but they only govern trade within the oblast, which will do nothing to attract Western investment. [pageend58]KALININGRAD 57 Nevertheless, Western businessmen are coming to Kaliningrad, if only to reconnoiter the situation. Poles and Lithuanians are also coming to test the waters of commerce, but they can only afford to open small businesses. Mafialike groups from all over the former Soviet Union are setting up shop here, making Kaliningrad second only to Riga in terms of gangland penetration of the private sector. Nomenklatura-owned firms are also numerous. You can get in and out of the country with all the contraband you want: just pay a 200-dollar bribe to the border guards — on each side of the border. One of Kaliningrad's growth institutions is its commodity exchanges. Owing to the lack of a business infrastructure, these exchanges are becoming allpurpose business centers. In keeping with this development, the International Commodity and Currency Exdhange of Kaliningrad will soon include, if all goes well, a bank, an insurance company, and a barter bureau, which is particularly important for Western businessmen who don't want unexchangeable rubles for the goods they import here. The management of the exchange — which is housed in a theater — is counting on this plan, because it is barely breaking even, and relies too much on small traders from Lithuania and Poland. They're after bigger fish from Germany and Scandinavia. A foreigner visiting Kaliningrad should be prepared for encounters with the post-Stalinist mentality. It's not just the pervasive corruption, lackadaisical attitudes, or attachment to the city's name. Rather, the most striking thing is the widespread fantasy that Russia is a particularly attractive place to invest — and that Kaliningrad is more attractive than elsewhere in Russia. Sooner or later, people believe, the West will be pouring money into the place. This notion has captured the imagination of the military people stationed here and also in the Baltic countries; it explains why many of them are choosing to stay. They want to stay despite nearly hysterical reports in the Russian media about the bad treatment Russians are receiving at the hands of the Baltic peoples. Many Russians, it seems, still think their country can dictate its terms to the rest of the world — a notion inculcated through years of Soviet propaganda. Now they are deeply offended that their compatriots are not being treated with the utmost respect. They are complaining to the world about the violation of Russians' human rights in the Baltic countries — which is a way of blackmailing those countries' governments into making concessions of various kinds. An article from the June 11 issue of Kaliningradskaya Pravda entitled “Who needs a Baltic Karabakh?” exemplifies this propaganda technique. The author, a Captain W. Gromak, begins by describing Lithuanian provocations aimed at Russian forces and the predicament of the Russian soldier, who is deprived of the freedom to travel and so forth. He then goes on to describe the impoverishment of Russian officers in Tallinn. He writes that the Baltic governments are oppressing Russians — both soldiers and civilians — and that the Russian army is the only structure that can assure the safety of Russian civilians in the Baltic countries. The author throws in the argument that the Baltic gov[pageend59]UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 ernments are flouting international law, illustrating his point with tales of how the children of Russian military personnel have been denied a free education. “All of this has provoked a sharp reaction among Russian soldiers,” he writes. “More and more frequently, they are saying it is time to defend their dignity and honor by any means, including arms.” While the higher officers are managing to keep a lid on things, there may come a day when their commands are ignored, as soldiers and lower officers rise up in defense of their dignity or the rights of the Russian-speaking inhabitants of the Baltic region. At that point, Gromak concludes, responsibility will lie with the governments of the Baltic countries. The intention here is not to dramatize the plight of the Russian soldier. The point is to warn the Baltic governments that their efforts to rid their countries of Russian troops can blow up in their faces. The order to decamp, after all, is going to come from Moscow — not Vilnius, Riga, or Tallinn. This article was part of a propaganda campaign that preceded the announcement of Russia's new defense doctrine. The arguments raised in it are universally applicable to the countries of the former Soviet Union. Kaliningrad's German connection has been revived as of late. There are a number of associations devoted to cultural and economic contacts with Germany: the Kant Foundation, the Eintracht Society for German Culture, and the Sobor Association. There is a Russian-German newspaper, the Kaliningrads- ky/Koenigsberger Kurier. In Germany itself, there seems to be a new-found interest in the rump of former East Prussia. Der Spiegel, for example, published several lengthy articles on it. But the German revival is hardly affecting the Russian character of this region. Plans to settle Russia's ethnic German population in Kaliningrad — which originated in Petersburg mayor Anatoli Sobchak's office — have been ruled out. So far, about 3,000 ethnic Germans have migrated here on their own from elsewhere in Russia, but 800 of them have already gone back. Estimates of the total German population in Kaliningrad Oblast range as high as 20,000, although it is probably a good deal lower. The Lithuanian government has a number of disputes with the Russian and Kaliningrad authorities. It claims the Russians have been preventing the opening of Lithuanian schools and churches in the oblast, and in particular, a center of Lithuanian culture in Sovetsk. The Lithuanian government fears that if the Kaliningrad Lithuanians choose Lithuanian citizenship (all people living on Russian territory must choose their citizenship by the end of 1994), they will lose their rights to welfare, health insurance, and so forth. However, whether Kaliningrad's Lithuanians are being discriminated against, or are simply the victims of bureaucratic bungling, like most of the rest of the oblast's population, is an open question. In the opinion of one of President Landsbergis's advisors, the Kaliningrad Lithuanians have not been too active themselves. 58 [pageend60]KALININGRAD 59 The treatment of Lithuanians in Kaliningrad will depend to some extent upon the treatment of the significantly larger Russian minority in Lithuania, a fair number of whom settled there before the war. The central issue in Lithuanian-Russian relations, however, is the Russian forces that have remained in Lithuania. President Landsbergis has stated that the clearest indicator of Moscow's intentions is how fast troops are withdrawn from the Baltic countries. And of course, the direction matters, too: if they're sent west to Kaliningrad, it will hardly reduce tensions in the region. Kaliningrad's relations with its other neighbor, Poland, have been considerably smoother. The Russo-Polish friendship treaty signed by Presidents Yelt sin and Walesa in May (though not yet ratified) has a section calling for stepped-up contacts between the oblast and the counties it borders in northeast Poland. The foreign ministries of the two countries were quick to draw up a document that elaborates the forms cooperation is to take between these two regions. New border crossings, highways, and railroads are to be built. How quickly these agreements will become reality is anybody's guess, but it seems that Walesa and General Administrator Matochkin have given them high priority, and they have agreed to meet to discuss these matters in the near future. What will become of this Russian island? The Lithuanians think that it should join Lithuania, although they're not openly saying so yet. A high official in the Lithuanian Ministry of Culture has described the Kaliningrad Oblast as ‘ ‘ethnically Lithuanian. ’ ’ When I asked him whether such ethnographic views could become political arguments, he said the time has not yet come “for all interested parties to sit down and make the final decision on this matter.” This minister was a good deal more subtle than the Lithuanian ambassador to the United States, Stasys Lozoraitis, who said in an interview that the possibility of the Kaliningrad Oblast uniting with Lithuania had not been ruled out. To be sure, the Lithuanian minister of foreign affairs denied that Lozoraitis's views were Lithuanian policy. But Lozoraitis's career has suffered no adverse affects for committing a blunder that could have inflamed Russian-Lithuanian relations. Zbigniew Brzezinski has suggested another possibility: transformation of the oblast into an extra-territorial free-trade zone. This of course would require a change in Kaliningrad's relationship to Russia, and possibly even independence. This may seem utopian for now. Yet there are signs that some people in the oblast may be thinking along the same lines. One often hears talk of the city's past as a member of the Hanseatic League, which was an association of largely independent city-states. And recently, an exhibition was opened in the city that was meant to demonstrate the separate cultural identity of the region. But in this case, history and culture would only serve to justify economic motives. If Moscow doesn't allow the oblast a sufficient degree of autonomy, and if the free economic zone fails to come into being, then the economic arguments for leaving the Russian Federation could become very persuasive. [pageend61]60 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 This, by the way, could be one reason why Moscow is reluctant to withdraw the enormous military forces it has stationed here. The most important question that remains to be answered is whether Moscow will realize that Kaliningrad cannot live up to its economic potential in an atmosphere of threats. Only a few of the Russians with whom I spoke think that statements such as those Ruslan Khasbulatov has made are nothing but empty posturing. All the politicians and diplomats with whom I have spoken from the Baltic states and Poland take these threats seriously. Will the international community have the wherewithal to stand up to these threats — and save Russia from herself? The train from the Polish border town of Braniewo takes almost three hours to travel the 30-mile route to Kaliningrad. When high school students from all over Europe come to visit, travel those 30 miles in an hour or so, and send their postcards from a city no longer named after a mass murderer's henchman, the people who live along the eastern part of the Baltic will be able to sleep a little easier. [pageend62]BELARUS 61 ALOSHA CAPONE The following article appeared in the May 16-17 issue of the Polish daily Źycie Warszawy. One of the leaders of the Chechen mafia held a banquet in the Belarus Hotel in Minsk. First he ordered a case of champagne for every table, then he hit the dance floor. After awhile, a pistol slipped out of his pocket. Someone called the police, and the mafioso was taken away. Not for long, however: a half-hour later the police, apologizing profusely, brought him back — in a civilian vehicle, because he didn't want to ride in a police car. “Here, everyone is a criminal,” says Valeria, a money changer at the Komarovsky bazaar, the largest in Minsk. The great hall, which houses state shops on the ground floor, is divided up into booths where people sell goods of all kinds. Many don't even have booths to sell from. It's legal to carry on retail trade here, but not outside the confines of the hall — where it takes place just the same. “A few years ago,” Valeria recalls, “beginning businessmen began to come to the area around the hall with things they had brought from abroad or obtained under the counter. Wherever the sellers set themselves up, buyers appeared, and there was trade. After awhile, more and more people gathered, and that's how the Komarovsky bazaar came into being.” Kiosks have arisen along the streets leading to the bazaar, where you can buy the leftovers of the West: the cheapest cigarettes, beverages with expired dates, used clothes. The signs above these kiosks proudly announce that they are “commercial shops” — that is, private enterprises, which are better known as “cooperatives.” Walking around the bazaar, you get the impression that there is more than meets the eye — that something is going on that is not readily apparent to the casual visitor. Conversations with the merchants here confirm this impression. by Wojciech Górecki [pageend63]62 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 The important goings-on are the secret arrangements with the police and the mafia. Theoretically, the police can arrest anyone for selling things outside the hall. But in reality, they only shake down the richest. How do they determine who the rich ones are? If the capacity of the street merchant's bags are greater than the wares he has for sale — which means he must have sold something, so he can afford to be extorted. The goods the merchants display for sale are often only a small portion of what they have to offer. If you ask, you can find a tear-gas pistol for 6,000 rubles ($60), a World-War II assault rifle for 15,000, and a Kalashnikov for 18,000. Ilie merchants from central Asia have anasha — marijuana. In the handbags of the ubiquitous babushkas there are usually bottles of vodka, and sometimes even wine and cognac. The old men milling about have coupons and ration tickets for sale. Money changers are also all over the place. They're easy to recognize, because they have little sheets of paper clipped onto their clothes with the symbols of dollars, marks, or pounds written on them. According to Valeria, money- changing is a good business, because lots of people are buying and selling foreign currency in Belarus these days. Officially, however, trade in foreign currency is a serious offense, and can earn its practitioners long jail terms. Yet the law has to be broken if one wants to comply with the law. When a citizen of the former USSR traveled to the West, he was allowed to buy a few dollars from the state at a fair, even quite favorable, exchange rate — but only a few. Today, a citizen of Belarus has to pay hard currency for a train ticket to, say, Warsaw. Jews and Germans who wish to emigrate also have to pay in Western currency. But the state exchange bureaus offer dollars only at an extremely high rate. So the only place citizens of the former Soviet Union can realistically buy foreign currency is from the money changers. They get their hard currency from foreigners, who trade their money for rubles at an absurdly advantageous rate. Valeria makes about 500 to 700 rubles a day. His mother, a physician, earns 2,000 a month. So it pays to risk arrest plying his trade at the bazaar. A friend of his got caught the day before with 1,000 dollars in his possession. Another friend of his was arrested by plainclothesmen after buying 40 dollars; the police found 230 more in the friend's pockets. The cops wrote up a report, mentioning the total amount they found: 270 dollars. Since that amount was liable to confiscation, Valeria's friend refused to sign it. Instead, he gave them 100 dollars, thinking that would be enough to smooth things over. But two days later, he received an official summons from the precinct house, demanding that he pay more, and threatening unpleasant consequences if he didn't. “I'm a cop heart and soul,” says Vova, a 60-year-old policeman from a central Minsk precinct. “I would be a policeman in any country, in any system. Now, with my retirement approaching, I've been troubled by thoughts [pageend64]A LOSH A CAPONE 63 of all the innocent people I locked up, for speculating, for changing money. I should have been arresting people for assaults, rapes, and robberies...” Until recently, the money changers and the small traders at the Komarovsky bazaar had to pay fbr “protection.” Like Chicago in the 1920s, gangsters would go around the hall making “offers that couldn't be refused.” Alosha, said to be the most powerful gangster in the city, ordered his underlings to call him “Al Capone.” Today, however, the police have cracked down on the protection racket in Minsk. The racketeers have left for Grodno, Brest, and especially Vilnius. ‘ ‘Maybe some kiosks on the outskirts of the city still pay protection, but those are exceptions,” says Valeria. “The kiosks around the Komarovsky bazaar never had to pay protection, because the ‘hairy hand’ already protects them.” What is the “hairy hand”? I never found out for sure: it was probably either another mafia or guards hired by a merchants' association. Getting in contact with Alosha was no easy task, but with a little luck, and a couple bottles of vodka, I managed. True, the bosses of the post-Soviet underworld are dangerous people, but they're also vain — they like to read about themselves in the paper. “A year ago at the bazaar in Vilnius, the boys took a hundred rubles a head,” the Belarusan godfather tells me. “Now it's up to a thousand, because of inflation. In Vilnius, the racket controls the market. We don't allow the money changers to pay more than, say, 115 rubles a dollar, and we just sit in a car outside and pay 120. So people come to us...” I ask Alosha whether the merchants have to pay twice if two protection rackets are operating at the same place: “No. The guy says he's paying so- and-so, and the boys settle the matter between themselves.” No one of course believes that these rackets provide any real protection, although Alosha says that they watch over peoples' things sometimes. When I ask whether “the boys” carry weapons, Alosha advises me not to ask stupid questions. The people in the protection racket like to give you the impression that they're a branch of the mafia. Sasha, a kiosk operator, says that's not the case: if the real mafia wants to do business somewhere, it doesn't let the protection rackets in on the action. Sasha has quite a background. First he was a physicist, then he was sent to the Gulag, and now, in his own words, he is “a pioneer of Belarusan capitalism.” As befits a man of the hard sciences, Sasha carefully distinguishes between various phenomena: “Protection racket? It's a group of big, strong guys who are hungry for easy money. A mafia is a quasi-organization consisting of rich and influential people capable of causing serious, nationwide economic phenomena.” [pageend65]64 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 According to Sasha, the decrease in the black-market rate for the dollar, which went from over 100 rubles in December 1991 to about 60 in February 1992, was the work of the mafia. The purpose of this operation was to induce people to sell off their hard currency. Sasha says the mafia is involved in large- scale arms trading, and “takes care of” Russian prostitutes abroad. Though Sasha believes that the mafia constitutes a threat to the country's welfare, he thinks the word “mafia” is much overused: “A shooting in the Belarus Hotel — it's the mafia; Western cars without license plates racing late at night — the mafia; every mysterious death — the mafia. Let's keep our heads on our shoulders. We have to make a distinction between the mafia and common crime!” [pageend66]A Marine in Belarus. Behind him is a portrait of Dzherzhinsky. Photo: Yuri Rebrov [pageend67]Photo: Yuri Rebrov Veterans of Afghanistan in Belarus. [pageend68]BELARUS . 67 THERE WILL NOT BE CIVIL WAR Jan Różdżyński is an editor for the Polish weekly Spotkania. Until recently, Belarus was considered the most Soviet of all the Soviet republics. It remains so today even though it is now formally an independent state. Former members of the communist party make up 80% of the Belarusan parliament and 100% of the government. Regional administration, industrial and agricultural management, and organized labor are similarly dominated by onetime party members. Former communists hold all positions of importance, and they intend to keep them. “They are pulling on the brake as hard as they can,” says one member of the Belarusan opposition eager to increase the pace of change, “but the train won't stop now.” The Belarusan National Front (BNF), has collected the signatures of460,000 Belarusan citizens on a petition calling for a referendum to decide whether the Supreme Council, or parliament, ought to be dissolved and new elections held. Under the law, 300,000 signatures are sufficient to force a referendum. The communist nomenklatura, however, is doing everything in its power to delay the vote. Time is working against the communists, according to Zianon Pazniak. Pazniak is head of the BNF and the leader of the opposition in the Supreme Council of the Belarusan Republic. When he speaks about the confrontation between the BNF and the communists, Pazniak becomes impassioned. He proclaims himself “consciously Belarusan” and proudly points out that the BNF took the lead two years ago in calling for an end to Soviet rule in Belarus, for independence and democracy, for a free market economy, and for a national cultural renaissance. by Jan Różdżyński [pageend69]Photo: Jan Roždžynski Zianon Pazniak [pageend70]t h er e w il l n o t be c iv il w ar 69 By Pazniak's reckoning, the BNF is supported by 35% of Belarus's citizens, while no more than 3-4% support the communists. The Independent Institute for Socio-Economic and Political Studies in Minsk has come up with somewhat different figures, however. According to the Institute's most recent findings, the BNF is supported by 23% of the public and opposed by almost 20%. The Communist Party of Belarus, created after the dissolution of the CPSU, is supported by 12% of the public and opposed by 30%. Are the communists a real political force in Belarus? “The ability to influence events, ” Pazniak argues, “lies not with the communist party per se, but with the communist mafia that is keeping the government in power.” In his view, “If this mafia is eliminated, there will be nothing to prop up the government, and then the government will collapse, as has happened in several other republics.” Pazniak is not one, however, to underestimate the enemy. “The nomenklatura is preparing for elections and preparing possible candidates. Directors of factories and collectives, for example, are joining forces. They have money and power, and people are scared of them because they each control the fates of hundreds of families. With 15,000 members, the Communist Party of Belarus is the strongest of the dozen or so political parties in the country. They have already begun with scare tactics. ‘Disaster has struck,’ they recently announced in their newspaper, ‘and we must do all we can to prevent civil war.”’ Pazniak dismisses the possibility of civil war. “They used to portray us as blood-sucking monsters, and now they're trying to terrify the public with their visions of doom and disaster. But no one believes them anymore. If the referendum produces the outcome we're hoping for, and if we go on to win the elections, there will inevitably be a certain amount of political conflict and confrontation. That is, however, a far cry from civil war.” Aside from the possibility of losing power, the communists have another reason to fear the prospect of elections. The BNF's program makes clear its intention to settle accounts with the Belarusan section of the CPSU. According to Pazniak, this “fascist organization” is responsible for Belarus's dependence on Moscow, the policy of russification, the nation's economic backwardness, and the decay of Belarusan national culture. “The so-called independence we have today is also their doing, as is the fact that people are sick and tired of politics. What does it matter if there are new parties with good programs if they have no real influence among the public?” Pazniak's manifest bitterness about the political situation is directed in part toward some of the political groups that have emerged from the BNF itself. He acknowledges, though, that the low level of popular political participation is typical for societies going through a difficult socio-economic transformation. Belarus's problems are quite similar to those of the other states of the former Eastern bloc, with the difference, perhaps, that change is occurring especially slowly in Belarus. [pageend71]70 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 The survey conducted by the Independent Institute for Socio-Economic and Political Studies found that 15 % of those Questioned were sympathetic to the Peasants' Party, 7% to the Liberal Front, and about 10% to the Social Democrats, the recently reestablished successor to the party that the Bolsheviks had dissolved in 1918. The membership of these parties ranges from one to six thousand. Other new parties, such as the Christian Democrats, the Nationalists, and the Socialists, have even fewer members. The combined membership of all these parties is still smaller than that of the new communist party. Most of the members of the new parties were once members of the communist party, usually for pragmatic reasons (e.g., to advance their careers, to improve their living conditions, and so on). The Institute's sociologists believe that this attitude is a reflection of the proverbial patience and tolerance of the Belarusans; these qualities could also be interpreted, though, as evidence of conformism and a readiness to submit to whatever government happens to be in power. Pazniak does not rule out the possibility of the communists returning power. “The nomenklatura are professionals. They might well attempt to install Stanislau Shushkevich [the former communist functionary who is now head of parliament] as president.” But Pazniak believes that the results of the referendum will reflect the public's discontent with declining living standards, and he is optimistic that the referendum will result in democratic elections. The BNF has prepared a program both to develop and to democratize the country which it will implement should it win the election. Although the BNF leadership is careful to stress that an electoral victory is anything but certain, it has formed a shadow cabinet ready to assume authority in the event the BNF wins a parliamentary majority. “Even if we don't win a majority,” Pazniak says, “the elections will produce the most democratic Supreme Council in Belarus's history. And not winning a majority would not be a disaster for the BNF: there is still much for us to do.” [pageend72]BELARUS 71 IN DEFENSE OR OFFENSE? Jakub Lapatka is a writer, translator, and an activist in the Belarusan Popular Front. The following article is based on the text he presented at the Human Rights Congress in Vienna in March 1992. Each of the former republics of the Soviet Union faces unique problems, but there is one extremely dangerous problem confronting them all: the agitation of the Russian minority. Conventional wisdom holds that ethnic minorities must defend their rights against the aggression of the majority. In the former Soviet Union, however, the situation is quite the opposite: the national majorities must defend themselves against the Russian minority. The totalitarian system has fallen, but each of the successor states must confront its legacy. For seventy years Russian was the lingua franca uniting the diverse peoples of the Soviet Union. Suddenly Russian has become a foreign language in the new states. The psychological shock this change has caused the Russians in the former republics is easy to understand. The communists long hammered into their heads the notion that Russian was superior. With some justice, the average Russian living in the new states might consider recent language laws discriminatory. That does not, however, legitimate the manipulation of civic and human rights issues for political purposes. Many articles have appeared on the oppression suffered by the Russian populations of the Baltic states. The Russians established a number of organizations to defend themselves against repression. The result? Bloodshed in Vilnius and Riga. Writers in Russia have written prolifically on the subject of human rights violations suffered by Russians in the other member states of the CIS, calling particular attention to debates on language and education. True, the Russian citizens of Belarus, Lithuania, and Ukraine are now expected to learn by Jakub Lapatka [pageend73]72 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 the languages of those countries. Yet, there are numerous schools that use Russian as the language of instruction in each of those states. Moreover, many thousands of Lithuanians, Ukrainians, and Belarusans live in Russia, but how many schools there offer instruction in those languages? Not one. Civic and human rights questions have become a cover for political ambitions. Russian Cossacks claim the need to protect their rights in Moldova. The Russian ministry of foreign affairs has issued orders to the government of Latvia to change its laws on the status of Russian. And Russia's Congress of Deputies has promised “to defend the millions of Russians living outside Russia.” Hitler made similar declarations about defending the Germans living outside the confines of his Thousand-Year Reich. This situation is increasingly dangerous for the new democracies of the CIS. Russian imperialist and chauvinist instincts are clouding all reason. Politicians in the new states who try to play the Russian ethnic card meet with warm approval from Moscow. The Russian government does nothing to disavow these demagogues; its silence speaks volumes. Developments in Belarus strikingly illustrate that the position of the Russian minority is not a human rights issue but rather a political problem. Belarus is perhaps the most stable of the newly independent states to emerge from the wreckage of the Soviet Union. We have been spared bloody ethnic conflicts. Political and economic reform has been proceeding smoothly. Yet Belarusans now find themselves in the paradoxical position of having to defend the very existence of their language and culture against the attacks of leaders of the Russian minoritv and the russified ruling elite. Long ago the Bolsheviks claimed the working class had no motherland. The same might be said about today's ruling class in Belarus, about the leaders who so quickly renounced their communist beliefs after the August 1991 coup and proclaimed their commitment to democracy. Belarus has approximately 10 million inhabitants, of which 85% are Belarusans. Nearly a million Belarusans live in Russia. There are no Belarusan schools for Belarusans living in Russia, and even in Belarus itself schools using Belarusan as the language of instruction are not numerous. A long history stands behind this anomalous situation. The Great Principality of Lithuania, Rus and Zemaitiya used Belarusan as its official language for several centuries. The Statute of the Great Principality of Lithuania, one of the most impressive medieval codes of law, was written in Belarusan. The first vernacular bible in use among the Eastern Slavs was also in Belarusan. Belarus's laws were abolished after the Russian annexation (1772-1795). The Belarusan language was banned, and the use of the name “Belarus” in documents and newspapers was prohibited. All individuals of authority — priests, governors, officials of all ranks — were appointed by the central government. No effort was spared to russify the conquered nation. [pageend74]Distributing the newspaper "Democrat" in Belarus, February 1991. Photo: Yuri Rebrov [pageend75]74 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 Stalin and his successors not only continued in this tradition, they were far more successful than the czarists. During Stalin's terror, some 1.8 million Belarusans were murdered. Teachers, scientists, writers, and poets were exterminated en masse. Another 2.5 million Belarusans were killed during the Second World War. Under the communists, teaching at the universities and institutes was exclusively in Russian. Only in the countryside were schools allowed to use Bela- rusan as the language of instruction. The official Soviet version of the past made no mention of Belarus's former statehood. In 1991, after two centuries of systematic efforts to eradicate our language, history, and culture, Belarus regained its independence. Under the recently adopted law on citizenship, all individuals living in Belarus at the time independence was declared are full citizens of Belarus, regardless of ethnicity. Non- Belarusans have exactly the same rights as Belarusans. The law on language is extremely fair, allowing ten years for full implementation of measures to make Belarusan the language of the nation. Yet it was the law on language that inflamed the passions of Belarus's Russian minority. Russian agitators quickly set up such organizations as White Russia and Slavic Council that refuse to recognize Belarusan statehood, much less independence, and proclaim Belarus a part of “Great Russia. ” They also encourage the public to avoid learning Belarusan. Their newspapers and magazines are filled with articles about alleged violations of the rights of Russians, particularly their right to study in Russian-language schools. To assess the veracity of these allegations consider the typical city of Navapolacak. The city has 100,000 inhabitants, of whom approximately 80% are Belarusans. There are 13 schools in Navapolacak — and only one uses Belarusan as the language of instruction! Opening that one school required a considerable struggle and provoked endless clamor from the town's Russian minority. I am well-acquainted with this fight because I am a member of the city council and chairman of its commission on education and culture. The situation in the nearby city of Polacak is quite similar. Polacak's Russians wrote the United Nations to complain of the violation of their human rights when the city opened its one Belarusan school. This pattern has been repeated across Belarus. Russian groups issue appeals for help and try to sway public opinion in Russia and the West. They succeed in provoking outrage in Russia, while the West remains ignorant of the actual facts of the matter. Most ethnic Russians living in Belarus are willing to learn our language and to respect our laws. But a small handful of agitators, perhaps with Moscow's backing, are using claims of human rights violations to advance their own political agenda. Events in Moldova stand as evidence of the results of such agitation. The actions of these communist Russian demagogues threaten our newly independent state and all the other states of the CIS. [pageend76]HUNGARY 75 interview with András Kovács András Kovács is a sociologist, a historian, and an adviser to the Federation of Young Democrats (FIDESZ). He was interviewed in June by Uncaptive Minds editor Irena Lasota. THERE HAS NOT BEEN A REVOLUTION One of the difficult challenges confronting Eastern Europe today is deciding whether or how to bring former communists and their secret agents to justice. Behind this problem lies a fundamental question: has Eastern Europe broken completely with communism, or is a new political order evolving from the communist state? Which do you think applies to Hungary? The Hungarian experience is similar to that of the other countries of Eastern Europe in that there has not been a revolution, but rather a gradual transition from communism to post-communism. This transition was not set off by pressure from a mass movement, but rather by changes within the communist world in general. When did this transition begin? Can you pinpoint a particular moment? I would say that the process began with the establishment of independent organizations in early 1988. First, there was the Hun- UM KOVACS UM KOVACS [pageend77]76 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 garian Democratic Forum (MDF), which began as a loose association of independent or semi-independent intellectuals. Shortly after that, in March 1988, first FIDESZ was established and then the Network of Independent Initiatives, which later became the Alliance of Free Democrats (SzDSz). At that point, it was not clear whether we would bring about the total collapse of communism or initiate a transition to some sort of new system, some sort of compromise between the communists and the new independent groups. The three main independent opposition organizations had slightly different positions. The Hungarian Democratic Forum initially did not want to become a political party; they wanted to concentrate on a few issues, above all the so-called national issue. In a sense, they wanted to function as a pressure group in coalition with reformist and nationalist communists. They were mainly concerned with the fate of the Hungarian minorities in neighboring countries. FIDESZ, on the other hand, argued that the Hungarian constitution did not prohibit the creation of independent parties and organizations, and thus if such parties weren't forbidden, they ought to be recognized as legal. The Network of Independent Initiatives was mainly concerned with creating pressure groups in order to build free areas of social life. Meanwhile, the communists were split between reformers like Imre Pozsgay, Rezsó Nyers, and Gy- ula Hom, on the one side, and, on the other, more dogmatic hardliners. The independent organizations were able to use the reform communists as allies. In 1988 and 1989, there was speculation that the liberalization movement in Hungary was being directed by Moscow, which was trying out a new policy in Eastern Europe. Hungary, according to this theory, was to be a test case for a strategy to bring Eastern Europe closer to the West. There were talks, for example, about the possibility of withdrawing Soviet troops and of Hungary leaving the Warsaw Pact. Moscow's strategy was undone, however, by the course of events. What do you think of this theory? UM Well, it sounds logical, but there is no real evidence that such a conspiracy existed. The event that was the major turning point was the Bush-Gorbachev meeting in Malta in 1989. It became clear then that there was a greater chance for change than before. That doesn't necessarily mean that a revolution did not occur in Hungary, but change did begin with the collaboration with the reformed communists. “Collaboration” is too strong a word — let's say change KOVACS [pageend78]INTERVIEW: KOVÁCS 77 began with the involvement of the reform communists. That made for an important continuity. There was not a complete break with communism; the independent organizations used the reformed communists to create a situation that would enable them to progress further. So gradually a sort of continuity developed between the old system and the new. The reform communists now argue that they created the opportunity for changing the system and that without them it would not have been possible. There is some truth to that: their involvement was an important factor in the transition from communism. Another important factor was that the communist system in Hungary was not like the rigid and repressive systems that existed in East Germany, Czechoslovakia, or Poland. Intellectuals were not imprisoned, and oppositionists were relatively free to leave the country. Persecution was comparatively limited in Hungary. The political police did not have a major influence on the life of the country. Naturally there was surveillance. Materials printed by the opposition were often confiscated. And the police kept files on many people. But the police were not allowed to act independently. They were under the control of the political authorities, and the authorities had differing points of view. That opened up quite a lot of room for maneuver, hence the gradual nature of the transition from communism. The participation of the reform communists has resulted in a situation in which the problem of weeding out the old communists has to be looked at very carefully. The negotiations between the opposition and the communists in Hungary were quite different from those in Poland. In Poland, the negotiations produced the round-table agreements, and nobody knows quite what guarantees were given to the communists in the process. The result of the opposition's negotiations with the communists in Hungary, on the other hand, was free elections. The democratic forces in Hungary did not give the communists any sort of guarantees, as far as I know, and that seemed to make for a freer discussion. Exactly. I think it was a huge advantage for Hungary that our round- table talks started later than Poland's. A great deal happened during that year — the meeting in Malta, for instance. By the summer of 1989, the purpose of talks with the authorities was to arrange for free elections and not to accept something along the lines of the Polish formula. UM KOVÁCS [pageend79]78 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 There was, however, the unresolved issue of a presidential versus a parliamentary system. The round-table discussions on constitutional changes were very useful in achieving a real parliamentary system with free elections. But some opposition groups signed a compromise agreeing to grant the president certain executive powers and to have him elected by popular vote. The communists thought that this compromise would work to their advantage. If there was a revolution, and I don't think I would use that term, it occurred when four parties — FIDESZ, the Social Democrats, the Alliance of Free Democrats (SzDSz), and the Smallholders' Party — refused to sign the agreement and called for a referendum. As you know, they ended up with only a tiny majority, but they still won the referendum. The three parties that demanded the referendum wanted the president to be chosen by parliament because they wanted a more representative president. And they won. That made it impossible for Pozsgay to become president, and that's when the compromise collapsed. If you want to talk of a revolution in Hungary, I would argue that it rested on two events. The first was Imre Nagy's reinterment in June 1989, which signaled the old system's loss of legitimacy, and the second was the referendum in the autumn of that year. So it would be accurate to say that the referendum really took away the communists' advantage; afterwards, they were no longer in a position to dictate what the new Hungary would look like. UM KOVACS Precisely. Very soon after the new parliament was elected in March 1990, discussion began on what to do about former communists in positions of authority. What has come of this discussion? UM Let me first describe the legal and political situation that has shaped the discussion. Hungary does not have a new constitution. The political sections of the old constitution have been removed, but we have not adopted a new constitution. The penal code and civil law have undergone minor changes, but remain essentially the same. One political event was of major consequence. In late 1989, an officer of the political police went over to the opposition and KOVACS [pageend80]INTERVIEW: KOVÁCS 79 released documents on how the political police maintained surveillance on legal organizations. This produced a major scandal. The political police realized they didn't have long to act, and so they began shredding documents. Since the influence of the political police was more limited in Hungary than in other communists countries, there were fewer files to be destroyed, and thus the police succeeded in getting rid of most of the really important documents. Following this scandal, two SzDSz deputies, Demszky and Hack, proposed during the first session of the new parliament that all who hold positions requiring an oath of allegiance to the state must undergo investigation. If someone's name turned up on a list of secret collaborators, he could resign his office, in which case the fact of his collaboration would not be made public. But if that person were to refuse, his name would be published. UM That would apply to members of parliament? KOVACS Yes, the law has to apply to all holders of official positions. UM Judges, ministers, and the like? KOVACS Yes, and municipal leaders such as mayors and prefects. The parties in the government kept trying to postpone making a decision by arguing that the lists were not complete and had been tampered with. Some names could have been deleted, some names might have been added at the last minute. Many in parliament, including some members of the opposition, also argued that investigations would catch only the small fry, not the really important agents. And the investigations would not touch the major communist leaders. Horn, Nyers, and Pozsgay had access to the reports of the political police up to the end of 1989, and today they sit in parliament as representatives of a major party. But since they were not secret agents and had acted under valid laws, they cannot be punished. That is the situation in Hungary. We could have tried something along the lines of what they did in Czechoslovakia and prohibit everyone who had held office above a certain rank in the old system from government office for a number of years. But that would have been extremely difficult because of the gradual transition from communism in Hungary and the role the communists played in the transition. The reform communists could say, “Yes, [pageend81]Photo: Eva Kapitany An early FIDESZ demonstration against building the Nagymaros dam. [pageend82]INTERVIEW: KOVÁCS 81 UM KOVACS UM we belonged to the party, but we were working for your interests. This way of dealing with us is unacceptable.” So the role of the communists in the transition became a factor in the discussion. There was never an open discussion on what to do with communists and their collaborators in Poland, in either the parliament or the press. Instead, two opposing camps made emotional appeals to certain sets of values. Was there anything resembling a real discussion in Hungary? There was a certain amount of discussion of the Demszky-Hack proposal. Everyone was very cautious, however, since even the opposition parties were not keen to destroy social peace. In other words, they did not want to get involved in a symbolic fight at a time when very important political and economic decisions were being made. These were difficult decisions, and introducing the issue of communist collaborators could have opened the way for populist demagoguery. It is all well and good to say that all communist officials above a certain rank must resign their positions, but the average person is much more concerned about the privileges communist officials enjoyed — the villas, the special pensions, and the rest. Here again, though, there are complications. For instance, a deputy department head of the Central Committee living in a modest flat in Budapest would be subject to punishment, while a local party secretary out in the country somewhere with a huge house would not be touched by the proposed legislation because he was not of high enough rank. The distribution of economic advantage did not correspond to the distribution of political power. Were the communists, both those in and out of parliament, able to impede the redistribution of the party's holdings? In Poland, to continue with our comparison, one of the arguments put forward in support of lustration is the widespread suspicion that the communists have held on to economic power, and until it is taken from them they will continue to have considerable political power. KOVACS The former political elite is transforming itself into an economic elite in Hungary and they are doing so by taking advantage of the new privatization laws. The communists were in the most advantageous position to exploit new opportunities. The former director of a big factory, for instance, could quite possibly end up as the [pageend83]82 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 new director of that same factory after privatization. It is a simple matter to punish individuals who committed crimes under the old laws; the problem is what we should do about those who have not violated any of the laws, old or new, and have still preserved their privileges. Discussion of this problem entered a second stage at the beginning of this year. Two representatives of the MDF proposed a law governing crimes committed between 1945 and 1956 and during the 1956 revolution, such as politically motivated murder and high treason. The question of high treason was both very important and very sensitive because high treason was defined as activity in the interests of a foreign power. Only the Czechs have touched upon the question of whether having collaborated with the Soviets constitutes high treason, and the related question whether the communist regime was an illegal system of occupation. None of the East European countries has really dealt with these questions. Did the Hungarian parliament adopt the proposed law on high treason? Had it been passed, all the communists would have been liable to punishment. But that would h ve created another legal problem on account of Hungary's very strict statute of limitations. That period is thirty years, which means that all those crimes are no longer punishable. Even murder? Even murder. The proponents of this law argued that the statute of limitations should not apply in this instance because the individuals ihvolved were not liable to prosecution under the communist system. A parliamentary majority accepted the law as it stood. The president, however, did not sign it and instead sent it to the constitutional court, which nullified it. The court pointed out that both legal and moral arguments had to be taken into account. Morally, it argued, these acts were crimes and the individuals involved should have been punished. But there is also the rule of law to be considered. In the current situation, the court decided, the stability of the legal system is a more important consideration than the moral issues at hand. As a result UM KOVÁCS UM KOVACS [pageend84]INTERVIEW: KOVÁCS 83 of the gradual transition from communist rule, there was no break in legal continuity , and we cannot risk the stability of the legal system. For that reason, the court declared the law to be unconstitutional. So in effect the constitutional court proclaimed the continuity from the previous regime to the current government. The court assumed, in other words, that from 1948 to 1989 Hungary had a legal system that was perhaps bad but nonetheless legitimate, and that system had to be maintained. Is that accurate? UM Not exactly. That was not the court's argument. It argued that the stability of the legal system was a given because there had not been a revolution. And since it's a given, it had to be accepted. It was not a legal argument. KOVACS What did the public think about this issue? UM KOVACS This issue was not really a major concern among the public at large. If you were to ask someone on the street if the communists ought to be punished, he would probably answer, “Why not?” But if you were to ask the same person to list the most important political problems facing the country, he would not mention reckoning with the communists as one of them In a recent opinion poll, a representative sample of the Hungarian pubic was asked whether the communists' crimes were serious enough to deserve punishment, and whether they agreed that there were more pressing problems than to worry about crimes that occurred a long time ago. The majority responded “yes” to both questions, which was completely contradictory If you ask whether the communists should be punished, people will say yes; if you ask whether it would be better to concentrate on other matters, people will say yes. That is the typical response to this issue. Then there is the question of how trials ought to be conducted. Some people argued that certain individuals might be accused and brought to trial although there was no evidence to use against them. There is some truth to this argument; many crimes occurred long •ago, and many documents have disappeared Consequently, those who were actually responsible for murders and assassinations could very well end up being acquitted on account of insufficient evidence. To avoid the problems of formal trials and sentencmg, the presi- [pageend85]UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 UM KOVACS UM KOVACS dent proposed to create a fact-finding commission to investigate all these cases. This commission was conceived as an informal moral court that would issue a report of its findings. Parliament set aside the president's proposal, but now it has to debate a new law on the police and will be forced to deal with the issue of secret collaborators. I think that at least the members of parliament will have to undergo investigation. There is, however, a basic moral problem here. Members of the major political parties will probably escape punishment, and only minor agents will be caught. A similar argument against lustration was put forward in Czechoslovakia. But surely, even if you can't catch the major figures, the small fry are better than nothing. A doctor, for instance, wouldn't refuse to treat one illness just because there are others he can't cure. Yes, but if you consider the problem further, you'll realize that the problem of minor agents is very difficult. Many of them, for example, were blackmailed into collaborating. That was the case with some of the agents that I have known. But that doesn't mean that such individuals should still be allowed to participate in politics. Let's move on to economic issues. As you know, the West regards Hungary and Czechoslovakia as models of a successful transition to a free market economy, and both countries have attracted foreign investment. How does the transition appear from a Hungarian perspective? This is partly a political issue and partly an economic issue. I will concentrate on the political aspects. All the parties are more or less agreed that privatization must go ahead. Rapid privatization, however, creates a very favorable situation for the old nomenklatura. The question is whether we are willing to pay that price. Initially the Hungarian Democratic Forum [the strongest party in the governing coalition] was in favor of rapid privatization. Then it came to realize that “directed privatization” — in other words, politically controlled privatization — had certain advantages. It could fill important positions with its own people, who could use them for political purposes. So a sort of centralized privatization began to take place under the control of a state agency. Besides centrally controlled privatization there was also spontaneous privatization .. 84 [pageend86]INTERVIEW: KOVÁCS 85 By “spontaneous” do you mean open bidding and the like? UM KOVACS No. Factories and firms were turned into share-issuing companies, then the shares were sold. The state agency for privatization had to approve the sale, but the management could choose its own directors. There were differences in the ways shares could be sold based upon value. Political considerations led to tighter government control over the privatization process. The government now maintains that a certain amount of property must remain in state hands and that the state must keep a certain percentage of shares in particular firms. Other firms may be freely privatized, but then they face the problem of the lack of capital. The amount of capital available from domestic sources is very limited. There is not enough credit. Because risks are so great, banks are keeping interest rates high. Inflation is also high. UM Has Hungary considered a Czechoslovak-style voucher system of privatization, that is, distribution of a given number of shares, or coupons for shares, to each adult citizen? KOVACS No. UM What were the political and moral justifications for that decision? KOVACS Some economists proposed voucher schemes. Others argued that this method of distribution would not put state property in the hands of the most capable and competent entrepreneurs. Another argument against share vouchers was that the country needed the revenue from the sale of state firms to pay off the national debt. UM Has property that had been confiscated under the communists been returned to the original owners? KOVACS That is another important issue. The debate began in 1990. First there was the question of the reprivatization of land. The Democratic Forum was initially against agricultural reprivatization and [pageend87]86 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 19 9 2 UM KOVÁCS favored compensation instead. But the other members of the governing coalition, especially the Smallholders' Party, put pressure on the Democratic Forum to accept the law to reprivatize land. The first law the parliament passed dealt with compensation for property confiscated at different times: between 1945 and 1949, after 1949, and so on. According to this law, those who lost houses and factories were to receive compensation, and land would be returned. The constitutional court nullified this law, however, on the basis that it was not justifiable to distinguish between different categories of owners in this way. A second law allowed for claims for compensation for property confiscated from 1939 on. The first laws annulling civic and property rights were the laws against the Jews, and Jewish property was expropriated between 1939 and 1945. So Jews who left Hungary and now live abroad or their descendants can now claim compensation? It's more complicated than that. The expropriations that occurred in 1948-49 are clear: the communists were responsible. But after 1945, there was a general land reform. Large estates were confiscated from their owners and parceled out to the peasantry. The peasants, in turn, were forced to give up this land when the communists collectivized agriculture in 1948-49. According to the law on compensation and restitution, the big landowners should in principle be given back the lands they lost in 1945. This argument is based on the idea of the absolute right of property. Then some people began to argue that perhaps the Rakoczi family should be given back the lands the Habsburgs seized from them at the beginning of the eighteenth century, and perhaps the Slavs should get back the lands they lost in Hungary when the Hungarian tribes first entered the region. Where do we draw the line? Finally there was an agreement that 1939 was a reasonable limit. But then we had to deal with the problem of property that had been destroyed, such as factories, or had been sold to new owners. What would happen, for example, to the tenants of a house when the owner arrived to reclaim it? It was a mess; it was impossible to find a just solution. At that point, arguments for compensation rather than restitution began to make more sense. But the Smallholders were still pushing hard for reprivatizing land, even though many peasants were not as keen to have their lands restored to them as might be expected. Hungary is in the midst of an agricultural recession, and everyone involved in agriculture [pageend88]FIDESZ demonstration in front of the Chinese embassy after the Tiananmen Square massacre. Photo: Gábor Rózsa [pageend89]88 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 UM KOVACS UM KOVACS UM KOVACS knows quite well the difficulties of making a living from the land. Many old proprietors are no longer living on the land. There has been a huge migration to the cities in recent decades. Before the war, the population was 60% rural and 40% urban; today, we have the inverse, 30% rural and 70% urban. We are no longer an agricultural society. As a result, many proprietors prefer to stay in the cities and lease their land to peasants, and many of the peasants now working the land have never been landowners. The people involved in agriculture are not landowners, and the landowners are not involved in agriculture. One of the laws recently passed, basically a law on restitution, states that owners and their direct descendants may receive compensation from the state. Compensation is progressive: small landholders will receive more than large landholders. Do you mean that some people will recoup 100% of the value of their land, while others will receive only a fraction? Yes, exactly. The big proprietors will end up getting almost nothing. The peasants will be able to use the compensation they receive to buy back their lands from the current proprietors. Are they allowed to buy back only land that had once been theirs, or can they buy any piece of land they wish? They can buy whatever land they can afford. People who are not in agriculture may use the compensation vouchers they receive to buy shares in state-owned firms. Older people who were not property owners may transform their vouchers into a sort of old age pension. Residents of state-owned apartments may use theirs to buy their apartments. In addition, these compensation vouchers arc quoted on the stock exchange, where they can be bought and sold. How has the public received this program? Are people satisfied with it? Well, most Hungarians were not affected by this legislation at all; the program concerned mainly the peasantry. The old bourgeoisie hardly exists any more; its members have either died off or cm- [pageend90]INTERVIEW: KOVÁCS 89 igrated. Young people were not directly affected, since they are not and never have been landowners. The high cost of this program is, however, creating problems for the state budget and will contribute to inflation. As a result, many Hungarians are complaining that the budget is strained enough at the moment and cannot bear this extra burden. For the majority of the population, the consequences of the law on restitution will not be favorable. There is a moral argument to take into consideration. Of course it is morally right that former landowners be compensated for what they lost. But compensation does not necessarily mean restitution. Setting a time limit is difficult, as is distinguishing between legitimate and illegitimate expropriations. The break-up of the big estates after 1945 was carried out by the democratically elected government at the time, so in a sense it was a legitimate expropriation. It's hard to say what was and wasn't legitimate. Trying to unravel all the complications will have generally disadvantageous economic consequences for the majority of the population. For that reason, FIDESZ proposed that former owners who are still alive should receive a pension and not any other form of compensation. UM What is FIDESZ's position on policy toward the Hungarian minorities in Romania and Slovakia ? To what extent are these minorities a political issue in Hungary? KOVACS The Hungarian minority abroad has been an issue in the past, of course, and remains an important and legitimate issue today. It is perhaps not the most important issue in the eyes of the public, though it is a factor on the political scene. I think the Hungarian minority could become a much more important issue in the future on account of changes taking place in neighboring countries, in Slovakia and Yugoslavia. The largest Hungarian minority lives, of course, in Transylvania. That problem has by no means been solved yet, and it may very well become explosive again in the future. The main issues are collective rights and self-government. FIDESZ supports collective rights for minorities. We believe, first, that a peaceful solution to the minorities issue must be found, and, secondly, that there has to be a certain give-and-take on both sides. If the minorities gain collective rights, the state must recognize that it has given up sovereignty on certain matters. Conversely, the minorities must provide some sort of guarantee that they will not use these collective rights for the purpose of secession. [pageend91]90 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 UM Does FIDESZ insist that existing borders must not be changed? KOVACS Yes. That 4s why we made this proposal: the state's loss of some of its sovereignty in exchange for a guarantee against secession. Self-determination stops short of secession. UM Romanian newspapers, and not just strongly nationalistic papers like Romania Mare, routinely print articles suggesting that important political forces in Hungary are intent on taking Transylvania back, that Hungary is still a major threat, and so on. KOVACS These accusations have no basis in truth; the groups that hold such views are politically insignificant. So far, the Hungarian government has been quite moderate on minority issues and has more or less followed the West. In the case of Yugoslavia, for instance, the government realized that if it took a militant stance, the situation of the Hungarian minority would deteriorate. So it went along with the rest of the international community. I think that Hungary's politicians realize that by becoming involved in minority problems, they risk losing the West's backing in other areas and their advantageous standing with the West. If, on the other hand, they are cautious and follow the rest of the world their position with the West is secure. If there is any grain of truth to the Romanian accusations, it is only because from time to time the government makes stupid and irresponsible statements on the subject. According to one stupid line of argument, since the Treaty of Versailles was signed not by Serbia and Slovakia, but by Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, both of which are breaking up, a new situation now exists. A second argument is that European borders have moved. The Hungarian government has always insisted that it doesn't want to change the borders by force, which leaves open the possibility that borders can be changed some other way. I think that's why the Romanians are afraid that there could be pressure, both from its Hungarian population and from the European powers, for an adjustment of its borders with Hungary. At the same time, the Romanians are not entirely consistent. They would quickly accept changes in their border with Moldova, but refuse to consider a comparable adjustment on the other side of the country. [pageend92]INTERVIEW: KOVÁCS 91 UM KOVÁCS UM KOVÁCS Let's turn to FIDESZ itself. It appears to be one of Hungary’s great success stories. People say that its popularity in the opinion polls is growing faster than its membership. How do you explain its success? That is a difficult question. I think, first, that FIDESZ is something totally new, a completely different kind of party. The source of its legitimacy is different from that of other parties. FIDESZ has no ties to the pre-communist past. The social democratic parties, the Smallholders, the Democratic Forum, and even the Free Democrats all derive at least part of their legitimacy from historical continuity. FIDESZ 's legitimacy derives from the emergence of human rights issues during the 1970s and 1980s. The social groups behind FIDESZ were products of the communist system in that they were the groups who managed to create islands of normalcy within that communist system. They produced a sub-culture of young people tired of the careers open to them in the system, young people who tried to do something in a private, less controlled political and economic sphere. The current discussions about what is wrong with the Hungarian state and the quest for historical legitimacy are very strange to these young people. They arc pragmatic, and their pragmatism goes beyond politics to everyday life. They simply want to live normal lives like people in the West. But I think FIDESZ is also ideological, in that we claim to represent human rights. That, not the nation, not the liberalism of the past two centuries, was our starting point. Of course, FIDESZ advocates a capitalist economy, a pluralist democracy, and the idea of civil society. Is FIDESZ ideologically a liberal party, then, in the sense that it holds the freedom of the individual paramount? I think the relation between ideology and politics in FIDESZ is not quite the same as in other parties. The ideology of human rights defines the limits of politics for us, and we believe we should never stray beyond those limits. But within those limits, political decisions must be pragmatic. Political decisions should not be determined by ideological considerations. Ideology defines the limits of politics, but is not a system of axioms from which you can deduce practical political decisions.

She wrote the following article for Uncaptive Minds in July 1992. When Lech Walesa won the presidential elections in November 1990, he promised to make a definitive break with communism. Among other things, he declared he would tear up the 1989 round-table accords. Contrary to his promises, however, the president has failed to implement decommunization — and he has been actively hostile to those who would. After the October 1991 parliamentary elections, Walesa reluctantly settled on Jan Olszewski, a man genuinely committed to decommunization, as the new prime minister. Olszewski was faced with a daunting task: he had to put together a government from a parliament with 29 parties, none of which held more than 13 % of the seats. After protracted negotiations, he managed to form a minority center-right government. Further negotiations to broaden the government, which lasted for nearly the duration of Olszewski's stay in office, never panned out. So the Olszewski government was weak from the start. The need to make urgent decisions on economic matters, and thus to make all sorts of concessions so as to get its legislative initiatives through parliament, sapped what little strength the government had to implement its political agenda. On account of these concessions, and the unsuccessful negotiations to broaden the government coalition, the public increasingly perceived Olszewski's administration as ineffective, indecisive, and rudderless. In fact, one of Olszewski's failings was public relations. He kept much information about the coalition negotiations secret — information he could have by Urszula Doroszewska [pageend95]94 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 used to portray his efforts in a more favorable light. He failed to publicize the government's clashes with the remaining communist structures. In general, he was poor at communicating his ideas through the media. But Olszewski wasn't the only one to blame for his image problems — the media were also responsible. Few in the national media could tolerate the center-right, and especially the Christian parties, that belonged to Olszewski's coalition. The press was particularly unfair. The post-communist papers — which are surprisingly influential — embarked on a vicious, often vulgar campaign against the government. The other left-wing papers also attacked the government. The man in the street, worn out by the endless economic crisis, was ready to believe the media's portrayal of the situation: an idle government, politicians squabbling for power with no regard for the national interest, reform going nowhere. The government's modest achievements were often ignored, and when they weren't, the government wasn't given much credit for them. It succeeded in restoring the line of credit from the International Monetary Fund, which had been cut when the previous government failed to live up to its obligations. The Olszewski government introduced import licences for fuel, cigarettes, and alcohol, measures which put a halt to much black-market activity. A special fund was set up to help farmers repay crushing debts. The prime minister managed to get a budget passed, a task that required enormous political skill on account of his government's minority status. Finally, under Olszewski's administration, the decline in industrial production came to an end, and exports began to pick up. But despite his successes, almost no one outside Olszewski's coalition was satisfied. And few less so than the man in Belweder Palace, Lech Walesa. From the beginning it was clear that the president would not make things easy for Olszewski. Before long, Walesa was harping on the government for its supposed foot-dragging, claiming to speak for “ordinary people” who just wanted “things to get better.” The president threatened to dissolve the Sejm (he backed off when reminded he had not dissolved the previous Sejm, 65% of whose seats had been reserved for the communists and their allies). He met with political groups outside parliament — and even the communists, who now call themselves social democrats. Walesa, however, limited his attacks to words and vague political maneuvers until what became known as the “Parys Affair” broke out. Jan Parys was the defense minister in the Olszewski government. He was the first civilian to hold the post, but more importantly, the first defense minister determined to rid Poland's armed forces of communist influence. Three days after his appointment, he retired Admiral Piotr Kolodziejczyk, his predecessor at the defense ministry, from active service. The prime minister backed him up. It was said that ‘ ‘even Jaruzelski thought Kolodziejczyk was controlled by Moscow.” Walesa, on the other hand, publicly supported the admiral, stating that “he had always been very, very pleased” with him. Parys took further [pageend96]OLSZEWSKI'S GOVERNMENT 95 steps that displeased the president, or the president's National Security Bureau: he dismissed two deputy ministers from the old military establishment, appointed a Polish-bom British citizen to replace one of them, and advocated a defense posture at odds with the “Presidential Doctrine.” (Parys wanted to station the bulk of Polish forces along the eastern border, whereas Walesa wanted to spread them evenly around the country's frontiers.) Two broad issues underlaid the sparring between Olszewski's Ministry of Defense and Walesa's National Security Bureau. One, of course, is decommunization; Walesa thought people from the former establishment could be trusted in high posts, but Parys thought they couldn't. The other issue is constitutional: who has the right to decide what? The Polish constitution was written in the 1950s by a Stalinist government and has been only haphazardly amended since. One of those amendments, which stemmed from the 1989 “round-table” accords, created the new post of president. Because the post was designed to be filled by Jaruzelski — who was to pilot the ship of state through the uncharted waters of the transition period or, depending on your point of view, safeguard Moscow's interests at a time when the local communists were weakening — the scope of the president's powers was left unclear. They include “control” over the armed forces and responsibility for the “sovereignty and security” of the state. The defense ministry, a body subordinate to parliament, also has control over the armed forces, but the constitution has nothing to say about how control is divided between these two branches of government. The two previous heads of Solidarity governments, Tadeusz Mazowiecki and Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, had consulted with Walesa in the selection of the defense ministers, and at least Bielecki's defense ministry had cooperated with Walesa's National Security Bureau. But in the absence of this spirit of cooperation, the lack of clearly demarcated powers was a crisis waiting to happen. On April 6, Parys dropped his bombshell: the minister publicly stated that “certain politicians’ ’ had been preparing to ‘ ‘overthrow democracy in Poland’ ’ and “take power by force.” The politicians he was referring to turned out to be in the National Security Bureau. The president asked the prime minister for Parys's immediate dismissal. Olszewski stated he was certain his defense minister's charges were “not without some justification,” but he bowed to pressure and gave Parys a two-week forced vacation. Parys persisted in his accusations, and finally was relieved of his duties permanently. Was there some truth to what Parys said? We may never know for sure. Walesa had a simple reply to the former defense minister's allegations: the armed forces were under the president's control, so his representatives were free to maintain contacts of any sort with whomever they wished within the armed forces. [pageend97]96 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 The Paris Affair triggered a flood of articles. Some took the president's view, portraying Parys as a hysterical amateur, or worse, a provocateur; others blamed the lack of constitutional clarity. But there was another interpretation that held that Parys was right to make his revelations. In this view, the president had made too many enemies in parliament and was losing his ability to play one political group off another, a technique he had long used to his advantage. Faced with the prospect of losing control over the Polish political scene, he — or at least his advisors — had begun to seek support outside parliament, in particular, in the post-communist structures of the armed forces. Those who hold this view believe that Mieczyslaw Wachowski, Walesa's former chauffeur and currently his closest advisor, is playing a particularly sinister role. Lech Kaczynski, who was formerly Walesa's closest advisor, said in January that “Wachowski, by giving people the impression that he is acting as the president's representative, has been able to put together a network of contacts; he has created an invisible structure in the army that is a potential threat to the political order.” In an interview conducted in April, Lech's brother Jaroslaw, leader of the Center Alliance party, was even more alarmed: “Wachowski, who has no political qualifications, has embarked on a very specific line of political activity. His aims are clear: to preserve and strengthen communist structures in the army and hinder Poland's relations with NATO, and for a certain period of time with Prague and Budapest as well, in order to create a joint command of all the post-communist armed forces. This would be extremely dangerous in the event of radical changes in the East, especially since Wachowski's actions have about them an air of being externally influenced. I have no proof of any of this, just my own conviction.” The president and the prime minister were also at odds on a number of foreign policy issues. One of them was Poland's relationship to NATO and the EC: while the Olszewski government was committed to building the closest possible relationship with the Western defense alliance and to speeding Poland's entrance into the European Community, Walesa made the extraordinary though vague announcement that he intended to create a second NATO and a second EC. Significantly, the new structures would be open to Russia. These proposals completely undercut the Olszewski government's strategy of strengthening the Visegrad Triangle (the loose alliance between Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary). The political scientist Jadwiga Staniszkis made the following assessment of Walesa's foreign policy initiative: “Despite the crisis, the Russians are attempting to reconstruct the Eastern bloc. They see the Visegrad Triangle as a threat. Consequently, any steps Poland takes to break up this triangle will be in line with Moscow's policy. The positive attitude of NATO and the EC towards Parys was due to his efforts to integrate the triangle militarily and to broaden it to include Ukraine. Thus the conflict between Olszewski and Parys [pageend98]• In 1 992 w e ar e c eIeBr at ín q t w o an n ív er s ar íes of qREAT Impo r t anc e Fo r Jewish ANd Polish c uIt ur e: The c en t enar y of Br u no Schulz biRTh ANd Thu 5Chh ann iv er sar y of his dEATh.

Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski, a holdover from the previous two Solidarity governments, saw to it that a draft of the treaty mentioned that the military bases left behind by the Russians would be taken over by Polish-Russian joint ventures. Skubiszewski explained that the Russians would not budge on this point, but the rest of the Olszewski government refused to allow Skubiszewski to put such a clause into the treaty, and it was removed. Strangely enough, when Walesa signed the treaty on May 22 — after receiving repeated admonitions from the government not to make any concessions in this matter — he met no resistance from Yeltsin at all. Why such a fuss over these Polish-Russian joint ventures? The former Soviet bases in Poland, which encompass sizeable pieces of land, are still beyond Polish control. The Russian forces that occupy them may be beyond the control of the Russian government. Thus they make perfect sites for large-scale smuggling operations to the West. A number of allegations have been made claiming that this is indeed the case, and that the Russian military establishment is making huge profits from these operations. The establishment of Polish- Russian joint ventures would only perpetuate, and even facilitate, the smuggling. They would thus be a potential threat to the security of the Polish state. Though Olszewski appeared to get his way in the question of the joint ventures, an interview granted by General Dubynin, until recently commanderin-chief of the former Soviet armed forces in Poland, appeared to deny the former prime minister even this modest victory. In the interview, which appeared in Krasnaya Zvyezda, the general questioned the Polish-Russian treaty and reasserted that Polish-Russian joint ventures should take over the military bases, citing promises that he claimed Walesa had made in Moscow. The president has yet to respond. There were many points of friction between Walesa and the Olszewski government, but the chain of events that directly led to the government's downfall was bound up with the lustration controversy [lustration is the term used for the screening of public officials for connections with the former security police]. Olszewski's interior minister, Antoni Macierewicz, insisted on the need to screen high-ranking state officials as soon as he assumed his post. This about- face in policy from previous Solidarity governments caused an uproar in the press, especially the communist and left-wing papers. He was accused of starting a “witch hunt.” His motivation was questioned, and often it was attributed to his membership in the “backward” National Christian Unity Party. The problem of collaboration with the former security services was presented from [pageend100]OLSZEWSKI'S GOVERNMENT 99 a moral point of view: because everyone shared responsibility for communism, no one deserved to be singled out for blame. Yet Macierewicz's main reason for undertaking lustration was to remove people from high state posts who were vulnerable to blackmail, and who thus endangered the security of the state. (Piotr Wierzbicki, editor of one of the few pro-government papers at the time, commented, “I'm told in the press that decommunization will lead to witch hunts. But so far, it's the witches that seem to be hunting us. ”) Moreover, Macierewicz, a co-founder of KOR [Work- ers' Defense Committee], did not go about his task in a reckless manner. His ministry worked on a law that was to govern the whole lustration process. And Macierewicz himself was adamant that only parliament could decide whether or not to disclose his ministry's findings to the public. But Macierewicz's carefully-laid plans for an orderly investigation were spoiled on May 28th, when Janusz Korwin-Mikke, leader of the Realpolitik Union, unexpectedly put a motion on the floor of parliament demanding the disclosure of the interior ministry's findings. The motion passed — albeit by a small margin, with barely enough deputies present to hold the vote — thus forcing Macierewicz to give parliament by June 4th all available information on parliamentarians and high state officials who had been in contact with the former security services. The text of this motion left much to be desired. It did not define how, or to whom, this information was to be presented; nor did it make clear who was responsible for determining the guilt of those appearing in the security services' files. The prime minister asked the chairman of the supreme court to form a commission to resolve these matters, but the events set in motion by Korwin-Mikke's resolution had already taken on a momentum of their own, and the commission was unable to carry out its task in time/ Macierewicz did not try to clear up any of the ambiguities; he explained that he felt neither qualified nor authorized to render opinions on whether the people appearing in the files had been police collaborators. On the morning of June 4th, Macierewicz handed the president, the speakers of the Sejm and Senate, and the chairmen of the parliamentary caucuses a number of sealed envelopes. They contained information about more than 60 people, including members of parliament, of Olszewski's government, and high officials in the presidential chancellery. This information was supposed to be a state secret, but within hours “lists of agents” were circulating around Warsaw. Cries of “witch hunt” became deafening. Macierewicz was accused of manipulating the files to discredit the government's enemies. The files were said to include falsifications. Walesa put a motion before parliament calling for the immediate dismissal of the government. The deputies were in such a hurry to put an end to the lustration that the usual 15 minutes debate time allotted to each caucus representative was cut to 5 minutes, and calls for a recess to allow emotions to cool were rejected. Finally, at 12:45 AM on June 5th, [pageend101]UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 parliament voted to dismiss Prime Minister Jan Olszewski's government by a margin of 273 to 119, with 33 abstentions. What were the reactions to this abrupt turn of events? General Jaruzelski declared that President Walesa had “averted a national tragedy.” Mieczyslaw Wachowski said, “Macierewicz suffers from an excessive, feverish imagination; his suspicions are almost pathological.” Jacek Kuroň of the Democratic Union went so far as to say that Macierewicz “had decided to destroy the state, because he's simply sick.” Several of the people whose names allegedly appeared on the list publicly denied that they had been collaborators. Leszek Moczulski of the Confederation for an Independent Poland was one of the best known figures on it, and he accused Macierewicz of tampering with the files. Some, such as Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski, remained silent when word got out that they had been named. It was proven that one person ended up on the list by mistake, owing to an erroneously recorded birthday. By and large, people forgot that those whose names were in Macierewicz's envelopes weren't officially accused of anything. (The contents of those envelopes remain a state secret, although they have largely been revealed.) One figure who found himself mixed up in the scandal was the president himself. Files on him were rumored to exist in a top-secret safe in the Bureau for the Protection of the State [UOP — the organization that replaced the former security police]. Supposedly, he had been recruited by the security services in the early 1970s. Walesa himself admitted in his memoirs to having “signed three or four documents” that he “was not proud of’ in those years. Nevertheless, no public accusations against Walesa were made, and, as head of state, he could have chosen to ignore the rumors. Instead, he appeared on television with a vehement rebuttal: “No, my friends, this is where you've gone too far! You'll see, Mr. ex-Minister [Macierewicz], that I still have few aces up my sleeve, and when the time comes for me to use them, you, my dear sir, will be a hospital case!” The president thereby let the entire country know he was a suspect. There were those who defended the Olszewski government and the lustration it had undertaken. A number of leading intellectuals, including the poet Zbigniew Herbert, signed the following public declaration: “On the night of the 4th to the 5th of June, parliament put its seal of approval on a political coup carried out to protect communist agents of the security services. The government of Jan Olszewski was the victim of this coup, because it had the courage to undertake the politically essential and morally justified attempt to unmask the hidden past of those who are now responsible for governing the Polish state.. .We are now witnessing a huge propaganda campaign intended to smear the authors and the executors of the parliamentary resolution concerning the 100 [pageend102]OLSZEWSKI'S GOVERNMENT 101 unmasking of former collaborators of the security services. We can oppose it only by giving our full support to the idea of revealing the truth — which, despite all the demagoguery of its opponents, can indeed be established...” (The signatories to this declaration were accused in Gazeta Wyborcza of ‘‘sowing hatred, ’ ’ while that paper's editor-in-chief, Adam Michnik, compared them to the Chinese Red Guards for their fanaticism.) After his dismissal, Olszewski said in parliament that “the interests of a certain section of ‘our’ political class have to a great extent come to be identified with those of the old nomenklatura; what has emerged is simply a common front. ’ ’ When later asked whether an era of authoritarian government was dawning in Poland, the former prime minister said, “It is not a question of what kind of government Poland will have, but of Poland's future place in Europe. Either we are a part of Europe, within the EC's sphere of influence, or we are in the CIS....” The lustration affair did not,(lie with the death of Olszewski's government, although there were efforts to kill the whole lustration process. On June 19, the Constitutional Tribunal declared the parliamentary motion on lustration null and void, arguing that it violated international human rights treaties to which Poland was a signatory. In all likelihood, however, the decision had more to do with politics than principles. Most of the Tribunal's members had been appointed during martial law, and were thus closely connected to the old communist structures that the lustrations were meant to eliminate from Polish public life. The Sejm appointed a commission to investigate the lustration affair. Upon completing its work in July, the commission found, among other things, that the whole lustration process had been a political provocation on a grand scale, intended to compromise and ultimately paralyze the highest organs of the state. However, five of the commission's members disassociated themselves from this conclusions, which they said was tendentious. (The commission's proceedings were supposed to be secret, but some interesting things were leaked to the press, such as a section of Macierewicz's purported testimony describing how Wachowski made an elaborate display of drawing his finger across his throat as a way of letting Macierewicz know what would happen to him “if so much as a shadow of suspicion falls on the president.”) The Senate, however, did not share the Sejm's negative assessment of the lustration process. On June 18th, it passed a resolution supporting, in effect, the continuation of the lustration: “The removal of former agents and collaborators of the security services from important state functions, together with the enactment of legal measures to prevent them from assuming such functions in the future, is a basic requirement of justice and an essential condition for the safe development of democracy in Poland.” The Senate also voted to draft its own law on lustration. [pageend103]UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 102 There arc good reasons to continue the lustration; moreover, many questions raised by the Olszewski government's investigation need to be answered. While there is no evidence that any of the documents have been tampered with — as the opponents of lustration have charged — it is certain that individual documents have been removed from the files. Deputy Pruchno-Wroblewski, who participated in the special Sejm commission, said “much of the material concerning prominent members of the opposition was destroyed during General Kiszczak's tenure as interior minister. The question arises why those particular documents, and not others, were destroyed.” Piotr Naimski, head of the Bureau for the Protection of the State under Olszewski, said he found strong indications that documents had been destroyed under the Mazowiecki government as late as January 1991. (The Senate has asked the prosecutor general to begin an investigation in this matter.) He also said there was conclusive evidence that many files had been stolen. These documents are almost certainly in the hands of former interior ministry officials; General Pozoga's recently published memoirs confirm this supposition. The documents, of course, can by used for blackmail, but the question by w hom and for what aims? If former employees of the security services are extorting, for'personal gain, current government officials who had collaborated. the threat to the security of the Polish state may be serious but acceptable. But if these documents are being used by foreign security services or by international, mafia-like networks to subvert the Polish state, then the threat is unacceptable. According to Macierewicz, there is the potential for such subversion. Not only were the Polish security services known to have close relations with the KGB and other East European services: the lustration in Poland unearthed traces of something called the “Interlinked System for Recognizing Enemies” [see “Police Agents in the Transition Period” in the Winter 91-92 issue of Uncaptive Minds], This system was in operation from the mid-1970s to 1989, and was the main route by which Moscow obtained information from the interior ministries of Eastern Europe. Thus any information that is missing from the archives of the Polish security services, regardless of whether it was stolen or destroyed, almost certainly exists somewhere in the former Soviet Union. Now it should be clear why Olszewski, and others, believed lustration was necessary to safeguard Polish national sovereignty. [pageend104]P O I AND 103 interview with Piotr Wierzbicki Piotr Wierzbicki is a political commentator and author of several books on politics and education. He was interviewed in early June by Ewa Polak for Uncaptive Minds. Well, I have friends in all the important political groups on the right and center, but 1 am not beholden to any of them. 1 have sacrificed so much to be an independent commentator that I would never risk my reputation by allowing some party or coterie to use me as a mouthpiece. This includes the president, about whom 1 wrote a favorable book, and the [former] prime minister, Jan Olszewski, who is a friend of mine. I defended Walesa when he was the victim of a media feeding frenzy and when both the parliament and the government were attacking him. But when he became president, I started to criticize him. I am defending Jaroslaw Kaczyňski [the chairman of the Center Alliance party] at the moment for two reasons: I like qualities he has, the same ones that I like in Walesa, in particular, the political I HAVE NEVER BEEN A PONTIUS PILATE For many years you swam against the tide. With your hooks and columns, you irritated the left intelligentsia and provoked the ire of the so-called moral authorities. But you always put your independence before your conservatism. You were never willing to follow the crowd, which often made your mission a lonely one. UM WIERZBICKI [pageend105]104 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 computer he has for a brain; also, he is suffering the same treatment by the media and the political class that Walesa was put through before the presidential elections, that is, he is made out to be a monster by the non-communistlcft and sentenced to political death because he doesn't want to go with the herd. If Kaczyňski becomes prime minister, however, I don't think I will have to make any special efforts to defend him. And of course I will stop attacking Olszewski when he steps down. UM Many people have become disillusioned with politics and especially politicians in Poland. The politicians don't stick to clear policies; they 're engaged in incomprehensible feuds and squabbles; they often seem incompetent. Aren't you worried about losing your readers' trust by taking sides as often as you do? WIERZBICK1 We need to make a distinction between two concepts: independence and neutrality. You seem to be suggesting that I should be neutral, that I should play the role of Pontius Pilate. I could play such a role ifl wanted: I could maneuver in such a way so as never to take one side or the other, and whenever a really sharp conflict arose I could take off for the mountains for a few days. But I wouldn't, because first of all it wouldn't be any fun to deprive myself of the opportunity to express my own views. I have never been a Pontius Pilate and I never will be. Perhaps there are some advantages to gagging yourself. But I simply don't have the temperament for it. UM Not long ago you defended the struggle for power that is an element of democracy. Yet many people think that the deep divisions in Polish politics and the brutal conflicts they have engendered are disastrous. W1ERZBICKI You're right — Poles arc terribly upset that their heroes are fight- ' ing among themselves. After all, the situation, in some regards, is less pleasant than it was three years ago, when there was Solidarity and there were the communists and it was very easy to choose which side to be on. It grew uncomfortable during the presidential elections, when we had to choose between two Solidarity heroes. Now it is terrible, because everyone is fighting with everyone. Even Walesa's camp has broken up. People think that things have gone [pageend106]INTERVIEW: W I E R Z B I C K I 105 too far; they don't know whom to cling to any more and they long for the days when making choices was childishly easy. Even in the West there are people who wanted the era of Solidarity to last forever, who wanted all of society to be united under the leadership of a few great Poles who all think the same and want the same thing. But I never longed for anything like that! What's happened to Polish politics is simply a return to world standards. Everywhere else the right ideas are held not just by one politician or party, but are spread around. It is no longer the case that one side to an argument is a hundred percent right, and the other a hundred percent wrong. People in the West have to choose between candidates, each of whom is capable of doing a reasonably good job — not between good guys and scoundrels. It is the same here. Politics here isn't as nice as it used to be, but that's what democracy is all about. True, if we had a better election law, parliament would have fewer parties, and the mess there wouldn't be as bad. I see other factors that have contributed to this undesirable state of affairs, but the fact that the politicians are arguing amongst themselves is not one of them. Politicians are supposed to argue; they argue, among other reasons, so we don't have to fight on the streets. Our representatives argue for us — that's the essence of democracy. Criticize them for it? Why, that's what we pay them for! As a result of their arguments, we reach agreements — although unfortunately, it can be a terribly slow process. It's regrettable that our politicians are not fully competent, and for the most part downright incompetent in economic matters. The political elites were very wise when it came to freedom of speech, but they have flunked their exams on economics. The failures of economic policy stem from Solidarity's failure to prepare an economic plan — which, after all, it had ten years to do. When we regained our independence, the political elites had no idea what to do about all those state factories... UM So the political divisions seem rational to you? Sometimes they can even be irrational. There's several Christian democratic parties, for example, and in general it's a mess, but in ten years only the strongest groups will remain. For me, this is neither strange nor regrettable — it's simply the way it has to be. Which is why the president's talk of suspending democracy WIERZBICKI [pageend107]Photo: Piotr Žycienski Piotr Wierzbicki. [pageend108]INTERVIEW: W I E R Z B I C K I 107 — that is, plenary sessions of parliament — for a year is absolutely wrong-headed and unacceptable. UM Yet many people attribute our political problems to the legacy of communism: bloated ambitions, arguments accompanied by invective, accenting differences in one's position for self-aggrandizement. Don't you find it disconcerting that so much more effort is put into emphasizing differences rather than searching for common ground? WIERZB1CKI You use the word “ambition” as if it were a pejorative term.. Why, for the love of God? Because politicians aren't supposed to be ambitious? We live in a country where the elementary values and modes of behavior of the West, especially America, are treated with, disdain. Would someone in America attack a politician by calling him “ambitious”? There it's clear that ambition is the driving force behind people who set out on grueling presidential campaigns. Another thing that Poles find so distasteful is the competition for positions. It's unseemly to go after a government post. Everything must be motivated bý higher values — the good of the nation, the good of humanity. Many of our politicians are aware of this, so they take great pains to emphasize that they are not at all interested in positions, but in the national interest. Politicians from the Democratic Union use this tactic. But I don't buy it when someone insists that they're doing something for Poland. I like those who come out and say: Yes, I want to be prime minister. At least they're not trying to fool anyone. One of my aims has been to make people understand that there is an elementary human right to make money and to pursue a career. This includes careers in politics. If we criticize our representatives for competing for ministries and other positions, it means we don't like democracy. How, after all, can democracy work if no one is allowed to compete for government posts? If we require potential office-holders to declare their selflessness and love of humanity, we're going to get liars and toadies. Politicians don't have to meet such requirements in America. A candidate for the American presidency will say, at the beginning of his first speech, “I want to be president!” It's the exact opposite here. The central problem facing our democracy is the economic catastrophe that communism has left in its wake. Owing to the severity and urgency of Our problems, there is a strong temptation to by- UM [pageend109]108 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 pass democratic procedures. What do you think of this growing desire for authoritarian, even dictatorial, solutions? WIERZBICKI In 1984-85 I wrote Thoughts of an Old-Fashioned Pole, in which — in hindsight — I came close to advocating a Solidarity dictatorship. In my analysis of the last weeks of Solidarity at the end of 1981,1 was critical of the workings of intra-union democracy, which paralyzed Walesa. I thought that martial law could have been avoided .if Walesa had been given full authority to negotiate with the communists, and if in general a more efficient executive apparatus had been set up for him. But I changed my mind a while later, after reading Churchill's monumental work on World War Two. In these volumes you can plainly see how the British prime minister had to conduct a war in which the very existence of Britain was at stake without the freedom to make any decision without consulting his cabinet. What's more, he had to constantly address parliament and explain his military disasters. Roosevelt was in a similar position; he was unable to declare war until the United States was attacked, because Congress wouldn't let him. Yet despite these hindrances, neither of these leaders ever considered suspending democracy. Stalin and Hitler, on the other hand, could do anything they wanted without ' any interference from parliaments, and look what happened. With these examples in mind, I see no reason why we should suspend parliament. If that happened, then newspapers would have to be silenced, along with everyone else who protested. It doesn't take much imagination to foresee the consequences of suspending democracy: namely terror, which would be necessary to physically shut down the various institutions of democracy. I hope that this doesn't happen, but people who are extremely embittered and disillusioned may conclude that democracy hasn't passed the test. But if that happens, then it means that our struggle with the communists was in vain, and we should have quietly led our lives and minded our own business. [pageend110]POLAND 109 THE POST-TOTALITARIAN SYNDROME The following letter was sent by Wiktor Kulerski to Irena Lasota, editor of Uncaptive Minds. Mr. Kulerski, former deputy minister of education in the Mazowiecki government and a deputy to the Sejm until October 1991, now heads the Education for Democracy Foundation in Warsaw. Warsaw, March 29, 1992 Dear Irena, In your letter, you reminded me of my promise to try to explain why “everything here is so awful and complicated and what can be done about the situation.” But the longer I view what is happening in Poland — in the villages and towns, in the provinces, in the cities, in the capital — the more reluctant I am to think about it, much less to write about it. After communism fell, the worst side of our character, all the blind and irrational instincts that had been slumbering within us, came to the surface in the most self-destructive, almost suicidal way. And it happened to all of us, regardless of class, education, profession, or status. What can be done? Nothing at all, I suspect, just as there is nothing to be done about the hole in the ozone layer. The hole in the ozone layer is just there; we created it, and there is nothing we can do about it. We can't even prevent it from growing. The aspects of Polish society we find at once so fasby Wiktor Kulerski [pageend111]UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 cinating and so horrifying are much the same. The problems stem from our actions, but we cannot control, much less solve them. The psychopathology of life in Poland and the other post-communist countries is not something I feel well-qualified to describe, even though it is something we all witness everyday. Let me tell you a Russian fable that might be helpful. There once was a miserable man who one day pleaded to God to free him from his sorrows. And God did take pity on him and promised to grant him a wish — but on the condition that whatever he requested would be given in double to his better-off neighbors. The man thought for a moment, then said, “Dear God, take out one of my eyes.” This wretched creature could well be a contemporary East European peasant or politician or intellectual. He thinks not of improving his situation, but of striking at his neighbor. Destruction has become more important than creation. There is a madness in this attitude that is terrifying; it is an obsession that borders on the suicidal. Deducing rules of behavior from observation alone is both difficult and disturbing. Perhaps the most striking and clearly visible rule governing all areas of public life in Poland — and even some areas of private life — is the dominance of personality. It is not what has been said or done that matters, but who said or did it. Depending on who that person might be, good can appear as evil and truth as falsehood. Indeed, the right person can put forward the manifestly absurd as reason of state. This rule has two corollaries. The first is the rule of the ulterior motive: any action undertaken by anyone other than myself must conceal base motives of personal interest. The implications of this rule are obvious. The second is the rule of hidden causes: the real reason behind anyone's success, other than my own, must be some dark or criminal deed that has been concealed. All means and arguments are justified in discrediting such a person, and the sooner done the better — for the public good, of course. These two rules have, in turn, corollaries of their own. There is, first, the rule of negative judgment: it is always best to judge a person negatively if possible, and if not possible, the best course is to abstain from judgment altogether. Positive judgments are to be made only to gain the approval of someone else. According to the rule of necessary and unavoidable criticism, we are dutybound to criticize others and to reject all criticism of ourselves. Neglecting this duty inevitably leads to public disapproval and suspicion of incompetence. The rule of necessary and unlimited aggression is quite simple. All means at my disposal must be used at every occasion possible to attack anyone who has reached a position in any way conceivable as superior to my own. This rule applies also to all whom I might have helped in the past to attain positions. Neglecting this duty will be interpreted as a sign of weakness or as evidence of conspiracy. 110 [pageend112]POST- TOTALITARIAN SYNDROME The rule of negative selection holds that I must surround myself only with individuals who will submit to my will in all matters or, better still, who owe their position to me alone. Tolerating views differing from my own, much less remarks critical of me, will inevitably lead to competition and ultimately to my downfall. Under the rule of monopolizing initiatives, I must ignore all ideas, no matter how promising, that are not my own. If a good idea appears, I must stifle it as soon as possible; otherwise, it could become a threat to me. These rules — and there are surely others that I have forgotten — operate under three principles of interpretation. The first principle allows me to widen my margin of safety when circumstances are ambiguous or unclear. Anyone who is not dependent on me or subject to my orders is against me, and anything he does will eventually be used against me. The second principle sanctions all actions that arise from the first. According to this principle, whoever or whatever is against me must also oppose God, the Motherland, or, at a minimum, Democracy, if not all three. The third principle frees us from unnecessary scruples by holding that anyone who has achieved more than I have must have done so by dishonest or criminal means. That person cannot, moreover, be a true, pure-blooded Pole and Catholic, but a Jew, a heretic, a foreigner, an atheist, or a capitalist. After observing the behavior resulting from these rules and principles, it is difficult to agree with the oft-heard claim that Poland's most pressing need is equality. Unless, that is, equality is a euphemism for envy, arrogance, stupidity, and vindictiveness. This attitude is, I think, the result above all of a deep-seated negative selfimage. This is accompanied by a constant sense of threat that is assuaged only by aggression and destruction. This inferiority complex and attempts to compensate for it are compounded by the habit of seeing one's self through the eyes of others. Friends and colleagues are seen as rivals or even enemies. This constant search for confirmation of one's own worth in the eyes of others leads people to live beyond their means, to substitute myth for reality, and to dramatize their lives. Cliquishness and xenophobia complement this sense of social insecurity. Not only do we háve a skewed view of the world, the world itself is becoming skewed as result of our manner of perceiving it. We live in a warped world of our own making, a world where we take our dreams and delusions for reality. We see threats where none exist and security where danger lies. We put our trust in swindlers and thieves as we reject and slander individuals of good sense and good will. The prevalence of this syndrome of complexes within society has prompted a chain reaction that causes the madness to escalate. It is hard not to think 111 [pageend113]112 that Poland and perhaps all the post-communist countries are in the grip of a psychological epidemic. This disease spares no one, no social class or professional group. It is not selective, just as the plagues of the Middle Ages attacked kings and peasants alike. Simple and sophisticated minds are attacked with equal ferocity. The symptoms grow imperceptibly, as in Ionesco's Rhinoceros. We are perhaps now in a better position to understand medieval acts of collective madness like the witch hunts — or the twentieth century madness known as totalitarianism. Is Polish history, our failure to develop a solid middle class like the West's, to blame? Or is it the fault of Poland's invaders and occupiers, particularly the Russians? Russia itself was shackled and its elite exterminated. Or should we blame communism for warping our social organism? Or perhaps should we blame all three? The absence of a stable middle class has certainly contributed to the weakness of Polish society. Over ten successive generations, the best and the brightest of Polish society were systemically exterminated or driven into exile. The young who managed to survive lacked role piodels. Society was subjected to lawlessness, violence, and humiliation. Communism later added falsehood, disinformation and mystification on an unprecedented scale. It would be strange, indeed, if all this left no trace, no lasting mark on Polish society. We may suppose that these two hundred years of struggle — a struggle in which we were always the weaker, always the conquered — have taught us to view the world m terms of certain contrasts. We see good and evil not as intrinsic qualities, but merely as attributes of different sides of the conflict. We are guided by a blind instinct for self-preservation. We have prevented the development of the qualities that are essential for successful and creative teamwork. Suddenly, here we are with no enemy in sight. The Russian and German empires that had invaded us are no more. Nazism and communism no longer threaten us with extinction. There is no longer pressure from the Orthodox Church, Protestantism, or atheism. We no longer live in fear of invading armies or foreign occupiers and the discriminatory laws they impose. An international security system protects us and our smaller neighbors. Ethnic minorities are protected by international law. But we remain as we had been, still shaped by our two centuries of struggle. We have no enemies left and cannot fashion enemies out of those who are weaker than us. What are we to do? In this situation, the slogan “war at the top” arrived like manna from heaven. Taken further, it has become “democracy is war between everyone.” This idea has been sanctioned by no less an authority than our head of state, the Nobel laureate and legendary champion of the oppressed, Lech Walesa himself. As always, his words went right to the heart of the matter. Not only do they provide a clear and simple explanation of the new reality, they also validate old habits and attitudes so deeply ingrained they seem quite natural to us. If there is no other way, then let us all be enemies and fight among our- UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 [pageend114]Photo: Stanisfaw Ciok [pageend115]UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 199 2 114 selves. Our two hundred years of training have turned out to be of some use after all. Our merciless behavior towards one another strikes back at us; each attack serves as justification for the attitude and ideology we have embraced. We Poles are caught yet again in a vicious circle. Even if this diagnosis is accurate, what point does it serve? Who would act upon it? How? At what price? The only possible course of action, in any event, would be to search for enclaves or even traces of belief in citizenship, and then to blow on these embers in hope of rekindling healthy social attitudes. What experiences exist to guide us? There are no direct parallels, though there are many other nations history has not treated kindly. Some of these nations have pulied themselves up, bringing about a renaissance through their efforts; some have been so thoroughly transformed that there is little continuity between past and present. Others have perished forever. Our sole comfort at the moment is that we have not yet taken to killing each other like the Yugoslavs, the Georgians, the Armenians and the Azerbaidjanis — not to mention the Irish and the Basques. Small consolation, perhaps, but it is better than nothing. I must end here. Indeed, I would rather not have written such a letter at all. I hope I am wrong. [pageend116]POLAND 115 interview Bogdan Borusewicz, a former KOR member and underground Solidarity leader, is currently the head of the Solidarity trade union's parliamentary caucus. The following interview was conducted by Anna Bikont and appeared in the June 29, 1992 issue of Gazeta Wyborcza. with Bogdan Borusewicz I DON'T BELIEVE THE FILES WERE FALSIFIED As one of Walesa's closest associates, you must have known for a long time that he signed some security police documents in the 1970s. Compared with his later achievements, those documents hardly mean a thing. Didn 't that make you think twice before you forced through the resolution on lustration?* AB That's right — in the light of what he did later, the documents have no significance. That's why I don't understand why this matter has been blown out of proportion and treated as if it were a scandal. BORUSEWICZ * On May 28, by a narrow majority, parliament passed a resolution requiring the minister of internal affairs to provide information on the files kept by the security police during the communist regime. A week later, the minister sent the requested report in sealed envelopes to several high government and parliamentary officials. The report also included a list of deputies and important state officials, whose names appear in the security police files. Most of the names on the list became public almost immediately and, in the ensuing scandal, the Olszewski government was brought down by a parliamentary vote of no confidence. See also the article on page 93. [pageend117]116 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 Exactly. And the other people from [former internal affairs minister] Macierewicz's list ? Even if the security police files weren 't falsified, they often prove little and merely testify to human weakness or foolishness. Why reveal such documents? AB Whether someone sold out others is a morally significant issue. It is also important information in judging public figures. Everyone who holds a public position must consent to having his career and background examined. BORUSEWICZ How do you distinguish, for example, between a paid agent and someone who signed documents consenting to collaboration but who ended up doing nothing for the security police? The only source you have are the security police files. How do you, a man who helped to create the ethos of Solidarity, look upon making use of these files? AB The documents are pieces of evidence that lead to investigations. Establishing who actively collaborated with the political police requires that the interested parties be interrogated. Moreover, I don't believe that these files were falsified. BORUSEWICZ It was widely believed, however, that the security police did in fact use falsified documents. Why should we doubt this now? AB Falsified documents could have been used in investigations, but the files are something altogether different. The security police, as the core of the apparatus of repression, had to base their operations on reliable and carefully collected information. Otherwise the police couldn't function. Macierewicz's team used a formal approach: whoever was in the files was added to the list; there was no analysis of what these people had done. It was an ahistorical approach. Someone who signed documents agreeing to collaborate in the Stalinist period may have done so to save his life, but that would not have been the case during martial law, when no one was sentenced to death. In the absence of normal investigative procedures, it's difficult to uncover the truth. Some files were destroyed, and it's possible that complete sets of documents may only exist on those who did BORUSEWICZ [pageend118]INTERVIEW: BORUSEWICZ 117 the least harm. If lustration had been done properly, it would have included an investigation and the interrogation of witnesses, and it would have given the accused an opportunity to defend themselves. And there is also a legal problem: collaboration with the security forces was not illegal under the communists. But you didn 't notice these problems until recently. You didn 't mention the need to formulate investigative procedures. Dziennik Bal- tycki published an interview with you on June 3 in which you disagreed with the idea that the disclosure of the names found in the files should wait until a law governing lustration was passed. Three days later the list of names was revealed. It was wrong that lustration was not governed by a law. I thought that we would pass a short statute on this in time. But the pace of events accelerated after the president called for the dismissal of the government in May. In the meantime, the list is still in circulation. It seems to me that defending the wronged, whoever they may be, is part of the ethos of Solidarity. For me, the ethos of Solidarity is bound up with a sense of justice, and in the name of justice lustration had to be performed. Well for me, purging one's own ranks brings to mind the French Revolution and the communists. Those who appeared on the list by mistake must be defended and have their names cleared. But those who consciously collaborated should be censured. So far, none of the accused have admitted their guilt. We are able to forgive, but first there must be repentance, and I have yet to see anyone repent. The speaker of the Sejm, Wieslaw Chrzanowski, admitted that when he was a prisoner in the Stalinist era, he signed a statement of collaboration — after which he warned his cellmates, refrained from AB BORUSEWICZ AB BORUSEWICZ AB BORUSEWIC7 AB [pageend119]118 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 informing on anyone, and ended up spending six more years in prison. BORUSEWICZ But only Chrzanowski tried to explain what he had done. And I respect him for it. Everyone else is holding their breath. Those who are guilty of betraying us are hiding behind those who wound up on the list because of a moment of weakness. They are certain that the files are incomplete and that the most compromising documents were destroyed. The general disgust surrounding the lustration has enabled those who betrayed their friends for money to portray themselves as innocent victims. It's hard to support an action with the consequences that lustration has had. The tradition ofKOR, an organization you helped create, was the defense of workers who had suffered injustice at the hands of the government, no matter who those workers were. BORUSEWICZ Yes, but another part of the KOR tradition was that if someone broke down and agreed to collaborate, he told his friends and colleagues about it. That was a principle that everyone working in the opposition and the underground knew. AB What about the case of Michal Boni? Many of his former friends from the underground — people who know how dedicated he was — have not signed a letter in his defense, because now they belong to a different political party. Does this have anything to do with justice? BORUSEWICZ I'm not going to talk about individuals. I'm not on the parliamentary committee which is supposed to clear up this matter. Many of the names that appeared on that list were a shock for me. AB As I see it, even if the files proved that the president, prime minister, and the speakers of the Sejm and Senate were guilty of collaboration, it wouldn't offset the injustice done to, for example, Grazyna Staniszewska, who, suffering from tuberculosis, led the underground in the Bielsko-Biala region for ten years and spent some time in prison for it. AB [pageend120]INTERVIEW: BORUSEWICZ 119 I'm sorry for Grazyna, as I am sorry for Michal. Every case musí be explained individually. But at the moment, each parliamentary caucus is defending its own members regardless of the evidence. We, the Solidarity caucus, are the only exception. We will not defend our people if the evidence against them is convincing. BORUSEWICZ Gazeta Wyborcza defends everyone on principle. AB Gazeta also has its favorites; it defends some with a good deal more enthusiasm than others. I would advise people to defend only those they know well. You can compromise yourself by defending everyone. Supposedly the security police and military counterintelligence had no informants. So how was the underground penetrated and neutralized? Several thousand people went to prison, but it seems no one is responsible. BORUSEWICZ AB In that June 3 interview, you said that internal affairs minister Antoni Macierewicz is one of the few individuals in government with a vision that has been consistently realized. You also voted against his dismissal. Have you changed your mind since then? BORUSEWICZ I voted against Macierewicz's dismissal for political reasons, not because he did a good job with lustration. I was against the new premier, Waldemar Pawlak, and I didn't want to kick Macierewicz when he was down just because he dared to take a risky action. AB The Solidarity parliamentary caucus thinks that lustration is an important step toward legitimizing our government bodies. Considering what's happened, doesn't that sound like a tragic joke ' No. It depends on what steps are taken next. If there are at acks against the former minister of internal affairs instead of careful investigations of those who appeared on the list, the goverrment r /ill remain under a cloud of suspicion. And I believe that if we ail to settle this matter, it will lead to early elections. BORUSEWICZ [pageend121]120 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 But if parliament is dissolved on account of arguments over whether the former opposition should be investigated with the help of the records of its jailers, wouldn't that be a tragic joke of history? Shouldn't the Soliddrity parliamentary caucus be concerned with législation pertaining to trade unions rather than lustration? AB BORUSEWICZ Please leave that to the union authorities. Solidarity was affected by martial law more than anyone else. It has a right to take a stand on this matter. AB You said you were disgusted with the quarreling between the postSolidarity parties and disappointed in the loss of the clean division between “us” and “them. ” Now new cleavages are forming on the basis of files that were kept by ‘ ‘them. ’ ’ Doesn't this disgust you ? BORUSEWICZ I don't think this is the main division anymore. Files were kept on everyone, including people from the opposing political camp. AB Opponents of lustration are accused of being collaborators themselves or, in the best case, of protecting the collaborators. BORUSEWICZ Yes, and the supporters of lustration are accused of being dolts who understand neither the national interest nor the lessons of the French Revolution. The way in which lustration was conducted is of secondary importance. The parliamentary committee should establish whether the people on the list were secret collaborators of the security police. But the committee is not going to do this. It doesn't want to. This is going to be a tragedy for some of the people on the list. How is the committee supposed to accomplish this ? Do the MPs, themselves entangled in political quarrels, have the right to hand down judgments on others' guilt? AB Somebody has to judge, and who if not representatives of parliament in a matter concerning parliamentarians? We could have tried BORUSEWICZ [pageend122]INTERVIEW: BORUSEWICZ 121 to settle this matter in the courts, but it didn't concern violations of the law, so we don't even know if that would have been possible. AB It was the people who did something for the opposition that risked getting their names into the security police's files. So I guess it would have been best to stay away from such activity — that way, you wouldn't appear on any lists. BORUSEWICZ That's not quite right. We know that whole groups of people unconnected to the opposition were recruited by the security police. Only now have I come to realize how debasing this system was. It was completely geared toward recruiting collaborators and spies. In the course of 40 years, several hundred thousand people signed documents agreeing to collaborate. Some groups were pressured more than others by the system, for example young academicians and journalists who traveled to the West in the 1960s and 1970s. If I hadn't seen all those names, I never would have realized the extent to which the system destroyed people. Whoever signed — regardless of whether he did something later or not — joined ranks with the torturers, although he himself was also their victim. AB When academicians went abroad, they wrote reports on whom they met. That was the price they paid for their passports. BORUSEWICZ A terribly high price. They signed documents that forever after would remain in their files and which could be used to blackmail them. AB I don't know whether they signed documents committing them to collaboration with the security police. That's only the version of the security police. BORUSEWICZ That's right, because that's the institution that conducted so-called operational work using the central archives. [pageend123]UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 122 I know people who made a lot of money or obtained apartments by collaborating with the security police. If these people steered clear of politics, let them live in peace — even if they made money off the taxpayers. Like Edwin M., who was an agent in the free trade union movement, and who now has a company in Gdaňsk, or Zdzislaw P., who also owns a company in that city — ~-=~he was an agent who became the main liaison between the Solidarity office in Brussels and the union's underground authorities. Or take Jan G. from Katowice, whom the security police used to penetrate the leadership of the underground. But the people who obtained their political positions with the help of the security police should not be left alone. After all, people who held key positions in Solidarity were arrested in order to make room for collaborators to move up. This matter has to be dealt with, and it won't be until we find out who consciously collaborated. AB But even if the parliamentary committee handed down judgments, it wouldn 't be the end of the matter. There would be further arguments and corrections. And let's not forget that the resolution on lustration spoke of carrying out the screening down to the village level... BORUSEWICZ We should have given the politicians more time to depart politics. The list was disclosed so quickly that they all simply held their breath. AB It was done so quickly because it was wielded as a political weapon by Macierewicz and Prime Minister Olszewski, whose government was about to fall. BORUSEWICZ Lustration was and is being used politically. However, the majority of representatives who voted for it did so not for political reasons, but out of a desire to see justice done. If I had known what names would appear on that list, I would have thought twice before deciding whether to disclose it. But it's too late now. We have a list and we have to do something with it. In medicine, for example, lies can be beneficial: doctors sometimes lie to patients for their own good. But in public life, the only thing that cures is the truth, the whole truth. [pageend124]GERMANY 123 interview with Joachim Gauck Joachim Gauck, a pastor in the Evangelical Church, was a human rights activist in East Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall. Afterwards, he helped draft the German reunification treaty. Currently, Pastor Gauck is head of the commission responsible for the files of the Stasi, the East German security police. The following interview, which was conducted by Piotr Cywiňski, appeared in the June 14 issue of the Polish newsweekly Wprost. THE CLEAN-UP BUREAU The disclosure that Manfred Stolpe, the premier of Brandenburg and a political figure who enjoys a great deal of popular trust and support, appears in the Stasi's files as a collaborator has thrown the work of your commission into doubt. Do you think the Stasi files are useless scrap? Nonsense. Although I know this view exists. There's no lack of similar absurdities in Germany today. Some people dismiss the importance of the Stasi files, especially when popular people are incriminated. Of course, we don't treat these archives like the Bible. Nor do we think they are unambiguous or easy to interpret. We also don't think they're a study in psychology. Simply put, these files are a record of the truth; more than anything else, they are evidence. You should also be aware that amongst these files — which, if stacked atop each other, would form a pile 200 kilometers PC GAUCK [pageend125]124 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 PC O.K., but when you were asked in an official interview whether Manfred Stolpe was an I.M., you said, “Ihave presented a 61-page high — are notes, memos, orders, and plans of the Stasi. These concern “steering people,” programs for suppressing “enemies of the state,” and rankings of people's potential “usefulness” for planned operations. These archives contain documentation of specific operations. There are two ways we can approach this documentation: as a collection of observations which we all have the right to look through to find out when and where we were spied upon, or as a solid basis for initiating criminal proceedings against traitors. It's not revenge we're concerned about, but societal selfcleansing, the restoration of public confidence in public figures, whether they work in government, the school system, or the churches. PC Is it possible that there are people who, though they were listed as “informal collaborators” (I.M.s) for a long period of time, in fact protected the people they were supposed to inform upon by giving false or useless information ? GAUCK No, I couldn't imagine any such cases. There may have been some people who didn't realize they were passing on information to the security forces, but those listed as I.M.s knew exactly what they were doing. They had regular meetings with Stasi officers; they participated in a dialogue, the goal of which was total subordination to the communist structures and the development and protection of those structures. Some I.M.s claim that they didn't betray anyone because “after all, who was really a communist in those days... ” This is astoundingly naive. The Stasi managed to construct a complete picture of what they wanted to know from even the slightest bits of information. I would go so far as to say that, together with operational plans, the information supplied by the I.M.s was the basis for the functioning of the apparatus of coercion in the former East Germany. I consider any explanations that such-and- such an I.M. was basically acting on behalf of the other side as absurd. These people were useful to the Stasi, and they knew why. It's characteristic that now they are speaking up the most loudly about the threat to national harmony that opening the Stasi files supposedly constitutes. Nothing could be further from the truth. The issue is the trampled dignity of individuals, the lawlessness that left deep scars on human biographies and psyches. [pageend126]INTERVIEW: GAUCK 125 report on this matter... I am not prepared to give an answer in one sentence. ” This answer satisfied neither the accused nor the accusers. GAUCK Pointing fingers is not my task. It's true that I gave an evasive answer. But that was because I didn't want to give any answer at all — although I do have my own opinion in the matter. The authority granted me by the Bundestag to carry out my task does not include rendering judgments. In my report I wrote that according to the criteria of the Ministry of State Security of the former East Germany, Stolpe was an I.M. The fact that he is of a different opinion is a secondary matter. For the Stasi, someone's personal motives weren't important: what mattered was how useful the person was. If someone didn't want to collaborate with the Stasi, all he had to do was speak publicly about his contacts with the organization. When that happened, the Stasi considered the informant's cover to be blown, and that was the end of the contacts. Besides informing on their friends and colleagues, Stasi collaborators performed another function: they would say what they were told to say, which of course they explained “was in the interests of the state.” Thus with the help of I.M.s, almost every social group was under the Stasi's control. There is some truth in the justification that “we had to do it.” And there were some who were simultaneously victims and wrong-doers. But apart from all this, the authors of the law on the Stasi archives decided that all those who collaborated with the security services of the former East Germany are to be removed from public functions in the name of restoring public trust. I believe this to be the right course of action. PC What about the charge that the files could have been partially falsified in order to compromise certain people? GAUCK I don't believe this, and there is no basis to support this view. The Stasi's activities and the records of those activities were conducted with Prussian conscientiousness, thanks to which we now have a genuine and exact picture of the functioning of the security services. If someone advances the hypothesis that the Stasi — which was all-powerful and felt so certain of itself — put together some documents for “bad times,” they don't know what they're talking about. In this entire mass of documents, we came across one and [pageend127]UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 126 only one forged signature under a declaration of loyalty and collaboration of an I.M. — a certain professor. But, although the signature wasn't his, it doesn't necessarily mean that he didn't maintain contact with the Stasi. PC Here are some quotes from the German press: “It's a witch hunt, ” “Senseless floundering in the stinking remains of the German Socialist Workers' Party. It will wind up putting the blame on small fish while the main culprits — Honecker, Krenz, Schalk-Golodkowski — are left in peace and quiet, ’ ’ ‘ ‘Today in the eyes of West Germans, every citizen of the former East Germany is a potential agent or informer. " What do you think of these statements? GAUCK The Czechs have a saying: “Beat the retainers, not the lords.” There's something to this. The first steps of criminal proceedings against some of the political luminaries of the former East Germany have been initiated. But these proceedings are very expensive and time-consuming. I propose that we take a different approach to this matter: In the former East Germany, everyone knew who the party functionaries were, but no one knew who was collaborating with the Stasi. The self-purification of society is the primary task today. I trust that the hand of justice will reach the guilty who sat behind desks; and that their wrong-doings will be differentiated according to the positions they held and the roles they played. As far as the opinion “Every East German was a Stasi agent”: Does that mean then that I'm supposed to feel as if I had been an agent too? Out of a population of 16.5 million, the former East Germany had about 200,000 I.M.S and about 100,000 Stasi functionaries. Is this enough evidence to view everyone as a spy? PC In Berlin alone it is said that 80,000 homeowners submitted systematic reports on their tenants and their tenants' guests... GAUCK You are talking about two categories of collaborators: I.M.s, ° nd those who helped the security services in one way or another witi. out signing any formal declarations. These people are not in the files, and in any case, we are not interested in petty swine like them. They have to come to terms with themselves. Moreover, we are not going to track down every member of the communist party, because not every comrade was in the Stasi. Our goal is to reveal [pageend128]INTERVIEW: GAUCK 127 the structures of the apparatus of oppression, the truth, and also to prevent people of questionable reputation from appearing in public life. PC In Poland the files of the former security services have not been revealed to the public... GAUCK I don't know enough about the situation in Poland to give any advice. But I believe it was different from here, for many reasons. The Poles' love of independence, their unshakable sense of freedom, were manifested in comments and jokes uttered aloud on the street about what they thought of the communist authorities. This was unthinkable in East Germany. Also, the security apparatus in East Germany was much larger, on a per capita basis, than in Poland. So Poland has had to deal with a different kind of legacy from its communists. Nonetheless, even during the era of “real existing socialism,” a number of drastic instances of Stalinism occurred. Take the Popieluszko murder, which I looked into. Why should the public forget about the obvious facts of the authorities' arrogance? How come this case and several others are still wrapped in the mists of legend, as it were? The point isn't to stir up conflicts — rather, it's to shed light on all the dark pages of the former system. We believe that this is necessary to build healthy social relations. The state does not have the right to decide for its citizens, to order the press to say the right things, or to ban ideologically incorrect literature. The public's views should not be steered by selective reports issued by the government. We started from the assumption that materials collected on a given citizen cannot be kept from that citizen. To do otherwise would be to continue, in a sense, the previous regime's policies; in any case, it would be an ambivalent solution, to put it mildly. PC So you are against, for example, those who criticized the press for causing shock waves in German society when it reported the killing of premature babies at birth in certain clinics of the former East Germany in order to improve infant mortality statistics? GAUCK Yes, I think we must speak openly about all the monstrosities that occurred. How? That depends on the sensitivity of the person doing the speaking. The press can do much good if it is responsible [pageend129]128 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 and objective. But it can also cause tensions between the two parts of Germany if it mishandles delicate material. We have no influence on the way the press, which has an extremely high degree of freedom here, treats issues pertaining to reunification. We simply have to do our work and worry about the unpleasant consequences later. PC Your office has about 2,000 employees, but you have requested more people... GAUCK By the end of 1992 we will have 3,406 employees, for whom the Bundestag has appropriated 220 million marks. Currently we are selecting applicants and training them. About 500,000 people have expressed a desire to see their files, and nearly the same number of applications have been submitted by institutions that wish to screen their officers or applicants for important or sensitive positions. The judicial system also needs a lot of information. So there is a great deal of work for us to do. We could never get it done with the personnel we have right now. GAUCK I believe the law is absolutely correct. Thanks to this law, we are not walking in a fog; we can eliminate the doubts and restore faith in democracy to the segment of society that had come to think this country could not be democratically ruled. Those who, like Lothar de Maziere, claimed that opening the files would result in public unrest, the settling of old scores, and even murders have been proven wrong. Of course some conflicts have arisen, but they were to be expected. Just imagine what would have happened if the files had been kept secret: not only would it have been impossible to create a climate of trust, but the files could have been used to threaten and blackmail people. The road we have taken is difficult and painful, but in my opinion it is the only road open to us. Having dealt with the problem of the files for several months, do you think the law governing them was right, or do you think it could use amending? PC [pageend130]CZECHOSLOVAKIA 129 THE LUSTRATION CONTROVERSY “Witch hunt” — proclaim left-liberals in the West. “Former StB officers are having the final word” insist their Eastern counterparts, who side with the communists on the subject of lustration. Stanislaw Lem once offered the best response to the clichéd witch-hunt metaphor by asking, “Has anybody ever seen a witch?” This question goes to the heart of the matter: the analogy is misleading. The women burned at the stake centuries ago as witches were innocent; witches never existed. But the secret police and their collaborators existed in a very real and proven way. The women accused of witchcraft paid with their lives. What has happened to members of parliament who have been exposed as agents of the security police? If they haven't left office on their own, they still hold their seats, taking part in deciding the laws that will govern the nation. They continue to enjoy parliamentary immunity and to receive parliamentary salaries. When the new minister of the interior took office in early 1990, the ministry began to hear from former employees who had been forced out after 1968 because of their anti-Stalinist views. They had a great deal of experience with the StB, first as functionaries and later as subjects of its interest. And because of their experience, they called for a complete dismantling of this institution. They were well-acquainted with the StB's powers and the power it could give the government. At the time the new security service was being set up, it wasn't at all certain what results the coming elections would bring or how the situation in Czechoby Petruška Sustrová Petruška Šustrová was deputy minister of internal affairs in the Czechoslovak federal government in 1991. She is currently an editor for the Czech weeldy Respekt. [pageend131]Slovakia would develop. The communist party had been removed from power, but had held on to its property. Its organizational structures were still intact. The communists had not abandoned their ideology, but had simply “modernized’ ’ it. Only the leaders of the Velvet Revolution, proclaiming the advent of general harmony, believed that communists would not attempt to regain power. Gradually it became known that StB agents had played an active role in the events of November 1989 and their aftermath. They participated in the newly formed Civic Forum groups and joined the civic commissions that were to decide whether former StB officers would be allowed to continue to work for the ministry of internal affairs. Some became involved in new political parties, and a few even ran for parliament. We will perhaps never know whether these former agents were acting on their own initiative after the Velvet Revolution or if they were acting on instructions from their i^h UaCís in the StB. In anticipation of the parliamentary elections, several political parties requested that the ministry of internal affairs screen their candidates. It was later revealed that the minister at that time, Richard Sacher, entrusted this task to subordinates who had worked in the ministry under the previous regime. A number of StB agents escaped detection as a result. Moreover, some of the political parties, including Civic Forum, kept on candidates who had been disclosed as onetime StB agents. The first major scandal over revealing the identities of former StB agents began during the campaign for the June 1990 parliamentary elections. Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Jan Rumi, who had assumed office two months earlier, discovered that Josef Bartončik, one of the leaders of the Czechoslovak People's Party, had served as an agent of state security for fifteen years. Bartončik was at the top of his party's list of candidates and was probably going to be elected. Moreover, it was possible that he would subsequently be chosen Speaker of the federal parliament. Sacher's ministry of internal affairs had not revealed that Bartončik had been an agent of the StB. Rumi had long been active as a dissident. After his parents' expulsion from the communist party in the aftermath of thé 1968 invasion, his entire family was subject to StB harassment. Rumi himself had not been allowed to attend university. The idea that the new president, almost certain to be Vaclav Havel, would be sworn into office by a long-time StB agent was absolutely unacceptable to Rumi. He thus denounced Bartončik on television. Before making this public accusation, Rumi had gone to the leaders of Bartončik's party and drew their attention to Bartončik's history of collaboration. He urged them to remove Bartončik from the list of candidates, but was not successful. Bartončik ran and was elected. The controversy that Rumi's action provoked is a sign that lustration, the seemingly simple task of ridding public institutions of former agents of the UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 130 [pageend132]THE LUSTRATION CONTROVERSY security police, will be a source of irresolvable conflict. Attempts to cleanse the political scene in Czechoslovakia nonetheless continue. In the fall of 1990, the federal parliament voted to create a commission to investigate the origins of the November 1989 events and the role that the StB and the leadership of the communist party played in it. The commission subsequently proposed that it investigate whether any members of parliament had served as StB agents. Parliament accepted this proposal in January 1991 and ordered the minister of internal affairs to provide the commission with all relevant materials. It also decided that deputies discovered to have been StB agents would be informed of that fact and given the opportunity to resign their seats without their collaboration being made public. Any deputy who refused to step down would be subject to public disclosure. At the end of February 1991, before a joint session of both chambers of the legislature, the commission's spokesman, Petr Toman, read the names of parliamentary deputies who had worked with the StB but who refused to resign their seats. National television broadcast the session live. In the ensuing scandal, the federal parliament decided that legislation was needed to remove prominent figures of the former regime and their collaborators from positions of authority and public trust. The federal government drafted legislation, which parliament approved with modifications. Under the law on lustration (Number 451 of the year 1991), certain categories of individuals are banned from holding executive or administrative government office for the next five years: former StB officers and informants, former officials and employees of the communist party from the township level up, as well as party officials who had a hand in directing StB activities, former members of the communist party's People's Militia, and individuals who participated in expelling noncommunists from the country after 1948 and 1968. The law regulates both appointments to certain levels of government office and the removal of individuals from those offices. According to this law, the removal of an individual from office is strictly a matter between the individual and his supervisor; in such instances, there is no question of subjecting the individual to any sort of public punishment. Parliament's passing of the lustration law prompted considerable controversy. One of the most prominent and important participants in this debate, which had really begun with Jan Rumi's denunciation of Josef Bartončik, was Jan Kavan. Jan Kavan had been one of the leaders of the student movement of 1968. Having left to study in England, he became an émigré when the communist authorities refused him permission to remain abroad. During the 1970s, Kavan established the Palach Press Agency in London. This organization made available information about individuals persecuted for their views in Czechoslovakia and provided coverage of events neglected or distorted by the official Czechoslovak press. Kavan was also able to establish a channel for sending émigré 131 [pageend133]UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 132 publications to Czechoslovakia and bringing dissident manuscripts to the West. With the collapse of the communist regime in November 1989, Kavan returned immediately to Czechoslovakia and began working with Civic Forum. He won a parliamentary seat in the June 1990 elections. The November 17th Commission discovered documents proving Kavan's collaboration with the foreign intelligence branch of the StB in the years 1969-70. Kavan not only provided information on Czech and Slovak émigrés in England and other countries, he also shaped his political activities according to the instructions he received from his StB handler. The November 17th Commission informed Kavan of its findings and suggested that he resign his seat. He refused, insisting that he thought, at the time, that he had been meeting with an embassy employee, not an intelligence officer. He did not deny that he had given information, nor did he deny that he had met with StB officers upon his return to Prague at the end of November 1989; this meeting is recorded on a videotape in the StB archives. Kavan's collaboration was made public, and thereupon the Western press began its reports of witch hunts and the “Kafkaesque” persecution of individuals for unnamed offenses. At this point, some observers in Czechoslovakia voiced general reservations about the lustration process. They pointed out that the individuals who had persecuted others for years were now in a position to decide the fate of their former victims by placing their names on the lists of StB collaborators. Arguing that the lists might well have been falsified, they raised the possibility of an StB disinformation campaign. Plausible as these arguments might sound, they lose all credibility when one takes a close look at the process that led to an individual's name being entered into the StB files. When an StB officer found a person willing to collaborate — to provide information about his fellow citizens or to follow StB instructions — he would open a file on that person. The file would contain summary reports, usually handwritten, of each meeting between the StB officer and the collaborator. Copies of those reports would in turn be placed in the files for all individuals mentioned by the collaborator (files were kept, of course, on everyone under StB investigation). Because reports were cross-filed, and because the sheets within every file were continuously paginated, it would be quite a task to create fake files. All files were listed in a register as they were opened. Each of the ten regional offices of the StB maintained a register. Physically, the registers consist of ordinary hardcover notebooks. Each double page provides space for ten entries. Under each file number is listed the date the file was created, the name of the file's subject (collaborator or person under investigation), any pseudonyms used for the subject, the name of the case officer, any changes [pageend134]THE LUSTRATION CONTROVERSY 133 in the subject's status (a victim's decision to turn collaborator, for instance, or a collaborator's fall from StB grace), and, finally, the date the file was closed. The registers of files are not in themselves a source of concrete information, but they do serve as an indispensable index to the StB archives. Falsified entries are easy to detect. The registers were maintained since the 1950s, and changes in ink, handwriting, etc. are readily apparent. As an index, the registers are absolutely reliable. Many files were undoubtedly destroyed in November and December 1989. Many more, however, were preserved. For years, files were routinely sent off to the StB archives. During the Velvet Revolution, all active files that StB officers were still assembling were destroyed. But the inactive files in the archives survived, and thus a tremendous amount of information on StB activities is available. Opponents of lustration in Czechoslovakia and throughout the former Eastern bloc argue that the police were able to open files on any individual without his knowledge. Certainly, the victims of the StB might well not have been aware that they were under the surveillance of this almighty organization. But creating and maintaining files on fictitious agents would have been very difficult. Each case officer was under careful supervision. Periodically he had to produce his agents in person, for example in meetings at safe houses that were recorded or videotaped. The officers had to record exactly what tasks had been given to agents and what information had been received. Copies of agents' reports had to be included in related files. Officers also had to produce receipts for expenses incurred in meetings with an agent. In short, the bureaucratic procedures required of StB officers made inventing an agent more difficult than actually enlisting one. Moreover, if an StB officer were found to have invented an agent, his career would be over and he himself would become a subject of interest to his former employers. The theory that the security police created files to discredit particular individuals rests on the assumption that for years the StB had nothing better to do than prepare for November 17th. The file on Josef Bartončik covers fifteen years of activity , and Jan Kavan's file is more han twenty years old. Is it possible to believe an StB officer in 1969-70 would have foreseen both Kavan's twenty-year stay in England and his return, and then have faked materials to discredit him in the future? The exclusion of certain categories of individuals from government office under Czechoslovakia's lustration law has come under attack from the International Labor Organization and a number of human rights organizations in the West. The fears these groups have expressed are, however, without foundation. Individuals are not being prohibited from working within their chosen professions; they are simply not allowed to hold government office. A doctor, for example, who had been an StB informer could continue to practice med- [pageend135]UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 134 iciné, but he could not be serve as minister of health during the five-year ban established by the law on lustration. The law on lustration- was approved by a majority of the freely elected deputies to the federal parliament. They were not motivated by a desire for revenge, as has often been suggested, but rather were guided by experience and reflection. The lustration law is not intended to punish individuals for their past deeds. Nor is it concerned with passing judgment. Collaboration with the StB is not punishable by law in Czechoslovakia. It is liable only to moral judgment. Neither the parliament nor the legal system has the right to make moral judgments; individuals must take that responsibility upon themselves. , Czechoslovakia, like the other countries of the former Soviet bloc, is going through a period of great change. In these difficult times, the country needs qualified leaders. Politicians who had been willing, for whatever reason, to denounce their friends and colleagues to the forces of repression fail the test of leadership. In late April 1992, the director of the Federal Security Information Service, Stefan Bačinský, passed on to Czech Prime Minister Petr Pithart a list of the members of the Journalists' Union who were recorded as agents in the StB files. The prime minister made the existence of that list public, but did not mention any of the names on it. A debate on how to respond to the list ensued in the media, in parliament, and within the government. The parliament of the Czech Republic passed a resolution proclaiming the need for a law making it possible to publicize the names of all former StB agents discovered to date. The Czech government is at work drafting such a law. The list was given also to the speaker of the federal parliament. The deputies then decided that it should be made available to all members of parliament. On April 29th, the list was copied and distributed to each deputy who wanted it. A note was attached indicating that the list was top secret material for the deputies' eyes only. The next day, two newspapers published the list, and other papers did likewise in the following days. Many have called for the names of all former agents to be made public. Among the many groups and individuals making this demand are the two largest right-wing political parties (the ODS and the ODA), the Confederation of Political Prisoners, KAN, and the Anti-communist Alliance. The publication of the lists is increasingly likely. The network of StB collaborators is a cancer within Czechoslpvak society. Is it so hard to understand that people want to know who these informers and agents are? It is not a question of revenge or of passing judgment — it is simply a question of being certain about our associates, about those who write our newspapers, and about the men and women who govern our country. [pageend136]135 IN MEMORIAM: Roman Zimand (“Leopolita”) 1926-1992 This text was first published in the May 1992 issue of the Paris-based Polish monthly Kultura. It was signed “friends.” By the time we met him, each of us at different moments in his life, he had already been cured of the communist disease. He broke with communism early: by 1955 or 1956 he had severed all ties with that episode in his past. Like many others, he had succumbed to communism in spite of his experiences, which included deportation to Kazakhstan by the Soviet authorities during World War 11. He was the only person we knew who didn't hesitate to admit his own part in Poland's shameful past. His assessment of what he had done was unambiguous and merciless; he felt that his ignorance and youthful naivete did not mitigate his conduct. “I have no excuses,” he used to say. He was prepared to take responsibility for his actions,“but,”-he would add, “only, them. ’ ’ He became a whole-hearted anti-communist — and an intellectual loner. Though rejoicing in the friendship of many, and honoring many with his own, he never again added his voice to a chorus of others. He spoke out firmly and courageously, but only in his own name. And he shunned the limelight. “Whenever I hear of someone taking power,” he used to say, “I cross to the other side of the street. ’ ’ After all, he had once consorted with the political vanguard. He preferred the minute and unrewarding drudgery of defending people and values to the signing of open letters and petitions. It was he who organized the defense of the Kowalczyk brothers, who, as a protest against communist tyranny, had blown up an empty amphitheater just before an annual ceremony honoring the security police. This happened in the early 1970s, when few approved, or even understood, such an act; in fact, it seemed to most people that the motivation to defend the Kowalczyk brothers from the vengeance o the communist authorities did not stem from a natural moral instinct. Nonetheless, he fought to save one of them from the death penalty. [pageend137]UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1992 136 He was a writer, a journalist, and one of Poland's best essayists. His prose was always immaculate: concise, trenchant, and witty. As a historian and sociologist of literature, he was tireless in demanding a place for the writings of Polish and other East European émigrés such as Czeslaw Milosz, Leopold Tyrmand, and Milan Kundera. In the 1980s, he published the much-respected and admired underground journal Almanach Humanistyczny. He also initiated the publication in Polish of the American journal Commentary. Roman was bom in Lwów — Leopolis in Latin — hence his pen-name “Leopolita,” with which he managed to maintain his anonymity for dozens of years. Only the proofs could betray his authorship of essays and articles in Kultura, Puls, Tygodnik Mazowsze, KOS, and Kultura Niezaležna. He identified with the secular right and considered capitalism to be the only solution for Poland, although he had no illusions that it would bring someone like him* glory or riches. He never gave much thought to his own career, which was obvious when one visited his 14-square-meter, book-strewn apartment with its dark little kitchen. After 1989 there were few who were willing to listen to him. It was easier to vote for or against than to respond to his icy criticism of the round-table accords or of the Subsequent actions of the new political elite. At the end, when he was dying of, he insisted on being buried in the Jewish cemetery in Warsaw. In one of his last essays, “Wormwood and Ashes,” he attempted to unravel the tangled accounts of wrongs that he had dealt and suffered. It stands as a testimony to his lifelong effort to remain true to himself.
