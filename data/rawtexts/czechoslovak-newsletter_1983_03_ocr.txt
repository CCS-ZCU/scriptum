New Charter 77 Spokesperson As of February 2, Marie Rut Křižková replaced Dr. Radim Palous* as Charter 77 spokesperson, it was announced on February 7 (Charter 77 Document No. 6/83). Dr. Palous continues to be a member of the Charter 77 Collective. Marie Křížková was born on June 15, 1936, in Milicfn near Benešov (Central Bohemia). She graduated from the Faculty of Philosophy, Charles University, in Prague and worked as a professor of Czech language and as a journalist. Because of her involvement in the democratization movement of 1968, she lost her job and worked for a while as a forestry laborer. She is now a postal service employee-. Her writings, first published officially, later appeared in samizdat form. She is a practicing Catholic and mother of three children. She lives at Jablonic-ka" 411, Prague 9-Prosek. Thus, the current Charter 77 spokespersons are Jan Kozlík, Marie Růt Křižkova, and Anna Marvanová. Three other spokespersons are in jail: Ladislav Lis, Dr. Vaclav Benda, and Ing. Rudolf Battek. 1 [pageend1]2 Court Actions Against Dissidents Helena Gondova and Frantisek Novajovsky, two Slovak Catholic activists from Bratislava, sentenced on January 26 to a year’s unconditional prison term, were released on February 17. They had been in detention since August 1982. Writer Dr. Jaromír Šavrda was to stand trial on sedition charges in Ostrava <North Moravia) at the beginning of March. He is in pretrial detention and is seriously ill (with nephritis). A petition has been circulated and was to be sent to President Husák calling for the release of Savrda, Rudolf Lattek, and Ladislav Lis. By March 2, some 200 individuals had signed the petition, including the recently released Vaclav Havel, writer Ludvík Vaculík, Milan Šimečka, and Dr. Jiri Hájek. In its February communications the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted (VONS), reported the sentencing of the worker Milan Vyhnálek, born on May 23, 1961, in Ústí nad Orlicí (Eastern Bohemia), to a prison term of 25 months for allegedly affixing posters attacking the Soviet Union and the Polish People’s Republic, for sending false information about Czechoslovakia to Radio Monte Carlo and a Danish organization, and for possession of a handgun. Vyhnslek had also called for the release of political prisoners and protested the persecution of churohgoers (VONS Communication No. 317, February 2, 1983). - A request for a conditional release from the Plzen (Pilsen, Western Bohemia) prison of Ing. Jan Litomisky was turned down on November 17, 1982. Mr. Litomisky, a 38-year-old member of the Czechoslovak Evan-f gelical Church, a signer of Charter 77 and a VONS member, had been sentenced in Ceske Budějovice (South Bohemia) in October 1981 to three years in jail for ’’organizing illicit philosophical and religious seminars in his home” (Czechoslovak Newsletter, Vol. VI, No. 11/12, November/December 1981, p. 11). The Case of Miklos Duray The trial of Miklds Duray, a leading personality of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia, which was to take place in Bratislava on February 2, was oalled off and the defendant was released. Mr. Duray, a geologist born in 1944, was 9 leader of the Hungarian youth movement during the 1968 ’’Prague Spring.” In 1978, he became affiliated with the Legal Protection Committee of the Hungarian Minority in Czechoslovakia, which issued several documents concerning Hungarians in Slovakia, one of them addressed to Charter 77. In its Document No. 37 of December 28, 1982, Charter 77 used the Duray case as an example of ’’tendentious interpretation” of some of the articles of the Penal Code. Addressed to the Office of the Prosecutor General in Prague, it drew attention to the violation of laws for political reasons. Thirteen Years for Trying to Help His Fiancáe Several years after he left Czechoslovakia, Jaroslav Javorsky was granted West German citizenship. In 1977 he went to Bulgaria to meet his Czechoslovak fiancáe and her eight-year-old daughter whom he planned to take back to Germany with him. The attempt failed because the couple was arrested by the Bulgarian police and extradited to Czechoslovakia. After more than a year in pretrial detention, Javorsky was sentenced to 13 years in prison for ’’espionage and attempting to help a citizen leave Czechoslovakia illegally.” Javorsky’s fiancee received a 10-months’ suspended sentence. Javorsk/ is in Valdice prison, one with the worst reputation in the country, and is seriously ill. The Internátional League for Human Rights issued an appeal to the Western public to protest the inhuman treatment of Jaroslav Javorský. [pageend2]3 Amnesty International Calls for Urgent Action Amnesty International called for ’’urgent action” on behalf of Jaroslav Javorsky, Dr. Jaromír Šavrda, and Miklos Duray (the latter has since been released—see page 2, above). MADRID REVIEW MEETING The Council of Free Czechoslovakia received a number of responses to its letter to the Western delegations at the Madrid Review Meeting of the Conference on Security and CooDeration in Europe, which reconvened on February 8 (Czechoslovak Newsletter, Vol. VIII, No. 2, February 1^83, p. 1). Excerpts from Letters Delegation of the United Kingdom: Letter of February 10, 1^83: ”... I believe that the Soviet delegation will have been left in no doubt of the seriousness of our concern that the human rights chapters of the Helsinki Final Act should be properly and thoroughly implemented. We continue to regard respect for these chapters to be a very important part of the process of detente. Since our Conference has only just resumed, it is naturally too early to make any firm predictions, but we hope that our work here will be able to achieve tangible results in the humanitarian field.” Yours sincerely, [signedj K.J. Passmore Delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany: Letter of February 14, 1^83: ". . .1 need not assure you that our delegation, together with the other Western delegations, continues to attach great importance to Principle VII and Basket III of the Final Act. I share the opinion of your organization, expressed in the letter to the Interchurch Peace Council, as regards the interrelationship between peace in Europe and the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. We will continue, therefore, to work towards a substantive and balanced final document giving due regard to these essential principles.” Yours sincerely, Csignedj Jorg Kasti Ambassador [pageend3]4 United States delegation: Letter of February 22, 1983: . .1 read with great interest the copy you enclosed of the August 28, 1982, Charter *77 document on the relationship between peace and human rights. Indeed, the U.S. Delegation strongly supports the view that true peace and respect for human rights are inextricably linked. This is why we remain steadfast in our determination to achieve a balanced conclusion to the Madrid Meeting through an agreement that reflects security and humanitarian concerns alike.” Sincerely, [signedJ Max M. KampeIman Chairman As Prague Sees It ”. . .In spite of the efforts by the delegations of the socialist countries, the goal has not yet been attained—to terminate the work [of the Conference} with a final document that would insure that detente had a future in the spirit of the Helsinki Final Act . . . Socialist countries at the Madrid meeting are doing everything they can to conclude the Conference that way . . . They categorically reject any blackmail based on the false premise that the Warsaw Pact states are interested in the outcome more than the NATO states and must therefore ’pay’ with concessions” (Rudd pravo, February 7» 1983)« PROVOCATION IN THE VATICAN As reported (Czechoslovak Newsletter, Vol. VIII, No. 1, January 1983» 5)» Pope John Paul II initiated into the order of bishops two Catholic prelates living in Rome—-Monsignor Dr. Jaroslav Skarvada, a Czech, and Monsignor Dominik Hrušovsky, a Slovak, both in charge of pastoral care of Czechoslovak exiles. The Prague regime reacted angrily. Under the heading of ”A Vatican Provocation,” the party daily Rudé právo of January 21 wrote that the Vatican ’’has left nobody in doubt about its view of socialism.” In spi.te of this, the paper added, there was a chance to improve relations with Czechoslovakia, but "on January 6, two emigre's were ordained bishops, persons whose hatred of their old country has become their trade. Dominik Hrušovsky is the official representative of those forces who dream of dismembering Czechoslovakia and restoring a olerical-Fascist regime in Slovakia.” The appointment of Monsignor Škarvada was characterized as ’’another act of unheard-of provocation by naming him the titular bishop of Litomyšl, a town [in Eastern Bohemia] with a glorious Hussite tradition.” Rudě prdvo concluded that the Vatican "is not interested in continuing negotiations with the Czechoslovak government, whioh began under Wojtyla’s [Pope John Paul Il’s] predecessor.” American Bishops Commended The Czechoslovak media reported approvingly the antinuclear war stance in the pastoral letter proposed by the Conference of Catholic Bishops in November 1982. The Prague trade union daily Prace wrote on January 22 that the authors of the draft [pageend4]5 letter ’’see the role of the Church in helping to mobilize U.S. public opinion against nuclear war as an instrument of national policy ... In making a moral judgment on the policy of Washington the American bishops take a stand against Reagan’s militaristic course." ENERGY CRUNCH AND NUCLEAR POWER One of the root causes of the present difficulties of the Czechoslovak economy is energy. Only 60 percent of energy consumption needs is met from domestic resources (1). Most oil and natural gas are imported from the Soviet Union and some electric power comes from Rumania and Hungary. Because of the ’’socialist division of labor,” Czechoslovakia was forced to develop energy-intensive manufacturing sectors, while obsolete equipment elsewhere increased energy consumption even more. Official party and government documents conoede that some Czechoslovak factories consume 20 to 5G percent more power and raw materials than similar plants in the industrial West. After the Soviet Union adjusted its price of oil to the free market level, oil imports have become substantially more expensive for Czechoslovakia. They rose faster than the price of finished products (2). Czechoslovakia must therefore pay the Soviet Union more than it gets for its exports (3). Czechoslovakia’s indebtedness to the Soviet bloc increased and Czechoslovak oil imports had to be reduced when Moscow notified Prague that in 1^81 and 1982 oil deliveries would have to remain at the 1980 level, about 2 million metric tons less than originally planned. Too, no increase is to be expected before 1985. Federal Deputy Prime Minister Ing. Ladislav Gerle, in charge of energy and the construction of nuclear power plants, wrote in Hospodářská noviny that ’’economic conditions of imported fuel have changed drastically in recent years. We were therefore forced to curtail fuel and power imports more than originally envisaged in the Five-Year Plan” (4)* He also noted that pressure is mounting to import more energy at the expense of other commodities in short supply, especially food (5)» "Our industrial output will be limited in the future by our energy capacity,” he wrote. ”We simply cannot afford to increase our energy consumption in keeping with the present technological level [of our industry]” (6). Czechoslovak energy resources, especially coal and water power, are limited and their utilization becomes increasingly more expensive. According to Gerle, domestic brown coal [lignite] deposits will become depleted in 50 to 80 years (7), and it seems that the reliability of the Soviet Union as Czechoslovakia’s main trading partner is now in doubt. Until I98O the regime’s propaganda played down the energy problem ("we have a reliable supplier”), but, as TheNew York Times put it, Moscow now prefers to export its oil to the capitalist countries. This places its trading partners, especially Czechoslovakia and East Germany, in a difficult position (8). The increased shipments of Soviet oil to the West can be achieved only by restricting domestic consumption and exports to Eastern Europe because the Soviet oil output has leveled off or has increased only marginally by about 4 million metric tons, less than 1 percent (9)« Mr. Gerle proves the correctness of The New York Times’ assumption. Soviet Western oil exports are made at the expense~of shipments to Eastern Europe. Czechoslovakia is the main victim. Under the circumstance, Czechoslovakia is finding that it has no alternative but to ’’increase our energy potential by building nuclear power plants” (10). The Czechoslovak government prepared plans for the so-called nuclear power complex: Nuclear power plants in Jaslovske7 Bohunice (Western Slovakia), Mochovce (Central [pageend5]6 Slovakia), Dukovany (Southern Moravia), and Temelín (Southern Bohemia). The first three projects are under construction (the V-l unit in Jaslovske Bohunice is already producing electricity). The Temelín project is still under way (11). The Czechoslovak media carry frequent reports about the development of nuclear power plants. Complaints are being made that their construction is lagging .despite the priority given to them in capital investments and labor policy in the Seventh Five-Year Plan. On January 22, the Bratislava Pravda printed an article entitled •’Body and Soul for Construction.” It appears that,the first section of the second unit in Jaslovská Bohunice is to enter operation at the end of 1983. A test run of V-2 should start in August, but there is apprehension that the schedule will not be kept. Rudé právo of January 18 called for coordinating the work on the nuclear powei plant construction sites (’’this year is decisive"). A special commission made arrangements to increase the number of skilled workers at construction sites. On January 4 Rude právo wrote that 8,000 assembly workers should be sent to Dukovany, but only 1,000 have been recruited so far. No Polish workers seem to be coming this year as in the past. Army personnel have been mobilized to fill the gap. The regime is doing its utmost to fulfill the plan for the construction of nuclear power plants or at least to prevent extensive delays. If the plan fails and the Soviet Union becomes increasingly unreliable as a supplier of energy, Czechoslovakia will face an insurmountable energy crisis.

HUNGARIANS AND UKRAINIANS IN SLOVAKIA CSEMADOK The Hungarian and Ukrainian minorities in Slovakia have cultural organizations with large memberships. Slovaks living in ethnically mixed areas have no special organizations and have to be satisfied with the cultural activities of national committees intended for all citizens regardless of national origin in line with the cultural policy of the communist party. For Hungarians the regime established the Cultural Association for the Hungariar Working People in Czechoslovakia (CSEMADOK) in 1949* It holds a congress every five years to evaluate past activities and to plan future programs. In its issues of January 4 and 27, the party weekly Nove" slovo reported on CSEMADOK’s 13th Congress. ”It has 512 local organizations with 80,000 members in the Slovak Socialist Republic. This means that among the 555,000 Czechoslovak citizens of Hungarian national origin living in the 15 [Slovak] okres [counties] 14 percent of the Hungarians are activist? . . . During the past five years local units organized 6,000 educational and 2,000 literary programs, as well as 4,700 artistic events. There were 250 song and choral groups, 150 theater ensembles, 120 dance and folklore groups, over 200 children’s and youth groups, as well as a large number of speakers for lectures.” Hungarian Literature in Slovakia Hungarian-language books in Slovakia are published by the Madach Publishing House in Bratislava. The latter puts out original works by Hungarian authors in Slovakia, writers from Hungary, and translations into Hungarian of works by Slovak [pageend6]7 and Czech authors. The regime calls this the ’’Czechoslovak socialist literary context.” In Slovakia, it also includes publications in the Ukrainian language. In an article entitled ’’Literature and Common Purpose,” ZoltaSi Fonod wrote in The Sunday Supplement of the ideological weekly Nove slovo of December 9, 19^2, that ’’culture is becoming an important factor in unifying nations 8nd nationalities . . . We speak about getting to know each other, not about the inferiority or superiority of one or another nation • . • Since the liberation [in 1945J have had two goals in mind: Organizing and inspiring the work of Hungarian authors in Czechoslovakia and interpreting the best works in Slovak and Czech literature to Hungarian readers in Czechoslovakia as well as anywhere else where Hungarian is spoken. It is gratifying to see that there is great interest in these works among citizens of Hungarian descent. Ten to 15 years ago three or four translations of Slovak works into Hungarian were published yearly; 10 in 1976; and 12 each year since 1977• Similar orders of magnitude apply to Czech-language literature. Madach and its predecessor have published since the liberation over 220 translations from Slovak, about 300 from Czech, and some 400 original works in Hungarian ... To read Slovak literature gives to our Hungarian fellow-citizens a feeling of oommon purpose with the Slovak nation. It is an expression of genuine interest in a life within the context of Czechoslovak statehood ... In this way a large number of translations of Slovak and Czech books find their way to the Hungarian People’s Republic.” Ukrainian Literature and the ’’Czechoslovak Socialist Context” The Bratislava Pravda wrote on January 4 that an anthology of poetry by Ukrainian poets from Czechoslovakia was published. It should become ”a focus within the Czechoslovak socialist cultural context based on a unified world view, a common goal, and a common creative method of socialist realism.” The anthology demonstrates the sound foundations of this poetry, reflecting the party spirit and courage. It discloses a healthy socialist basis and reflects the revolutionary movement of our time.” The 1980 census aggregated 579,5°0 citizens of Hungarian descent and 47,000 Ukrainians, most of them residing in Slovakia. After the war, in 1945, many persons speaking a Ukrainian dialect in Eastern Slovakia declared themselves Slovaks because there had been rumors that some areas where Ukrainians lived might be annexed by the Soviet Union as happened to Ruthenia, the easternmost province of Czechoslovakia before World War II. NEWS FROM NORMALIZED CZECHOSLOVAKIA Tares Among the Wheat Under the above heading Rud^ pr/vo of February 11 complained about character defects among communists and the ’’so-called socialist people.” "We do not hide the fact that there are many party members who believe that their membership card will open all doors, that it will protect them if they are in trouble, and that it is to be used as a shield behind which they can swim through life painlessly.” - The Bratislava Pravda wrote on February 1 that noncommunists are indifferent to mistakes committed by the communists or even feel compassion. "Public opinion is tolerant . . . Often an individual, whose true immoral character is revealed publicly, is treated indifferently . . . People even make heroes of such persons, represented as injured [pageend7]8 victims ....’’ And communists are lectured: They must live according to a "code with the most human face ... to act morally means to act in the promotion of socialism.” A breakdown in human relations, alienation, and corruption are a growing cancer devouring the system that generated it in the first place. Defense Minister*s Travels The Czechoslovak minister of defense, General Martin Dzur, arrived in Tripoli, Libya, on March 8. According to the CTH news agency his talks there focused primarily on extending relations between Czechoslovakia and Libya. The general reached Tripoli from Angola, where he condemned the ’’barbaric aggression against Angola by South Africa-,” and voiced support- for the United Nations resolution on the settlement of the Namibian problem. General Dzur had also visited Ethiopia and Mozambique. It is significant that it is the minister of defense, not of foreign affairs, who toured these African countries. Czechoslovakia has been an important legal as well as illegal source of arms to Third World countries, regardless of their political affiliation. Gun-running serves two purposes: It earns badly needed hard currency (and Libyan oil), and it helps subversion and terrorism to destabilize the region as part of Soviet imperialist policy. Travel Possibilities for Ordinary Citizens Czechoslovak citizens who plan to travel to the West in 1983 have to secure a hard currency allowance (in addition to a passport and an exit visa), for whioh they had to submit an application by February 10. According to the Bratislava evening paper Večerník, only 17 percent of applicants received the needed currency last year and there will be even fewer approvals in 1983* “Applicants will be selected in accordance with commercial and political principles based on a class approach,” the paper noted. Elizabeth Taylor Reprimanded Actress Elizabeth Taylor was reprimanded for visiting Israel by Rud^ právo of February 7• “Her trip was an attempt to excuse the bloody Israeli aggression in Lebanon and to gain sympathy for the expansionist policy of the current rulers in Tel Aviv . . • Taylor’s frankly political trip proved that artists do not and cannot divorce themselves from politics. Consciously or without awareness, they serve some purpose; the only question is which side they favor.” In the communist view art must be subordinated to ideology. It is clearly nothing but propaganda and Miss Taylor was being judged accordingly. [pageend8]
