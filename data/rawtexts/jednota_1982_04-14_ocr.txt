JEDNOTA Is the Life-Lineof the Society THE JEDNOTA SOCIETY WAS ALWAYS WITH THE ACTION IT ALWAYS PLAYED A VITAL ROLE FOR ALL SLOVAKS By Ri. Reverent! Abbot Roger GHesc O.8.B. Abbot of St. Andrew’s Slovak Benedictine Abbey I a sc November when Father, Pope John Paul TT^v^lt-' cd the Slovak Institute dtSalnts Cyril and Methodius In Rome, you and I, and all the members of the Jednota shared the joy of this historic event, and we ail felt a justifiable pride not only because the Vlčat of Christ addressed the Slovak priests and people on that occasion quite eloquently In oúr Slovak language, but also because our Jednota helped lay the foundations of the spiritual <md cultural Slovak Institute in the Eternal City. Incidentally, we Slovak Benedictines in Cleveland also helped to get the project off the ground from the very beginning. Some of your elder members undoubtedly recall the Pittsburgh Convention at which the late Secretary John Sabol's proposal to vote a hundred thousand dollars for the Institute was approved with an unanimous vote that followed the earlier Slovak Benedictine Fathers' grant of fifty-thousand. From that time on the building of the Institute in Rome was practically assured, for our Slovak fraternals soon followed with sizable grants, namely, the Slovak Catholic Sokol, the Ženská Jednota and the Ladies Pennsylvania Slovak Catholic Union. Then The Slovak Catholic Federation, headed, by Bishop Grutka, put the icing on the cake, so to speak. So much for this vital link between us in the United States and fConrinued on Page 10) For the Benefit of the Society CHANGE Administration’s Keyword! By Thomas J Guidish, F.L C. Vice President of FCSU We are gathered here In Cleveland. Ohio to give an accounting of our stewardship or as they say in political circles, we are here to give you "The State of the Union Message." "CHANGE" that is the key Church has changed, our life- style has changed, and so must this Society change. Changes have taken place within this Society. Some are very visible and are noticed by all the menders; • -others are subtle and are noticed; by very few; but, cKangíto bře being madé."ť Our greatest change was the purchase of the new computer, which has updated our accounting system into the 21ct Century. This machine makes our recordkeeping sc simple and almost error proof. This computer is allowing us to do what we purchased this equipment to do. It is allowing us to place the entire Society on a direct billing system. Direct billing has become a very controversial lien; — mainly because It means change Our portfolio is being updated. We have added a new term policy (JEF} which has proved very popular. Nearly Ten Million Dollars worth of insurance has been sold in less than ten months.

I Nutrition for Today Food Dollars and Sense Spoiled food means food waste. And food waste, of course, means money down the drain. You can prevent most food spoilage by following four basic rules. Simply remember to keep: Mo let foods moist dry fwib; dry frozen foods frozen Fresh foods as efeso to their original state as possible. While these are the basics, they're not the only ways to safeguard against food spoilage. The smart shopper, for instance, knows that perishables should be the last foods purchased at the grocery store—and the first ones put away at borne. You 'll nlso find that the meat you buy will stay fresher longer if you store it in the coldest part of your refrigerator. Remember to use It within two or three days. Otherwise, you should freeze it. It helps, too, if you rotate the foods in your refrigerator. Simply remember to put the freshest food items in the back. Thal way, the oldest foods will be up front, where they’ll be used before they can spoil. Preventing food spoilage — and waste — is one way to trim your food budget Another is switctdng your snaeklng habits. Specifically, that means occasionally forgoing expensive sweets in favor of more nutritious — and economical — snacks from the (our foods groups. Here are a few suggestions: Cheddar cheese and whole wheat crackers « peanut butter on crisp celery sticks plain yogurt mixed with chunks , of fresh mellon (or any other fnrit you choose) By learning to concoct your own snacks from the four foods groups, you'll discover a tasty, nutritious departure from the "sweet scene." And you’ll save money. Should Mom Give Son Zinc For Acne? Dear Doctor; My son is taking 75 mg. of cine on a dally basis lor his acne.

[pageend3]JEDNOTA. WEDNESDAY, APRIL.-14, 1982 One of the great values of any culture is the family. The regular observance of a family night tn the home will serve to foster a greater appreciation of family living and the joy of doing things together. Such a commitment will produce stronger, more thoughtful and more loving families. Modern day families find very little time to spend together Each local unit can serve to strengthen the American family by encouraging all families to adopt a "Family Night in the Home1' Here are some suggested activities for your family: — Make a family cassette with each member of the family con trib^ng tn the recording, and Bößdfc .grandparents or other family member who lives far away. Be sure to begin the tape by identifying the date and. the occasion for the family gathering. TRUTH AT MY TABLE By Joseph C. Krajsa, F.I.C.

In*- dude some simple songs If real young children are involved. Let each member select a favorite song. You could also use some sing-along records; or. if you have a pianist in the family. It's even more fun. — Letter-writing. Select a night when everyone will write that long-delayed letter — to a friend or relative; to a family member away at college or in the military service; to someone tn a nursing home or hospital. Some letters could be a composite wfth each family member contributing a paragraph. — Family Reading: Select a short story or an article of common interest to be read aloud by one or more family members. We are never too old — or too young — to enjoy someone reading to us.

Washington Letter,— Freezing Nuclear Weapons By Jim Lackey WASHINGTON (NC> - For Á while It seemed that nothing would get in the way of the campaign for a' nuclear weapons freeze. Though it began as a quiet little grassroots movement With support from a number of U.S. bishops, the campaign suddenly began making national headlines when several New England town meetings passed nuclear freeze resolutions and thousands of Californians were signing weapons freeze petitions. More than 140 members of Congress also got into the act, co-sponsoring nuclear freere resolutions in the House and Ben- But just as suddenly, . It seemed, the Reagan administration began running up the caution flags. Frecxe advocates mean well, but a Creese how would leave the Soviet Union with a potentially devastating nuclear advantage, the administration said. Thus it came as no surprise that a freeze proposal advanced by Soviet President Leonid I. Brezhnev a few days later was rejected without thought. Freeze advocates,- though, were fighting back. They argued that the administration was distorting the freeze proposal and was unwilling to debate the issue fairly and honestly. So who's right? The administration for saying the Soviets are pro posing the freeze now because they're ahead? Or the freeze backere, who say Instead that the two sides are roughly equivalent? The answer to that depends on whose deflnltlaiu and arithmetic you are- willing to accept But first, some basic concepts. Arms negotiations today are running primarily on two tracks: discussions on intermediate-range missiles In the European theater and talks on limiting or reducing the big intercontinental strategic missiles that the United States and the Soviet Union now have aimed at each other. An example of the first set of talks are the Geneva discussions which started last Nov. 80 at the height of the European nuclear protest movement; examples of the second are the treaties hammered out at the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, or SALT. Also in the second category are Presl- dent Reagan's proposed new second START talks — Strategic Arms Reduction Talks.

If a Light One Candle BY FATHER JOHN CATO1R Director Of The Christophers It is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness. Christopher Motto Learning fromthe Mystics God has spoken in private revelations to people we call mystics.' We are free to accept them as authentic or not. I personally find them very helpful In understanding God’s Unchanging Love. Here are a few excerpts to whet your appetite. (God is speaking): June 20.1941 — ' 'Believe without trying to define. ’' April 23, 1942 — "You may not feel Me beside you at ail times — yet I am always there . . . My love surprises you: The only thing you need to do is to believe with utter simplicity in this love." November 10, 1949 — "Eitabllsh strongly In your mind the notion that this, My presence in you, is neither allegory, fantasy nor metaphor. It is not some tale you are hearing nor an event experienced by someone else. It has to do with Me, It has to do with a reality to be lived.” October 11,1940 — "Imagine what would happen if at this moment all the people on earth let Me live in them through grace!" (from the book, "He and I — The Diary of Gabrielle Bowls." 1874- 1900) Gabrielle Bo míb was not a cloistered nun nor a person known as a pious religious. An elegant, intelligent woman, she came from a fine family and made her living In ths theater, acting. When she died all of France was amazed to learn that the dignified Gabrielle had a secret life with God. Another woman, Sister Josefa Menendez had a journal which also tolls us much about the subtlety of God's love. (God is speaking once again): October 17. 1920 — "Always remember that if I love you it is because you are little, riot because you are good." November 20, 1921 — "Many souls believe love consists in saying: 'My God I love you!' No, love Is sweet and acta because Lt loves: and everything It does Is done out of love. I want you to love Me that way, in work, In rest, in prayer and consolation as well as In distress and humiliation, constantly giving proof of your love by acts. That Is true love.” (The Way of Divine Love) Yet another private revelation from the spiritual legacy of Sister Mary of the Holy Trinity (Poor Clares of Jerusalem. 1901- 1942): "The most Important work Is not that which you do: it is that which you allow Me to do among you.” JEDNOTA Catholic Weekly Issued Every Wednesday. .

"While growing up in the Nitre region of Slovakia, near the City of Topolčany, we were taught that young girls were doused with cold water by young males and accepted this dousing with delighted giggles. The reason for the dousing, we were told, has meaning in terms of Christ's crucifixion According to tradition, the wailing women standing witnessing the scene would not leave and so the Romans used water to disperse them. The unafraid and daring retaliated by hitting the Romans with tree branches and twigs.

Pier: I tun a 34-year-old Slovak, a native of Portland, Oregon where there used to be a substantial Slovak community when my parents were growing up. There still is a gathering of the Jednota Society every other month, but the membership has dwindled to a current, but dedicated 20-30 members — and I fear this group will soon disband when the few older members die. That is too bad. "I am interested in my Slovak heritage, propelled by the real and indescribable pleasure of visiting with and talking to my 68-year-old mother to the relatives in Slovakia. So I would like to be more informed about Slovaks here and abroad. So far. my only source has been the very good newspaper, JEDNOTA. 1 enjoy very much your ‘Slovak News and Views' of and about Slovaks in the JEDNOTA. The number of tidbits from such a variety of sources is very interesting. You really chronicle the life of the Slovaks in America^ And, because of sources very interesting and your wide scope of these matters, I would like to ask for your help. “In general, ľ would like the names »nd addresses of publications in English and Slovak by Slovak authors and organizations. 1 would like to make a selection and subscribe to them for my interests and to share this with my parents who can read Slovak. "Also, you mentioned in your column publications from ether countries, films, and books on customs. I would like to generate some enthu- siasm among the younger members of the Jednota. “Further, 1 appreciate it when you write about a book or an organization and you include an address for further information.

The primary objectives of the newsletter are to encourage and support the continuing-interest of the NFCA ip “fostering, preserving, and strengthening families," to communicate trends and other information about families, and. to share ideas about family-related programs and resources for possible use by societies at national and local levels. It is not the intention of the editors to be the official voice of the NFCA on family matters. Rather, the newsletter is intended to be what the name implies — an exchange of information and ideas for people interested in supporting and affirming families. The sources of the ideas ■ nd information are individual) and publicatiöfls'trf member Sooetfos of' the NFCA, as wtll hs other publications dedicated te family-ralxteď issues." f \ * ARE YOU A HUGGER? — Marc HoDender, Chairman of Vanderbilt University Psychiatry Department, interviewed over 1,000 people and concludes that women state a need for hugging surpassing that of men. Without enough hugs, some women turn to eating for comfort and a few even substitute blankets for their mate's hugs. I Hugging for women involves security and comfort not necessarily as an invitation to more intimate activities. If you want to better your marriage, give your wife some sincere hugs every day. — NATIONAL EXAMINER • GRANDPARENTS NIGHT: FAMILY ACTIVITY THAT COULD BECOME HISTORY — At our local Jednota Lodge meetings, it would be nice if the atmosphere was such that the entire family could attend — from great-grandma to little Georgie. Here ia a Lodge activity that could turn a meeting into n history-making event — Grandparente Night I All you need is grandparents, grandchildren, a tape recorder and some questions. Let the grandchildren interview the grandparents and tape the conversations. William Zimmerman has written a paperback guide to recording people's life stories using interviewing techniques. It's called INSTANT ORAL BIOGRAPHIES and provides some of the questions that children and others could ask of grandparents. Marvelous stories, adventures, comedies and tragedies are waiting to be heard and what a marvelous night or afternoon at the local l>odge wo all could have. INSTANT ORAL BIOGRAPHIES can be ordered for $5.50 from Guar- ionex Press, 201 West 77th Street, New York, N.Y. 10024 • AVOID SHARP CRITICISM — It is beet if we try to be charitable in our judgment of others. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes, ho don't be harsh about them. It may scorn superior, smart, and clever to bo critical, but it’s a poor way to make or to keep friends. Furthermore, it seldom accomplishes as much as a friendly, understanding reminder. Sharp criticism makes people angry, not sorry. • RECOMMENDERS: LIKING AND UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE - People who like other people are generally more successful than those who hate everybody. But successful or not, the friendly folks are a lot more pleasant to bo with than the grumpy ones. Certainly, a genuine liking for people is an important part of a fraternal field representative’s equipment. Just as important is understanding what makes people art the way they do. You need to acquire and develop a knowledge of human nature. You need to know why different people react differently in similar situations. You need to recognize what emotions dictate a prospect's responses. You need to know what prompts the objections people give you. Liking people and understanding them are not tho same thing. Both are essential if a fraternal recommender ia to be successful. What it all boils down to, a good Recommender must have friends if he or ahe wants to be successful in signing new members for the Socioty. • SLOVAK BENEDICTINE MONKS APPROVED PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT MASTER PLAN — The monastic chapter of the Slovak Benedictine Monks at St. Andrew's Abbey, Cleveland, Ohio unanimously approved a master plan, intended to guide the physical development of the abbey and high school property for years to come. Since January, 1981, the monks havo carefully worked with the architects to generate a plan for the 17 acre campus. Thia worked-out interplay between present buildings and planned construction will eventually reeult in a complex characterized by a greater degree of accessibility for the monastery proper, a more fitting area in which to receive overnight guests, an abbey refectory and infirmary, an abbey chapel to servo as a focal point on campus and accomodating the monks for their prayer and liturgy, as well as for students and guests, monastic and school libraries large enough to hold their growing collection of books and better equipped for academic research, new academic programs, a central heating plant for both high school and abbey, a theatre-auditorium for drama and lecture, a new Slovak Institute facility, and a physical culture center which will also be accessible for the alumni in the evening and summer.

But the Soviet Union sees things in just the opposite light. It says that when you add up all of NATO’s nuclear forces In the European theater — Including U.S., French and British aircraft and Independent French and British missiles — the two sides already are equal. That then was the rationale behind Brezhnev’s proposal to freeze European nuclear weapons at the current level, as well aa Ids threat to respond In kind, perhaps some say with missiles in Cuba, if deployment of the Pershing nnd cruise missiles is carried out on schedule in late 1083. Back in the United States, meanwhile, the debate between the Reagan administration and nuclear freeze backen has been running along primarily the same lines. Even before Brezhnev announced his proposal Reagan was saying that the perceived imbalance in Europe made endorsement of a freeze Impossible. But Sens. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Maaa.) and MarkO. Hatfield (R-Ore.), prime sponsors of the freeze resolutions In Congress, Charged that their freeze proposal applies not just to Europe but to all strategic forces. While the Soviet Union may appear to be ahead In Europe — something freeze backers do not necessarily concede — the worldwide picture shows the two sides roughly even, with 9.000 U.S. nuclear warheads and 7,000 Soviet warheads. From there on the arguments over the freeze become extremely technical, covering such Issues as submarine and bomber fleets as well as potential improvements In air defense capabilities which could alter the current balance. To opponents of the freeze, such technical Issues show that a freeze would be slmplemlnded and a poor substitute for more painstaking but far more effective negotiations between the superpowers. But to freeze backers the sheer enormity of the nuclear arsenals, with their capability of destroying the world several times over, makes the technical Issues and the question of balance irrelevant.

By BOB DAILY OMAHA, Neb. (NC) — Former New York Knicks star Willis Reed, who will be Inducted on May 3 into the National Basketball Association Hall of Fame, is ending a painful year of transition. In his first year as basketball coach al Jesuit-run Creighton Um- venity in Ornate, the team finish ed with a 7-20 reconi, worst in the school's history. Reed had previous coaching experience at the college level as a volunteer assistant at St. John's Uuiverelty in New York Oty. “1 had a good Idea of what college coaching was like." he said. ''It’s like any sport. You need good people and sound coaching philosophy." He said he would have prefered to stay in the East, “but Ihe opportunity wasn't there." Reed had played college basketball at Gram bling in Louisiana. He filled the raciacy left by departing coach Tom Apke last spring well into the recruiting season and long after most of the best high school players had decided where they were going to play college ball, Reed's transition from the East Coast, where he had lived since IBM. to a new town, a new Job and a new team has been hamper ed by. a tough and a young, in- experienced team. "We played teams that outman- ned us physically and in numbers," he said "We were a young team without much experience The players that are here now havo not had much playing time." : During one 12-day stretch thia season, Omaha played four teams that made the NCAA post-season tournament: DePaul.

'Thank you," Jesuit Father Tim- onthy S. Healy, university president, told the team in the locker room shortly after the defeat “in 200 years our university never came this-riose." The Georgetown appearance in college basketball's championship game capped a long struggle back from basketball mediocrity. The school won only three games and suffered 23 defeats in the 1972 season before it picked John Thompson, a former Boston Cell les reserve center, from the ranks of little-known high school coaches to revive the basketball program Before long Thompson had Iha team going to the NCAA tournament with regularity. He came within a whisker in 1980 of taking hl* Hoyas to the "final four” of college basketball. Two years later the dream finally came true. And a victory over Louisville, 50-46, on March 27 put the Hoya* in the championship spotlight. For its effort* Georgetown reap ed huge financial reward*- Each team In the final four took home a $+40 000 check from the NCAA, and Georgetown officials predicted a flood of contributions from new friends of the university and proud alumni. The schooL whose 11,500 *tu dents are almost evenly divided between graduate and undergridu. ate programs, currently has an operating budget of $240 million and an endowment of $74 million. But Georgetown's ascension in college basketball also had its share ot tense moments and controversy. Just a day before the championship game Thompson revealed that his freshman center, 7-foot Patrick Ewing, was the subject of a death threat telephoned to the university March 8. Initially Thompson did not tell Ewing that bq-tad been singled out, but instead told the players HELP WANTED threatened. When he finally told Ewing, "Patrick just smiled, he didn't seem concerned," said Thompson □ bout the freshman's reaction Ewing also was the center of a controversy ever assertions that the 19-year-old freshman was not qualified academically tn be admitted to Georgetown. a very selective and demanding university JOB INFORMATION: solute nonsense," Father Healy view with The Washington Post Second Annual Pittsburgh District Bowling Tournament for Singles Official Registration Form DALLAS HOUSTON OVERSEAS * ______ Zip Code _ _ ____ ______ Bowline Averaie-------------- Bowling Average.................

MI 48127 ft««: (313) 561-M95 By NC News Service Assertions by Richard “Digger" Phelps, head basketball coach at the University of Notre Dome, that at least Seven universities have paid student athletes $10.000 a year to play for them have drawn both praise doubts from hu fellow coaches at Catholic and public universities. Phelps. 40, said during an inter view in New Orleans March 25 on the eve of the National Collegiate Athletic Association championship basketball games that he turned in two schools to NCAA oUidels because they have paid star college players, a violation of NCAA rules. In his comments, reported initially by The New York Times, Phelps said the usual rale is $10.- 000 a year for the player, often suppled in cash by a booster of the institution involved. Notre Dame's coach himself has had trouble recruiting good players and the university's basketball record of 10 wins out of 27 games this year has been one of the worst In 10 years. Phelps said three players he sought to recruit had been paid to attend two other schools. In his remarks March 25 Phelps said that 'there is a going underground Price for players. If i* $10.000 a year or $40,000 fortheir varsity career.” Although he specifically addressed the situation in the collegiate basketball, he also raid that in football “a good running back can get $100.0000, or $25,000 a year." Phelps declined to identify the ^even institutions or those he has reported to the NCAA The NCAA also did not reveal them. in theory, schools pay athletes in hopes of generating thousands of dollars in sports revenue. Phelps said the risk Is “worth It" to schools that take the chance. An appearance in the NCAA Final Four championship round, for example, will bring participating schools more than $440,000 The assertion* initially were published in a Boston newspaper, then repeated the weekend of the NCAA tournament finals by a national cable sports television network. The university president »aid he has seen Ewing's entrance exam scores and current grades and knows that Ewing and the other players are "students in good standing." In his locker room appearance after the Georgetown loss Father Healy also alluded to the good things that may be in store for the Georgetown basketball program.

And early in the season, the resignation of assistant coach Tom Brosnihan. a revered figure In Omaha athletics, rocked Reed's boat for a while. The Omaha Bluejays hit a low point early in the season with a 40-point loss to the arch-rival Cornhuskers at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln. That game was "very emotional for us," Reed said- “After that, we started to improve." And indeed they did, though they suffered'from a second-half curse. Creighton led DePaul by three at halftime.'but went Into a slump and lost 76-67. The same held true in the Marquette game when the Bluejays were down by only two at half-time, but lost by 11. Against Illinois State, they were down by only four at halftime. but lost by 14. The season did provide a few pleasant moments for Reed, however. The Bluejays were heavy un derdogs in their next-totast regular season game against Bradley, Which went on to win the National Invitation Tournament in- New * York City, but good passing and accurafe shooting gave Creighton a. 71-52 victory.

Some of Phelps' fellow coaches have been skeptical or critical of his charges, but others praised his candor In subsequent remarks to the press aS they gathered In New Orleans for a coaches' meeting and the NCAA finals. Georgetown University coach John Thompson, who said paying student athletes Is "simitar to slavery," nonetheless eritlied Phelps for the way he handed the charges and said Phelps should have named names. “I have a big problem with him saying the coaches are doing this when you don't name them. That casts a very dark shadow on the coaching profession Itself," said Thompson, whose team was preparing for the NCAA finals.

Here in Cleveland when we Slovak Benedictines needed j help In cur early pioneer days, it • was the Jednota that gave us a .helping hand ... for which we -will always be grateful, Mo recover, the JEDNOTA weekly has r Continued to give ub extensive publicity tn promoting our religious and educational apoštoláte for the past sixty years. ■ What I have mentioned is only a part of the moral and financial *.ald the Jednota has given to our worthwhile causes. This magnanimous generosity has been the trademark of the Jednota whose ' motto Is the very inspiring "Za Boha a národ". We must not forget that it was the Jednota that established the Slovak Shrine of the Mother of Sorrows in the Immaculate Conception Cathedral in WpaWMton. D.C. As ahead to the Centennial of odr- Jednota in eight short years, we must be ever ' grateful to Almighty God that He. gnw ub the Immortal Father ..Furdek, our founder, who gave ' the Slovak nation a great society In Dils great land of liberty, where hundreds of thousands of "our people found a new home at a time when they were denied their human rights of freedom of assembly, press, speech, and in many respects, too. of religion, under an oppressive Magyar regime that ruled the Slovak nation ruthlessly In their own historic homeland. Our Jednota was organized not only as a fraternal society for the welfare of its members here, but also for their follow countrymen overseas when the Magyar overlords In Budapest sought to des- .troy the Slovak language by . outlawing It in the Slovak schools. The challenge in the face of national genocide waa met valiantly and successfully by the united front of the American Slovaks, among whom nur Jednota brethren were In the foremost ranks of the champions of Slovak freedom. Liberation of the Slovak nation from Magyar rule In the First World War was largely due to the patriotic support of the American Slovaks, and when the J?ard-won freedom of the Slovaks was threatened by a centralist regime in Prague it was our gallant editor, Joseph Hu Bek, and his colleagues in the Slovak League of America who fought for national autonomy. The struggle lasted for twenty years... a fight for human rights es we know them. Finally, the ultimate outcome of tlila struggle for the national autonomy of Slovakia resulted in a great national outpouring of Slovaks In Bratislava In the early Bummer of 1935. Our Jednota was represented there by the Indomitable Joseph Hufiek who shared the reviewing stand with Hlinka, Sldor and Hletko on that memorable day In the heart of the Slovak capital of Bratislava. The nationwide demonstration led to the recognition of self-government In Slovakia by the centralist regime in Prague. The Jednota was always where the action was, and it played a vital role in historic events affecting the national destiny of our countrymen In their historic homeland of Slovakia in the very heart of Europe. From the very beginning, our existence for more than M years has been inspired, and kept vibrantly alive, by our JEDNOTA newspaper and supplemented by an unbroken series of the annual KALENDÁR JEDNOTA editions. Our press has been the lifeline of our society. I'm sure that all of.us feel proud that the JEDNOTA received national recognition from the Catholic Press Association several years ago. that this viral link must never be allowed to be broken. Cut it, and we die.' But we want to live, and we will not permit our enemies to destroy our JEDNOTA by severing Its life-line. (Continued from Page D ere now have a local representative tn the district to whom they may turn for answers to questions relative to coverages available within our Society, and someone who is willing and able to train new recommenders in the field. We hope that as we move forward with these programs in the Society, we will be able to give additional training to the new sales managers, offer them opportunities to obtain their F.I.C. designations, have them licensed to do business in the states in which they reside, and make them productive but for the Slovak American fraternal system In the United States and Canada. Our Annual Report which will be published in our JEDNOTA newspaper very shortly will in- “CHANGE” from Faft If Renewable and Convertible Term Contract, which we hope to present to you very shortly. We honestly believe this will prove even more popular than the JEP, Plan. "niese are the changes which our prospects are demanding. Term Insurance la the "IN THING" naw. Last November the Executive Committee authorized a change in the Non-Medical limits required to purchase Insurance. You can now purchase up to 55,000.00 tn life Insurance at age 86 without a medical. Again, another change to keep us competitive with the competition. Our older members, especially those over fifty, can now Increase the size of their contracts without a physical exam being required. Our commission schedule has been revised. We have tailored our payments more in line with commercial companies. We will pay commission over a five-year period. Our Recommenders will be able to build their own commission checks over the years and the Society hopes to improve our persistency. Another item that has created controversy, merely because we have changed. Under the mandate of the last Convention, twelve District Sales Managers were appointed. This program Is now in Its eighth montjj, and we believe it is beginning to take shape. These Sales Managers personal production Is going up. District sales are up and District Managers are getting more Involved In the Jednota. They are able to answer the questions of the Recommenders In the field. Education will Increase their value to the Society. The Membership and Marketing Committee has authorized a payment of 51.00 to each District for each new policy signed In its District. Thia money Is to be used for educational seminars and training of Recommenders and Branch officers. Also, as an example that our people believe in education, at this time, there are seven enrolled in the F.I.C. (Fraternal Insurance Consular) Program One has already taken and passed the exam for the basic course. These are just a few of the changes this administration has made concerning Membership and Marketing and they are proving their worth. In 1981. over thirteen million In new insurance was issued. This is nearly THREE TIMES more than was issued in 1979 or 1980. Our Insurance in Force, which is the barometer of the growth of any society, has Increased nearly Ten Million Dollars. Societies today are judged by- the Amount of Insurance in Force and not by the number of members alone. As I have pointed out, our Society has certainly shown growth, with ten million increase of Insurance in Force. Changes must be made — we must accept it! Accept changes and profit by them. To make a change In our usual daily routine Is not accepted easily by most people. Change Is resisted, and in fact will be fought with all the skill and energy man can muster. We have to learn to accept it and use it to our best advantage. I have just tried to show you that a few changes in the structure of our Society have paid big dividends. We have profited! Slovaks have a phrase, “Na starom". that is used much too often. We must accept new Ideas and chahges, then use theäs changes to better ourselves aád our Society. dicate that in the financial and fraternal sense, our Society continues to show positive gains. Our total assets increased from 44,658,334 In 1980 to 46.390,795 at the end. of 1981. Our solvency Increased from 116.6^ to 117.14- Our Insurance in Force increased from 126,725,838 in 1980 to 135,750,70S-in ^81, despite a substantial loss of 2914 members from deaths, cash withdrawals, and certificate nia^rltlesť-Thls is ah Indication thaWe are doing something right, and the secret now Is to continue implementing those programs which will continue this upward trend in insurance in force. Increasing our membership rolls continues to be a stubborn problem, and with the economic situation as it has been for the past two years, and is at present, Increasing our membership will continue tofgbe a persistent, chronic problem. However, we have now implemented as yet internally, the programe necessary to motivate our Slovak American population jto Join with us in our programs within our Society. We are contemplating for the near future, programs which should stimulate Interest from our younger Slovak American ethnic population, and hopefully these programs will stimulate the growth in new membership which we are seeking. Our JEDNOTA newspaper parried the names of the top recommenders for our Society for 1981. and the performances in sales and new membership for each of our nineteen districts. Since all of our District Presidents or their representatives are here today, this is the time to advise all of you, as District Presidents, that as these figures are published, they should be brought before the meeting of the District, analyzed as to who is carrying the load for the District, and why one particular district is In first place in sales, and another district Is dead last. Policies and sales plans must be formulated on the District level to obtain new recommenders and sales managers lor the district, increasing the production of current recommenders, and working in conjunction with, our ■ national vice president: and (Chairman of membership and marketing there should be no * Wm.

We are now just five months away from our 41st National Convention which will be háld at the Hyatt Regency Hotel located In Chicago, Illinois from August 29 through September 2; 1982. There are many decisions to be made relative to thia convention, and the Presidents of the Districts have-been brought up to date, at the district conventional seminar held here in Cleveland, Ohio, as to what these decisions entail. Broadly speaking, in an effort to control ’ Society costs, there is no doubt that one of Hie most Important issues to be faced at the 41st National Convention Is the necessity of a four year convention in place of the triennial convention system which Is presently In effect. A four year convention will save our Society a half million dollars over a twelve year period, plus the investment Interest on these savings, which is a substantial dollar saving In today's economy despite the inflationary effect on the dollar. Every other Slovak American fraternal society has a four year convention cycle in effect, and have had this for many, many years. To control costs, a four year convention is now mandatory, and that is the one prime responsibility of all officers of our Society on the national, district, and branch level, to assure that a four year convention Is accepted by our membership, and adopted by our delegates. If the district conventional seminar were-to ..accomplish just one thing, It would be the promotion and acceptance of a four year convention by our membership. Ab President of your Society, I am firmly confident that we are still the number one Slovak American Fraternal Society in the United States today. Success is measured in American Society by the size of total assets and size of membership.' But equally important to ua, as members of the Jednota le that our Society has continued, despite high costs, to provide a coat-free weekly Slovak American newspaper to our membership, a fraternal and. athletic program for gfilfqps wd.tptijer .^thl^tlc, minted membership, a scholarship program for our Pj. GajdOSÍk The Good News Report (Canänuad from Pete If Interment was in the Priests' Plot of the Greensburg Catholic Cemetery. Fr. Gajdostk was born in Nat-- rona, Pa., the son of John Gajdo- elk from Podskalle. Slovakia, and Veronica Stasny of Pružina. Slovakia. He attended St. Clement Grade. School. Tarentum; St. Fidelis High School and Prep, Herman; and graduated from St. Vincent College, Latrobe, Pa. in 1033, and from the Seminary in 1937. He was ordained to the priesthood on June 13, 1937. His school life was not continuous as he had to work in between — nights at the CJL. Flac- cue Glass Co., Tarentum; and at Allegheny Steel Co., Brackenridge. Fa- Fr. Gajdosik's early assignments were in the Pittsburgh Diocese at St. Clement, Tarentum; Divine Redeemer, Ambridge; and his first pastorate at St. Elizabeth In Pittsburgh In October, 1941. In 1948, he was. named pastor of Holy Name Churchy Monessen, and its mission, Holy, C-jgpss, Webster, In the Greensburg.Dlo- cese’. While in Monessen he was responsible for the construction of a new church, convent and rectory, and likewise was responsible for the construction of a new church in Webster. He stayed In Monessen until 1982. After a brief period as pastor of Holy Trinity Church, Ford City, and later St. John the Evangelist, Connellsville, Fr. Gajdosik became pastor oi All Saints Church In Arnold In June. 1964, and remained there until hia retirement In June, 1979, when he became pastor emeritus. He also served as a member of the Diocesan Building Commission from 1961-1979. He Is survived by three brothers, Andrew and Frank of Natrona Heights, and Steven of Linthicum, Maryland, and many nieces and nephews. He was preceded In death by a slater, Kathryn Cajka in 1962. JEDNOTA will miss him, the Society will miss him. and so will the Slovak people! A Special Job for a Special Guy By Thomas W. Pauken Director of ACTION Rick Eilert, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, has written, a book that Is going to be published next year by William Morrow end Company. It's called Three South, and its title Is taken from the name of the hospital ward Rick was on when he returned, badly wounded, from Vietnam in 1968. He hadn't planned to be a writer, but in those first months on Three South he found, like everyone on the ward, that it was impossible to communicate with those outside. Part of it was wondering why he had survived while his buddies were still fighting in Nam. Part of it was the failure of the American public to support or to understand the sacrifice the Rick Eilerts had made for theij country. And so, for reasons of therapy, he began to write about life and reflections on “the dirty orthopedic ward” - — called dirty because all those on it were suffering from festering. open wounds and bone damage; most of them no more than twenty years old. Whén Rick left the naval hospital at Great Lakes, III., rated as 100 percent physically disabled with chronic bone disease and shrapnel still in his body, he was not disabled in his mind or In his desire to make a new start. The writing he put aside. Later, he was to observe: "In addition to the hostile social attitudes encountered by the Vietnam veteran - - - he also found employment hard to find, but for the returning disabled veteran, finding a job was almost impossible." For Rick it was. So in spite of the leg brace, the difficulty in getting around with partially paralyzed arms, he went to Europe and found work in several countries. In Spain he began to write again. Ever since high school, there had been a girl named Cheryl- Following Vietnam, they had separated because, as he said, - "You can't expect a 20-year-old girl to go around with an 86-year- old man. "In time, they narrow- ed the age gap and were married. It was Cheryl wno encouraged him to write, who worked when he attended college, who was there when he had to have additional operations — Cheryl who is always there, Che mother and soon to be the mother of their second child. There was also BUI Corson, a Marine veteran of three wars, a colonel In Vietnam, a bulwark of strength who keeps in touch. A professional writer of note, Corson read Rick's manuscript and was Instrumental in putting It Into the hands of a publisher. And so, Three South Is coining out next year. Meanwhile, Its author is the Chicago project director for ACTION'S Vietnam Veterans Leadership Program. "We face college bound high school students, and many other programs which promote our Slovak American culture throughout the world. This is something to be proud about whether we acknowledge it or not, since we are á wall balanced fraternal socLety from the standpoint of fraternal activities. and financial management and responsibility. We are where we are because we are a team, your dedication and leadership on the District level, and the leadership of the Board of Directors In planning for the future of our Society.

You, as presidents of the Districts, present here this afternoon, are in a good position to tell us, as members of the Board of Directors which way this Society is going.

Thirty-five years have passed into history since the death of President Joseph Tlso of the Slovak Republic, who was hanged ' tn Bratislava at dawn on April 18, 1947, by the postwar Czechoslovak communist collaborators of Dr. Eduard Bene! who was restored to the presidency of a country he had deserted before the beginning of World War n.

Holy Father Sends Greetings to Hazleton’s Centennial Parish Vatican, March 23,1982 Dear Bishop McCormick, As the Slovak Parish of Saint Joseph in Hazleton celebrates the Centenary of Its founding, the Holy Father .sends his greetings of peace and joy .to the members of the parochial community. He wishes them all to know that he is spiritually united with them. His Holiness is confident that this celebration will be for the whole pariah family an occasion for a renewed consciousness of their Christian dignity and mission. As baptized and confirmed Catholics, all are called to build up Ihe Kingdom of God by bearing witness to Christ's loving mercy and by rendering generous service to those in spiritual and material need. For this reason the Holy Father prays that the sick, the suffering and the lonely will always be esteemed and supported by the rest of the faithful. His Holiness Is also confident that the clergy, religious and laity will manifest the authenticity of their Christian faith and love through their generous service of the poor and through other forms of Christian compassion. * . In the love of the Lord Jesus His Holiness cordially imparts the’ requested Apostolic Blessing. With personal good wishes for the parish celebration, I remain Sincerely your In Christ, Substitute The Most Reverend J.

People, everywhere flocked to their churches for prayer In their profound sorrow and anguish. Theyobeyed President Tieo's request not to revolt In his behalf.. . . and on the scaffold momenta before his execution he forgave hla enemies. After removing President Tiao from the scene, Benes and hie cohorts In Prague and Moscow proceeded to terrorize the Slovaks by imprisoning hundreds of people, many of whom were executed or who died after years in prison. Ironically, BeneS was stripped of his authority by a complete conununiat takeover the year after President Tlso's death . . . and shortly after Benet, himself, died, a broken-down victim of hla own political chicanery and machinations. By 1960 the communist regime tn Czecho-Slovakla had suppressed monasteries and convents, closed all parochial church-related schools, confiscated properties of Religious orders, Imprisoned or sentenced hundreds of priests and Religious to labor camps, Installed overseer comrade commissars In episcopal offices and introduced courses of Marxism Into state-controlled schools. Thus, church to the community is not made soon, the last remaining Slovak Parish will die out — and with It — a visible Slovak Community in Michigan Thia decision cannot be merely a verbal one; it must be backed up by a commitment of the necessary financial resources within the Slovak Community to build a new church and remain a visible and viable community.

Slovakia In the aftermath of the so-called Soviet liberation and the restoration of the postwar Czecho-Slovak state, against the Slovak nation's will, became an integrated part of the Czechoslovak satellite atate of the USSR behind the Iron Curtain as planned and approved by the Big Three at Yalta in 1944. Despite widespread persecution of religion and political oppression, the Slovak nation has remained faithful to Its Christian tradition under a government that is Marxist in Its concepts and ruthless in its implementation of radical socialist principles and teachings. t During the brief period of the Dubček era nf "Communism with a human, face” in the first half of 1W8 the Slovaks expressed their true feelings of opposition to the communist Ideology imposed upon them by force.

Pope W arns oi Moral W eakening By Fr Kenneth Z Doyle VATICAN CITY (NC) - Pope John Paul II warned April i agaJnat a decline in moral values, a weakening of people's awareness of sin and laxity in Catholic confessional practices. He also recalled that general absolution can be given only under exceptional circumstances. The pope’s observations came in a talk to 11 bishops from eastern France on their official five- year "ad llmlna" visits to Rome. There seems tobe “an Idolatry which attaches itself today to money, to power, to sex," the pope told tiie bishops. He said this Idölatry works "to the detriment of the values of tile person and of truth, of interpersonal relationships and of communication." Young people today, the pope advised, should be educated to recognize "the traps and the limitations of materialism and of a consumer society which limits one’s horizons to the satisfaction of immediate needs." One way to test the alertness of a Catholic's conscience, the pope suggested. Is to meo sut o hla consciousness of sin, his desire for pardon and his tendency to approach the sacrament of penance. Alluding to "a certain crisis with regard to the sacrament of penance" the pope expressed concern over reports of large numbers of people receiving the SIGN A NEW MEMBER TODAY Member of Jednota Lodge in Emmaus, Pa. Mike Krajsa Survives Helicopter Crash "Boy, I'm lucky to be alive, I’ll telL you . . . This guy (Green) knows his stuff. I’m alive because of him." Mike Krajsa said in an Interview after the helicopter he was In crashed on South Mountain in Upper Milford Township near Allentown, Pa. on Thursday, March 18, 1882. Krajsa was speaking about George Green of Mohrsville. Pa., a helicopter pilot with combat experience In Vietnam. He was credited with the -swift action that averted a tragedy when the .WSAN’s Sky-Watch traffic helicopter crashed. Passengers’ with Green were Michael J. Krajsa, Executive Director of millionaire Harold Fulmer's ’ businesses (HGF Group), and Jim Kramer, a Service Electric Cable Television cameraman. Green, whom Krajsa said was forced Into the Instrumentation panel by the impact, was listed in guarded’ condition at Allentown and Sacred Heart Hospital center with possible back Injury and multiple contusions. Krajsa rescued Green from the ’copter. All Krajsa suffered was a nick on his ring finger. According to Krajaa, the helicopter was in the air about 45 minutes before the incident, filming Fulmer's land to supplement footage already shot for KYW-TV Evening Magazine segment on Fulmer. "We came up over the mountain and were doing a vista shot of Allentown and the engine quit, It just quit, just stopped," Krajsa said. Krajsa, a 33-year-old Alien town man said the hellcoptei was only about 200 to 300 feel above the ground. Had the hell cqptep been higher, there woulc have been little problem gaining the air speed to glide to a land Ing. As.lt was. Green had to ac without hesitation. "What Greer did was dive the helicopter an< 25 or 30 feet from the ground, hi pulled back on the stick — yoi could feel the G forces." Kraj si continued. There was only one clearing b the trees and the helicopter jus .hgPWied tp.be,nearjt; "He's ; m.my boo^’.-Krajsi ^d, "Öreen's'reaction wps a instinctive — going for the clear Ing, you could just see it unfold.1 Green told Krajsa he had bee: shot down and forced to land in; similar helicopter several- time while serving in Vietnam. Krajsa said that when the pile began to pull out of the dive, " knew we could survive the crasl providing we weren’t struck b; Eucharist when only a few have gone to confession. "On this point," said the pope, "a good catechesls (religious education) ought to lead the faithful to examine their recognition of themselves as sinners, to .understand the necessity and the sense of a personal approach to (the sacrament of) reconciliation before receiving, with the ■ Eucharist, all the fruits of renewal and of unity with Christ and his church/’ The theology of the church teaches that confession is necessary before Communion for someone tn serious sin, and that for anyone participation in the Eucharist is deepened by proper sorrow for sin and the reception of absolution. The pope urged that Lent be marked in the lives of Catholics by a growing sensitivity toward the reality of sin and a desire for the freedom which comes through forgiveness. The pope praised the developing recognition among Catholics of the social dimension of sin and its consequences In the community. but said that this recognition should not militate against individual confession. Penitential celebrations with the general absolution, he said, should only occur in exceptional and grave situations, according to the norms of the church. General absolution does not dispense with the necessity ol Individual confession, he noted. "The Christian exists not only as a member of the community," sold the pope. "He Is an tn- 1 dividual person, with his own tendencies and his own problems, his own milieu and his own psyche, his own temptations and his own fallings, his own conscience and his own responsibility before God and before his brothers." projectiles and if it didn't explode." He braced himself, not wanting to go through the windshield. "We hit once, he hit it right, put it down so the tail and then the skids hit.", Krajsa recalled. "We bounced about 35 feet, then the chopper just crumbled on us." The other passenger. Kramer, was on his knees filming out the \ylndow when the engine .quit. "I didn't Vekily think anything. I just sat .back and waited." On the first bounce, Kramer sald, "I probably got thrown out, I know I didn't open the door." After Krajsa helped Green out, he quickly turned off the power because the fuel cell on the left side of the helicopter ruptured and. the men could smell the leaking fuel. After attending to Green, Krajsa found his WSAN radio and told the station the helicopter had crashed. Later, from the scene, he filed a live report on the crash landing over the radio. He is used to filing reports with the radio station because he occasionally flies the Sky-Watch in a plane with fixed wings. He is in the process of completing ids pilot's license. Less than four hours later, Krajsa. Fulmer and a pilot took a plane to Wilkes-Barre on a planned business trip. Krajsa served as the co-pllot on the flight. Kramer was asked if he would fly again, and said, "Not for a while." but he said he will go alfot in the future when his Job as a cameraman requires It. The following Sunday, Krajsa flew up to the Harrisburg International Airport, OlmiteMd Field, Middletown, Pa., to have a Sunday Slovak dinner with his parents, Joseph C. and Romani* 'Krajsa — the ’fonder ťhé^Edltor ' Ijf JEÖNOTA.

Svätý Otec stretnutie označil ako "historickú chvíľu" vo vzťahoch medzi Veľkou Britániou a SvHtou Stolicou. Vo svojom preslove prehovoril o budúcej návátove, ktorú vykoná u kráľovnej Alžbety H. Vyzdvihol, že to bude apoštolská cesta Čisto náboženského charakteru.

Juraj Churn, predseda okresu SLvA Sydney — V súčasnom období je potešujúca skutočnosť, týkajúca sa duchovných povoleni v Austrálii. To je úsudok vedúceho oddelenia pre duchovné povolania v arcidiecéze Sydney Pátra Kerry Bayada, ktorý okrem iného povedal, že do najstaršieho austrálskeho seminára Svätého Patrika, ktorý sa nachádza na predmestí Sydney, vstúpila toho času 25 študentov, kandidátov na kňazské povolanie. Ich priemerný vek sa pohybuje oko- !o 25 rokov a pochádzajú z rozličných civilných povolaní. Páter Bayada ďalej pripomenul, že na neho veľmi zapôsobila ich veľkomyseľnoať, viera a dôvera v Boha, pretože už skoro každý z nich mal pred sebou skvelú kariéru predchádzajúceho povolania. Podobne aj do arcidiecézneho serninš- ra v Melbourne vstúpilo tohto roku 20 študentov, z ktorých väčšina vykonávali už nejakú prácu alebo povolanie.

Každý, kto verí, že Ježiš je Mesiáš, narodil sa z Boha. A každý, kto miluje rodiča, miluje aj toho, ktorý sa z neho narodil. Po tom poznávame, že milujeme dfetky Božte, keď milujeme Boha a plníme jeho prikázania. Lebo v tom je láska k Bohu, že zachovávame jeho prikázania. A jeho prikázania nie sú ťažké. , Veď každý, kto sa z Boha narodil, víťazi nad svetom. A naša viera je tým víťazstvom, ktoré premohol svet. Ale kto môže zvíťaziť nad svetom, ak len nie ten, kto verí, že Ježiš je Syn Boží? On je Ten, ktorý prišiel cez vodu a krv, Ježiš Kristus. NJe iba cez vodu, ale cez vodu a krv!

(: Aleluja:) O osem äniprliiel Ježii Čítanie zo svätého evanjelia podľa Jána. — Večer prvého dňa v týždni prišiel Ježiš ta, kde sa učeníci zhromaždili a zatvorili dvere zo strachu pred židmi, postavil sa doprostred a povedal Im: "Pokoj vám!" A keď to povedal, ukázal Im ruky 1 bok. I zaradovali sa učeníci, keď videli Pána. Tu Im Ježiš znova povedal: "Pokoj vám! Ako mňa poslal Otec, tak aj ja posielam vás.” Keď to dohovoril, dýchol na nich a povedal: "Prijmite Ducha Svätého; ktorým odpustíte hriechy, odpúšťajú sa liň; ktorým zadržíte, zadržia sa im." Tomáš však, jeden z dvanástich, nazývaný Dvojčaťom, nebol medzi nimi, keď prišiel Ježiš. I povedali mu ostatní učeníci: "Videli sme Pána." On im odvrával: "Ak len neuvidím na jeho nikách jazvy po klincoch a nevložím prst do rán po klincoch a nevložím mu ruku do boku, neuverím." O osem dní jeho učeníci boli zasa v tej sieni a aj Tomáš bol medzi nimi. Tu vošiel Ježiš, hoci dvere boli zatvorené, postavil sa doprostred a povedal: “Pokoj vám!” Potom hovoril Tomášovi: "Daj sem prst a pozri moje ruky! Daj sem ruku a vlož ju do môjho boku! A nebuď neveriaci, ale veriaci!" Odpovedal mu Tomáš: "Pán môj a Boh môj!” Ježiš mu povedal: "Uveril sl, pretože 81 videl, ale blažení sú tí, čô nevideli a uverili." Ešte mnoho Iných divov urobil Ježiš pred svojimi učeníkmi, ktoré nie sú zaznačené vTejto knihe. Ale toto je napisarié, aby sta Verili,“že Ježiš je Kristus, Syn Boži, a vierou aby ste mali život prispením’ jeho mena. Počali sme slovo Pánovo “Nebuďneveriaci, ale veriaci" (Jn 20, 27) Dfla 23. septembra 1968 zomrel slávny kapucínsky kňaz Otec Pio. Celých 50 rokov svojho kňazského života nosil rany Pána Ježiša na svojom tele. Keď slúžil sv. omšu, neraz kvapky krvi padali na oltár. Pri pohľade na jeho rany sa mnohí obrátili, mnohí uverili a našli Ježiša, svojho Spasiteľa . . . Slovu Božie už takmer dve tisíc rokov povoláva celé ľudské pokolenie, aby sa lepšie pozrelo na rany Vzkrieseného Spasiteľa, aby nikto nebol zatratený. Prijmime túto výzvu, aby mpe aj my boli spasení! . 1. Buď veriaci a nie neyeriad! V Istom slova zmysle, dýprvotná Cirkev bola neveriaca. Veď v čase, keď náš Pán vstal z mŕtvych, viera samých apoštolov bola hlboko otrasená. Udalosti, ako bola Judášova zrada, Pánovo zatknutie a jeho potupné ukrižovanie, podminovali vieru sv. apoštolov od základov. Nevedeli sl nijako vysvetliť, že ten Ježiš, ktorý robil toľké zázraky, že nepoužil svoju zázračnú moc, keď išlo o neho samého a o Jeho celé hnutie, ale radšej sa podrobil toľkému potupeniu . . . Pravda vzkriesenia Pána Ich napokon od základov pretvorila a už neboli viac neveriaci, keď ho na vlastné oči videli, keď videli Jeho vzkre- . sené rany . . . Prvé čítanie tejto sv. omše {Sk 4,32-35) nám hovorí, že Vzkriesený Ježiš dobre vedel o tomto duševnom rozpoložení sv. apoštolov. Zjavuje sa Im, aby Ich vieru upevnil. Zjavuje sa im totiž viackrát, je 3 nimi, zhovára sa s nimi, dáva sa im aj dotknúť, aby len boli, ako: "Zástup, ktorý má jedno srdce”, veriace srdce, aby bolí jeho svedkami, hotoví žlť a zomrieť za Jeho Pravdu. Na viere apoštolov potom kladie základy pre svoju Cirkev, ktorá by zahrnula celú ľudskú spoločnosť, ako jednu rodinu milujúcich Boha. . V dnešnom sv. evanjeliu (Jn 20,19-31) sa hovorí o jednom takom zázračnom zjavení sa nášho Pána sklamaným a prestrašeným apoštolom. Sv. Ján tu doslovne hovorí, že náš Pán: "Prišiel ta, kde sa zhromaždili za zatvorenými dvermi, zo strachu pred židmi.

Kraj sa, F.I.C., redaktor JEDNOTY; Eduard Yuhás, direktor at large z Donory, Pa.; Otec Vincent Dančo, S.J., hlavný duchovný pre Kanadu, z Toronta, Kanada a hosť brat Gabriel Balažovič, O.S.B., zo slovenského benediktinského kláštora sv. Andreja, Cleveland, Ohio. Teodor T. Macejko, právny radca; Holena Macejková e Stefan F. Ungvár- sky, výkonný tajomník IKSJ. — Fotografoval Tibor Gaáparik. Celý príbeh bo av. Tomášom, ktorý potom nasledoval, smeroval k tomu, aby Pán utvrdil vieru aj ostatných apoštolov. Nech nás to nijako neprekvapuje, že sa Tomáš zachoval, ako sa zachoval, že neveril, keďže nebol doma. Aj ostatní apoštoli pred vldeníirf Vzkrieseného Pána neboli o nič odchodnejSÍ. Ani oni neverili, kým nevideli Pánov otvorený bok a rany-na jeho rukách ... Aj ostatní zvolali, ako Tomáš: "Pán môj a Bolí môj". Aj ostatným povedal. Čo povedal sv. Tomášovi: ''Nebuď už neveriaci, ale veriaci. Uveril si preto, že si videl- No, blaženi ti, ktorí nevideli a uverili”. Aj ostatní sa zaradovali, ako sa zaradoval aj Tomáš, keď videl Pána. Aj ostatných odmenil tým istým darom, ktorým odmenil Tomáša, ktorý uveril, lebo aj im .povedal: "Pokoj vám". Dal im teda drahocenný dar veľkonočného rána, dal im pokoj, po ktorom ich srdcia tak tú fill, ktorý celý svet dať nemôže. Vrátila sa im duševná rovnováha, lebo už nielen verili, ale aj ich srdcia zahoreli novou láskou. Skutky apoštolské hovoria, že takto pretvorení apoštoli boli: "Množstvo tých, čo prijali vieru, boli jedného ducha a jednej mysle. I S veľkou mocou vydávali svedectvo o zmŕtvychvstaní Pána a všetci 8a tešili veľkej obľube" (Sk 4, 32-35). Pán Ich napokon poslal, aby o ílom vydával! svedectvo celému svetu, keď im povedal: “Ako mňa poslal Otec, tak aj ja posielam vás” (Jn 21, 21), aby mnohých ■ priviedli k poznaniu Pravdy, k viere v Ježiša, vzkrieseného Pána a i Spasiteľa. 2. Prijmime aj my blahozvesť Pánovu a buďme veriaci, aby sme । boli spasení. V dojímavých obradoch veľkonočnej soboty sa nám Vzkriesený 1 Pán zaskvel v plnej sláve svojho veľkonočného víťazstva. Ukázal nám svoje oslávené rany', aby sme do nich vložili nielen svoje prsty, ako sv. Tomáš, ale aj celé svoje srdce. A keď sme 81 v jeho prítomnosti obnovili svoje krstné sľuby, povedal nám: "Blažení ste. lebo ste ma'nevideli a ste uverili..Veru, nikto, kto tieto veľkonočné záväzky lásky k Ježišovi berie vážne, nemôže poprieť, že by aj jemu Pán nebol povedal: "Pokoj s tebou”. Keď sme prijali blahozvesť Pánovu, zacítili sme aj my jeho pokoj, ktorý je darom vzkrieseného Pána všetkým, ktorí v neho v láske uveria. V druhom čítaní tejto sv. omše (1 Jn 5,1-6) nám sv. Ján apoštol hovorí, že tým, že sme sami uverili, tým sa naša veľkonočná povinnosť ešte nekončí. Ani najmenej! Svätý Ján hovorí, že nás vzkriesený Spasiteľ zaväzuje, aby sme svojim "vzkrieseným životom”, teda bezúhonným životom, vydali svedectvo svetu okolo seba, že Ježiš za nás zomrel, vstal a žije a žije v nás. Ak teda veríme, že Ježiš je náš Spasiteľ, sa narodili z Boha .... čo dokazujeme tým, že už odteraz žijeme, ako dletky Božie, ktoré plnia jeho prikázania". Keď naše osobné "znovu zrodenie” -vidia na našom správaní sa mnohí okolo náa, môžu Uež zacítiť Pánovo povolanie, aby uverili a tiež žili. Lebo svet v našich časoch lačnie po Pravde a inej Pravdy na svete nikdy nebolo a nebude, ako je Vzkriesený Spasiteľ, Ježiš Kristus. On al nás ale osobne vybral, aby sme Jeho Pravdu svojou živou vierou a horúcou láskou k nemu svetu zvestovali. Musíme teda svoju vieru sami dobre poznať, aby sme dľa nej mohli statočne žlť a dokonalosťou svojho súkromného 1 verejného života ju nebojácne vyznávať. Pánov pokoj v našich srdciach bude tou príťažlivou silou, ktorá upúta tých, čo Pána okolo nás úprimne hľadajú, lebo Ho v dobrom príklade nášho života uvidia a stretnú. Zátvrdllvcov voči viere ale náš dobrý príklad života zahanbí, možno otrasie a možno aj prebudí. Preto sa musíme snažiť, vždy a všade vystupovať, ako ozajstní veriaci Vzkrieseného Pána a nie neveriaci.» Pri sv. prijímaní Vzkriesený Spasiteľ Bj nám ukáže avoje ranené ruky a svoj otvorený bok a povie nám: "Nebuď už neveriaci, ale veriaci". Prikľaknlme ku sv. apoštolom, ktorí sa už tešia v nebesiach b Pánom a vyznajme ho pred celým svetom ich slovami: “Pán môj a Boh môj". A za dary viery, horúcej lásky a veľkonočného pokoja a medzlspevom tejto sv. omše Vzkriesenému Spasiteľovi: •‘Vzdajme vďaky, lebo je dobrý, lebo Jeho milosrdenstvo ja na veky” (Ž 117).

JOZEF VAVROVIC Drahí bratia a sestry I Ťažko nám to padlo uveriť, keď v prvý jarný deň z tunajšej nemocnice sv. Filipa Neriho prišla do Slovenského ústavu správa, že o pol dvanástej predpoludním skončil svoju životnú púť slovenský jezuita Otec Michal Lacko, profesor Orientálneho ústavu v Ríme. Stalo sa tak na operačnom stole, keď jeho organizmus nevydržal chirurgický zákrok na rozšírenej srdcovnici (aorte). Boli sme hlboko dojatí jeho náhlym a nečakaným skonom, So zadosťučinením však 6me sa dozvedeli, že bol zaopatrený sviatosťami chorých a poslednú noc prebdel v prítomnosti svojho priateľa kňaza. Venujme mu dnes, v deň jeho pohrebu, túto našu pietnu spomienku oko skromný prejav bratskej vďaky za všetko, čo vykonal v duchu viery za Cirkev a slovenský národ. Čiara života Michala Lacku, ktorá sa začala 19. januára 1920 v Krásnej nad Hornádom a skončila sa vo Večnom meste 21. marca 1982, je mimoriadne pestrá, bohŕtQ_žvteená a naplnená mnohorakými skutkami umu i srdca. Až sa raz ujtážeůíovenskej verejností jeho dielo v plnom rozsahu a zostaví sa bibliografia jeho prác, len potom ai uvedomíme, koho sme v ňom mali a koho sme stratili. Už miesta, na ktorých sa utváral jeho duchovný profil — Košice, Ružomberok, Záhreb, Rím a Wepion —’ boli mu podnetmi, aby zodpovedne využil Bohom dané vlohy a aby rozšíril oblasť svojich záujmov o život Božieho ľudu. No jeho láskou i predmetom osobitných štúdii ea stali dejiny Východných cirkví, pričom osudy slovenských gréckokatolíkov doma i v cudzine boli mu po celý život vecou srdca. Po dôkladných štúdiách na rímskych univerzitách, štátnej i pápežskej, stal sa profesorom na Pápežskom východnom ústave a neskoršie na Gregoiiáne. Ako profesor vychoval početných odborníkov pre otázky Východných cirkvi, príslušníkov rôznych národností. Otec Lacko nebol typom profesora zavaleného knihami a uzavretého do knižníc, Získané vedomosti štedro rozdával, ako mu to kázalo jeho apoštolsky založené kňazské srdce. V tejto súvislosti bolo by poučné mať pred očami zoznam vedeckých kongresov a sympózií, na ktorých oa aktívne zúčastnil. Zahľadený do minulosti, do dávnych storočí cirkevného života, vynášal na svetlo a objasňoval udalosti i osobnosti, ktoré mali čo povedať aj nám kresťanom 20. storočia. Desiatky a desiatky štúdií uverejnených samostatne alebo v zborníkoch, pripadne v encyklopédiách — talianskych, anglických, nemeckých alebo latinských — ilustrujú rozsah i tematickú rozmanitosť prác O. Lacku. Keďže ovládal slovanské reči, mohol bez ťažkosti udržiavať čulé styky a vedeckými slovanskými ústavmi, predovšetkým na Balkáne. Nepochybujeme o tom, že zvesť o smrti O. Lacku, ktorú oznámilo v nedeľu'Vatikánske rádio, vyvolala živý ohlas v mysliach slovenských poslucháčov. Veď jeho osoba bola mnohým známa a všetkým sympatická. Koľkí slovenskí pútnici, vďaka jeho obetavosti, dostali sa na audiencie vo Vatikáne, našli v Ríme ubytovanie alebo sa oboznámili a pamätnosťami Večného mesta, po ktorom ich sprevádzal. Náš zosnulý brat prežil väčšinu života mimo vlasti, ale na svojeť nikdy nezabúdal. Jeho styky so Slovenskom boli nepretržité a intenzívne s Postavme Dr. Jozefa Tisu na oltár ' - O. Jozef Kováč, S.J., Paríž '~r Túto výzvu urobil z ďalekej Afriky ešte pred dvadsiatymi rokmi slovenský jezuitský misionár, Otec Pavol Bojan, SJ na 25. výročie mučeníckej smrti prezidenta Dr. Jozefa Tisu. Bolo to posolstvo umierajúceho misionára — slovenského rodofuba, ktoré zanechal slovenskému národu krátko preďsvojou smrťou, Bolo to jeho posledné a "prorocké" posolstvo celej Slovače, ktoré dal uverejniť v slovenských novinách JEDNOTA dňa I 5. júla 1972, práve na sviatok našich slovanských vierozveatcov sv. Cyrila i a Metoda. Otec Pavol Bajan hlboko nahliadol do plánov Božích, oké má Boh s mučeníkom Tisom a pre slovenský národ. Boh si Otca Bajana použil za svój nástroj, aby vyriekol toto posolstvo krátko pred svojou smrťou. Otec Pavol Bajan je už na večnosti, ale jeho výzva ajeho posolstvo nás zaväzuje, aby sme ho začali uskutočňovať. Posolstvo Otca Pavla Bajana je vážne a veľmi dôležité a preto bo tu aj celé a doslova ratujem, aby sa s ním oboznámili SloVád na celom svete. Pridám ku nemu svoj posudok a poukážem na to, ako vec blahorečenia mučeníka Tisu postúpila za posledných 10 rokov dopredu. Na 35. výročie jeho mučeníckej smrti, ktoré budeme sláviť 18. apríla 1982, budeme môcť povedať, že ruka Božia je s nami o Boh sám ei pomaly pripravuje oslávenie svojho hrdinského mučeníka. aby ho odmenil nebeskou palmou mučeníctva. Nechajme najprv hovoriť Otca Pavla Bajana, SJ. ako to napísal do JEDNOTY 5. júla 1972. Svoje posolstvo Otec Bajan uverejnil aj v CERN Ä KOVOM ODKAZE, čo je dnešné SLOBODNE SLOVENSKO.- "Dobre som si prezrel všetko, čo sa o ňom popísalo z príležitosti 25. výročia jeho mučeníckej smrti: JOZEF TISO: dobrý statočný človek, horlivý kňaz, kaplán, biskupský tajomník, profesor teológie a farár. Celý život I pracujúc za Boha a národ, verne im slúžiaci ako prezident štátu. Koruna I celého živote: mučeník za Boha a národl Nie chvíľkové mučeníctvo, ale I vlečúce sa cez hrôzy vojny, zajatia, žalárovania, súdenia, až po potupnú smrť na šibenici.” "Toto všetko je prejavom a dôkazom jeho hrdinskej čnosti. Co je ešte viac potrebné, aby bol postavený za vzor dešnému svetu: kňazom, štátnikom a všetkým ľuďom? Od dnešného svätca sa nevyžaduje, aby lietal v povetrí, bol stále alebo äspoň niekedy vo vytržení, robil zázraky, konal vždy len dobre a nikdy sa nedopustil nejakého omylu alebo hriechu. ” "Mnohí svätí Sú ťažko dostávali na oltár, prekonávali sa veľké prekážky, procesy trvali dlho, ale cieľ sa dosiahol!" ‘Keď jezuiti pripravovali blahorečenie svojho klerika Jána Berch- mansa, cirkevná vrchnosť sa zadivila: "Co vy chcete a týmto chlapcom?" Nič zvláštneho neurobil, verne zachovával regulu, bol príkladným pre iných. Andrej Bobola, poľaký jezuila-mučík, bol tak ľudsky slabý ako každý iný v jeho a v dnešnom čase. Keď ho Kozáci zabili, nikto nemal záujem stavať ho na oltár, Sám sa musel ozvať z hrobu a neba. Naši slovenskí mučeníci-jezuiti Ján Simonides a Katunský, ako aj mnohí iní. upadli do zabudnutia." "Pápeža Pia X. "modernisti" pokladajú za zaostalca, reakcionára a tmára, sám Pius XI. nemal ochotu kanonizovať ho, jednako dosť chytro sa dostal na oltár. Vezmime si mučenicu čistoty Máriu Goretti. Počul som. že podobný prípad en stal aj ne Slovensku, po svete ich určite bolo viac, ale upadli do zabudnutia. Pozrime aa na 22 čiernych mučeníkov v Ugande. Ich krajania černoSi nechcú veriť, že by sa po krste boli tak zmenili u viedli svätý život. Ale sa dokázalo, že podstúpili mučenícku smrť pre vieru, tá zmyla všetky hriechy a priniesla im korunu svätosti." ‘ "V prípade Dr. Jozefa Tisu nemôžeme budovať len na jeho mučeníctve. Je pravdu, že vo smrti aa odzrkadľuje celý jeho Život, je znakom jeho kvalít, ale nemožno ju brať priamo ako smrť pre vieru. A smrť Ježiša Krista? Pôlát ho uznal za nevinného, ale nepriatelia kričali. Búri ľud, zakazuje platiť daň cisárovi, robí sa kráľom, protiví bo cisárovi! Bol odsúdený ako zločinec a ukrižovaný so zločincami. Nápis jeho viny: Kráľ židovský (burič, rebelant). Vina politická, nie náboženská! Takto to navonok • vyzeralo." "V našom prípade je potrebné dokázať, že život Jozefe Tisu bol príkladným životom kňaza u štátnika, že mal skutočne čnosti až do hrdinského stupňa. Na toto sú potrební svedkovia, svedectvo tých, ktorí boli a ním, výpoveď taká, čo môžu dosvedčiť pod prísahou, nijaké zveličovania, povedať skutočnú pravdu." "Na toto sa máme sústrediť všetci, ktorí sme s ním žni a osobne ho poznali. Podľa nášho svedectva a jeho hodnovernosti Cirkev bude Tisu súdiť. My nejdeme začínať proces blahorečenia, ale iba robiť prípravu. Pckraco vanie vedeckýrňi pracovníkmi a ustanovizňami. Staral sa hlavne o výmenu vedeckých publikácii. Stál pri zrode podujatí, ktoré mali a stále majú základný význam pre náš kultúrny n náboženský život. Mal Účasť na založení a udržiavaní Slovenského ústavu sv. Cyrila e Metoda v Rime, ktorý sa vynasnažuje pokračovať v činnosti Spolku Sv. Vojtecha. Od začiatku bol spolupracovníkom mesačníka Hlasou z Ríma, ktoré obohacoval svojimi -článkami najmä 8 cyrilometodskou tematikou a spestroval ich sústavnými recenziami zborníkov, kníh alebo štúdií o Slovensku, starostlivo zachycu- - júc všetko, čo sa týkalo života nášho národa. Osobitne čulá bola aktivita prof. Lacku v cyrilometodských jubllej- ; ných rokoch 1963 a 1969. Bol hľadaným prednášateľom na akadémiách, organizátorom liturgických osláv a odborným sprievodcom po miestach, I ktoré sú v Bime drahé každému Slovákovi a Slovanovi. No hlavne svojimi Štúdiami a článkemi, napísanými pri týchto jubileách, vykonal záslužnú prácu tým, že osvetlil zástoj Slovákov v období veľkomoravskom r cyrilo- metodskom. Roku 1963 vyšiel z jeho pera hodnotný životopis sv. Cyrila a Metoda v slovenčine i v angličtine a práve v týchto dňoch sa dostáva na knižný trh aj v znení talianskom. * * — Jeho odborné kvality v cyrilometodukej otázke uznávajú oj neslovenské kruhy. Keď nedávno talianska televízia pripravovala seriál o sv. Cyrilovi a Metodovi, požiadala Prof. Lucku o odbornú spoluprácu. Tak isto si počínala aj rúk t, keď chystala film a tou istou tematikou. — Po vyhlásení našich vierozvestov-za apolupatrónov Európy Sv. Otcom Jánom Pavlom D. bol utvorený Cyrilo metóda ký-komitét na propagovanie ich významu pre celú kresťan a kú Európu. Prof. Lacžo bol doá menovaný ako odborný Člen za Slovákov. Azda je tu vhodné spomenúť, ž® v Komitéte nás zastupujú O. arcibiskup Tomko, O. biskup Hnilica, kým Msgr. Hrušovský je jeho gen tajomníkom. Mnohí z vás bezpochyby poznajú O. Lucku z jeho príhovorov vo PaTi- ádnséom rádiu. V prednáškach o slovenských gréckokatolíkoch mohli ste vybadať jeho úprimný záujem o minulosť našich bratov východného obradu. 1 jeho úvahy o nedeľnej liturgii spĺňali svoje poslanie u kňazov i veriacich. Vedúci slovenského oddelenia by vedeli najlepšie oceniť jeho ochotu, na ktorú sa mohli vždy spoľahnúť. Ako je známe, popri Ústave av.. Cyrila a Metoda, ktorý m zameriava no vydávanie slovenskej náboženskej literatúry, jestvuje v Rime od roku 1961 aj vedecký Slownsiý ústau, ktorý dnes združuje na 200 slovenských vedeckých a kultúrnych pracovníkov v zahraničí a stará Ba o šírenia vedomostí o našich národných hodnotách publikáciami v cudzích rečiach (anglicky. francúzsky, nemecky). Každoročne vydáva zborník prác SLOVAK STUDIES pre svojich členov a záujemcov, — jednotlivcov, pre Slovenské ústavy, Univerzitné nlobo Národné knižnice. Prof. Lacko bol redaktorom všetkých 20 zväzkov, ktoré dosiaľ vyšli, a takmer v každom mal svoj príspevok, ak nie dva. Posledný 21. zväzok je v tlači, bohužiaľ, obetavý redaktor ho už neuvidí. Ako Človek a kňaz náš nebohý Otec Miško, tak sme ho priateľky oslovovali, bol povaha vyrovnaná, láskavá, muž skutočne zlatého srdca, neschopný hnevu, nesmieme trpezlivý a obetavý bez hraníc. Všade, kam prišiel, šíril radosť a optimizmus. A keď svojim zvučným hlasom zanôtil šumné východniarske piesne, cítili sme sa v duchu prenesení ta na naše rodné Slovensko . . . Bývali to nezabudnuteľné chvíle bratskej pohody a národnej spolupatričnosti. Jeho široký úsmev a presvedčivé oči zvýrazňovali vnútorný pokoj a to čo je najhlavnejšie, vraveli nám, že v jeho duši vládla atmosféra živej a žitej viery v Ježiša, ktorému zasvätil celý svoj život. A tak viera sa prejavovala skutkami lásky voči každému, h kým sa stretal. Nech mu je Všemohúci Pán časov i večnosti zaslúženou odmenou! Smutné výročie irew iné veci. Teraz, keď je veľká m- ' Imrich Stol ári k- < * ‘ Dňa 18. apríla 194? zakvílil slo- I venaký národ nad popravou svojho ' verného syna, kňaza, prezidenta 1 Slovenskej republiky, ktorá bola ’ vojensky okupovaná v roku 1945 cudzou .mocnosťou, neprajnou nám ’ Slovákom. Od toho času uplynulo I už celých 36 rokov, no slovenskí národovci doma i v cudzine nezabúda- ) jú na svojho hrdinu-mučeníka Dr. ) Jozefa Tisu, ktorý položil svoj život j za Boha a národ. Každoročne si Slovač spomína toto smutné výro- . čie. keď pomsta Beneša slávila svoj triumf nad smrťou slovenského » prezidenta. Zlo načas zvíťazilo nad dobrom. ' No história nezabúda nad činmi spravodlivých. Vlastná matka náš- ’ ho prezidenta potvrdil" v mojej prítomnosti V polovici opríla 1945 vo Veľkej Bytči v Tiaovakoin dome, že ’ jej syn nič zlého neurobil a preto sa 1 oddávala do moci Božej v tých po- 1 hnutých časoch, keď zdivelí partizáni ničili po nociach slovenských vlastencov a práve v tom čase v Ti- ( novom rodisku bol zavraždený jeden slovenský učiteľ-hrdina, pri- r vrženec slovenskej samostatnosti. I Mnohí Slováci v roku 1945 so rozišli širym svetom. Jedna väčšia skupina prívržencov slovenskej samostatnosti prišla aj do Kanady. Prihlásila sa do Kanadskej Slovenskej Ligy, ktorá taktiež ai osvojila i program slovenskej samostatnosti. V rámci Ligy sa konajú každoročne i pietne spomienky na potupnú smrť i šibenice Msgr. Jozefa Tisu..Dávajú k sa slúžiť sv. omše na jeho pamiatku a píšu sa spomienková články do 1 tlače na slovenského hrdinu-mu í e- ‘ nika. Kanadská Slovenská Liga ide ’ však ešte ďalej. V roku 1976 jej , konvencia odhlasovala zbierku na postavenie pomníka prezidentovi Dr. Jozefovi Tisoví. Táto zbierka doteraz pokračuje a vyniesla úcty- , hodnú sumu vyše 41,000.00 dolá- L rov. Je teraz na Ústrednej správe Ligy, aby sa postarala o miesto, kde pomník bude postavený a tiež ai^ zadovážila potrebné plány na eo- • chu. Medzi konvenciami je to Ústredná správa KSL, ktorá má - právomoc realizovať rozhodnutie konvencie. Táto už dala súhlas na i postavenie pomníka a treba ho začať uskutočňovať v tomto jubilejnom roku Kanadskej Slovenskej Ligy. ktorá slávi 50. výročie od svojho založenia. Zozbierané peniaze pôjdu len na pomník, lebo na to boli určené a nie fácia, budeme potrebovať azda väčéiu sumu, nejakých 50,000.00 dolárov a preto sa prosia slovenské duše, aby na zbierku ešte prispeli, ak tak doteraz neurobili. Ozvali sa aj jednotlivé hlasy, aby sa zozbierané peniaze radšej venovali na knihy, ktoré budú pojednávať o Dr. Jozefovi Tisoví. Treba ho vraj najskôr očistiť od nepriateľskej nepravdy. No Slováci nemajú prezidenta Tisu od ničoho očisťovať, on je pre nás vzorom, príkladom a mu- čertíkom. Je zaujímavé, že práve poniektorí jednotlivci, ktorí na pomník nič nedali, chceli by nás poučovať na čo treba peniaze použiť. Dokonca sa chýri verzia, že Megr. Tiso napísal latinský list počas poslednej vojny do Vatikánu, ktorý nevrhá dobré svetlo na slovenskú samostatnosť. Zistilo sa však, že v tomto liste nie je nič závadného, azda na niektorú Štylistickú vetu. Nuž my pôjdeme svojou zlatou strednou cestou, ktorá je lepšia. Nič nedáme na SuŔkanie rôznych jedin- Nopokon si prečítajme niektoré výroky prezidenta Dr. Jozefa Tisu, ktoré povedal počas trvania Sloven skej republiky. — Samostatnosť sa neudrží ani rečami, ani schôdzami, ani piesňami, ale sa udrží iba prácou, cťou a charakterom. — Historické poslanie Slovenského štátu je, do najvyššieho stupňa možnosti -vyvinúť slovenský etnický svojráz. — Naša národná neodvislosť znamená, že chceme ako národ vo svojej zemi, na svojich majetkoch a statkoch byť neodviali. — Cim kto vrelejäie uzná našu národnú samobytnosť a čim účinnejšie podporuje našu štátnu samostatnosť, tým lepší priateľ, ktorý môže počítať na tým väčšiu lásku a vernosť Stováka-národovca. — Jednota národa nech nie je frázou, ale líniou, ktorú musíme bezpodmienečne uskutočňovať. Všetky naše úsiliu musia vyúsťovať v jednom cieli, a to je blaho slovenského národu. — 14. marca pochoval národ slovenský svoju minulosť, začal novú epochu svojho života obdivuhodným napätím všetkých síl v budovaní svojho samostatného života. — Národa sme sa nikdy za nij akú cenu nezriekli. Národ bol vrcholným záujmom a tomuto musí slúžiť všetko. Stát je nie cieľ, je len prostriedok, slúžiaci národu. Dr, E. Beneš a slovenskí suplikanti (0 vyjednávaniach delegácie SNŘ b č.-8. exilnou vládou v Londýne, október - november 1944) Navrhol som mu, aby poukázal Cechom, že omnoho výitelnejíiu pomoc by im mohli poskytnúť Rusi. Pík. Perkins mi odpovedal, že už tak urobil. Česi mu však na to odpovedali, že v takomto prípade Rusi ptedkta- vujú beznádejný prípad, pretože doteraz nikdy neposkytli pomoc ňa čas. V tomto ohľade my sme vraj omnoho spoľahlivejší. Toto je naozaj revolučný obrat v českom zmýšľaní. Súčasnú situáciu pokladám za najuspokojívejší vývoj v Ceako-Sloven- aku od mníchovského rozhodnutia (v lete 1938), najmä keď ma pDr. Pw- kinö uisťuje, že slovenské divízie m celkom dobre držia."(30) Nasledujúceho dňa (31. aug.) vypracoval F. K. Roberta druhé memorandum, (31) doplnené o ďalšie informácie z britských a českých prameňov: 1'Veľvyslanec Nichola mi priniesol zápis z rozhovoru, ktorý mal včera večer a ministrom Ripkom. Z rozhovoru vidno, že Česi oficiálne informovali britskú vládu o povstaní na Slovensku n pri tom žiadali: (I) vojenskú pomoc, tj. bombardovanie dopravných stredísk a zhodenie vojenského materiálu, (R) vydať prehlásenie, ktorým aa Slovákom bojuj w±n proti Nemecku priznáva Štatút spojeneckých vojak ('the belligerent status'). S podobnou žiadosťou sa obrátili Česi oj na sovietsku a americkú vládu a české vojenské kruhy sú v styku a naším generálnym štábom a to Special Operations Executive. Veľvyslanec Nichols mi hovoril, že Ceai nie sú vôbec spokojní ■ doterajšími výsledkami, a akými sa ich žiadosť o vojenskú pomoc stretáva u Rusov.(32) Bol by veľmi rád, keby sme mohli nejakým pozitívnym spôsobom výsť v ústrety spomenutým českým žiadostiam, pretože v súčasnej situácii hy to politicky veľmi užitočne zapôsobilo. Rozprával aom sa aj s plk. Perkinsom, ktorý má k veci tieto pripomienky: Niet pochybnosti, že Slovenská armáda je zaangažovaná v boji s Nemcami, hoci treba ľutovať, že naše správy zo Slovenska boli menej uspokojivé než napríklad z Poľska a museli sme sa spoliehať len na české hlásenia, ktoré sa v minulosti často ukázali byť prehnane optimistické. Preto aj teraz buds treba čakať, aby sa ukázalo, Či máme do činenia a vážnym povstaním n ako sa budú ved vyvíjať ďalej. Dosiaľ — čo sa týka informácii na SOE — nemáme nijakú vedomosť o organizovaných partizánskych útvaroch,(33) iba o slovenskej armáde. Preto každé vyhlásenie o štatúte spojeneckých wisk by sa malo vzťahovať len na slovenskú armádu a nemalo by zahrňovať neznáme n neorganizované skupiny bojovníkov bez uniforiem, Btď. Pokiaľ ide o praktickú pomoc, ťažkosti sú obrovské. Pretože Ceai nechceli nikdy spolupracovať s SOE na prípravách poviUnla, hod zrne ich k tomu' opätovne vyzývali b neplánovali toto povstanie v súlade b nami, sme postavení pred úplne novú situáciu.(S4) Maršal letectva J. Stessor zakázal všetky operácie nad Poľskom a Ceako-Stovenskom vzhľadom na vysoké strety a phiý mesiac. Okrem toho vôbec nevieme, kde zhodiť zbrane, alebo pre koho sú určené. Z toho hľadiska vyhliadky teda nie sú veľmi sľubné. Samozrejme, že politicky je veľmi dôležité, aby sa o nás nemyslelo, že nám na týchto Slovákoch záleží menej ako na Poliakoch. Neprestajne zdfc razňujem nielen vedeniu SOE, ale každému, koho Ba to týka, aby všetky české žiadosti ss aspoň sympaticky vypočuli. Ale tak sa mi vidí, že naj- 1 rýchlejšou praktickou pomocou, ktorou môžeme poslúžiť, je bombardo- 1 vanie dopravných stredísk na Slovensku, ako nás o to Česi žiadali a nech 1 ďalšiu pomoc poskytnú Rusi. V tomto nnyale'by sa mohlo napísať aj nAŠ- ’ mu generálnemu štábu. Ohľadne vyhlásenia o štátuto vojnovedúceho spojeneckého vojaka, myslím, Že by bolo najlepšie, keby sme trošku počkali, ako M situácia vyvinie. Medzitým by sme sa poradili bo Sovietskym zväzom a s americkou vládou r opýtali aa ich, d súhlasia pridať sa k takému vyhláseniu. Vyhli- j senie sa však musí obmedzovať len na organizované jednotky sloveniisj i armády, pretože o iných jednotkách odbojového hnutia nemáme dosť informácií. Navrhneme, aby také vyhlásenie urobili spoločne všetky tri 1 vlády, ovšem za predpokladu, že za niekoľko dni bude ešte stále slovenská armáda bojovať proti Nemoom."|35) K tomuto memorandu pridal ďalšie poznámky legálny odborník brit- 1 akého minirterstva zahraničia. Upozorňoval: "Je veľmi dôležité, aby sme vo všetkých veciach týkajúcich sa SIo- 1 venska od začiatky držali krok eo sovietskou vládou a tak vyhli podobným' 1 nepríjemnostiam, oko v poľskom prípade. Cesko-álovenská vláda koni ko- * rektne, keď sa ob rada na všetky tri spojenecké vlády a rovnakými požia- J davkami. * Co sa týka britskej vlády, myslím, že sa môžeme bezpečne a bez politického ritike podujať na bombardovanie takých vojenských objektov, ’ ako dopravné uzly a mestá, nakoľko to strategické a geografické okolnosti 1 dovolajú. Veľmi však pochybujem o účelnosti zhadzovania zbraní odbojovému hnutiu, kým sa nepresvedčíme, že Sovieti súhlasia s povstaním L ako takým. Ináč by sme sa mohli opäť ostihnúť v situácii, kde sme pri- ' nútení podporovať odboj v nemožných podmienkarh. Ohľadne vyhlásenia štatútu vnjnovedúdch spojeneckých vôjsk, tu myslím, že musíme bezpodmienečne naliehať na to, aby sa k vyhláseniu ’ pripojila aj Amerika a Sovietsky zväz. Dr. Benešovi by sme nijako nepo- 1 mohli, keby sme mu naše vyhlásenia dali, ale Sovieti by mu bo nedali. Na šťastie v tomto prípade je menej obáv, že by Sovieti sa stavali proti vyhli- seniu."(36| 30. F0 371 (38941) C11809. 31. FO 371 (38941) No. 849. 32.
