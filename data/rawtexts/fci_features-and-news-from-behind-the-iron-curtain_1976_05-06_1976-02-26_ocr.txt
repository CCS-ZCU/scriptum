TRUTHINFO Cables: TRUTHINFO LONDON W14 Vol. XXVIII No. FCI 5/6 (1299/1300) *Founded in 1948 * 26.2. 1976 CAMPAIGN AGAINST RADIO FREE EUROPE WILL MISFIRE (London/Ed.) - The world s press has briefly recorded the fact that yet anoth- er agent planted in Radio Free Europe 'has been recalled by his Communist masters. He is Pavel Minarik, Captain of the Czechoslovak Intelligence Service. He went abroad in I960 as a refugee in the mass exodus from the Soviet-occupied CS(S)R, when the infil- tration of escapees by agents provocateurs and spies was regarded as unavoidable. At any rate, their detection has been and always will be a difficult problem. After seven years service abroad, Minarik returned to’ a hero s welcome and was made to go through the standard procedure of statements, press conferences and radio and television interviews,, which may yet turn out to be not such a one-sided affair aft- er all. Time is always needed to evaluate whether slinging mud on Western targets helps the Communist cause, or whether it is counter-productive, since such operations usually confirm the readers, listeners and viewers in their belief that the anti-Commun- ist exiles are not inactive and that they do find considerable support for their liber- ‘ tarian struggle among their foreign friends. ALL CZECHOSLOVAK MASS MEDIA gave Minarik the widest possible coverage, with the official "Rude Pravo" and radio and television leading the way. At a press confer- ence in Prague, the questions were very well assigned: besides the local press, corres- pondents of the Soviet TASS, Izvestia, Novosti, Komsomolskaya Pravda, Bulgarian BTA, GDR s Neues Deutschland, Polish "Zycie Warszawy", PAP and Interpress, were all given the chance to submit their loaded questions. Nevertheless, the overwhelming impression nn- ong the Czech and Slovak public, as well as in other SOVBLOC countries, must have been that Radio Free Europe must be effective, that it is a thorn in the side of the Coimnun- ist politicians and propagandists, and so must be vilified and", if possible, silenced. Former US Senator Fulbright is repeatedly invoked as an ally because he referred to RFE and Radio Liberty (broadcasting to the USSR.) •as "relics of the cold war". What is more important, even people who are not regular RFE listeners have novi learned scores of nam- es, some quite well known ones, mentioned as belonging tc RFE staff, and many others as collaborators and correspondents. The same applies to various exile organisations. N/1TURJ1LLY, THE CI״ IS PRESENTED AS THE LUJN_CULPRIT. It recruits end con- trols the staff, plans campaigns and finances their execution. . It would be difficult to check what the attacked individuals or organisations have done and promoted within RFE campaigns to get the news and truth to the listeners on the other side of the Iron Curtain. What FCI can most definitely say is that every imputed association between FCI and CIA is pure and simple fabrication, a lie ns good as the famous British wartime courier "who never was", although a body was washed up on the Spanish coast for the ben- efit of enemy Intelligence. Further accusations, such as any connection with the war- time Sicherheitsdienst, laughable as they are, , are reported verbatim elsewhere in this Press Bulletin. The serious lesson of it all is, that judging by the fabrications ag- ainst FCI we should be technically obliged to accept any disclaimer by the CIA which may be offered - even if we do know that they are not saints, as they cannot very well be in their arduous, unsentimental and important task of counteracting the activities of the KGB and its Satellite stooges. CAPTAIN־ MINARI1Í s OFFICIAL־ "TESTIMONY״־ disclosed that on his journey into ex- ile, for the purpose of penetrating RFE, he was equipped with materials and information which his bosses knew would be of interest to the RFE organisation. Having delivered them, he had laid the door wide open... Minarik also claimed that not a single employee of RFE s Czechoslovak Depart- ment had.regarded the Helsinki detente operation as something positive. If that was so, subsequent events, including Angola, have certainly proved them right. For the Commun- ists, the most disturbing exile activity seems to be their demand not only for the res- toration'of freedom and independence (stressed in the testimony as a priceless moral boost for the Czechs and Slovaks) but also the restoration of territories occupied and annexed by the Soviet Union. This must refer to the constitutionally inseparable prov- ince of Sub-Carpathian Ruthenia, a claim pursued by the Czechoslovak West-European Ad- visory Committee., obviously the most active among Czech organisations in Europe. (East- ern Poland, s losses to the Soviets or Romania s Bessarabia, are just two more fruits .on the tree of Soviet imperialism.) To conclude with, Captain Minarik promised some "further revelations".( 32/jj) [pageend1]FCI - NEWS AND FEATURES FROM BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN February 1976. CS(S)R/UK: LATEST PORTRAIT OF a CIA AGENT BEHIND FCI's EDITORIAL DESK (London/FClJ - Captain Pavel Minarik of the CS(S)R Incelligence, vzho in 1968 in- filtrated Radio Free Europe s Czechoslovak Department, has been recalled to Prague and is now "exposing" CIA activities. In itself, the infiltration into RFE of a Czechoslovak Intelligence agent is surely the best argument for CIA s counter-espionage wherever Amer- ican and Allied activities are involved. (RFE is a US Congress-financed transmitter.) TESTIMONY: The return of Minarik led to a great new anti-RFE campaign, which included sTpress^ohference, radio and televisionappearances (protest at the International Olympic Committee against the presence of RFE reporters in Innsbruck, vzhich led to the withdrawal of their accreditation), and the publication of a score of interviews with Cze- choslovak, Soviet (Pravda, Izve^Jia, ^assAine^c•י correspondents about RFE s alleged Int- elligence activities. Those/questioned/included a certain Zdenek Rosenbaum of the CTK (Czechoslovak Press Agency),־whose testimony is published i.n Rude Pravo (official news- paper of the CS(S)R Communist Party) of January 30, 1976• It reads: j’ZDENEK ROSENBAUM, CTK: According to an item of January 16, 1976, Elliott Ri- chardson, former US Ambassador to Britain, admitted that CIA carried out its operations and had an objective in England, could you tell u3 something about it?" "Answer: I can hardly speak about CIA/s work in Britain, but perhaps I could mention one campaign which was inspired by CIA via Radio Free Europe and vzhich took place in England. In the second half of 1974? there was to take place the visit of a Czecho- Slovak Parliamentary delegation to. England. The CIA ordered some collaborators of the so-called Czechoslovak Advisory Committee, which I have already described, <0 prepare a campaign to prevent the visit. In exemplary collaboration with RFE s Evaluation Depart- ment, the Advisory Committee prepared background material for a campaign of slander in the British Press. Jcsef Josten, vzho heads the so-called FCI News Agency _n London, an agent of several Intelligence Services vzho was in the Sicherheitsdienst (Nazi Intelligence) dur- ing World War II, was charged with organising this campaign in England. Obviously Josten maintains his Press Service witn American money, and so, with the help of materials rec- eived from RFE and in association with Bernard Levin, the British journalist, he prepared this inflammatory, vulgar and insulting campaign vzhich was a series of truly abominable and shameful articles, insulting not only to Czechoslovakia but to the Soviet Union too. Further, on the directives of CIA, Josten also organised a campaign of letters against the presence of the Czechoslovak delegation in England, all under the slogan: "V/e are serving the cause of better understanding between nations"." FCI COMtENT: 1) Neither FCI nor its Editor have any contact whatsoever vzithclA or any foreign Intelligence Service, thus cannot be maintained by their funds. Both FCI and its Editor are ready to open their account books for inspection of their sources of income by a lawyer and a chartered accountant acceptable to both sides. FCI prides itself on being a professional independent and unsubsidised source of information. 2) FCI received no material about the Parliamentary Delegation s visit from RFE. The Editor knew personally Deputy Voj-’-a Erban, a friend from student days, who ser- ved as an Intelligence officer with the Czechoslovak Army in the USSR during World War II. FCI received information from Erban s former political colleagues that he was in the KGB. 3) FCI never received and would not accept instructions from anyone. Any ev- ent or piece of information is treated on its news value and presented in reports to FCI subscribers in the Western press, radio and television, vzhich check and extend such mat- erial in accordance vzith their ovzn judgment and requirements. 4) Mr. Bernard Levin of The Times is among the many journalists and newspapers subscribing to FCI, and he wrote one single article. Two other articles were written in The Sunday Telegraph by Norman Kirkham, their Diplomatic Correspondent, who interviewed British political personalities and the Secretary of the British Interparliamentary Group. His reports were discussed in the House of Commons and dealt with by the Rt. Hon. Selwyn Lloyd, M.P., the recently retired Speaker. 5) That was, purely and simply, a Czechoslovak-British event and the USSR was mentioned only indirectly, since the aforementioned Deputy is an agent of the Soviet KGB. 6) THE REFERENCE TO FCÍ s EDITOR as an alleged former Nazi agent has been made so often in the ČS׳(s )R s mass media, that it was brought to the notice of the British For- eign and Commonwealth Office, as a matter of routine, by a prominent British Member of Parliament, vzho asked the FCO to protest against this constant denigration of a British subject. The FCO reply, signed by a Minister, said that it would bring the matter to the attention of the CS (S)R Ambassador. It is well xciown that the Editor of FCI served dur- ing the war not only in the Czechoslovak Army but also in the Allied High Command (SHAEF/ PUD): he returned after the war to Czechoslovakia where he served on the staff of the Press Department of Jan Masaryk s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, doubtless a very risky move for an allegedS_icherheitjj.ienst agent. (The Sicherheitsdienst archives and their cont- acts were in the hands of the Czechoslovak authorities and under direct Communist scruti- ny, since both the Ministry of the Interior■} controlling the Police and Intelligence Ser- vices) and the Ministry of Defence had Communists at their head. (This is mentioned mer- ely to show that the Soviet-directed disinformation services are constantly at work and' that their character assassination operations are now as strong as they have ever been.~J [pageend2]
