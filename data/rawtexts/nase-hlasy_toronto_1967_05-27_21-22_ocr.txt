LITERA PRINTING CO. Address: 1255 Queen Street West, Toronto 3, Ont. AUTHORIZED AS SECOND CLASS MAIL BY THE POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT OTTAWA, AND FOR PAYMENT OF POSTAGE IN CASH. Editorial (Comment Josef Cermák, Chairman, Editorial Board We came for many reasons: running away from outbursts of brutality in "civilized” Europe, searching for a quiet landscape of uninvolved peace, seeking freedom or material abundance and sometimes just adventure. We came and in varying degrees most of us found what we came to seek. True, the reality did not always match our expectations. For, in the heart of post-war Europe, bleeding from too many wounds inflicted by both friends and enemies and perhaps just as many self- inflicted, it was easy to dream about vast far-away Canada in technicolour and panavision. But on the whole we found Canada a beautiful and blessed land. She accepted us and offered us a refuge, a hope and an opportunity. We are deeply grateful. But, being human and being proud, we like to feel that we have given something in return, that we have not come empty- handed, that we have justified the trust and proved equal to the opportunity. This centennial issue is an expression of that feeling. It attempts to give our fek low Canadians a few-glimpses of the historical contact between the country of our origin and the country of our adoption, a sketchy survey of the contribution made to Canada by Canadians of Czech and Slovak origin and a brief outline of our political and cultural heritage. We came from a people with an old culture and we are proud of their contribution to the common heritage of mankind. That contribution is, in the end, the true measure of any nation. We still have deep love for our native land, deepened. perhaps, by the red shadow which still lies heavy over her people. But that love does not diminish our love for Canada or our loyalty to her. It's more a Josef (J.R.C.) Cermák is a Toronto lawyer Publishers VOL. XIII No. 21-22 (515-516) burden than a joy. For it would be so much easier for us to abandon the people With whom we once shared our youthful visions to the Communist system and to enjoy in placid tranquility our homes, our cars and our summer cottages. Too many of us, and it is not to our credit, are doing exactly that. We are sometimes criticized and occasionally ridiculed by the so-called liberals for our anti-Communist stand. Our answer to that is that, having seen Communism cripple the life of a whole generation in our native land, having seen some of the best men and women jailed, tortured and executed, having ourselves paid a high price for our convictions — self-imposed exile for a man from central Europe is a stupendous price — we would not like to see a similar fate inflicted on Canada. It is argued that profound changes have taken place in Soviet Russia and her satellites. Changes there have been, but they have not been made by the Communist ruling class. They have been forced on this class by economic stagnation, the threat of China, revolts and the dissatisfaction of the people. The aims of Communism have not changed. The policy of the Soviets, as Mr. Peter Worthington, of the Toronto Telegram, found after two years’ stay in Moscow, still is to bury the West. Their means have changed. They are more subtle and because of this might prove even more deadly than open terror and violence. We would not wish to see Canada become another Communist republic, whether of the Stalinist or the "liberalized” variety. We want her, perhaps naively, to become the promised land of this and the next century. We want her to come as close to the dreams of her poets as any reality can match the stuff of dreams. And we want to help to make those dreams come true. 3 [pageend3]ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Publishing an ethnic newspaper is a labour of love and a costly labour of love. It is labour at times so frustrating that it tests the endurance of the publisher and editors beyond endurance. The publishers of this paper, Mr. George Hlubucek and Mr. Josef Kuril have met this test nobly. Having been associated with them from the first issue of Nase Hlasy some 13 years ago, I know how much this paper has cost them in money, and still more, in time. I would like to pay a sincere tribute to their selfless dedication. Producing this Centennial issue was a comedy of so many errors and of such confusion that this product, with all its manifest imperfections, ranks as one of the minor miracles of this decade. Let me give you one example. Some time last fall the publishers received a letter from John Fisher, Centennial Commissioner, offering encouragement and more particularly, significant advertising. I wrote to Mr. Fisher outlining our plans and accepting his offer. No reply came. I wrote again. Again, no reply. I have concluded that Mr. Fisher, realizing the cost of millions of dollars in Centennial projects to the Canadian taxpayers, decided to save a few dollars on our Centennial Issue. Since, however, we are good guys, we are sending him a copy of this issue with our compliments anyway. I would also like to thank the many people who contributed time and ability to producing this issue, among them Mr. Jaroslav (Jerry) Reichl for designing the cover, Miss Alena Reichl for proofreading part of the issue, Mr. Mirko Janecek for compiling information on, and editing the commerce and industry section and of course, all the contributors to this issue. Chairman, Editorial Board SLOVAK MOUNTAIN HUT AT EXPO Visitors to the Czechoslovak pavilon at Expo may do well to pause at a “Slovak Mountain Hut”. It was built, at least partly, by political prisoners at the infamous Leopoldov Penitentiary, notorious as a Communist concentration camp for both Czechoslovak and foreign political prisoners. A report on the conditions in this Penitentiary was published a few months ago in “Smena”, a publication of the Slovak Board of Czechoslovak News Federation. This report reveals mutilation attempts, suicides and generally, typical concentration camp conditions. Wc would like lu apologize ro our readers as well as to our contributors for a number of rypografical errors which escaped us an we proofread this paper. In particular we are very sorry that the two quotation« by Primo AAinictor Lector B. Pearson and Premier John Robarts on page 93 have a number of type errors in them. We are sure, however, that neilhei u( lliem will send us t o a concentration camp. 4 OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT Mr. J. R. C. Cermák, Masaryk Memorial Institute Inc., c/o Wahn, Mayer, Smith, Creber, Lyons, Torrance and Stevenson, Bank of Nova Scotia Building, 44 King Street West, Toronto 1, Ontario. Dear Mr. Cermák: The Board of Governors accepts with great pleasure your offer of the sum of to be paid over a three-year period, towards the salary of a professor in the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures who will be responsible for teaching a course or courses in Czech and Slovak Literature. It is understood that the selection of this professor, and his rank (within the three professorial ranks) will be at the discretion of the University. The University agrees to continue the course in Czech and Slovak Literature for a minimum of three years after 1970. After 1973 it is the intention of the University that the course be continued indefinitely unless lack of students or simi 1 ar unpredictable reasons make it impossible to do so. I am anxious to arrange proper publicity of this generous award, and would be very pleased if the official announcement of it conid be made jointly by the University and the Institute. I will ask the University Information Officer, Mr. Edey, to get in touch with you within the next few days. I would like to say how delighted I am personally at this very splendid benefaction. It is gifts such as this that enable the University to make distinctive contributions to scholarship. You may be assured that your gift to the University will be effectively used. Yours sincerely, Claude Bissell, President. Modesty dictates that we delete the amount. . NOTE ON CZECH AND SLOVAK IMMIGRATION TO CANADA Apart from Prince Rupert and the Moravian Brethren, it would seem that the first Czech immigrants came to Canada in 1884. They were four farmers who established themselves in Saskatchewan and founded the hamlet Kolin. Some immigrants came in 1896 and 1898 and most settled near Esterhazy in Saskatchewan. In 1904 a Czech hamlet, Prague, was established near Viking, Alberta. Winnipeg soon became the centre of Czech activities. In 1911 there were some 1,800 persons in Canada who had been born in Bohemia or Moravia. After the First World War, more Czechs immigrated to Canada. Another wave came after the 1945 Communist coup d'etat in Czechoslovakia.

The Slovaks began to move from the United States to Western Canada in the 1880’s. In 1886 a group of Slovaks were brought from Pennsylvania to the district north of Qu'appele River in Saskatchewan. Somewhat later, a fairly numerous group of Slovaks went into mining in Alberta and still later in the Timmins, Kirkland Lake area of Ontario. A large number of Slovaks immigrated to Canada after the First World War and again after the Communist coup d’etat in Czechoslovakia in 1948. The largest number of Slovaks are to be found in Toronto and Montreal, Windsor, Hamilton and Vancouver. It is estimated that there are approximately 70,000 people of Czech and Slovak origin in Canada, of which probably 40 per cent live in Ontario. [pageend4]Our Oentenniaf projects 1.

[pageend6]EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS OF ANGLO-CZECHOSLOVAK RELATIONS An address by Cardinal DR. JOSEF BERAN, Archbishop of Prague, Primate of Bohemia, delivered in the Cholmmondeley Room, the House of Lords, on October 31, 1966 at a luncheon in his honour sponsored by the Rt. Hon. The Viscount Boyd of Merton. It is not only a great honour for me but it also impresses upon me a great responsibility when I am invited to make a few observations in this historic building so important to your own country and to the welfare of the Commonwealth and indeed the entire world. For a citizen of Czechoslovakia it is also a rare opportunity to retrace before such an important and very distinguished audience of politicians, press representatives and personalities from various walks of British life the age-old friendship which has existed and often flourished between your country and mine. As early as 1174 the Abbot of Milevsko had already recorded in that monastery’s history the death of Thomas Becket. He related that there was no need to speak about Becket's many miraculous acts as, here I quote "his deeds are well known to us’’. Later our king Wences- laus II obtained Becket's relics. An altar was erected to his memory in the cathedral of St. Guy, and the famous monastery and church of St. Thomas were built under the Prague castle hill. But to my mind the year 1381 is one of special importance because certain events took place which enable me to claim that your country and mine entered into a solemn treaty which makes them historically the oldest of allies. . Here I hope that no one will take this claim amiss. I am not re-writing history, as sometimes happens these days, but merely re-stating historical facts. It was in December that year that the very young Princess Anne, the daughter of Emperor Charles the Fourth, the king of Bohemia, arrived at Dover. In January of the following year she was married to Richard the second. Although her reign was short - she died a victim of the plague - she had already become known as "Good Queen Anne". As was the custom of the day she brought with her many noblemen and clergy and laid solid foundations for cultural and other contacts which have developed ever since. But that was not all, Anne’s arrival was marked by the signing of a pact between the King of Bohemia and the King of England, dated 'in the fourth year of the reign of Richard II”, that is 1381, and I am tempted to quote a few words from it. It said: "Richard, by God's grace King of England and France and Lord of Ireland, sends greetings to all whom this document concerns." And it continued: "We wished first of all to be closely joined with our illustrious brother Vaclav, by God's grace, future Emperor, not only by such a treaty of affection, but also to arrange a relation of kinship and to enter into a firm, unique and eternal Alliance. "May I repeat?" ... to enter into a firm, unique, eternal Alliance." Such words are indeed sweet music to our ears. They were a prelude to the passage which reads:" . . . not only to arrange such an alliance and friendship, but also to happily conclude a marriage agreement . . . between us and her most illustrious Ladyship, Lady Anne, renowned sister of this same brother of ours." All this was in my thoughts when I stood the other day at Queen Anne's grave in Westminster Abbey — near the tomb of St. Edward the Confessor, while I prayed for the continuation of friendly, brotherly relations between the peoples of our two countries. I have dwelt at some length upon this event. It is, however, also of significance to relate that ever since the establishment of the University of Prague in 1384 there has been a lively exchange of students with the University of Oxford. Throughout our mutual history we have wonderful instances of co-operation and mutual support. More recently in 1618 an English princess Elizabeth: Alzbeta in Czech, daughter of Cardinal J osej Beran lives in exile in Rome. PRINCE RUPERT OF BOHEMIA THE IMMIGRANT WHO NEVER CAME He was born in Hradčany Castle and slept in a cradle of ivory and gold and precious jewels presented by the women of Bohemia. It was winter — and his parents were the Winter King and Queen of Bohemia, enjoying their brief glory in Prague before the darkness of the Thirty Years' War settled over Europe. He was the first royal prince to be born in Bohemia for more than a hundred years; descriptions of his christening at Graz on Christmas Eve, 1619, read like fairy stories. The Russian Embassy arrived with fifty coaches, each bearing red leather chests of furs for the baby prince, while the Muscovite Embassy gave him three coaches, one drawn by six white bears, one by six black bears, and one by six stags. Prague celebrated the auspicious beginning of the new regime. It could not last, of course. With the coming of spring the glittering frost melted, and after the Battle of the White Mountain the Winter King and Queen fled from Bohemia. In the excitement the infant prince who had been the symbol of the new age was forgotten, until his crying attracted the attention of the King's chamberlain who threw him into the last wagon leaving Prague in his parents' train. Except for a brief visit many years later, and the probably apochryphal story that the first words were "Praise the Lord" in Czech, this was the end of Prince Rupert’s connection with Bohemia. The rest of his life was spent in exile and in arms. He saw action on the continent, and then gained his greatest glory fighting for the hopeless cause of his uncle the King of England. After the restoration of the English monarchy in 1660, Rupert returned to the English court of his cousin, Charles II. No longer the dashing cavalry commander, he was an old man by contemporary standards living quietly in the midst of gaiety and splendour, more interested in scientific experiments, drawing, and tennis. It appeared that Rupert's useful days were over. There was, however, to be one last fling — one more adventure typical of the man in its audacity and in its vision. In 1665 two penniless Frenchmen came to the court of King Charles with tales of their discoveries in the frozen lands of Canada and of the fabulous wealth to be made there in the fur trade. Over and over again Radisson and Groseilliers told of the country they had explored, and of the ease with which a passage could be found from 7 PART I ENCOUNTERS IN HISTORY [pageend7]King James, married Frederick known as the "Winter King" of Bohemia. Following some upheavals in our own history, England offered fruitful refuge to John Amos Comenius, accepted as "teacher of nations" because of his influence in the sphere of modernizing education. Wenceslaus Hollar, the XVIIth century master of etching, as guest of the Earl of Arundel became what I would call a "photographer" of the life of that period. It fills me with pride that Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth, has, I am told, a most extensive collection of his works. That much, and perhaps too briefly, about our mutual past. In our own times just over 50 years ago, G. K. Chesterton edited a brochure which appeared under the title "Bohemia's Claim to Freedom". Professor T. G. Masaryk made London his base during World War I. In this he was aided by Professor Seton-Watson and that great journalist from the Times, Wickham Steed. Masaryk, of course, became our President-Liberator. Words and political campaigns alone were not the mainspring of our renewed indepedence: We were accorded the status of an ally in war because of the deeds of our soldiers. It is sometimes now forgotten that a Czechoslovak army was master of the entire trans-Siberian railway, and that, right in the midst of a revolutionary upheaval. When we dwell upon history, we cannot remain blind to the fact that friendship, even between allies and friends, is from time to time put to the test. It even suffers scars. During World War II London once again became the seat of a Czechoslovak liberation movement — a situation precipitated by less fortunate decisions which are collectively known as the Munich agreement. Yet the presence of my country's leaders and of a new army of liberation on British soil surely bore witness that our friendship has survived the acid test. When I visited Westminster Abbey, I was shown a book in the lady chapel with the names of those of my compatriots who gave their lives during the glorious air Battle of Britain. On Friday, October 28th, our Independence Day I visited the graves of airmen and soldiers whose remains rest at the Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey. In that common fight 1,200 died, besides the many thousands on the other battlefields of World War II. Now, may I just say: My dear allies, we are once again assembled for one single and happy purpose — to give expression here to the desire to strengthen and support our mutual friendship, having, I hope, learned even from the past misunderstandings, mistakes and the resulting sacrifices. May such a bond carry on in this spirit of your Magna Carta supporting the yearning of my nation for justice and opposing the infringement of rights, both of the individual and of nations. We have never ceased to look upon Great Britain as a European and World power. May God strengthen your hand to continue playing your historic part. The opportunity for such active policy is indeed on your own doorstep. All that is involved is the general application of principles to which we are all bound by our honour and dignity. So, may this happy occasion unite us in a friendship similar to that expressed in the pact of the past — in a firm, unique and eternal alliance. This will survive only if it rests on the principles of democratic rights and justice: Principles which I am sure will be restored to my own beloved country before it is too late. FCI. Hudson Bay to the Orient. It was the sort of story that appealed to Prince Rupert, who had dreamed of a remote overseas kingdom in his youth. With several others he provided ships, men, and trading goods for the Frenchmen to push once more through the ice into Hudson Bay. When the little ships sailed back up the Thames to London, they carried, not the riches of the East, but a fortune in furs. The success of this first expedition showed that Radisson and Groseilliers knew what they were talking about. A company was formed to exploit their discoveries, known as the Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson's Bay, or more familiarly, the Hudson’s Bay Company. On May 2, 1670, King Charles signed a royal charter giving "Our Deare and entirely Beloved Prince Rupert” and the seventeen others who formed the company the monopoly of trade in the territory draining into Hudson Bay, and making them its "true and absolute Lordes and Proprietors." Neither Charles nor Rupert, of course, had any idea that the charter granted complete control of 1,486,000 square miles, more than a third of Canada. This vast area called Rupert’s Land, remained under the government of the Company for two hundred years, until it was finally bought from them by the new Dominion of Canada. Prince Rupert served as Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company from its founding in 1670 until his death in 1682. Meetings of the Company were often held in his lodgings, where the Adventurers, the curls of their huge wigs touching, pored over their incomplete and innaccurate maps of Rupert’s Land and made their plans for each season's successful trading. Rupert himself never visited Canada, but from London he directed an enterprise of tremendous Canadian importance. Prince Rupert is chiefly remembered today for the thundering hoofs of his cavalry charges during the English Civil War. At the beginning and the end of his life, however, lay the frost of Czechoslovakia and of Canada. E. G. F MORAVIAN BRETHERN The Battle of the White Mountain, which had had such a decisive effect on Prince Rupert's life, was also of great significance in the development of the second important influence on Canada. The Moravian Brethren, a Protestant communion founded after the martyrdom of John Hus in 1415, was driven into exile following the victory of the Roman Catholic forces in the Battle of the White Mountain. Led by their great Bishop John Comenius, the Brethren settled in Poland and in Saxony. Over the years, of course, they attracted many inembers who were not born in Bohemia or Moravia, and in 1727 at Herrnhut, Saxony, a renewed Moravian Church was formed with stronq German influence. From the beginning the new church was interested In foreign missions. The first Mutuvian mission was established in 1732 — to the Negroes in the West Indies. In the next year or two missionaries were sent to the Eskimos in Greenland, the Indians in Georgia, Pennsylvania and New York state, and the Negroes in North Carolina. The Moravians' first attempt to establish a mission in Canada was made in 1752. It was an utter failure. With high hopes and a prefabricated mission house four Brethren sailed from London to cottlo among the Fikimns nn the roast of Labrador. When Ihey unived they were received amicably but shortly afterwards one of the missionaries, the captain of the ship, and five members of the crew were murdered. Because there were not enough suiluis lefl Io lake the ship back to Europe, the remaining missionaries returned to help them. Thus ended the first unhappy venlure of the Moravian Brethren In Canada. Twenty years later a more successful attempt was made to establish missions in Labrador. A group of eleven Brethren, three of them accompanied by their wives, arrived in Lab- 8 [pageend8]MORAVIAN BRETHERN rador after an exhausting two-months voyage across the Atlantic in a small sailing ship. Like their whole communion these pioneers represented many nationalities, but among them there was at least one, John Schneider, who was actually born in Moravia. Their lives in Labrador were unbelievably difficult.,When they were building their house it was necessary, as one of them said, to work with one hand and hold a weapon in the other, so much was the European distrusted by the Eskimos. This bad feeling, caused by the unscrupulousness and avarice of the early traders, was gradually overcome by the Moravians. By 1800 they had three stations in Labrador and had baptized 110 converts. Their missions continued to grow; their work among the barren rocks and reefs of Labrador will never be forgotten. Meanwhile the Moravian missions to the Delaware Indians in the United States were becoming part of the battlefield, first in the French and Indian War and then in the American Revolution. The missionaries pushed further inland into Ohio, until they were finally offered 25,000 acres on the Thames River in Ontario by the British Government. Here they brought the converted Delaware Indians in 1792, and here they founded a settlement which they called Fair- field. The settlement prospered; a village was built around the church and it seemed as if the troubles of the mission were over at last. But once more war threatened, and the Moravian missionaries and their flock found themselves once more squarely in the path of clashing armies. On October 5, 1813, the American and British forces met at Fairfield, and in the ensuing Battle of Moraviatown the village was destroyed. All of the devoted work of the pasttwenty years was gone in a couple of hours, while the missionaries and their Indians became homeless once again. The refugees wearily trekked across Ontario, finally camping near the shores of Lake Ontario for the duration of hostilities. After the close of the War of 1812, however, they returned to their old lands on the Thames. A new village was built across the river from the blackened ruins of the old. As ‘New Fairfield Church,, built 1848’ Courtesy Fairfield Museum the years passed, New Fairfield on the Thames flourished. The original log church built after the war was replaced by a handsome frame one, still in use. The mission was maintained by the Moravian Brethren until 1902, when it was taken over by the Methodist, now the United Church. Among the ice and rocks of Labrador, in the green valley of the Thames of Ontario, rest the remains of devoted Moravian Brethren, who came so far and who suffered so much to bring their faith to the native peoples of Canada.

The Czech troops, who had elected to fight on the side of the Allies, had fought their way right across Siberia, and had joined the allied expeditionary force against the Reds. When the Ixion arrived here there was only one woman aboard, Mrs. Maria Hasek, wife of a Czech major. Her adventures with the Czech army were given wide publicity and her picture appeared in the New York Times. Last week, exactly 38 years to the day, Mrs. Hasek arrived in Vancouver again at the end of a Pacific voyage, this time as a passenger in the Orient liner Orsova. In her purse was the faded copy of the New York Times with her picture as a charming young woman in her twenties. The intervening years have been full of adventure and tragedy. After she and her husband returned to Czechoslovakia he became a very successful businessman, with a large glass factory and world-wide export business. Hitler’s seizure of Czechoslovakia was the first blow. They were expelled from their property and Major Hasek imprisoned by the Gestapo. Madame Hasek joined the Czech underground movement, maintaining a supply and food depot for secret Allied agents. Then came the defeat of the Germans, and the fall of Czechoslovakia to Russian control, which was even worse. For a time the Haseks received their property back, but eventually the Communists took over everything, and they were nearly penniless again. Their daughter was sentenced to the salt mines for writing a letter criticizing the Russians, and they realized they had to escape. On a few hours' notice, ffie whole family, children and grandchildren, numbering 13 in all, set out on foot through the mountains and forests to the German border It was January, 1950, bitter cold and snowing, and for two days and three nights they wandered lost and without food. In her purse Mrs. Hasek had the old newspaper clipping. By good fortune they eventually found refuge in a farmhouse in the American sector of Germany, and were sent to a DP camp at Nuremburg. Their dream was to make a new home in Canada. When Mrs. Hasek showed the Canadian consul the faded clipping and old friends of Mackenzie King, passage told him that she and her husband were was soon expedited and they were able to get to Toronto. Now a proud Canadian citizen, Mrs. Hasek has just returned from a visit to her married daughter in Melbourne.

And Caravan. Then there are those brave new Voyageurs planning to cover the northern route of discoveries of long ago and the EXPO and dozens of other projects, large and small, carried out by cities, clubs, offices of government, citizen^. Among all these birthday greetings we stand somewhat bewildered, like a runner being urged to get up and take off and not knowing in what direction. Most of us, still on the threshold of belonging to Canada, will probably end up just drifting through the year, not really involved in any positive Centennial project, nevertheless feeling left out and even miserable for missing it all. In order to prevent this we should definitely try to find some way of participating, of contributing, of feeling at home in our home. Undoubtedly, the excitement which — let us hope — the Centennial will generate, should rub off some of its enthusiasm on us, even if we just stand by idly. This feeling we should nourish and develop into a positive reaction, into a commitment of our own, which might, if we truly realize its importance, grow and become our real contribution, our Centennial project. Our backgrounds are strong in us, no matter how much we want to reject them, consider them out-dated, even a hindrance in this new world of speed, abundance, practicality. And the traditions, which used to provide the foundations for our growing up back there in the turbulent times of Europe have not been shaken off by mere crossing of the ocean. Both could prove of greater value than we realize. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the heritage we have brought with us, with the golden rule that honesty is essential for the kind of life we want to live and that work is noble. And that a close, responsible family is the most effective barrier against insecurities and doubts today’s youth is suffering fro'm. On the contrary, there is greater need for application of these and similar so called “old-fashioned” rules than ever before. Just take a look around. How much positiveness can you see in arts, movies, books? In the way children play, think, plan for the future? How many of us feel more and more often that while we still look at life with joy, while we still gladly work to fulfill man’s basic need for “creating”, others are threatening the future with negation, cynicism, complete lack of purpose? This rich, great, wonderful, empty land of ours needs the calm, levelheaded positiveness more than anything else and if we pride ourselves on being in this category, than it needs us. And we must take part in its affairs, on any scale suited to our talents or abilities. We have to take on commitments in the neighborhood, civic life, clubs or churches, and above all we have to commit our children to an idea of advancing the positive approach to life in their schools, among their friends, learning their own responsibilities. We may call it our Centennial Project, if you wish, but let it definitely be a wav of life after the year turns over and Centennial with all its events, trains and caravans grinds to stop. A.V. YEARS FROM A COLONY TO A GREAT NATION By Frank Tresnak To read the history of what the Canada of today was one hundred years ago is an impressive reading. It is almost unbelievable how in just one hundred years, a few former British colonies, underpopulated, industrially underdeveloped, unconnected by any railway and by their character almost exclusively rural, comprising, however, the bigger part of the North American continent, became a united, fully independent, economically developed and internationally highly influential nation. It would almost be blasphemy to try to appraise the historical importance of the Quebec conference of October 1866 where the “Founding Fathers", the representatives of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario, drafted the agreement which, on July 1st 1867, changed their isolated territories into the Dominion of Canada and attracted the remaining colonies west and east to join it as Canadian provinces. It would be just as futile to try to describe the colossal industrial, financial, agricultural, cultural, and social development which followed and made Canada what it is today: a great and marvellous country. And this is what Canada is today. It is obvious to everybody who comes to her from any other part of the world, the United States of America not excepted. At the same time Canada is an absolutely free country where everybody is allowed to have his or her own political or religious opinion. This contrasts highly especially with those countries of Central and Eastern Europe which are still denied political and religious liberties, and are, of course, far behind Canada in their standard of living. Canada is, therefore, fully entitled to celebrate the centennial anniversary of the founding of the Confederation (changed to even closer ties of a later Federation). And it is understandable that she tries to use this most important anniversary to create memorials wich would show both the pride of, and the satisfaction with, what happened one hundred years ago and since then. There is little doubt that as a memorial to the history of Canada's independence, we are able to build hundreds of monumental buildings and to fill civic squares of every Canadian city with statues rightly or wrongly regarded as great modern art. However, it is a question whether this somewhat pompous behaviour is really in the spirit with which the Founding Fathers created Canada. First of all, we should not forget that we are still confronted with some of the 13 [pageend13]FROM A COLONY TO A GREAT NATION problems which the Founding Fathers tried to solve and solved for their time and ours, but not, however, for ever. The French Canadians who accepted Confederation one hundred years ago and made the creation of Canada possible, do not feel quite at home today. To save them for a united Canada is, therefore, our first centennial task. If they feel lost outside Quebec, because few people are able to talk to them in their own language, the problem may be solved the minute we realize that though French is taught in almost every Canadian school, it is not taught in the way a child learns its mother language. No mother teaches her child to talk by teaching it grammar. She talks to her child. We, in schools, do just the opposite. We teach French grammar and have no time to talk French. Is it any wonder then, that even the highschool students are unable to talk French? Forget the grammar and talk to the pupils and students in French and they will start to speak French too. If, however, the French Canadians have political grievances and want to go back from Federation to Confederation or even constitute themselves as an independent nation, let them go. They will still remain our allies, they will still remain Canadians, and one day they will come back to us "others’’. No force, in any case, is able to prevent a great people from reaching heir goals, however difficult or even irrational. Another problem which we have in common with the Founding Fathers is the much talked about fear that American investments are changing Canada into a satellite of the United States and that after losing our economic independence we will lose our political independence too. For a period of one hundred years the creation of the Dominion of Canada was able to prevent such a danger, if it really existed. Again, it is clear that no administrative steps are able to prevent closer and closer ties between Canada and the United States — if not for any other reason, then because the United States is always able to reciprocate much more forcibly. Nevertheless, nobody can forbid us to invest our money in our own industry instead of using it for some doubtful centennial projects. Creating new, really Canadian, secondary, goods- finishing industry is perhaps more necessary and much more useful. There is still another way to remember the anniversary of Confederation. It is social justice. We declare proudly that we have already introduced a guaranteed annual income for every Canadian. What we really did was introduce pensions fixed far below the dividing line between poverty and a decent standard of living. What is still more unsatisfactory is the question of how much these pensions which do not buy many grocertwenty years from now. We cannot stop prices from rising from year to year. They have gone up and up since the first goods were offered for sale and they will continue to do so as long as goods are being bought and sold, though they rose in every age sometimes for quite different reasons. The wages and salaries may go up too. Unfortunately, they seldom go up without corresponding strikes which are not very rational and not available to every group of employees. Among those who cannot strike and can only die, are the pensioners. And if they try to provide for the future by lifelong savings, we return them their money when they need it in a debased currency. However, let us forget for a minute the old people and let us think of the younger ones. Are not strikes rather a too costly way, both for the employee and the employers, of adjusting wages to higher prices? And, of course, savings are never adjusted at all. Is there no other method to keep 'real' wages, i.e. their value expressed in what KANADA, NÁŠ DOMOV Země od moře k moři. Země nedohledných prérií, přeměněných v pšeničné farmy.

Francouzským námořníkem Jacques Cartierem, který roku 1534 vplul do zátoky sv. Vavřince a nazval území “Novou Francií” ? Skutečná kolonisace Kanady nastala po příchodu Samuela de Chaplaina, který roku 1608 založil obec Quebec.

Po tomto vítězství byla Kanada rozdělena na pět adminis- trativných celků, spravovaných z Londýna. Kanada jak ji dnes známe, se zrodila v r. 1867 zákonem britského parlamentu (British North America.

Why wait until srikes make the situation still worse for those who cannot strike and do not srike?

FRASTACKY In 1881 The Canadian Pacific Railway Company launched bonds in London to secure funds for the extension of its railway net in Canada. On September 1, 1881, the editor of the long forgotten publication, "London Truth”, commented on the prospectus and we quote some of his remarks. “A group of Montreal and New York bankers have undertaken to float ten million dollars worth of the Company's land grant bonds, and the Bank of Montreal, with its usual courage, has taken one-fourth of the entire loan. This announcement looks as if the Canadians were going to raise the necessary capital on the other side of the water, but I have a shrewd suspicion that they have no real intention of doing anything of the kind. The New Yorkers are keen enough gamblers, and reckless enough iat times, I admit, and yet it is impossible to believe that they are such fools as to put their money into this mad project. I would as (soon credit them with a willingness to subscribe hard cash in support of a scheme for the 'utilization of icebergs. The Canadian Pacific Railway will run, if it is ever finished, through a country frost bound for seven or eight months in the year and will connect with the Western part of the Dominion a Province which embraces about as 'forbidding a country as any on the face of the earth. British Columbia, they say, have forced on the execution of the part of the contract under (which they became incorporated with the Dominion, and believe that prosperity will come to them when the line is made. This is a delusion on their part. British Columbia is (a barren, cold, mountain country, that is not worth keeping. It would never have been inhabited at all, unless by trappers of the Hudsons Bay Company, had the “gold fever” not taken a party of mining adventurers there, and ever since that fever died down the place has been going from bad to worse. Fifty railroads would not galvanize it into prosperity. This “Dominion” is, in short, a “fraud” all through and is destined to burst up like any other fraud.” It was a fraud indeed . . , As Canada celebrates her hundredth birthday, Canadians are optimistic about the economic outlook even though the vigour of North American business expansion has somewhat abated in recent months. The country is prosperous and the underlying strength in the economy suggests that the upward momentum will continue for some time even if the growth rates are slower. But the real basis ifor optimism lies in the long run: in the fact that Canada is still very much the youth whose potentials far exceed anything already accomplished. Indeed, it could be hardly otherwise. Here is the second largest country in the world, more than forty times the size of Britain, inhabited by 20 million people —fewer than the combined populations of Belgium and The Netherlands. The small population base has been a major historical factor limiting the full exploitation of Canada’s immense natural wealth and the potential rate of industrial growth. Over the past 30 years or so, the development of the country has accelerated thanks to dramatic changes in the technology and structure of the economy and an almost doubling of the population. Just as the first big wave of immigration and the introduction of 'new agricultural techniques coincided and brought prosperity in the early 1900’s, the postWorld War II immigration and the “technological revolution" have laid the foundation for Canada’s second century. The postwar immigration had a significant impact on the quality as well as the quantity of the country’s labour force. The newcomers brought with them much- needed skills and professional training. They became productive members of the community practically within days after their arrival. With roughly 20 per cent of the total labour force now consisting of people born outside Canada, the proportion is much higher among professional groups. For example, 43 per cent of all architects, 33 per cent of all engineers and natural scientists, and 25 per cent of all medical doctors, university professors and statisticians in Canada today are immigrants. R. V. Frastacky is president of the Metropolitan Trust Company in Toronto. The majority of newcomers found or created for themselves jobs in cities and thus intensified the already rapid urbanization of the country. The Canadian population is now heavily concentrated in such metropolitan communities as Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver and other centres across the nation. Almost half of the population lives in Canada’s 17 metropolitan areas and a further 20 per cent in smaller urban centres. The farm population is steadily declining in absolute numbers and proportionally; it now accounts for less than 12 per cent of the total. The process of urbanization and the changing composition of the labour force have been both a response and a contributing factor to major shifts in the character of the economy. Although the primary industries (agriculture, mining, forestry and fishing) continue to be the backbone of Canada and their produce represents the main source of export earnings, the growth of secondary manufacturing and service industries is the truly dynamic force in the country. Since the end of the war, employment in service producing industries more than doubled and in secondary manufacturing increased by about 50 per cent. On the other hand, the production of primary goods now occupies only half as many people as 20 years ago. Technological changes explain this development. All of Canada's primary industries have become increasingly mechanized, employing a high ratio of capital equipment relative to labour. Improvements in productivity have made it possible to increase the volume of output and at the same time release workers for other employment. Still, reflecting faster growh rates in other sectors, the dollar value of primary production has declined relative to the total production of the economy. Primary industries now account for just over 10 per cent of Canada’s gross domestic product compared with 19 per cent in 1946. Mining taken by itself, however, increased its share over the period. The output of the manufacturing sector tripled in the 20 years since the war with production of durable goods rising somewhat faster than non-durable manufactured commodities. The increase in recent years has been particularly impressive in research and development oriented fields, such as in the manufacturing of modern transportation equipment and electrical apparatus and appliances. Among service industries, whose output now represents more than 6'0 per cent of the gross domestic product, the government sector expanded considerably during the period under review. Trading and financial concerns also increased their respective share and miscellaneous personal and business services have become a major factor, equal in the importance of their contribution to the gross domestic product to primary industries. Against this general background, the dynamic character of the Canadian economy is brought into even sharper focus by the current business expansion which got under way in early 1961. At the beginning of the period, the economy was operating considerably below capacity levels and more than seven per cent of the labour force were unemployed. The unemployment rate halved in less than six years despite a substan- 15 [pageend15]COMPLIMENTS OF KENROC TOOLS LIMITED V. STEPANEK President and Managing Director 6-8 RIPLEY AVE., TORONTO 3, ONT. CANADA TELEPHONE: 7 6 3-5 6 1 6 TELEX: 0 2-2 9 8 2 5 CABLE: KENROC [pageend16]tial growth of the work force. The rapidly expanding economy created well over a million new jobs — more than in the 30 years prior to 1946. The growth of the real output in recent years has put Canada in the front ranks among highly industrialized nations. In fact, only Japan has experienced a faster increase in the volume of goods and services produced. Accompanying the rise in output, Canada’s productive capacity has also expanded at a remarkably fast rate. Between 1963 and 1966 alone, investment spending was up by more than 60 per cent. Business fixed capital formation last year amounted to about $12 billion, representing more than 20 per cent of Canada’s Gross National Product The exceptionally rapid growth of the economy during the 1960 has generated new records in every sector. But it has also given rise to some imbalance in the system and Canadians are now faced with the problems of maintaining, rather than creating, prosperity. During the past year, Canada's national output rose by close to seven per cent in real terms. At the same time, however, the general level of prices increased by roughly four per cent — more than in any year since the early 1950s. The higher price increase was clearly associated with growing demand pressures on the country’s productive resources and capacity. The build-up of inflationary forces was further strengthened by international food shortages — in some cases of evidently temporary nature — which exerted a sharp upward threat on Canadian consumer prices. While the rate of increase in Canadian prices still compares favourably with the experience of most industrialized countries overseas, it is of particular significance to Canada that price and cost developments in the United States have been more moderate. Since much of Canada’s prosperity depends on exports and the U.S. is by far the largest customer, a relative deterioration of Canada's international competitive position could have an adverse impact on the country's future growth. By 1965-66 all of the slack in the Canadian economy had been taken up and in a number of areas demand became excessive in relation to supply capabilities. Production bottlenecks and shortages of skilled labour and industrial raw materials had developed in these sectors. Employment and incomes continued to increase during the past year but the economy’s performance in terms of output per employed person was disappointing. Lagging productivity in conjunction with an accelerated rise in labour and other production costs has greatly contributed to the upward pressure on prices. For businessmen, 1966 brought indications of a squeeze on profit margins. While sales were booming and total profits were still up in most industries, competitive resistance to price increases and government pressure to hold the line forced business firms to absorb much of the higher costs of production. The profit squeeze became particularly evident in the second half of the year under the impact of widespread strikes and disruptions in the transportation and basic supplies industries. Tight credit conditions, and interest rates at a 40-year high, contributed to business problems, as has the generally restraining fiscal policy adopted by the federal government last year to combat the inflationary situation. One sector particularly adversely affected by recent developments was residential construction. Housing starts in 1966 dropped well below the all-time high of 167,000 dwelling units started in the previous year. A very tight mortgage market with high rates and limited availability of funds has been the major cause of this cutback. Another factor was the shortage of serviced land in metropolitan centres. On the international side, Canada's deficit in the curent account of the balance of paymentse was about $1 billion last year. The trade deficit with the Uniled Slales alone approximaled $2 billion, but this was partially offset by surpluses accruing to Canada from trade with other countries. This was in conformity with Canada's traditional pattern of foreign transactions and, as in previous years, the difference to finance the current account deficit was met from capital inflows, largely from the United States. At the eve of Canada’s second century, the task of living with prosperity is indeed a formidable challenge. The basic question is how to achieve reasonable price stability and an internationally competitive cost structure while at the same time sustaining full employment and maximum use of other productive resources. At the present time, the overall view of the economy is affected by uncertainty from three major sources. First and foremost is the impact of the Viet Nam war on the U.S. economy and the policies pursued by the government of that country. Developments in Canada tend to follow closely the pattern set by the United States and the future course of economic growth in the two countries is not likely to differ much. The second source of uncertainty pertains to the profit squeeze. Clearly, both the incentive and the ability to expand productive capacity bear a close relationship to the expectation of profits. Given the wage-price squeeze in which many Canadian industries have found themselves, the outlook is largely dependent on improvements in productivity and less restrictive domestic policies. In this context, some encouragement is already provided by a decline in interest rates and a general easing of monetary conditions during the early weks of 1967. The third problem area is the extent and direction of new capital spending. Potential demand for goods and services is at a very high level from domestic as well as foreign sources. Short of measures to depress demand — an unlikely development as they would also create substantial unemployment—the inflationary pressures in the system can be diminished only by further additions to capacity. Here the immediate question is whether sufficient funds will be forthcoming in such relatively starved sectors as housing, and in those industries where productivity gains are contingent upon new machinery and equipment. These are the major challenges for the Canadian economy in the short-run. But, as the attached brief surveys of some key industries indicate, the current prosperity is sound and broadly based; meeting the challenge is well within the country’s capability. Agriculture The development of large export markets for Canadian wheat in the U.S.S.R., mainland China and Eastern Europe points to continued prosperity on the farm. Contracts for 500 million bushels with delivery over the 1967-69 period have already been signed. A bumper wheat harvest of 840 million bushels in 1966 enabled Canada to meet export and domestic requirements and carry a stock of 600 million bushels into the new year. Statistics of the 1961 Census of Agriculture Number of farms: 480,903 Total farm area: 173 million acres Employment in agriculture: 648,966 Farms with electric power: 409,882 Tractors: 549,789 Grain combines: 155,611 Automobiles and trucks: 659,963 Value of land and buildings: 8.7 billion dollars Value of machinery and equipment: 2.6 billion dollars Farm cash income (1965): 3.8 billion dollars Mining Mineral production, worth close to $4 billion last year compared with $500 million in 1946, is strongly export oriented. Canada leads the non-Communist world in the production of nickel, zinc, asbestos, platinum metals and columbium; it is second in gold, uranium, cobalt, cadmium and titanium; and it is third in sulphur, gypsum, magnesium and lead. With known reserves equivalent to up to 50 years of supply at current operating rates, several new discoveries have been reported in recent years and exploration activity continues. Canada’s oil industry, practically non-existent only tv/enty years ago, is now the fastest growing among all major oil producing countries in the Western Hemisphere. Production of crude oil (including natural gas liquids) averages 17 [pageend17]Compliments of THE METROPOLITAN TRUST COMPANY 353 BAY STREET, TORONTO Phone 362-4761 HIGHEST INTEREST RATE ON YOUR CHEQUING ACCOUNT and TERM DEPOSITS GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CERTIFICATES [pageend18]around a milion barrels per day — a barrel equals 35 Canadian gallons — and the country's crude oil reserves are over 7 bilion barrels to which now may be added the recoverable 27 billion barrels of upgraded crude oil from Alberta's oil sands along the Athabasca River. Supplies from this source will enter commercial channels for the first time late this year. Natural gas production in 1965 was about 1,500,0'00 million cubic feet and known reserves amounted to 43,400,000 million cubic feet. Natural gas accounts for roughly 17 per cent of Canada's total energy requirements compared with about 2-3 per cent in Western Europe.

G. CORN, C.A. While the country, today known as Czechoslovakia, has been providing a good livelihood for millions of people for more than a thousand years, while natural resources of the same country have been contributing substantially to maintain and increase the standard of living for all of these generations, Canada with its natural resources was for all practical purposes, untouched until the beginning of this century. The economy of the country is dependent upon three major factors — natural dard of living in any country of the world is influenced and usually dependent upon proper development and use of at least one of these factors. Politics can either help develop these factors into a workable unity, which naturally results in a high standard of living in that country, or can disrupt this basic economic principle by eliminating any of these factors or retarding their development by dictating the behaviour of such factors. This naturally results in a decrease in the standard of living of the people in that country. Canada, a democratic country, which developed and maintained a long-run equilibrium of all these factors, is fortunate. The standard of living of its people is one of the highest in he world. On the other hand, the people of Czechoslovakia through the centuries have experienced the oppression of foreign dominations which have always resulted in economic instability and temporary decrease in the standard of living of its people. Czechoslovakia today is again J. O. Corn is a Toronto chartered accountant encountering such oppression through Communist dictatorship. Natural Resources Canada is now in the midst of an industrial revolution which Czechoslovakia experienced during the latter part of the 19h century. Since World War II, Canada has been changing its attitude towards the use of its natural resources. Its secondary industry is growing and its production is changing from mere production of quantity to production of goods of high quality. The industry is getting governmental support and is growing rapidly. I believe it should be temporarily protected and that Canada will develop into a country exporting finished goods, products and machinery to many countries of the world. Labour Labour supply was and still is a problem for Canadian economy. The immigration policy was changed from time to time to fit the programme of development of the country or parts thereof for certain industry. Skilled labour was always scarce and the same situation prevails today. Many of the European countries contributed to the Canadian labour market. Some only as to number, others as to skill. The Czechoslovak people helped to build Canadian economy, less in numbers than in skill. Historically this happened in three different waves. The first was shortly before and after World War I and was represented by a mixture of skilled and unskilled labourers and farmers. The second was shortly before 19 [pageend19]COMPLIMENTS OF ALEX A.

The influx of the third wave, which occurred after World War II and lasted for less than a decade, brought to Canada professional people such as lawyers, economists, doctors, engineers, technicians and highly skilled political refugees who preferred to live in a democratic country rather than Communist Czechoslovakia. This wave was not large in numbers but was high in acumen. Today we are experiencing a new influx of people from Czechoslovakia, people of all trades who were allowed by relieved political restrictions to visit other countries where political asylum was granted. The contribution of Czechoslovak immigrants to the Canadian economy, particularly in the past thirty years, can be considered quite high and we Canadians of Czech and Slovak origin are proud to have been able to participate in the economic growth and prosperity of the country of our choice — Canada. Capital The growth of the Canadian economy following the depression was made possible by attracting the inflow of foreign capital to Canada. There have been extensive discussions as to whether foreign capital has fulfilled its role and has been beneficial to the Canadian economy. There have also been discussions whether Canada still requires foreign capital or not. It is my view that Canada does and for some time will require foreign capital if she wants to maintain her present growth and high standard of living. I feel that we cannot afford to slow down the development of our country merely by immature chauvinistic and patriotic reasoning. Closing I believe in the systematic development of Canadian natural resources by skilled Canadian' manpower, which may be made possible only by adopting an effective educational programme in harmonious co-operation with pro-Canadian oriented capital under the leadership of a democratic system and government of Canada. We believe in Canada, Country of the Future. CANADA IN SPORTS OFFICE PHONE 267-Ó880 RESIDENTIAL - COMMERCIAL LAND - MORTGAGES 19 FAIRCROFT BLVD. SCARBORO, ONT. As well as other facets of Canadian history, sports represent an important part of its eventful past. The proof of this, for instance, is the winning of two gold medals in track and field in Amsterdam during the Olympics there in 1928 by Percy Williams over 100 and 200 metres. In 1936, Canada won several medals in canoeing and Edward's excellent effort in track and field in middle distances is preserved in Olympic film. Following World War II, Canadians proved their ability in winter sports. Names of ice-skaters like Barbara Ann Scott, Dafoe Bowden, Jackson, Maria and Otto Jelinek, and recently skier Nancy Greene, achieved world wide acclaim. In Tokyo, at the Summer Olympics, the emphasis shifted to track and field, as witnessed by Crothers' winning of the silver medal in the 800 metres run and Jerome’s bronze medal in the 100 metre sprint. He is still a co-holder of world record for this distance (10 seconds). However, the sport that has the longest tradition and is most popular for Canadians is ice-hockey. The best is played in the professional National League and it is watched by thousands and thousands of wildly enthusiastic spectators throughout the entire season. Some of these stars — like Mahovlich, Mikita, Hull or Beliveau are becoming idols of fascinated youth, who try to follow in their footsteps by playing hockey from early childhood. The best ones are, however, later “drafted” into professional teams, so that the world amateur championship has for the last five years eluded Canada. And Russia became the title holder. Also, Czechs are proving to be still stronger opponents and gone are the times, when Canadians would be winning by large scores as for instance in 1924 when Canada won the first world tournament by a 22-0 over Sweden, 30-0 with Czechoslovakia and 33-0 with Switzerland! It is interesting to note that Canadians were the best teachers of ice- hockey in Czechoslovakia. The world trophy was won under the coaching of a Canadian of Slovak origin ■— Mike Buena. Some Czechoslovakian immigrants— following the coup d’etat in 1948 — performed so well in Canada that their success has added to the laurels of Canadian sport. Examples of this are Hana Sladek, champion in lawn tennis, Max Marinko in table tennis, Jana Paehl in figure skating and the most brilliant pair of them all — Maria and Otto Jelinek, who captured the world skating title in their native Prague in 1962. 21 [pageend21]Compliment to OTTO PICK & SONS SEED LTD.

I. COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY THE WORK AND STRUGGLE FOR HOME (THE STORY OF BATA IN CANADA) By Anthony Cekota That small group of Czechoslovaks who landed in Quebec City during the summer of 1939 looked different from the usual groups of immigrants to Canada. Instead of “the sturdy peasants with sheepskins on their backs”, who were preferred as immigrants since the turn of the century, these people were indistinguishable from Canadians in Quebec City, Ottawa, Toronto, or from that region of Ontario between Trenton and Belleville where they wree heading. Actually, these Batamen, coming from Zlin, Czechoslovakia to plant a new industry on Canadian soil represented the first ripple in the wave of major change in Canadian immigration policy. They were no peasants or common labourers. Questions such as, “Can you milk a cow” on Canadian census forms, astonished them. They were specialists , or highly skilled workers who, under normal conditions would never have dreamed of leaving their country and their place of employment, both of which were considered to be the best in the world. However, the situation in Central Europe, nay in all Europe during that spring and summer were not normal. And it was the abnor- malcy of the situation which contributed toward the change in Canadian immigration policy and the change in the industrial policy of the Bata Shoe Company in Zlin, Czechoslovakia, which brought these small groups of people here. Czechoslovakia, their former home, a small country with great industry and a highly developed democratic society, was lying down, dismembered at Munich in 1938 and occupied by Hitler's armies in the spring of 1939. By some quirk of the Nazi mind, no objections were raised to the Bata Shoe Company's request to open new businesses in several countries and to transplant into those countries both men and machines from Zlin. It may be that the Nazis were so sure of their control that they were willing to permit the Czech pioneering groups to do the Anthony Cekota is a consultant to Bata Limited spade work of starting and development, only to be pushed aside later by the MASTER Race after the war. For they were preparing for war, although, in their contempt for France and the United Kingdom after Munich, they never expected it to come so soon. The top management of the Bata Shoe Company had no confidence in Hitler's declaration that the occupation of Czechoslovakia was his last step in expansion of the Reich and that his next move would be taken in peace. Actually such suspicion had existed in their minds for many years (more than a decade). The major change (from centralized organization of Bata business to decentralization and world-wide dispersion) started in about 1928; Munich, and the occupation of the country in the spring of 1939, only accelerated the process, which had been in progress for many years; another reason that the Nazis did not suspect anything unusual was because those brave men in Czechoslovak government who, at that time, were still left with some authority in the administration of the country, degraded by the status of “Protectorate”, did not object to such policy either. Thus, at that time of September 1939, the last of such small groups of Bata men, disembarking from the “Athenia", knew that others were already waiting for them in the small village (population 860) of Frankford, Ontario, uncrating the shoe machinery brought to the country by another boat. They were aware that the next cargo boat, the "Koenigs- berg" was loading more than 800 crates containing machine tools and precision instruments in Hamburg, Germany, and would call at Montreal before the end of the month. It called there all right, only to slip out of the harbour the night after arrival, lights extinguished and without tugboats, heading down the St. Lawrence for the sea. There was still no war, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who stopped the ship at a point beyond Quebec City on Bata's request, and persuaded the captain to unload his cargo, scored another success in its long history of persuasive diplomacy. The boat returned to Montreal, unloaded Bata machinery, arid left hurriedly, its captain apparently aware of the oncoming war. It never made it back to Hamburg, having been sunk somewhere in the Atlantic a few days after the “Athenia” was sunk by a German submarine. Building a New Industry and a New Community The marks of the Great Depression were very visible everywhere in the rural areas of South Hastings County in Ontario when the small groups of Czechoslovak Batamen moved in, and probably nowhere were the signs as visible as in the village of Frankford. The huge paper mill of that formerly fine and lively place was closed down several years previously. A great number of its active population moved out, and the rest was slowly sinking into the inertia of a country place, where farming is poor, and those magnificent woods of the former Champlain trail had gone never to return. Much needs to be said, however, about the fine human qualities of its population of 860, which revealed themselves in the way in which these people welcomed about 180 newcomers, men, women and children in their homes, and how quickly they learned the new skills which these newcomers started to teach them. Without the fine human qualities and desire for mutual understanding on both sides, it would have been impossible to accomplish the transplanting of the new industry and the development of a new community so quickly in spite of difficulties, which at the time appeared insurmountable. World War II broke out, and with it, all communication and all assistance by the original Bata concern in Czechoslovakia was cut off. The separation was permanent. All contact ceased, never to be renewed again. Although short in financial capital and many other things, the new Bata Shoe Company of Canada was rich in the most vital sectors of any industry, in the knowledge and skill of its people, and specifically in the vitality of their enthusiasm and loyalty toward their young leader, Thomas J. Bata. In this loyalty there was something more than the respect for the son of the founder, whose genius had created the largest shoe concern in the world. This young 23 [pageend23]CZECHOSLOVAK (TORONTO) CREDIT UNION LTD.

(Very few of them spoke English, and still fewer of them knew anything about the new country.) With the exception of the first settlers who came to Canada centuries ago under political patronage, there are few examples, if any, of a small group of people who built up in a very short time, not only a new industry but a new community. This community of Batawa, developed during the critical years of World War II, was more than a village of about 190 houses and a population of about 800 people. Very soon it had two churches, two schools, and dozens of civic, cultural and sporting clubs. Without any help from outside, the people organized their own language schools and library, as well as numerous other ways of self-help. Their impact upon the surrounding area was as marked as their contribution toward the success of the Canadian war effort. Both were acknowledged by the Hon. T. A. Crerar, then Minister of Mines and Resources, speaking for the Canadian government in Batawa on July 5th, 1942. The occasion was “The United Nations Day' organized by the Batawa Czechoslovak Sokol Gymnastic Association and attended by about 5,000 people. Observing the new community, listening to the machinery humming in a huge factory and feeling the vitality of the place as he faced the crowds, he expressed the emerging Canadian immigration policy more clearly than ever. “There is Biblical warrant for the belief that bread cast upon the waters shall not return unto us void,” he said, and continued: “Here, before us, as in other parts of Canada where other new industries have grown up under the hands of new citizens, who came here to escape brutality and tyranny, we have evidence of their desire to add to the economic and social fabric of Canadian life.” As the years rolled on, such evidence has mounted, although it may not be as concentrated, visible and dramatic as the first years of Batamen in Canada. For as their knowledge of the country and its opportunities increased with the years, some of them left Batawa and started their own indusries elsewhere. Some of them established several new shoe companies in Ontario; others started small machinery factories; opened various other kinds of small trade enterprises, or even turned to farming. However, the most interesting reflection of their attitude toward life in a new country was their relationship with their children. Considering their number, there is perhaps no community in Canada of similar size which has had so many university graduates who are now active in the Mr. and Mrs. T Bata professions, be it medical, engineering, commerce, art or social work. A further interesting phenomenon here is that Batawa has not, and never has had, any communal police force and any crime since its foundation in 1940. Today, the Bata Shoe Company of Canada is manufacturing leather, rubber and plastic shoes, in its main plant in Batawa and two branch plants in other communities (Picton and Campbellford), while its Engineering Division produces a great variety of engineering products, besides specific types of shoe machinery of its own design. The Bata Shoe retailing organization is serving its Canadian customers from coast to coast, selling Bata- made brands as well as a good selection of shoes made by other Canadian shoe manufacturers. The Bata business in Canada provides regular employment to about 2,500 people in various parts of the country. This however, is not all that the country gained in return for its hospitality. Thomas Bala, remembering its friendly attitude in the past, and considering the international respect enjoyed by Canada everywhere, established in Toronto several years ago the Bota International Service Centre” to serve 87 independent Bata companies in 84 countries of the free world. Thus, Canada besides being “home” to him and his family, became the centre of the world-wide industrial service of a unique industrial organization employing over 71,000 people of every colour, religion and race, and dispersed on all continents. This "Bata Shoe Organization” (BSO), created by Thomas Bata out of the crises and disasters in which the original Bata enterprise was lost, first to the Nazis and later to the Communists, is as unique in its structure as “The United Nations”. All Bata companies in every country are independent business corporations, managing their own businesses under their own Boards of Directors and their own operational managers, continuously making their own decisions. However, all of them draw upon the services of one non-business company, Bata Limited, at Bata International Centre, Don Mills (Toronto). These services consist of advice on manufacturing, maiketing, administration, personnel and research covering practically every phase of the shoe industry: financing, product development, manufacturing technology, material testing, statistics, promotions, factory and store designs, industrial relations and personnel development. Considering the latter, Bata Limited is perhaps the largest industrial management development centre in the country, planning and organizing, each year, a great variety of specialized courses for Bata companies in many parts of the world, and serving as a kind of broker, consultant, and even supplier of managerial personnel to Bata companies who need it and when they need it. This service has opened highly interesting opportunit es to well educated and competent young Canadians who want to see the world while building their own careers with B.ita. Some of them who have managed to work their way to the top (or close to it) of Bata business overseas have already made good us of this opportunity. The Future With the security of a new home built in Canada, Bata International Centre is planning to help the indepen dent Bata companies to expand their business on an average by 10 per cent yearly, which mean: that in early 1970, they will turn out about 300,000,000 pairs of shoes. Because the greatest bulk of this pairage is made and sold in developing countries by their own nation als, this Canadian Bata service is continuously providing specific “foreign aid" to these countries and their people, which does not cost the Canadian government anything, but which contributes toward the goodwill and international respect enjoyed by Canada among the family of nations. Hon. T. A. Crerar's observation that "bread cast upon the waters shall not return unto us void” was correct. Cast upon a small piece of the Ontario countryside along the banks of the Trent River, it is now being recast to many people of far-away lands, helping them to develop their own industrial home, and helping Canada to improve its own in the ever-widening process. 25 [pageend25]Compliment to Centennial Canad t r a d e MARX JELINEK SPORTS LTD TABLE TENNIS BADMINTON TENNIS HOCKEY GAMES BASEBALL GOLF TELEPHONE VAIloy 7 112 1 [pageend26]Frantisek J.

(n 1942 Leon Koerner bought a collection of artificial mushrooms made by a Czechoslovak artist and gave it to the Department of Biology and Botany of the University of British Columbia. Soon, further donations from Leon and Walter Koerner followed. First, assistance to students. Then, in 1955 the "Leon and Thea Koerner Foundation" was founded with a gift of one million dollars, subsequently increased by additional gifts from Mrs. Koerner's estate. During the first ten years of this Foundation, grants totalling some $750,- 000 were made to support various projects in the arts, sicience, education etc. In 1959 Leon Koerner donated to the University of British Columbia the Faculty Club Building, a cultural and social centre for the University staff. Many oustanding visitors stayed at the Faculty Club, including Queen Elizabeth. In 1961 Leon Koerner donated another building to the University, the Thea Koerner House, named after his wife, which serves as the Graduate 29 [pageend29]Sir dolu SWexander 'MacJonatJ FIRST PRIME MINISTER OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA Presented with sincere compliments for a Happy Centennial Year ond Glorious Future to our Land and all its peoples JAN AND JARMILA MATEJOVIC DRUMMOND METAL PRODUCTS LTD., COOKSVILLE, ONTARIO WALLACEBURG ALUMINUM EXTRUSIONS, WALLACEBURG, ONTARIO MANUFACTURERS AND WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTORS OF EXTRUDED ALUMINUM.

Of Leon Koerner's other contributions to the University we should mention at least the Frederic Wood Theatre and a substatial contribution towards establishment of the departement of opthalmo- logy, one of the finest on this continent. In 1959 the University of British Columbia conferred on him the honourary degree of Doctor of Laws and soon after he was named the “Man of the year” by the newpapermen in British Columbia. Walter Koerner’s interests lie in a somewhat different direction. Soon after coming to Canada he began supporting Slavonic studies at the University of British Columbia. Thanks to his gifts, students in the Department of Slavonic studies are well provided wilh scholui- ships, both on the undergraduate and graduate level. Walter Koerner was equally generous in his donations to the university libraries. He provided not only part of the library building, but also considerable sums of money for books. Equally important was his contribution toward establishment of clinics at the university hospital. Walter Koerner is still the president of Alaska Pine Company. He is also a member of the Board of Governors of the University of British Columbia and a member of the ’ Economic Council of Canada. He has received an honourary degree of Doctor of Laws from the University of Victoria and the University of New Brunswick. Recently, he received from the University of British Columbia a Scroll of Honour of academic distinction in recognition of his contribution to scholarly research in the studies of Central Europe.

The interview had already gone on for more than an hour, and the reporter now elected to be humorous. "Would you then, Mr. Velan, advise the young man starting out in business to go and make a success in the export market before trying to succeed in Canada?" The executive across from him, distinguished looking, trimly and expensively tailored so that his physical vigor was accentuated rather than covered up, chose not to treat the matter humorously at all. In the Czech accent that adds color to everithing he utters in English, he studiously replied. "I would say if he is starting out right from the beginning, and doesn't have any reputation, yes; his way will be easier." Certainly that was true in the case of the executive himself, A. Karel Velan: “Four years ago our sales in the United States were several millions of dollars; but it has taken us until the last year or two to begin getting good sales expansion here in Canada." In his office-boardroom above his humming plant in Ville St. Laurent — a suburb attached to the northwest of Montreal — surrounded by paintings of industrial scenes, amid constant interruptions by phone calls from all over Canada and the U.S. and from senior members of his staff who pop in while succeeding in solving problems or uncovering new ones, he runs North America's most successful high pressure forged valves and controls manufacturing firm, located at 2125 Ward Avenue, Montreal 9, Quebec. Velan's belated domestic success comes after he has put together a com- pany that sells its products all over the free world (“I will not sell to Communist countries," he has said), a wholly- owned subsidiary in the U.S. and a 70 per cent owned subsidiary in Britain. The whole complex does about $10,000,000 worth of business a year. The man who did it all is a picture of thoroughgoing independence. He was born in Ostrava, Czechoslovakia, on February 8, 1918, and got his Master of Mechanical Enginering degree in 1939 from the University of Brno, Czechoslovakia. He then went to work for Československa Zbrojovka (the Bren gun factory1) in Brno as a product design engineer. He later joined Vikor as a tooling design engineer, and rose to the post of chief planning manager. 35 [pageend35]CZECHOSLOVAK SOCIETY OF ARTS AND SCIENCES IN AMERICA INVITES YOU TO VISIT A DISPLAY OF CZECH AND SLOVAK BOOKS AND ENGLISH BOOKS ABOUT CZECHOSLOVAKIA, DURING EXPO, AT McGILL UNIVERSITY, MONTREAL QUEBEC SPOLEČNOST PRO VÉDY A UMĚNÍ SRDEČNÉ ZVE NA VÝSTAVU ČESKÝCH A SLOVENSKÝCH KNIH A ANGLICKÝCH KNIH O ČESKOSLOVENSKU NA McGILL UNIVERSITĚ V MONTREALU BĚHEM “EXPO 67” [pageend36]CZECHOSLOVAK MUSIC BOHUSLAV MARTINU (1890-1954) Bohuslav Martinu is the composer who in recent years has been the most outstanding exemplification of Czechoslovakian music abroad. He is undoubtedly the most admired contemporary Czech composer today. His beginnings in music were dubious. Despite his passionate interest in music, Martinu failed at the conservatory, and his instructors despaired at being able to teach him nothing. Nevertheless, within the next few decades, he was to attain uncontested world recognition. When he eventually finished at the Prague Conservatory, Martinu was taken on as a violinist with the Czechoslovakian Philharmonic Orchestra, where he remained for ten years. During this period he began to compose. He wrote several orchestral works, including the ballet ls- tar, which was produced successfully in Prague in 1922. In 1923, Martinu left Czechoslovakia forever, emigrating to Paris, where he soon felt the influence of Stravinsky and the Group of Six. It was a period of experimentation, as he tried his hand at the current trends in music: constructivism, neo-classicism and jazz. He even composed a surrealisic opera, Juliette, which contained a libretto written by the surrealist poet, Georges Neveaux. It was in Paris that he first began to write operas, his initial effort being The Soldier and the Dancer, but his most outstanding operatic work of this period was The Miracle of Our Lady. During the Second World War, Martinu took up residence in the United States and became an American citizen. In the United States, where he wrote on commission, he proved even more productive, composing numerous works which have been performed by the world's leading orchestras and musicians. He wrote six symphonies, various concertos and many chamber music and piano compositions, all of which have been widely performed throughout the United States. In his music, Czechoslovakian influences with Czech and Moravian-folk- song inspired melodies are combined with French precision, refinement and restraint, resulting in music that is economical, graceful and objective as well as melodious and lyrical. In the last years of his life, Martinu retired to Europe, and died in Switzerland in 1954. His name, however, lives on as the popularity of his music continues to grow, both in North America and abroad. Bohuslav Martinu is undoubtedly the most successful Czechoslovakian composer in our time; it is he who carries on the tradition of Czechoslovakian music, that irresistible force within the Czech soul, that began over one and a half centuries ago with Bedrich Smetana. After the war, at the age of 27, he formed two engineering companies of his own because the opportunities in newly freed Europe were tremendous. He formed them without capital, since his needs for capital weren't great - his assets were his mechanical engineering capability, probing curiosity, and restless drive. He never since worked for another man. “I always had wanted to be on my own,” he says. The companies quickly became successful, and by 1947 he was already in the U.S. trying to drum up business. After the Communist takeover in 1948, he received in the mail one of the routine advice notes from the authorities that simply stated that his companies had been naionalized and his bank account blocked. Shortly after that, he escaped over the border with his three-year-old son. His wife waited behind with their 18- month-old boy, since she had made up her mind not to leave unless Karel made it successfully. Then, with the boy, she followed him out of the country, using her Norwegian passport. He makes it clear that it wasn’t nationalization of his two companies that made him leave: ‘‘There are two big things about a loss of freedom. Because you can’t change your job if you want to stay with your wife and family, this makes you right away a softer person, vulnerable, you will be a good boy. Second, for opportunistic reasons some of your best friends join the party right away. Suddenly they don't want Io talk about it any more. So how long do you continue to see such a person? And he is just as unhappy about the conflict as you. All over, there is this great feeling of unhappiness in people. You feel it." He couldn't live like that, so he fled. In 1950, a year after reaching Canada, he set up Velan Engineering Ltd., again without capital. He was developing and patenting some new steam traps, used in all plants making and using steam, that remove condensate from the lines so that only pure steam will be left in the system. He had some models made up as samples, and he carried them round in a suitcase. His big opportunity came when a manufacturer’s agent, who was supplying steam traps to the U.S. Navy, called Velan to say the navy had a problem that present traps couldn't solve. Would the new principles designed into Velan's traps do the trick? They did, as it turned out, and Velan Engineering went on the navy's lists as an approved supplier. Today, 10 years later, 95 per cent of the U.S. Navy's vesels are equipped with his products. Velan has developed many original controls and valves for which patents have been accorded. These inventions are being produced and are in use throughout the world in power plants, the nuclear field rocketry, oil refineries and chemical plants. He is very active in astronautics and in the nuclear field and in these fields has presented many technical papers. He is a member of the British Interplanetary Society, American Rocket Society, Canadian Association of Mechanical Engineers, American Society of Mechanical Engineers and Rotary International. Married in 1941 (his wife’s name: Olga) and has three sons: Ivan, Peter and Tommy. Resides at 49 Aberdeen Ave., Westmount, Quebec. Recently he turned down a Canadian offer to buy him out, saying simply that his companies are not for sale. “I am 48," he says, "with three boys, 22, 20, and 15. I feel they deserve a chance to show what they can do running this business. If they can do the business, good; they should get it. If they can't, well, if it is possible to sell it for a good price today, I can still sell it 10 years from now; maybe for more, maybe for less." But today, he is not ready for that sort of ending to his work. ( "Canada Month" ) Mrs. Liba Vesely, b. in Jindrichuv Hradec, Czechoslovakia.

NEW CANADIAN THEATRE — One of the most interesting developments in ethnic theatre was formation of the New Canadian Theatre. It is a group which was formed of actors of various ethnic origins and which performs in English. The first play presented by this group was John van Druten’s comedy "I Remember Mama", at the Crest Theatre, Toronto, Ontario, in 1963. The man responsible for formation of this group was Mirko Jane- cek, born in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia. 41 [pageend41]CZECH AND SLOVAK ORGANIZATIONS AND NEWSPAPERS IN CANADA Czechoslovak National Association of Canada — The waves of Slovak and Czech immigrants before and after the first World War were scattered throughout Canada and did not have any central organization The founding meetings were held just before the second World War and launched an organization which grew to ninety-three branches throughout Canada. The main work of the Association during the war years was to re-establish a free democratic government in Czechoslovakia by direct support of the govern- ment-in-exile and to Czechoslovak soldiers fighting in the armies of the western allies and by support of the International Red Cross. With the end of the war effort and the disenchantment with the political situation in Czechoslovakia, the membership of the association declined until the incorporation of the Czechoslovak National Association of Canada, which succeeded to the name and obligations of the previous unincorporated body and now works for wider purposes and objects than those evoked by the war effort. The Association has as its purpose to develop the highest standards of citizenship in Canadians of Czechoslovak origin, as well as acting on behalf of the rights and welfare of Canadians of Crcchoslo vak origin. Czechoslovaks coming to Canada ar* assisted and encouraged by various organizations while on the other hand, the organizations strive to maintain a n a p- preciation of the cultural heritage and historical tradition of the immigrants' homeland. The Association promotes the growth of understanding and goodwill among all ethnic groups in Canada and the strengthening of democratic Government in Canada. For its Centennial Project, the Association initiated and supports the establishing of a professor of Czech and Slovak literature at the University of Toronto and Slovaks and Czechs will participate in the Sokol Slet and Rendezvous at Expo on the 1st and 2nd of July.

HOLY President [pageend44]PROFESSOR VLADIMIR KRAJINA Professor Krajina is teaching botany at the University of British Columbia and is engaged in research work in the field of plant ecology. He is the editor of "Ecology of Western North America”, a yearly publication put out by the University of British Columbia, and a member of the editorial board of "Vegeta- tio” published in the Hague (Netherlands). With his students he is presently preparing a large publication "Vegetation and its Environment of British Columbia”. In 1961-62 he spent a year as a visiting professor on the Hawaian Islands and in 1963 and 1965 travelled to the Canadian Arctic for several months of botanical studies. Earlier this year, he attended, as a Canadian delegate, and one of the main speakers, the Pacific Science Congress in Tokyo. Professor Krajina's research has opened up new and important vistas for future planning in the preservation of Canadian forests and Canada's natural resources. Professor Krajina is first of all a scientist but he has played an important part in politics in his native Czechoslovakia as well. As a matter of fact, his life reads almost like a James Bond story. After graduating from Charles University in Prague in 1927 he spent a year studying the flora of Hawai on a Yale Fellowship and he then worked in Switzerland, Paris and the famous Kew Gardens in London, Englland. After the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1939 he joined the resistance movement and until his arrest by the Gestapo in 1943, was one of the outstanding leaders of such movement. After the war, he wished to continue his academic career but the threat of Communism forced him into public life again and so, in addition to his academic career, he became a member of Parliament and one of the most outspoken critics of the Czechoslovak Communists. After the Communist coup d'etat in 1948 Professor Krajina and his family left the country and found exile in England. In 1949 he came to Canada and has been teaching at the University of British Columbia since that time. KRAJBICH, George, M.D., b. in Roud- nice, Czechoslovakia. Came to Canada in 1951.

LTD. VALENTI SHOE LIMITED [pageend46]OLDRICH POKORNY OF SARNIA For years the residents of Sarnia have noted a man walking along main thoroughfare Christina Street with his head hidden behind a newspaper or a book— somehow negotiating curbs and intersections without looking at them. This would bo Dr. Oldrich Svatopluk Pokorny, on his way to or from Imperial's Research Department. An immigrant from Czechoslovakia, Dr. Pokornys was a true pioneer. His ingenuity and resourcefulness have enabled him to make outstanding contributions to petroleum technology, among them the development of many of Imperial’s best lubricating and transformer oils. He played a major role in dewaxing of lubricating oil fractions and in a wax recrysallizing process which provided a new range of purified wax products. During World War I, when he was 19, his knowledge of chemistry convinced his superiors that he should not be used as any other ordinary soldier in the trenches; instead he spent most of his time taking apart unexploded shells picked up on the battlefield. He would reassemble the components into live shells for possible use by friendly guns. After the war Oldrich Pokorny returned to school and left Prague University in 1924 with a doctor's degree in chemistry. He came to Canada in 1928 and was hired by the Research Department of Imperial Oil Ltd., Sarnia Refinery. Thus he became one of the original members of the staff of four chemists, headed by Dr. R. K. Stratford. By the end of 1932, management of the firm had ample evidence that research and development was more than paying its way. Close co-operation with refinery personnel was firmly established and this marked the beginning of the modernization program at the Sarnia Refinery. Dr. Pokorny played a key role in all design and development. Although he never bothered to acquire a Canadian accent, he writes Eng- glish superlatively. His reports were masterpieces. One of Pokorny’s major interests is drama work. For years he was an important figure in the Sarnia Drama League and the Western Ontario Drama League — working on staging, lighting and decor, often with his brother George, a well-known Toronto architect. When Dr. Pokorny recently, after 36 years of exciting work, retired, it was said that the Canadian oil industry owes a great debt to this quiet and unassuming research scientist.—MJ.

TRESNAK, Frank — born 1902 at Kukleny next to Hradec Králové (a town known in history through the Austrian disaster at the battle of “Sadova” in 1866) was originally a teacher by profession, after a few years left, however, school to become a journalist. In the years before the Second World War and after it he was on the Editorial Board of “České Svobodné) Slovo”, a daily of the Czech Socialist Party. To schow the West orientation of the Czechoslovak people he took part in founding “The League of Friends of America” in 1945 and edited League’s biweekly called “American Letters”. After the Communist putsch of 1948 he escaped with his family to Germany and came to Canada in 1951. To Czech readers he is known by his contributions to Czechoslovak newspapers issued in Canada and the United States. He is employed by Encyclopaedia Britannica of Canada, Ltd. as an accountant. TRESNAK-REDLY, Milada b. in Prague, Czechoslovakia, came to Canada with her parents in 1951.

[pageend50]SOKOL IN CANADA Jan Waldauf Sokol was established in Canada in 1912 when the first Sokol Unit was founded in Frank, Alberta. In 1913 another Unit followed in Michael, B.C. These two were the only Sokol Units in Canada prior to World War I. In 1929 three additional Units were established in Regina, Sask , Winnipeg, Manitoba and Montreal, Quebec. The first Sokol Unit in Ontario was established in 1932 in Toronto. In 1941 another Unit was established in the newly formed community of Batawa, Ontario and 1952 saw the establishment of a Sokol Unit in Kitchener, Ont. On 5th July, 1952, at a meeting of representatives of all the then existing Sokol Units in Canada, a National organization was established — "Sokol Gymnastic Organization of Canada". This National organization is a regional district of the International Sokol Organization (Sokol Abroad). In 1953 two new Sokol Units were founded in Ontario — one in Windsor and the other in Toronto where there were now two Sokol Units — Sokol Toronto and Sokol Toronto 2. In 1955 the first Sokol Unit in the north was founded in Noranda, Quebec, and in 1960 a Sokol Unit was established in the nation's capital, in Ottawa. During summer 1955 a second National organization, the Canadian Sokol Organization was established. This organization associates Sokol Units not wishing to belong to the International Sokol organization. In January 1967, the two Toronto Sokol Units (Sokol Toronto and Sokol Toronto 2) merged under the name of "Sokol Gymnastic Association of Toronto." In addition to its programme of regular physical training and education, its meetings and conventions, Sokol members are active in all branches of sport and recreation. A close co-operation exists between Sokol and the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada. Because of the training, discipline and leadership of Sokol, its members are among the best in this country not only in gymnastics but also in many sports such as skating, skiing, track and field, swimming, tabletennis, volleyball and others. It is also significant that in 1956 a member of Sokol, Dave Baillie of Sokol Noranda, placed sixth in the weight lifting competitions at the Rimmer Olympics al Melbourne, Australia, and that in 1962 another two Sokol members, Maria and Otto Jelinek, won the world figure skating championships. Thus, Sokol once more, contributed Io successful representation of Canada in the field of international sports contests. FRANK JANAK President of Canadian Sokol Organization and Sokol Batawa Frank Janak was born into a Sokol family on 12th May, 1905, in Trebocho- vice. His brother and two sisters all belonged to Sokol and young Frank took part in Sokol physical training since he was 6 years old. Following employment in the airplane manufacturing plant of "Avia” and service in the Czechoslovak Airforce as a fighter pilot, Frank Janak became one of the pre-war Bata pilots. Wherever he was stationed he was active in Sokol (he attended Sokol training classes and held membership in Prague, Nitra, Olomouc, Plzen, Otrokovice and Batanagar in India). At the outbreak of the Second War Frank Janak piloted his plane to Poland; from there he flew via Jugoslavia and Italy to Paris to be for a short time a courier pilot between Paris and London. Following a short stay at Bata's factory at Tilbury in England (where he again became a member of Sokol) he left for Canada towards the end of 1939 to assist in building Batawa, Ontario. He immediately joined the recently founded Sokol Unit and was one of its most active members. In recognition of his outstanding services brother Janak was elected the Unit’s President in 1954 and has been re-elected every year since. Al Ilie founding of the Canadian Sokol Organization i n the summer of 1955 brother Janak became its First Vice President. One year later, in 1956, brother Janak was elected President of the Canadian Sokol Organization and has since been re-elected for additional terms of office. ING. FREDERICK B.

Pozornost každého čtenáře musí hned zaujmout barevný symbolický obraz na titulní straně: An- dersonův “Kníže Pokoje”, Spasitel, jehož postava se tyčí nad prapory všech národů světa až do výše gigantické budovy Spojených národů v New Yorku. Klepáním na budovu upozorňuje Spasitel na svou přítomnost. Celý výraz jeho ušlechtilé tváře a jeho ústa jakoby chtěly říci: Zastavte se la své nesprávné cestě! Vzpamatujte se dřív než bude navždy pozdě! Hlas naděje je vydáván za redakce Josefa Ku- bičíka a redakční rady, v níž jsou: Amil H. Mold- řik, Josef Krnálek, dr. Milena Šimečková a Jaroslav Ott. Časopis “Hlas naděje”, jak je řečeno na okraji druhé strany obálky, se snaží uvádět do denního života ty nejlepší zásady, a to ve vlasteneckém duchu, podle odkazu velikánů našeho národa - dle slov učitele všech národů Jana Amose Komenského, jehož obraz spolu s citátem o bibli z jeho “Kšaftu” je uveřejněn na zadní straně časopisu. Obsah prvního čísla zahajuje překrásná báseň “Naděje” od Ervína Wojnara, po níž je uveřejněn úvodní článek redaktora Josefa Kubičíka na téma “Opravdu hlas naděje?” Autor v něm filosoficky řeší obtížný úkol: najít největší lidskou bolest, lidské slabosti a nedokonalosti, a ukazuje východisko - rozebírá víru, naději a lásku. Známý krajanský literát E. H. Moldřík se představil velmi cenným článkem “Hledání Boha” a Jaroslav Ott přeložil pojednání E. W. Reinera “Čtyři úžasné záhady bible”. Stejně působivý je překlad V.

Gustav Drnec v Denním hlasateli, Chicago WOODLAND LUMBER LIMITED 1117 ST. CATHERINE ST. W. MONTREAL [pageend52]ERVIN SYPTÁK President of Sokol Gymnastic Association of Toronto Born 1910 in Hostalkov in a building which housed the local Sokol gymnasium. Thus he literally grew up in Sokol surroundings and began Sokol physical training at the age of 5. He remained a member of his home-based Sokol Unit even when, at later stages of his life, he lived elsewhere and participated in Sokol activities in the capital city of Prague and the capital city of Slovakia, Bratislava. For his activities in the Czech National life and Sokol he was imprisoned during the War for three years in Nazi concentration camps. In 1948, following the establishment of Communist regime in Czechoslovakia he had to leave his homeland and lived for a number of years in London, England. There he became very prominent in Sokol and following his immigration to Canada he continued his active Sokol work in Toronto. In January 1967, following the merger of Toronto’s two Sokol Units, he became President of the merged Unit, Sokol Gymnastic Association of Toronto. An cxpcil in culinary art, he gained considerable renown in this field in England and in Canada as Chef of the Lord Simcoe Hotel. He now owns a Coffee house on one of Toronto's main thoroughfares. LOUIS VÁVRA Founding Member of Sokol Toronto Born on 18. August 1902 in Slovakia, Louis Vávra, became a member of Sokol shortly after the end of World War I when Sokol expanded into Slovakia. Upon his immigration to Canada in 1928 brother Vávra explored the possibility of establishing Sokol in his new homeland. In 1932 when the first Sokol Unit In Ontario was established in Toronto, he was one of the founding members. He then held almost every office in Sokol; for many years he was the Unit's Physical Director and then Vice-President. During the Second World War all his efforts were concentrated in the Czechoslovak National Association of Canada to assist the Allied War effort and the Czechoslovak struggle to regain freedom from Nazi oppression. With the arrival of new immigrants to Canada following the Communist takeover in Czechoslovakia Sokol activities in Canada expanded and in 1953 there arose a need in Toronto to establish a second Sokol Unit in Toronto. Brother L. Vávra was elected It's first President and was successively reelected for 10 full terms of office. He served also as Vice- Prooidont of Sokol Gymnastic Association of Canada. Following the merger of the two Toronto Sokol units, in January 1967, he was elected to the Board of Directors of the new Unit and his great experience and the many years of meritorious work made him the "Elder Statesman" of Sokol in Canada. Dr. KAREL JERABEK Secretary of Sokol Toronto Founder of Sokol Windsor KAREL JERABEK, born 1910 in Prague, Czechoslovakia, member of the Sokol organization since 1928, received the degree of doctor of jurisprudence from Charles University in 1933, practised law until February, 1948, when disbarred by the Communists, fled the country in 1949, was elected chairman of the refugee camp "Valka" in Nurnberg, secretarygeneral of the Czechoslovak Political Refugees Organization in Germany, since 1950 in Canada.

KASANDA A SOKOL IN CANADIAN FORCES The recent announcement by the Headquarters of Canadian Forces Base at Camp Borden, Ontario that Lieutenant J. J. Kasanda was promoted to the rank of Captain, was read with pride by all members of Sokol in Canada. — For Captain Kasanda has belonged to Sokol since his earliest childhood and, whenever his duties allow him, takes part in Sokol activities. Captain Kasanda is an example of contribution by ethnic groups to Canada’s life at its best. * * * Brother Kasanda, born in Southern Bohemia has been an enthusiastic devotee to Sokol ever since he was 5 years old. Outstanding as an athlete and gymnast he took part successfully in a number of competitions and was a Sokol instructor. His studies at the University of Prague were interrupted by the Communist coup d’etat in 1948 following which he left his homeland. Following a stay of some months in Refugee Camps in West Germany, he immigrated in 1949 to Canada. Following the completion of a one year’s contract on a farm near Collingwood, Ontario, and a number of various employments (among them as a bushworker in Canada’s North and on a ranch in Alberta) he enlisted in 1952 as a private in the Princess Patricia’s Canadian Light Infantry. Following his basic training in Canada he served in West Germany with the 1st Canadian Infantry Brigade. He then attended a Physical Training Instructors course with the British Army in Aldershott, England. On return to Canada in December 1955, he was promoted to sergeant and employed as a staff instructor of the P.T. Wing at the Royal Canadian School of Infantry at Camp Borden. In 1958 he was posted to Winnipeg as the senior physical training instructor for the recreation centre. Promoted to Staff Sergeant in 1959 he was posted again to Camp Borden in 196'0 to the Army School of Physical Training. On 1st January 1963 he was commissioned as a lieutenant and returned to Winnipeg as Officer Commanding the Recreational Centre. In 1965 he returned to Camp Borden for the third time as Camp Fitness and Recreation Officer. His main task at that time was to centralize the fitness training on the Army side of the camp, and no sooner had that been accomplished, than it was time to centralize this training for the whole base, including the R. C. A. F. segment. Following amalgamation of the Army and Air Force PT staffs, he became Second in Command of the integrated Base Physical Education and Recreation Section. He is also the Base Water Safety Supervisor, responsible for organizing and supervising both the military and dependents swimming programme. Brother Kasanda is married and resides with his wife Margaret and sons Thomas (6 yrs) and Paul (1 yr) at the Base Borden, Ontario. The Sokols in Canada are justly proud of “their” Captain Kasanda in Canadian Forces and of his contribution to the Forces' Physical Education Programme. “As a pioneer in the field of fitness, the Sokol organization can, I am sure make an increasingly important contribution to the achievement of the aims and objectives of Canada’s new nationwide program to promote fitness and amateur sport.” J. Waldo Monteith Former Minister of National Health and Welfare "Sokol represents a splendid group of Canadians dedicated to the principles of physical fitness, democracy and human brotherhood.” T. C. Douglas National Leader of the New Democratic Party of Canada SOKOL SLETS IN CANADA Sokol Slets and exhibitions were held by most of Canada's Sokol Units at irregular intervals. During the war the Ba- tawa Sokol Unit organized a number of important Slets. Following the end of the war Sokol Slets were held annually at Masaryktown near Toronto in conjunction with the annual Czechoslovak Days, usually on Dominion Day. Since the establishment of Sokol Gymnastic Association of Canada, there were four Slets of this organization in Canada. The FIRST SLET was held f^52 at “Masaryktown” near Toronto, Ontario, the SECOND SLET in 1955 at Montreal, Quebec, the THIRD SLET in 1960 at No- randa, Quebec and the FOURTH SLET in 1962 at the grounds of the Canadian National Exhibition at Toronto, Ontario. This year, to commemmorate Canada's 100th Birthday, the FIFTH SLET will be held at St. Helen’s Island at Montreal, Quebec, the site of Expo 67. As this Slet will be also the SECOND SLET of the International Sokol Organization (whose FIRST SLET was 1962 at Vienna, Austria), it will be a most significant event in the history of Sokol in Canada. Al the Slets in Canada have been attended in large numbers by Sokols from the United States. This year’s Slet will again have numerous participants from American Sokols and, in addition, Sokols from Europe and possibly other parts of the world will take part. “Today the task of Sokol remains as great if not greater than it was a hundred years ago. You must not only prepare yourself for the strenous future, but you must through your activities, serve as a continuing reminder to all Americans of the need for physical fitness.” Paul H. Douglas U. S. Senator “I know of your organization's distinguished reputation not only for encouraging gymnastics and athletics but also for its moral and intellectual teachings.” General Dwight D. Eisenhower 54 [pageend54]JOSEPH M. HAMATA President of Sokol “Stefanik" Winnipeg, Man. Born on 6th November 1910 in Mala Planicka, near Klatovy. He attended schools at Hluboka and Kdyne and participated in physical training from an early age with his main interest being gymnastics. At the age of 15 he came to Canada and as soon as a Sokol Unit was established in Winnipeg (1929) he became a member, A gymnast and all-round athlete of note, Joseph Hamata, represented Sokol well on numerous occasions and displayed his outstanding leadership qualities. In 1933 he was elected to the office of Unit’s Physical Director and held this office until 1940 when he enlisted in the R. C. A. F. Following his return to Winnipeg after the War, he was elected President of the Unit and has been re-elected ever since. He is also very active in the life of Winnipeg's Czechoslovak Community and is President of Czechoslovak Benevolent Society of Winnipeg. “The good work of the Sokol Gymnastic Association of Canada, carrying on the Sokol traditions of Czechoslovakia, is a matter of groat admiration, even envy, among all Canadians. Everyone acknowledges the validity of your motto, “A healthy spirit in a healthy body", but few succeed in fulfilling it so well." Donald C. MacDonald New Democratic Party of Ontario Provincial Leader FRED M. PEARSON President of Sokol Rouyn-Noranda. The outstanding Sokol personality in Northern Ontario, Fred M. Pearson, was born on 3rd December, 1898, in London, England. A great sportsman in his youth, he gained considerable renown as a boxer. His keen interest in physical education and in working with youth soon had him involved in various physical education and youth organizations wherever he went. He served with the British Army during World War I and was later posted to India. After his immigration to Canada he was employed in the mining industry, in the Safety Education field. During World War II he served with the Canadian Army and returned to the mining industry after the war. He retired in 1963 after 32 years of service at No- randa Mines as Safety Supervisor and is now a Mining Safety consultant. Soon after Sokol was established at Noranda he became one of its most active members and was elected President. From 1963 to 1965 he also served as National President of Sokol Gymnastic Association of Canada and is now its Vice-President. For his many years of outstanding service in Canada’s Boy Scout movement he was awarded in 1955 the Older of Merit by the Governor General of Canada. He also received, in 1964, the exclusive William H. Cameron Award of the National Safety Council. He is a member of the Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, National Association of Fire Investigators and the Royal Ak.Ii Masons.

OUR YOUNG PEOPLE Our young people, of course, have all the irritating habits of any young people and in addition sometimes irritate their parents by their studied contempt for all things Czech or Slovak. However, as they grow older thoy occasionally discover a few things in their parents' heritage which even they think worthwhile. Some of them even manage to speak their parents' native tongue. On rhe whole, however, we are rather proud of them. Most of them do well, and some brilliantly, in school. Last year, for example, a few won Ontario scholarships. Here are three Toronto kids who did extremely well: Gus Pristupa, son of Gustav and Mary Pristupa. Gus took Czech language classes at Masaryk Memorial Institute where his grandfather was president for many years, and attended Sokol. He graduated from Kipling Collegiate Institute with high honours and won the Victoria College Yvonne Slípky Eva Koclik is another interesting teenager. She is Miss Toronto Sound and last month represented Canada in the Miss Teen International Pageant in Hollywood. She often plays leads in her school's plays and models teenage clothes for leading Toronto department stores. We think she is quite lovely and if you don’t believe us, see the picture below. mechanical engineering at the University of Toronto.

A GOOD CANADIAN “A Moravian woman, married to a farmer near here, brought me a loaf of bread so peculiarly good that I could not but enquire about it. She said that it was made with rennet and whey, without yeast or water, and baked in wicker or straw baskets, which is the method taught at the Moravian School at Bethlehem, in the States, where she was educated. The bread was as light as possible and rich, like cake." From "The Diary nf Mrs. John Gravel Simcoe," by John Ross Robertson.

In the Telegram of March 13th, 1967, we saw the following item: “Zdenek Metzl of the University of Montreal led a talented crew of Ontario-Quebec Athletic Association representatives to victory Saturday in the jumping competition of the Canadian intercollegiate ski championship Melzl’s victory, the fourth for the OQAA in as many events, left the winners far ahead of the Western Canada Intercollegiate Athletic Association in the foam competition.'’ * * * Many of our young people are at various universities.

As a matter of fact, he's probably a better Canadian than many of us because he was Scoutmaster here for five years, a member of St. John's Ambulance Brigade, a voluntary blood transfusion group and Toc-H." “Vladimir, who since his naturalization as a Canadian a number of years ago, calls himself James V. Hortig, was born at Maly Ujest in northern Czechoslovakia, but a stone’s throw from the German border." "I'm waiting for a recruit office to open and you can bet my name will top the list,” he said in his fluenl English.

LAURENT 748-7743 [pageend60]PART IV GERMANS FROM CZECHOSLOVAKIA CONTRIBUTE TO CANADA By Henry Weisbach, President, Central Organization of Sudeten German Clubs in Canada The year is 1938 — Europe is in uproar — once again the mighty machine of Hitler is on the move to gobble up another part of Europe. Within the borders of Czechoslovakia live 3^/2 million German born people. A large number of them have been loyal citizens of their country. In the spring and in the fall of 1938 they stand together with their Czech friends to defend the borders of their homeland against the invasion of the Nazi forces. However, the big powers of the time decided otherwise and ordered the territories which were the homeland of the German population to be handed over to the Nazis who occupied the Sudeten area on October 1st. Thousands of Social Democrats who stood with their Czech friends must give up their jobs and homes. Thousands of them are thrown into the concentration camps of the new rulers. More than 2,000 of the Social Democrats who were ready to defend their homeland went into exile, because remaining in the country would have meant certain death for them. About 1,000 of those finally found their way to Canada. A loan aranged between the Exile Government of Czechoslovakia and the British Government enabled these Sudeten German people to settle in Canada. They have always maintained close contact with their friends. When the first Czech-German settlers, as they were called, came to Canada, they were sent to Northern British Columbia into the Peace River District and to Northern Saskatchewan where they established settlements. Farmland which was given to them was mainly bushland and in Northern British Columbia the group of settlers worked together to clear thousands of acres of land and to plant crops. In Northern Saskatchewan the settlers received abandoned farms and here again, they worked hard to make a living, Today the picture has changed completely. In Northern British Columbia the selllemenl is equipped wilh new roads, the houses have electric light, compared to the kerosine lamps in former years and the farms are bringing in good crops. However, many of the original settlers moved away from the settlements and came to the cities to find employment in industry Today we ran find the former German citizens of Czechoslovakia in all walks of life in Canada. We Henry Weisbach is the ExccufilT Secretary of the Ontario Federation of Labour will try to outline the career of some of the people who came to Canada in 1939 and what they and their children are doing today. Former German Citizens of Czechoslovakia can be found in all parts of Canada. We find one of the foremost authorities in mental health and psychiatry, Dr. Robert Weil, who farmed in Northern Saskatchewan, now at the Dal- housie University in Halifax. Dr. Weil has written many papers on psychiatry and has appeared at many medical conferences in Canada and is considered one of the outstanding personalities in this field. Another doctor is still practicing in Northern Alberta. Dr. Arnold Glass, has a practice in Hythe, Alberta, and is giving valuable service to his patients. In the cultural and professional field we find Mrs. Tosca Lerch of Toronto, who comes from Teplitz Schonau in Bohemia, being recognized as a painter who has had many exhibitions and whose paintings have among others been obtained by the Borough of East York. The son of Victor Tinkle, who comes from Southern Moravia, is also a known painter. The son of one of our immigrants, Walter Schoen, is now vice-principal at the High School in Dawson Creek, B.C. The Schoens come from Freiwaldau in Silesia. The yfundsun of uui iiiend Emil Kutscha, who comes from Troppau, Silesia, is a Professor at the University in Berkley, California. Many of the Sudeten German immigrants have gone into business for themselves or have obtained influential positions in business. One of them, Frank Rehwald, (from Reichenberg) is now the Editor-in-Chief of the German newspaper “The Courier” in Winnipeg. Willi Barth and Ernst Kohlisch (from Gablonz) are engaged in the importing business, as is Carl Alber (from Bodenbach) who imports machine tools. Alois Wagner (from Krumau) has an electrical business and does work in many parts of Canada and the United States. Curt Fleischer (from Teplitz) operates a furniture business which has a large clientele, his brother Willi Fleischer is the owner of a dry goods business which also flourishes excellently. Many others have obtained influential positions with business firms. Otto Mann (from Znaim) is manager at the Fiberglas Co., while Armand Koutnik (from Reichenberg) is also a manager with a large company. Felix Skoutajan (from Aussig) is chief inspector at the Bata Works in Batawa, Ont., while his son is a minister of the United Church. Henry Weisbach (from Aussig-Warns- dorf) has made his mark in the Canadian Trade Union movement and presently he is the Executive Secretary of the Ontario Federation of Labour, as well as an officer of the Toronto Labour Council. He represents the trade union movement on many governmental and other bodies. Daisy Kaschte (from Bodenbach) is the Education Director of the Packinghouse Workers on a job which gives her the opportunity to travel all over Canada. There are many more, who have made their mark in the Canadian society. Our farmers in North Saskatchewan and in the Peace River District of British Columbia are well liked and have made a mark in this part of the country. Canada has gained tremendously by the immigration of the victims of the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia. Hundreds of Sudeten Germans work in industry, as tradesmen, many are by now of course pensioned off, but they all made an outstanding contribution to the development of Canada. We are very proud of the fact that there were no failures among our people. Today, when Canada celebrates its Centennial we, former citizens of Czechoslovakia, join all other immigrants of Canada in these celebrations knowing that during the last, almost thirty years we have contributed to the development of Canada in no small way. May the future be bright for the country which we have learned to love and which has become a second homeland to us. 61 [pageend61](dompiimenti to (dentenniaf (Canada H DENT and VALLIS CANADA LIMITED 215 SHERBOURNE ST.

ED, THE CZECHOSLOVAK CONTRIBUTION TO WORLD CULTURE, pp. 555-634; MOUTON & CO., THE HAGUE LONDON PARIS. CZECHOSLOVAKIA - A STORY The gods were lavish when they created today's Czechoslovakia. They gave it a great deal of natural beauty and considerable charm. They were somewhat cheeky when they surrounded it with the German people. For while German cultural influence contributed greatly to the development of Czechoslovak literature, arts and sciences, German political escapades often brought unhappiness and sometimes unspeakable misery to the inhabitants of the small country in the heart of Europe. The other, and not always happy influence either, came from the East. This influence goes back to the ninth century when Byzantium, on request of the Czech ruler Rostislav, sent to Bohemia two Christian apostles, Cyril and Methodius, who eventually became Czech saints. A definitely less happy example of the Eastern influence is the communization of Czechoslovakia after the Second World War. Squeezed between these Iwo basic influences, the Czech and Slovak people struggled to retain regional consciousness and unity and freedom for 13 centuries which Jerry Zaborski’ divides into tour phases. The first phase of Czechoslovakia came into being in 623 A.D. by the establishment of Sarno's State. Jerzy Zaborski puts ‘Jerry Zaborski is a distinguished Polish scholar presently teaching at Arizona State University. OF THIRTEEN CENTURIES it as follows: “Sarno's State was thus the first incarnation of Czechoslovakia, which has he same outlook, is the same composite of nations, has the same rational approach to politics and socioeconomic problems, and possesses the amazing stability of a regional concept so characteristic of the 1340 years of Czechoslovakia's existence as an independent multinational state '. During this period Mora- vain influence was strongest. Czechoslovakia's second phase, known in historiography as Greater Moravia was, as was Sarno's State, organized as a confederacy of nations but on a larger scale. During this period, dominance shifted to Slovakia The third embodiment of Czechoslovakia, under the Premyslides, was dominated by the Bohemian influence and declined in the late Middle Ages under the German pressure. The fuuilh phase uf Czechoslovak existence came into being in 1918 after a century of magnificent effort by the Czech and Slovak people. During the 13 centuries of their history, rhe people of Czechoslovakia have known periods of greatness and glory — the late Premyslides, the reign of Charles IV, the Hussite wars, the anabasis of the Czechoslovak legions in Siberia in World War One but alto — and perhapc more often periods of defeats and near-destruction. The defeat of the Protestant forces in the Battle of the White Mountain by the German Catholic Habsburghs in 1620 mark- By Josef Cermák ed not only the beginning of the Thirty Years' War but also of almost 300 years of German domination ending only in 1918. Only 20 years later, after a brilliant period of the First Republic under Thomas Masaryk, Hitler’s Nazis destroyed Czechoslovakia and imposed on it six years of nightmare. For three years after the Second World War hopes and fears took turns in quick succession while the West and Stalin played a deadly game. Czechoslovakia lost and another dark period descended upon its people, the end of which is not yet in sight. And yet—in spite of, or perhaps because of — their turbulent history, the Czechs and Slovaks have made a significant contribution to the common heritage of mankind. The Czech literature is the oldest among Slavic literatures and, as Rene Wellek documents in his article elsewhere in this issue, “can compare in age with almost any uf Ihe mujur and minui lileiuluies uf medieval Europe. It can stand comparison with Middle English literature. The old Czech and the Middle English literary languages were established about the same time: in the late 13th and early 14th centuries.'' The fact that Czech and Slovak literatures are little known (with the exception of Karel Cupek’s plays R U R and The Insect Play and Jaroslav Hasek's Good Soldier Svcil<> in the West, is no reflect ion on their quality. In religion, the influence of John Hus ranks in importance with that of John Wycliffe of England and Martin Luther of 63 [pageend63]COMPLIMENTS OF AIR & OCEAN TRAVEL CENTRE LIMITED TRAVEL SERVICES AROUND THE GLOBE KAREL BUZEK PRESIDENT TELEPHONE: EM 3-8888 (4 LINES) 1 ADELAIDE ST.

Two great statesmen merit mention: King George of Podebrady who, in the 15th century, proposed the idea of United States of Europe and Thomas Masaryk, considered by many the greatest statesman of this century. In education John Amos Comenius had a profound impact on modernization of educational system in England and elsewhere. It is perhaps worth mentioning that today over five hundred Czech and Slovak scholars are teaching at American and Canadian universities. The Czechoslovak contribution to music is well known. Names like Smetna, Dvorak, Janaček, Martinu and others are' familiar to music lovers everywhere. So are the names of Novotna, Kubelik, Firkusny. In industry the Skoda Works in Pilsen (and of course the Pilsen beer), the Bata shoes, the Bohemian glass and many other products are well known. Czechoslovakia produced two world champions in tennis (Kozeluh and Drob- ny), a triple Olympic gold medalist in Zatopek, number of excellent figure skaters including the world champions Otto and Maria Jelinek, twice won the hockey world championship and a bag of gold and silver and bronze medals in gymnastics and canoeing. The Czechoslovak soccer was always close to the top. Lately, due to somewhat freer conditions in their country Czechoslovak filmmakers are triumphing all over the world — Shop on Main Street, Loves of a Blonde and others. Sokol, a gymnastic organization founded in Prague more than 100 years ago, deserves a special mention. It seems to predate our preoccupation with physical fitness by a century. We have given it a special section in this issue. A few words should be said about Prague. In the view of many (and naturally we don't disagree) it is one of the most beautiful cities of the world — even in today’s dilapidated state. Its old palaces and baroque churches speak of other eras and other dreams. They are witnesses to the role Czechoslovakia played in European history. It was here that Charles University was founded in 1348. It was here that the Thirty Years' War started. It was here that astronomers and alchemists were guests of Rudolf II. It was here that the symbol of man's restlessness, Doctor Faust, signed away his soul to the devil and inspired Goethe's immortal drama. It was here that the Czech, German and Jewish cultures fused to create a unique atmosphere, the destruction of which is not the least of Hitler’s crimes. It was here that Mozart composed some of his music and scored his major triumphs. It was here that Kafka wrote his haunting novels. Indeed, Prague had its rendevouz with history. In closing, what can one say? Perhaps this: that after 13 centuries of contribution to the world culture the people of Czechoslovakia deserve as much support in their struggle for freedom as the emerging nations of Africa. CZECHOSLOVAK HISTORY Karel Jerabek RELIGION — THE BACKBONE OF CZECHOSLOVAK HISTORY The great leader of the Czechoslovak people of this century, the late Thomas Garrigue Masaryk, was a man of profound faith. His deep religious philosophy was prominently expressed in his political axiom: "Christ—not Caesar”. The nation that produced Masaryk and other personalities of similar stature must have had some tradition in the religious Ilie and philosophy. The difficulty of recognizing a group of men as a permanent compact unit called a nation is admitted. Still, there is a central stream of events and qualities which form the life of a nation and its history. Through this approach some as pects of the religion on the territory known presently as Czechoslovakia shall be discussed. From the scattered historical records it can be assumed that the Slavic peoples entered the country by the first century A.D. The latin word of Bohemia is derived from a Celtic tribe, the Rnii which had been conquered by the Teutonic Marco- mani in approximately the twelfth century B.C. All these tribes were originally primitive pagans. Present archeological dis- cvreiies and historical research Indlrnte that Ilie iiisl contact wih Christianity reaches as far as to the fourth century A.D. through an Iro-Scottish mission. More concrete appears the mission of St. Amand, apostle of Belgium and the Netherlands in the seventh century. Otherwise, three historical facts can Banska Štiavnica.. New castle ( 1 564> be considered as solid historical data of Christianity in Czechoslovakia. The first church in Nitra in 836, the baptism of fourteen Czech dukes at Regensburg in 845 and the official mission of Cyril and Methodius to Great Moravia in 863. They were invited to come from Salonika by King Rostislav who ruled over a huge territory including not only the present Czechoslovakia but reaching far to the north and south. That empire collapsed in VU/, but by then Christianity was established. The subsequent history is marked by periods of wise and unwise rulers, eo operation and fights among them, including oven the murders of the closest kin. Thus In 929, the Christian Prince Wenceslas—Vaclav (known as 'Good King Wenceslas") was assassinated by his brother Boleslav. Karel Jerabek, is a Toronto executive 65 [pageend65]The national life of Czechoslovak peoples throughout the history had a strong, if not prevailing, overtone of religious substance. Most of the big battles and wars were fought for the conviction of religious truth. Religion was an essential part of national policy and as such vitally influenced the nation’s position among other European powers, in the first place, the Holy Roman Empire and its successor the Roman-German Empire, a confederation of autonomous kings and dukes. The Polish neighbour to the north and the Hungarian to the south played also an important part in the history of Czechoslovakia. Religion was often employed as a means of power by shrewd rulers, or to stir up discordance and enmity among the members of the same nation. On the other hand, religious denomination was often a unifying force among different nationalities. In 973 the bishopric was founded in Prague to emancipate the local churches from foreign jurisdiction. The eastern part of the territory, namely Slovakia, was for centuries under Hungarian domination, with the exception of some short-lived interruptions of freedom. Since the Xllth century Roman culture was more and more introduced into the country, mostly from Italy and France during the reigns of powerful Czech kings, Vaclav II and Premysl Otakar II. When the kings of the Premysl dynasty had no male successor in 1306, after a period of foreign interference, the Czech crown was assumed by Jan of Luxemburg in 1310 who very strongly influenced the country by French culture. His son, Karel IV (Charles IV) although not of Czech origin, was soon called “Father of the Fatherland" for his tremendous accomplishments in all sectors of the national life. He caused the elevation of the bishopric to archbishopric in 1347 and founded in Prague the first university of Central Europe in 1348. His prestige and power in the German Empire and, in fact, the whole of Europe, was second to none. His son, Vaclav IV, was a strongly nationalistic Czech sovereign. Destiny put him in the tumult of rising religious reforms. The teaching of the English reformer John Wycliffe soon found fertile soil in Bohemia. Starting with Konrad Waldhauser, Jan Milic of Kromeriz, Tomas of Stitny, Matej of Janov, Peter Payne of England and Jeronym of Prague, the reformation culminated in the teaching of Jan ((John) Hus, Master of Charles University. With his reformatory activity there is connected a glorious history of the Czech people. He was recognized as the most prominent reformer of his era in the Central European region and even Martin Luther, a century later, based some of his articles on Hus’ teaching. Hus was condemned as a heretic by the decision of the Church Council and burned at the stake in Constance on July 6th, 1415. 66 The Hussites, as the followers of Jan Hus were called, formed a powerful army, led by Jan Zizka of Trocnov, to defend their creed and decisively defeated many times huge armies of the German emperor and of the pope, sent to break the hard heads of the rebellious Czechs. The victory of protestantism was reflected in the election of a Hussite nobleman, George of Poděbrady, as King of Bohemia by both protestant and catholic nobility. Deeply religious, this king is known for his efforts to unite European states into a federal Europe. Hussitism gave origin to an orthodox unit of pacifists, the Czech Brethren, led by Peter Chelcicky, a farmer, who is sometimes called the predecessor of Leo Tolstoy. After the death of George of Poděbrady the country was ruled for fifty years by the Polish royal family of Jag- ellon. When the last male member of the Jagellon dynasty died in 1526, a member of the Habsburg dynasty, Ferdinand I, became king of Bohemia. The first Habsburgs, and particularly emperor Rudolph II, proved good rulers. During the reign of Rudolph, Prague was the seat of the imperial court and was one of the most cultural and powerful cities of Europe. Rudolph, giving in to the demands of the Czech nobility in 1606 proclaimed “The Majestat” guaranteeing religious freedom in the country. The subsequent Habsburgs exercised all efforts to suppress the protestantism, Czech language and historical rights. The Czech protestant army was decisively defeated by the imperial army in the Battle of the White Mountain (Bila Hora) on November 8th, 1620. The Utraquists and the members of the Unity of Brethren were subject to the severest persecution, their estates seized and given to foreign catholic, mostly German, nobility. Ferdinand II, with unrestrained cruelty, had executed publicly twenty-seven real or alleged leaders of protestant opposition on June 21st, 1621. In his anti-reformation activities the emperor found loyal supporters in the Order of Jesuits. Approximately thirty-thousand families emigrated and with them the last bishop of the Unity of Brethren, Jan Amos Comenius, known also as “Teacher of Nations", who died in exile in Holland. A group of protestants called “Moravian Brethren" emigrated to Canada in 1752 where they preached Christianity to the Eskimo and Delaware Indians. One of their churches at Thamesville, Ontario, is preserved as a national monument. Since 1620, the Habsburghs, throug systematic persecution, converted the country, overwhelmingly protestant, into an almost enterily Roman Catholic one. The next three hundred years were marked by incessant struggle of the Czech and Slovak peoples for national, social and religious freedom. The three main leaders of the political fight for freedom were Thomas G. Masaryk, born in Moravia, Edward Benes, a Czech and Milan Rostislav Štefánik, a Slovak, who crowned the efforts and struggles of numerous national leaders and martyrs for the liberation of their nation and restoration of its historical rights for an independent state with the foundation of Czechoslovakia in 1918. The democratic Czechoslovak Republic was the bearer of all religious virtues of the past as well as of new philosophical streams coming from the west and other parts of the world. After the Communist putsch in 1948 conditions similar to those prevailing after the defeat at White Mountain reigned in Czechoslovakia, suppressing all freedoms of man and particularly religious freedom. The Communists and their secret police seized the properties of citizens and executed hundreds of politicall opponents, among them a devout follower of Hus’ and Masaryk's teachings, Milada Horáková. She had been previously jailed f or many years in concentration camps by the Nazis and after their defeat she started working again for her religious and humanitarian ideals. In the Hussite tradition, she courageously defied the Communist tribunal and was brutally executed in 1950. She is now recognized as a martyr of Czechoslovak nation. An estimated seventy-thousand men and women of all walks of life escaped from their native country and some of them came to Canada. Recently, the red regime under political and economical pressure released from imprisonment the Archbishop of Prague, Cardinal Dr Josef Beran, recognized by both catholics and protestants as a great spiritual leader and patriot. With humble prayer and filled with determination the descendants of Saint Wenceslas and Jan Hus live and work in Canada and other parts of the free world to preserve their heritage and help restore freedom in all oppressed countries including Czechoslovakia. [pageend66]PHILOSOPHERS, HEROES AND MARTYRS SAINT VENCESLAS “Good King Wenceslas looked out on the feast of Stephen, When the snow lay ‘round about, deep and crisp and even." Every Canadian is familiar with this popular Christmas carol, yel how many realize that it is a Czech saint whose praises we are singing? The carol relates but one incident in the life of this legendary character, one which typifies the saintly kindness and charity for which the ruler is remembered. Wenceslas was born in Bohemia in 907, and assumed the reins of government at the age of seventeen. The carol wrongly designates the royal saint as ‘king’ Wenceslas, for in actual fact there was no monarchy in Bohemia at that time, it being a province within the Holy Roman Empire. Though Wenceslas became the ruler of Bohemia at the tender age of seventeen, his wisdom and sensibility made themselves felt immediately. His rule was marked by a determined effort to keep peace in his land and to maintain cordial relations with neighbouring states. A popular Czech legend tells of an incident when a warring knight, Radislav by name, eager to acquire the rich Bohemians lands, invaded the country. Wenceslas summoned his loyal followers and set out to meet the knight. Once the two armies were facing each other, Wenceslas, in order to spare his beloved people unnecessary bloodshed proposed that only the two leaders fight and the victor be declared the conqueror. In the ensuing battle Wenceslas succeeded in felling the knight. Radislav lay wounded at Wenceslas' feet. Instead of slaying him, Wenceslas in his mercy called him brother, told him to rise and sent him home in peace. Wenceslas was an intensely devout Christian, and a great part of his life was spent in the zealous spreading of Christianity throughout his land. He ■founded numerous churches, and his acts of love to the poor and the sick did much to alleviate his people's distresses. He fed and clothed the poor, protected orphans and widows, gave hospitality to strangers and brought freedom for slaves. He was a man of such extraordinary goodness and piety that his legend has perpetuated for over ten centuries. This in itself is not uncommon, for many man's names have remained famous for even longer times. But these other men were great warriors, scientists, oralors or philosophers. St. Wenceslas is a man whose fame has peisislcd on tho strength of goodness alone. Yet how was h« rewarded for his pietv and charity. By a piemulure and tragic death, on Sept. 28, 929, at the hands of his power-hungry brother as he was on his way to mass. He was assassinated for lacking the vices desireable in a ruler-power lust, ruthlessness and greed. His brother, who came to be known as Boleslav the Cruel, succeeded to the throne and initiated an era of constant warfare that ravaged the land for centuries to come. But the memory of Wenceslas, ordained by the pope as a saint shortly after his death, and of this peaceful era in history, lives on still. The celebrations in honour of the Millenary of St. Wenceslas in July and September of 1 929 culminated in the completion of the splendid medieval cathedral of St. Vitus in Prague, a cathedral that St. Wenceslas himself had founded. Within the cathedral is a magnificent chapel set apart as St. Wenceslas Chapel. This exJOHN HUS (1369—1415) John Hus, one of the Czech nation’s greatest heroes, died a martyr’s death at the stake for his advocation of the truth as he found it in the Scriptures. His sin was an adherance to the truth and a refusal to put the Church before God. — Educated at Prague University, Hus became dean of the philosophical faculty there and later was appointed rector of the University. In 1402 he became rector of Bethlehem Chapel, erected by the citizens of Prague to provide popular teaching in the Bohemian rather than the Latin tongue. Hus was no meek or weak principled follower of the status quo of the Roman church as it existed at that time, the age during which the Great Schism was taking place and large number of the clergy were taking advantage of their priestly offices by lining their pockets with the money of the pious. Hus regarded the Church as corrupt and anti- Christian and decided to devote his life to its reformation. He attacked the sale of indulgences, challenged the primacy of the pope and emphasized the supreme authority of the Scriptures. In 1408 a group of clergymen laid befuie Ihc archibishop a formal complaint against the strong expressions used by Hus with regard to clerical abuses. As a result, Hus was forbidden the exercise of priestly functions. Fruthermore the archbishop appointed an inquisition to Inquiie inlo the charges of heretical teaching and inflammatory preaching brought against him, accusing him nf speakinq disrespectfully of the church and of praising Wycliffe, his English forerunner, as a pious man and an orthodox teacher despite the fact that he had been declared a quisitely ornate room, with walls of mosaic tiles inlaid with precious and semiprecious stones, and depicting scenes from the life of the Saint actually dates back to his time. It is within this chapel that the priceless Crown Jewels are housed, the jewels which have now been shipped to Canada where they will be on display in Montreal Expo ‘67. Other memories persist. Wenceslas Square, the main street in the heart of Prague is named in his honour and a huge impressive statue of the Saint stands at the top of the hill looking out over the crowds bustling by at his feet. And every year on Sept. 28th Czechs all over the world are united as they celebrate the Feast of Wenceslas, the patron saint of Bohemia. Helen Nofzl. heretic and an enemy of the Roman Church. Hus had been deeply influenced by the teachings of Wycliffe although he did not agree with all his beliefs. Nevertheless he saw Wycliffe as an earnest crusader of the truth. Consequently Hus was excommunicated by the pope, yet he continued to preach in his Bethelem Chapel and began publicly to defend the treatises of Wycliffe in the University. Despite the rising of the populace in defence of their hero, in 1411 a ban was declared anew against Hus’ preaching, and ultimately the whole city was laid under interdict. But Hus was not to be silenced; he continued to preach dispite the ban. His unyielding devotion to the truth, his moral integrity, and his love and concern for his congregation would not let him give up his mission. In 1414 the famous Council of Constance took place. Hus was given the imperial ‘safe conduct’ to lure him from comparative safety at home to Constance. Confident in the honour of his king and of the church, Hus went to Constance to defend his preaching and to rid himself of the accusation of heresy once and for all. The pope appointed three bishops to investigate the case uyuinsl HuJ. The case turned out to be one of the greatest travesties of justice in history. Excerpts were taken from hie writings and out nf context were given outrageous interpretations. Hus was unable to make any sort of defense, for he could not be heard over the violent outcries of his enemies. In the end, when he was given rhe cliuine to'tepenf, to admit his heresy and to recuul Ids leueluny publicly, ho steadfastly refused, for he could see nothing 67 [pageend67]TOP PAPER PRODUCTS LTD. an 309 ELIZABETH ST.

[pageend68]heretical in his treatises on the supremacy of the truth. The sentence of death was pronounced on July 6th, 1415, and after being handed over to the secular arm, Hus was burned at the stake. He died praying for his beloved flock at the Bethlehem Chapel that they might continue his quest for the truth. “Defend the truth to the dealh, for the truth will liberate you.” The gist of his argument was that the Roman Church tended to put itself above the Scriptures, setting itself up as an authoritative, omniscient structure. Hus attacked this view, considering the Scriptures to be the sole source of authority. He repudiated all absolute submission to the magesterial authority of the church, and insisted on every individual’s freedom to interpret the Scriptures. “It is proper to obey God rather than men,” he wrote. No one could go beyond the Scriptures, Hus declared, be he pope or the most famous theologian, for the Bible is the source of all truth and as such was the rule of faith. Hus regarded the church as a spiritual fellowship of those possessing the spirit of Christ rather than a legal corporation governed at that time by the Council. This body of theologians claimed to possess supreme authority over the entire church. To Hus they were men who could err just as were the popes, of which there were during the Schism, three. Two were deposed by the Council and the third was induced to resign. Little wonder Hus repudiated their absolute authority and omniscience. He also deplored the excessive veneration of saints. They were to be respected and admired, he taught, but only God was to be worshipped. Hus advocated the ‘priesthood of all believers’, the theory that very believer has direct access to God without the necessity of intermediation. In connection with this doctrine he taught that the priestly office was ministerial and not self-authoritative. The priest does not himself forgive sins, he can only declare them forgiven when the required conditions of sincere repentance are met. Only God can forgive sins. He emphasized Christ's teaching that people must practice acts of love to be true Christians. The clergy tended to stress penances and the payment of in dulgences, a very passive form of Christianity. Hus advocated that faith plus works of love, not faith alone, are necessary for everlasting life. Hus' hculises on Church reformation are the grounds by which he is inextricably linked to the Protestant Re- formalion; it was he who handed on to Luther the torch which kindled the Reformation. But is there a doctrine among his teachings from which we can still learn From Maudr’s medallion in Constance something to-day? There certainly is. At present the burning issue within the churches concerns church unity. Hus had strong beliefs on this topic. During his time the Roman Church claimed to possess universal rule over all of Christendom. Hus renounced this claim, insisting that other churches possess equal autonomy and the Roman Church's power was limited to its own particular communion. Present-day eccumenists who believe that by organized union of particular churches they can produce one united body ought to consider carefully Hus’ contention that no one can A TRIBUTE TO JAN J. A. Comenius, born at Uhersky Brod in Bohemia in the year 1592, has a multiple claim to fame: a deeply loyal Czech patriot, a theologian, and the last Bishop of the Moravian Church, he was also one of the greatest educators that ever lived. Bohemia was at that time experiencing the most tragic period in her history, having been robbed of her freedom and enslaved within the Austrian Empire under the Habsburgs. Comenius, who was an ordained priest of the Protestant Brethren, followers of John Hus, found life precarious for himself and his Brethren as religious persecution spread, and was forced to flee in exile to Leszno, Poland, where religious tolerance could still be found. He was later consecrated Bishop of the Brethren and Leszno became the headquarters of the exiled Czech community. There his learning and his avid belief in the value of pure truth won him a unique reputation in the educational field. He was invited to England by Parliament Io introduce necessary reforms in their educational system. There he conferred with such notables as John Pym and John Seldon. He did a great deal to reform education in England, including drawing up plans for a Baconian College dedicated to collective scientific research on international lines, a centralized pool of all learning. The college never took concrete form because Comenius' stay was cut short by ‘produce’ spiritual unity but God. The unity that exists between different churches is spiritual and not organizational or legalistic. The freedom to entertain individual beliefs and interpretations of the Scriptures within the separate churches must exist, unless wc arc to return to the age of inquisitions, martyrs and the persecution of heretics, who like John Hus, feel it is their God-given duty and right to seek and expound on the truth as it exists for them. Yet Hus' influence extend even beyond the church. The great religious reformer was also an ingenious and successfull innovator in the Czech language, both in vocabullary and in orthography, as revealed in his treatise De Orthographia Bohemia (1410). He simplified spelling and popularized the Prague dialect, and it was Hus who introduced the diacritical signs ’ and v which have survived to the present. The Czech people have in John Hus a national hero truly worthy of the admiration and reverence bestowed on him. July sixth has remained to the present a day set aside for the commemoration of this pious man who contributed so much and who gave up his life so that truth might live on. Helen Notzl AMOS COMENIUS the war in England imminent at that time, but these plans are the grounds by which Comenius is regarded as the for - runner of the Royal Society founded in 1662, to which Comenius dedicated one of his most important books, The Way of Light. The German philosopher Leibniz, influenced by Comenius, founded the Berlin Royal Society, and similar societies appeared elsewhere. While in England Comenius was offered the position of Master of the newly formed College of Harvard in America. However he declined this offer because his aims throughout the years of his exile were to continue working for the restoration of his ruined country and to propagate his educational theories throughout Europe. He had resolved, he states, that “Should God in his mercy toward us restore us to our native land, supports must be in readiness whereby the harm wrought to our schools and our youth might be more rapidly repaired.” What is most bitterly ironic is that this great Czech educuloi, this ‘Gulileu of Education’ had widespread influence in Holland, Sweden, Poland, Britain and other parts at t-nrnpe, hut his works were denied to his own people.

AS AN EDUCATOR The debt which the modern world owes Comenius in the field of educulion is summed by Dr. Odlozilik: "The infant school of Kindergarten, female education, the value of drawing and manual training, the physical and ethical elements in education, and finally that education is for all and not for a favoured few only, were all articles in the creed of Comenius." His ideas have provided the source for generations of educationalists that have followed. He published over 200 books, many of which were translated into English. His ‘Gate of Language Unlocked' (1631) revolutionized Latin teaching and was translated into sixteen languages. In addition to his Latin works on educational and theological problems, his works in Czech reveal him as a writer and thinker of the highest stature. ‘The Labyrinth of the world' (1631) is analogous to Bunyan’s ‘Pilgrims’ Progress' and is one of the supreme achievements in Czech literature. It was a major source of spiritual consolation to the exiled Bohemians. AS A PATRIOT In his ’Testament’ (1650), Comenius’ devotion to the Czech cause reaches its loftiest expression. This book with its poiguunl and heartrending appeal provided daily inspiration to a later Czech exile, Thomas Masaryk. It is a book in which Comenius bequeaths everything he has stood for — love of truth, a deep and loyal patriotism, and a belief in the fundamental importance of universal education compatible with religious belief — to those that will take up his cause. "I bequeath first a love of the pure truth wich God revealed to us earlier than to other nations by the ministrations of our own Master John Hus. Thine is this inheritance, my beloved native land." His challenging rallying-cry rings out to us to-day with an even greater poignancy. "I, believe that after the tempest of God’s wrath shall have passed, the rule of thy country will return again unto thee, O Czech Nation. Live, O nation, consecrated to God, and die not." Comenius' words cry out even now in an inspiring message of hope and faith to those people all over the world living in exile from their native lands. This was Jan Amos Comenius: educational reformer, theologian, writer, and fervent patriot, a Czech to whom the world owes an enormous debt of gratitude, and a fellow countryman worthy of the pride of every Czech. By Helen Notzl. THOMAS GARRIGUE MASARYK PHILOSOPHER IN ACTION S. Harrison Thomson ( Excerpts from an article published in University of Toronto Quarterly, July, 1949) There is nv man hi rhu history of our modern civilization who better exemplifies the ideal of Plato's philosopher-king than Thomas Garrigue Masaryk, first President of the Czechoslovak Republic. So cautious a judge of personalities as George Bernard Shaw remarked of him that he was the only man capable of being the President of a United States of Europe. He has been called the wisest and greatest European of this century and there are few if any who dispute that judgment. Yet he came from one of the smaller and almost unknown people» of Europe. The yieolci powers oiiei llieir statesmen a broader field on which to display their talents, and we are accustomed to accept the size of their role as an index of the excellence of performer and performance. But size is not quality, and history ultimately judges quality. Fifth-century Greece was small, even in its own day, but it produced men and ideas, a society, and a culture we humbly envy and respect today. And so, I venture to say, will this one man—the founder and head of U Smoll Stale wliiuli is suiiielimes culled an "artificial" state, without a sea coast, at the mercy of stronger neighbours for centuries — come to be regarded as the leading mind and character of a whole epoch. And it is more than likely that his renown will increase with the patting of time . . . The very simplicity of his origins might provide a key to his greatness. His father was a Slovak coachman on one of the royal estates in Moravia, and his mother was a Moravian of equally humble family In later life Masaryk gave almost all the credit for his ambition tn learn to hit mother. Professor S. Harrison Thomson teaches at University of Colorado. Ho went as tar a, th« family poveily wuuld ulluw in local schools, was apprenticed at thirteen to a locksmith and af fourteen to a blacksmith. He was not satisfied and by sheer determination found ways and means to attend and graduate from the University of Vienna, then the leading centre of learning in the vast Austro-Hungarian Empire. He wrote his doctoral thesis in 1876 on "Plato on Immortality” — which he later burnt, a fitting fate for many doctoral theses. He had already read voraciously in German, English, French, and Russian literature and philosophy, and was, without being conscious of it, preparing himself for his later and worldwide work. The next year he met Miss Charlotte Garrigue, an American studying music in Leipzig. Their marriage in 1878 was to be of great importance for his development. Her fine mind and noble spirit opened new vistas to him, particularly through her understanding of the best in the American and English literary and philosophical tradition. As he sums it up, my marriage completed my education ...” Before his fiftieth year, by |y(JU, he was well known throughout the Empire as the philosopher of the new Czech "Realism" — a term by which he meant to convey an idea of individual and national honesty and simplicity. Students from all over the Empire, and particularly from the various Slavic peoples undei llupsbuiy lule — Crodls, Serbs, Slovenes, Bulgars, Slovaks — had come to Prague to study at the leading Slav university, and had been stimulated and heartened by Masaryk's teaching and spirit. They had naturally spread his name and doctrines upon return to their native provinces . , . Of the many controversies in which he was reluctantly engaged while a professor at Prague, three of the more dramatic will show something of the character and motiva- 71 [pageend71]tion of the man. The first is the case of the manuscripts In 1818, over sixty years before Masaryk came to Prague, two manuscripts were “discovered” by a patriotic and romantic Czech scholar. They purported to be from the early thirteenth century and to demonstrate that then and formerly these western Slavs had a culture higher than their German neighbours. Though a few doubted their authenticity, they were generally accepted for decades. Patriotism, particularly sensitive when the Czechs were living under the Hapsburg rule, demanded that the people have something from the past to offset and minimize their humiliating present. But a few voices were again raised against the acceptance of the manuscripts, and Masaryk was drawn into the dispute. It seems that some of the polemics had appeared in the Athenaeum, a publication which he had founded and continued to edit. “To me,” he says, “the question of the manuscripts was first and foremost a moral question. If they were forgeries we must confess it before the whole world. Our pride, our culture, cannot be based on a lie. Besides, we could not truly get to know our own real history while we were obsessed by a fancied past. The case seemed perfectly obvious to me.” He was called a traitor, a paid agent of the Germans, and much else. Former friends deserted and reviled him. But after profound and open-minded study of the records he was convinced he was right, and for him that was the end of the story. It took years for the furore and the enmities to die down. A second typical battle was the Hilsner case, which almost cost Masaryk the influence he had worked so hard to earn among the Czech people. In 1899 a young Jew, Hilsner by name, was accused of murdering a Czech girl and using her blood for ritualistic purposes. Public opinion rose to fever heat and outbursts of uncontrolled anti-Semitism were common. Hilsner was convicted after a hurried trial and sentenced to death, a sentence later commuted to life imprisonment. Masaryk did not accept the thesis of the ritualistic murder, and was ashamed of his countrymen for being so unregsoningly panicked by a mob psychosis. In the columns of his own periodical Cas and in as many others as would publish his communications, he examined the evidence and showed the lack of factual basis or legal justification for the verdict. Again, going counter to a popular and temporary fancy which was crystallized in the heat of anger, he was reviled and misrepresented, and even some of his students turned against him. It became so serious that at one time he packed his belongings preparatory to leaving the country. But he faced angry mobs and cat-calling student demonstrations, on several occasions formented by the clergy, proclaiming his convictions that anti-Semitism was a disgrace to the Czech people and a national evil, and that he was defending the cause of truth, which would in the end honour the people who stood loyal to it. Only two professors had sufficient courage to condemn the cruel treatment Masaryk had received and to defend his right to get to the truth. Again it was years before the slanders were forgotten, and as late as 1914 rumours of his being in German pay were being maliciously circulated. There is a Czech proverb that says: “Lies have short legs.” It might equally well be said, certainly in the case of Masaryk: “Lies have long lives.” The third cause celebre was the Zagreb treason trial and the related Friedjung libel case. This incident has received rather more publicity in the West than other events of Masaryk's life, by reason of its having been thoroughly reported to the British people by R. W. Seton-Watson and by Wickham Steed, then Central European correspondent of the London Times and author of a serious study of the Hapsburg monarchy. Austria's desire to punish Serbia for opposing the annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1908 led Count Aehr- enthal, Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister, to accuse Austrian Serbs of treason. By January 1, 1909, fifty-three such South Slavs, subjects of Austria-Hungary, were in jail on charges of high treason. The trial was grotesque, even on those rare occasions when the presiding judge was sober. To make it worse, a renowned Viennese historian, Dr. Heinrich Friedjung, published an article defending the government’s position and citing allegedly incriminating documents upon which he based his judgments. Masaryk, several of whose former students were among the fifty-three accused, had gone to some of the sessions of the trial, and had, on his own initiative and at his own expense, travelled to Serbia and done much investigation. He was able to gather evidence that convinced him that Friedjung’s documents were forgeries. He made a speech on the floor of parliament, of which he was then a member, expressing his point of view before the judgment of the world. Thereupon one of the judges in the case denounced Masaryk as “a scoundrel, guttersnipe, a felon, an upstart, the scum of the earth.” After this exchange of courtesies the majority of the accused were found guilty. Professor Friedjung, a naive tool of the Foreign Office, was sued for libel by the Slavic cultural organization which had been accused of fathering the alleged conspiracy, with neutral results. But Masaryk was not through. Further evidence came into his hands, as to where and when the forgeries were concocted and photographed, and Masaryk openly charged the Austro- Hungarian minister in Belgrade, Count Forgach, with the whole scheme. But the scandal reached even higher. Masaryk also charged that the Foreign Minister himself, Count Aehr- enthal, was guilty of complicity in the plot, and forced him from one admission to another until in March, 1911 Aehren- thal took a vacation, never to return to office. A professor of philosophy had proven to the world something that even the Austro-Hungarian armies and inept diplomacy had been unable to make clear — that the Hapsburg "monarchy had lost whatever inner virtue it may once have possessed.” He had also demonstrated what was meant by Czech “realism" —quite the opposite of the sinister if apparently successful "Realpolitik"—that in the hands of honest, intelligent, and determined men, the ideals of truth and justice will bear positive fruit. In the few short years till the outbreak of the First World War, Masaryk's influence among forward-looking Czechs and Slovaks grew. His efforts to persuade the Vienna government to modify its short-sighted policies in such a way as to unite and solidify the Empire by giving the minority peoples an enlightened government were fruitless. In the midst of these troubled events he finished his memorable study, on The Spirit of Russia, which remains to this day the most penetrating study written on the complex of thought, inspiration, myth, prejudice, and mysticism that confuses and confounds the rest of the world. No Russian could have written such a work. Only a scholar of wide and deep reading and understanding, firmly rooted in Christian thought, of East and of West, familiar for decades with Russian thought and life, could have assayed so critically and yet so sympathetically the congeries of paradoxies that is Russia. The outbreak of hostilities in 1914 found him prepared in mind and will. His analysis of political history and actualities had convinced him that the ramshackle edifice of the Hapsburg Empire, standing for almost a thousand years, had to come down, and that in its stead there should rise new national structures, built according to both rational and idealistic plans. The story of his personal odyssey — a superannuated professor of philosophy, as he said of himself with a twinkle in his eye — aided by the young Edvard Benes, to the capitals of the Allies, Paris, Rome, London, then to Russia to organize Czechoslovak legions and get them, in good order, out of a Russia seething in Revolution, across Siberia, the Pacific, and to the Western Front; the proclamation of Czechoslovak unity and independence in historic Independence Hall in Philadelphia; his return to his beloved land as President: these facts are well known and their import fairly well grasped. But what is perhaps not so well understood is that he looked upon the precarious struggle for independence and the future opening out before the republic of which he was the principal founder in a 72 [pageend72]A drawing by Prof. K. Braun [pageend73]purely moral light. In his mind the struggle had been from the beginning one for moral values; the essence of the future was also a matter of the maintenance of justice, forbearance, and honour. He was sixty-eight years old when he returned to be the first president of Czechoslovak Republic . . . I have used the paradoxical title, the “philosopher in action." The usual connotation of the term “philosopher” is that of the disembodied intellect, secure in its isolation from the common things of life, dealing with distant and abstract ideas, building an esoteric system which only a select few can understand, and which of course no one would dare to sully or degrade by putting into practice. At rare moments in history some genius has lived a philosophy, or the livable implications of his thought have seeped over into one or more compartments of human life. But these are indeed rare moments and rare men. Masaryk is undoubtedly this phenomenon in our modern times. A trained and astute philosopher, the discipline was never to him an end in itself. He had studied closely and critically all the philosophical systems from Plato to those of his contemporaries. From each he learned; none did he accept slavishly. Each he tried to see as a step in the progress of humanity; each he felt free to analyse, criticize, and in part reject. Many he found wanting in consistency, in breadth, or in proper and scientific evaluation of human realities. Quite conscious of what he was doing, or rather refraining from doing, he built no philosophical system, in the manner of Spinoza, or Hegel, or even Comte whom he admired greatly. In histories of philosophy, which lean to elaborate descriptions of intricate systems of metaphysics, Masaryk will not occupy a large place. He had rejected that dubious honour quite willingly . . . Masaryk must be regarded as one of the pioneer sociologists. His first study, that on suicide as a social phenomenon, reached in to many aspects of social life, viewed historically and analytically, and showed the early breadth of his interests and observations. He later subjected current sociological thought to penetrating analysis. In his The Social Question (1898) he examined closely the thought of Marx, with whose interest in the welfare of the common man Masaryk was deeply sympathetic. But Masaryk found Marx’s basic thesis that the masses alone possess political rights and wisdom unacceptable. To Masaryk the individual is an end in himself. He may not be regarded as a means by any element in the social structure . . . Masaryk further criticized Marx’s dogma of a struggle between the classes—bourgeoisie against the proletariat— by insisting that it would not stand historical investigation. He points out that, properly speaking, the bourgeoisie does not really exist as a class any more than does the proletariat, but that both are composite, non-homogenous resultants, and resultants in flux at any given moment. Masaryk also differed sharply from Marx on the important matter of the ideal of labour. To Marx physical labour was a good in itself and hence the labouring class exemplified that ideal good. The labouring class was therefore the ideal class. It was not difficult to show that this formula oversimplified and in a degree falsified actuality. Masaryk observed that, so far as he had been able to see, the workers seldom work simply because they revere the ideal of labour. They work in order to live. It is philosophically as well as morally unsound to exalt a necessity reluctantly accepted into a categorical ideal. Labour is not an ultimate end; it is only a means. Ultimate aims are of a moral, not an economic, order . . . The Czech and Slovak peoples have a spiritual tradition which may be regarded as unique among the peoples of Europe, whether Slavic or non-Slavic. Whereas the heroes of most of the peoples of Europe are their great conquerors— Charlemagne, Napoleon, Frederick Barbarossa, Frederick the Great, Gustavus Adolphus, Peter the Great -— the heroes of the Czechs and Slovaks are men of sensitive heart and mind. Their greatest is John Hus, a religious reformer, a lover of the truth, or Chelcicky, a mystic and a pacifist, or Kollar, a poet who would fain have led his Slovak people to glory by the path of spiritual grandeur, or Palacky, the historian whose whole life was devoted to showing the Czech people that they had been great when they had been Christian, or Havlicek, a fervid and courageous journalist who taught his people to believe that they could regain their pristine greatness if they morally deserved it. This tradition was Masaryk's inspiration. He was proud to count himself its continuer. He continually urged the Czechs and Slovaks to reach out to claim that heritage . . . Through all his presentations and analyses there runs one dominant note, never at any time far from his thought, that “democracy is a complete outlook on the world and life, a special way of regarding the universe and life." Democracy was not restricted in its implications and applications to political structure and organization nor yet even to individual life. It was much broader, a whole culture in itself . . . It will certainly be objected that this is a pretty scheme and should certainly be committed to paper, but it is contrary to human nature and experience But one can hear Masaryk's answer to that without having to depend upon the imagination. There is first the actual republic of which he was the head. It had a scant twenty years of existence. Yet in that time, with the many faults of which Masaryk was perhaps more conscious than any other, it went farther toward the goals he set in his philosophy of life than any other state in our Western political history. We cannot in fairness demand more than that of a people. They were showing the real effectiveness of the ideal, proving, as good pupils, the rightness of their teacher’s precepts and justifying his faith in them. He set before them a goal, still distant at his death, but yet nearer than when he accepted the burden of leadership. It was the goal of a good society, based on equality, fraternal love and respect, and the Christian standard of justice and morality. This is what he meant when he gave as his testament to his people the short motto: “Jesus, not Caesar.” A few years before his death, he summed up his life’s work in a short paragraph, which should be carefully read and pondered in the light of his life, his struggles, his aims and ideals, and his achievements: You ask me what I consider as the culminating point of my life; I would say my election to the presidency and the fact that I am able to shoulder this burden as a great honour and an equally solemn duty. My personal satisfaction, if I may call it so, lies deeper.- for as head of the State I relinquish nothing that I believed in and loved as a penniless student, a carping critic, a reforming politician,- occupying a position of power, I do not seek for myself any other moral law or relationship to my fellow men, to the nation, and the world than those which guided me before. I may say that office confirms and completes everything that I have believed, so that I have not needed to change one item of my faith in humanity and in democracy, in the search for truth, nor in the supreme moral and religious command to love men. I can still affirm from experience which I am continually acquiring, that the same moral and ethical rule applies to the State, and those who administer it, as to the individual. This does not spring from satisfaction that through all my life, with its strange vicissitudes and changes, I have remained myself; it is more important that the human and social ideals which I confessed have endured and become acknowledged through all those trials. I can tell myself that in that incessant struggle for a better nation and people I was on the right side. That conviction is enough to make a man's life beautiful and happy.1 'Karel Capek, President Masaryk Tells His Story (New York, 1935), pp 301-2. 74 [pageend74]h drawing by Jaroslav Sejnoha MILADA HORÁKOVÁ BORN DECEMBER 25, 1901.

CARDINAL JOSEF BERAN By Josef Cermák There is nothing about him to catch your eye if you should meet him on the street. You would see a short, unassuming man with a kindly face and eyes which have witnessed much cruelty and sorrow. Unless he wore the cloth of his office you would hardly guess that you were meeting His Eminence Cardinal Josef Beran, the Archbishop of Prague. He might command our respect as one of the princes of the church. But then, not all of us share his faith and the dogmas of his church. It is also true that in these times of changing values titles and positions are no longer of first importance. There are, however, some things which most men still honour, such as courage and integrity of character. If that is the test of greatness, Cardinal Beran has met it. When the Nazis came, Josef Beran was teaching at the Theological Faculty of the Charles University in Prague. The Nazis came and with them came unspeakable terror. Josef Beran preached against tyranny and prayed for its victims. He was arested and spent 3 years in a Nazi concentration camp at Dachau. There, he was u good shepherd. As starved as his fellow prisoners, he divided his ration with them. As cold as the others, he gave his only blanket to an ill Italian prisoner. After the war he was installed as the Archbishop of Prague and soon thereafter fared his second test, this time the Cu 111111 u ri i s I s. In the February days of 1948 he issued a memorable proclamation in which he appealed to the Communists not to destroy the work of Thomas Masaryk and Dr. Benes and warned them of the consequences uf llieii ucliuns. On Mu k.Ii 14, 1948 he served solemn mass in Prague Cathedral at which the whole Communist cabinet, trying then to impress the Western world that nothing had happened, was present. However, Cardinal Beran had a proclamation posted on the door of the Cathedral which said that, although the Church cannot refuse anyone the right to ask for God’s help, it does not accept the philosophy of a party or movement which is contrary to the teachings of the Church. Immediately the Communist party started a violent campaign of terror against religion generally and the Catholic Church in particular. On June 19, 1949, the Archbishop preached again in the Cathedral. He commenced by declaring the Communist-inspired "Catholic Action” a fraud and assuring his listeners that he would never sign anything which was contrary to the teachings of his church and violated human rights. Communist groups, using amplifiers, disrupted his sermon. That was the last time the Archbishop preached in his country. He was deprived of his right to carry out the duties of his office and was practically imprisoned in his palace. In March, 1951, he was ordered to leave the Prague diocese and was interned in secrecy at various places. Only in 1963, apparently due to the intervention of President Kennedy and many other influential individuals and organizations was he released. On January 25, 1965 he was named Cardinal by Pope Paul VI. The following February he was allowed to ao to Rome for his installation, with the understanding that he would not be allowed to return to Czechoslovakia. And so Cardinal Beran became an exile. Some men yiuw billei in udveisily and others become arrogant with success. Cardinal Beran was cheerful during his dark days and humble when he reached the summit of his career. In his speech at the Ecumenical Council last year he said "so it seems to me that in my country the Catholic church is still suffering for what has been done in its name against the freedom of conscience as, for example, the burning of the priest Jan Hus in the 15th century or, in the 17th century, the forceful catholization of a large portion of the Czech nation. So history reminds us that we, at this Council, declare the principle of religious freedom and conscience in clear wards withant any qualifications which might be dictated by oportunism”. Indeed, an unusual man. A man, one might say, for all seasons. 75 [pageend75]1867 1 1967 HAPPY CENTENNIAL- CANADA MASARYK MEMORIAL INSTITUTE INC. TORONTO — ONTARIO [pageend76]CZECHOSLOVAK MUSIC By HELEN NOTZL THE DEVELOPMENT OF CZECHOSLOVAKIAN MUSIC Czechoslovakia has always been known for its wealth of extraordinarily beautiful folk songs—Czech, Moravian, Silesian and Slovak, all with their own distinctive styles. Music plays a vital part in the life of every Czechoslovakian. Dancing, singing and playing musical instruments are as much a part of life as eating, sleeping and working. This is a national characteristic, heritage passed down through the ages, not only through popular folk songs, but because music is an important element in the education of every child. The well-known slogan ‘Every Czech is a musician’ is indeed based on truth. Dr. Charles Burney (1726-1814), the great English music historian, reported during his travels through Bohemia-. “I had frequently been told that the Bohemians were . . . perhaps the most musical people of all Europe. I crossed the whole kingdom of Bohemia from south to north; and being very assiduous in my enquiries, how the common people learned music, I found out at length that not only in every large town, but in all villages where there is a reading and writing school, children of both sexes are taught music.” And further on: “I went into the school, which was full of children from six to ten or eleven years old who were reading, writing, playing on violins, hautbois, bassoons and other instruments.” It is easy to see how this early exposure to music 'engenders into every individual a love of music that [grows into a way of life. Yet up until the nineteenth century, there was reason to suspect that Czechs were merely good players or interpreters of the music of others, but not real, creative artists, for Czechoslovakia up to that time had not produced any indigenous composers of its own. But this lack was not due to any inferior artistic ability in the Czechs as was believed. When a nation is yacked with struggles for independence, religious turmoil and foreign occupation, the situation is not conducive to the development of great artists. In the nineteenth century an astounding transformation took place, as the relatively settled political conditions of the country enabled the latent musical talents of the Czech people to Emerge and to flourish. Under the guidance of Bedrich Smetana and his sue cessors, Czechoslovakia developed a unique musical culture of its own, correcting the world’s assessment and giving Csccholovakia its rightful place in the world of music. These men — Smetana, Antonin Dvorak, Leos Janaček and Bohuslav Martinu {there are of course many others, such as Z. Fibich, J. B. Booster, lz. Novak and J. Suk, but lack of space Helen Notzl is a graduate of Queen’s University restricts me to concentrating on the most prominent') — transformed Czechoslovakia’s exquisitely beautiful folk melodies into the universally appreciable form, of classical music; due to these composers, the world can now enjoy these melodies hitherto confined to the Czechoslovakians themselves. BEDRICH SMETANA (1824-1884) While music in the form of popular folk songs had always been an integral part of every Bohemian’s life, before Bedrich Smetana there had been no great native composers to put Bohemia on the musical map of the world. Smetana, the father of Czech music, devoted his life to the development of a national art; music assumed importance in Bohemia’s cultural life for the first time as a result of his work. Born in Litomysl, Bohemia in 1824, Smetana displayed musical talent from an early age, performing publicly as a pianist at the age of six. His formal training was taken in Prague under Josef Proksch. There was little scope for a musician in Bohemia 'at that time, and in 1850 Smetana went to Goteborg, Sweden, where he remained for five years, teaching music, playing the piano and conducting the city’s orchestra. In 1861, homesickness drove him back to his native Bohemia. On his return Smetana was caught up in the tide of an aroused national consciousness that had suddenly swept the country, proving most influential in his subsequent activities, as he worked with passionate dedication to develop the music culture of Ka- hemia. He directed the music school, and wrote criticisms in which he furthered the cause of Bohemian music; he founded and directed a dramatic school for the Bohemian Theutn in Prague and helped organize the Society of Artists. 77 [pageend77]In 1863 Smetana completed his first opera, The Brandenburgers in Bohemia. It was Bohemia’s first major national opera. It was extremely well received, for it echoed and glorified the prevailing national feeling. But this minor success was soon overshadowed when, in 1866, Smetana’s comic opera, The Bartered Bride, destined to become his world-famous masterpiece, was performed and was immediately a tremendous success. In this opera, Smetana’s approach to national music is best revealed. He violently opposed the amateurish concept that national music necessarily means a mere adaptation of folk songs. Smetana never used popular folk songs in his compositions — all his music was original. Nevertheless, his music somehow managed to capture the essence of the Czechoslovakian spirit, in both its delightful lightheartedness and in its tragedy. In World War II his serious opera Libuse, long accepted as a masterpiece, became the symbol and embodiment of Czech defiance of the German occupation. Smetana wrote eight operas in all, including Two Widows (1874). The Kiss (1876) and The Secret (1878), but the Bartered Bride remained his crowning operatic achievement and has been hailed all over the world. Smetana’s output, however, was by no means confined solely to operas but included a great deal of orchestra and chamber music, piano and voice composition. His outstanding achievement in this category was a cycle of tone poems collectively entitled My Country (Ma Vlast), among which is his most celebrated orchestral composition, The Moldau (Vltava). V. V. Zeleny describes My Country as “Smetana’s greatest poetic deed, as well as the proudest glorification with which an artistic spirit ever celebrated his country." Toward the end of his life tragedy struck the composer. He was to write the last three of his operas, the entire My Country cycle and two quartets in total deafness, and he died, in 1884, in an insane asylum, his breakdown precipitated by the severe criticisms levelled against his last opera, The Devil’s Wall. /is do so many artistic geniuses, he died in misery, lamenting that the world could not appreciate his work. Yet posterity has realized what a great debt it owes Smetana. While his international fame is not as widespread as that of a later Czech composer, Dvorak, owing to its strong ties with the singular Czechoslovakian spirit, Smetana as a great patriotic figure and as a composer is much more highly regarded in Czecho- slovkia than is Dvorak. Paul Stefan has called him ‘the hero of Czechoslovakian music, its founder, its architect and its guardian spirit.’ Smetana singlehandedly created Czechoslovakian opera, both comic and tragic, and Czech symphonic music, andHaid down a foundation for the development of typically Czech chamber music, piano and vocal composition. Smetana is the father of all Czechoslovakian composers who came after him and flourished in the musical culture he created. ANTONIN DVORAK (1841-1904) The name Antonin Dvorak is world-famous and needs little introduction. Dvorak has attained international popularity to a greater extent than Smetana, for his style, based more on the principles 'of classicism than Smetana’s compositions, can be enjoyed and understood by those not linked by nationalistic bonds to the Bohemian spirit. Yet Smetana’s influence on the young Dvorak was profound. Not only did Smetana create an atmosphere favourable for the emergence of Czechoslovakian musicians, but through personal contact and friendship between the two, encouraged Dvorak to develop a unique style by concentrating on Bohemian national music for his inspiration rather than German influences that resulted in the Wagnerian style found in Dvorak’s earlier work. It was Smetana who aroused Dvorak’s enthusiasm for Bohemian national music, an interest which was to culminate in Dvorak’s first success, Airs From Bohemia. But success did not come early or easily. Dvorak’s father insisted on his becoming an innkeeper to carry on the family tradition, and tried to educate him toward that end. Dvorak neglected his studies in favour of music; he simply had to study music. His father refused to sponsor his music education and Dvorak spent his youth in poverty and hunger. He studied at the Organ School in Prague, earning his meagre living by giving piano lessons. At the age of 18 he joined a concert band as a violinist. He was then transferred to the orchestra .of the Czechoslovakian Theatre where his earnings amounted to $50 a month. During this time he turned out a quantity of music, but only a few of these pieces were ever heard and he eventually destroyed most of them. It was then that Smetana’s crucial influence changed the course of Dvorak’s fortune. Airs P'rom Bohemia captured the attention of Brahms, who urged the Austrian Commission to award Dvorak a grant of $250 a year. He also encouraged Dvorak’s publisher to commission the composer to write a set of Slavonic dances analogous with Brahms’ own Hungarian Dances. The resulting Slavonic Dances and Rhapsodies were an outstanding success, and Dvorak’s reputation as one of Europe’s leading composers was solidly established. When in 1884 he apeared in London for three concerts devoted entirely to his compositions, he was given a tumultous ovation. The impoverished viola player of 1859 had indeed come a long way. Of his London success he wrote home. “Who could have thought that far across the sea in this enormous London, I should one day celebrate Triumphs such as few foreign artists have known. Everywhere they write and talk about me and say that I am the lion of this year’s musical season.” The star of fortune continued to shine on Dvorak. In 1892 he was invited as a world celebrity to fill the post of Director of the National Conservatory in New York, his acceptance of which proved most consequen- 78 [pageend78]tial, for it was in America that Dvorak wrote what was to become his most celebrated orchestral work, the Symphony No. 5 in E minor, more commonly known as the New World Symphony. In this classical symphony, Dvorak pays homage to America in the spirit of American folk songs, using the musical idioms of the American Indian, Negro spirituals, and the songs of the old settlers. Dvorak spent three years in the United States, teaching young composers and encouraging them to make use of their American heritage. His own output was considerable-, the American Quartet, Cello Concerto, and Biblical Songs, as well as the New World Symphony, were all written in America. However, his yearning for his native, land could not be long suppressed, and in 1895 Dvorak returned to Prague to resume his professorship at the Prague Conservatory where he remained until his death in 1904. His pupils at the Conservatory, the ‘Dvorak School’, have dominated Czech music for over 60 years. Dvorak’s contribution to music has been vast. In addition to those compositions already mentioned, he wrote eight symphonies, a large number of significant chamber music works, various concertos, several great oratorios, and many piano compositions including the popular Humoresque, op. 101, No. 7. Dvorak’s music is characterized by its exquisite melodic quality; it is romantic, filled with lyrical expressions of surpassing charm, infectious rhythms, sensitivity of feeling and unsophisticated freshness. His melodies have the immediate and inescapable appeal of folk songs, full of freedom and variety. Because Dvorak wrote from the heart, on themes that were close to his heart, the result was music that immediately captures the heart of every listener with its wealth of tenderness and beauty. LEOS JANAČEK (1854-1928) Leos Janaček was a musician of a totally unique variety. He was a violent non-conformist, virtually without predecessors and without successors, for his music is the result of several unprecedented influences, not the least of which was his own strikingly original personality. For over half his life-time, Janaček was unrecognized at home and completely unknown abroad. Then in 1916, when fie was 54, the long-awaited break-through came at last with the successful production in Prague of his opera ‘Jenufa’, a psychological drama of Moravian village life. Shortly afterward it was produced in Vienna where it was also enthusiastically received, and later in Berlin and in New York. Stimulated by this success, Janaček wrote in the last twelve years of his life five more operas, a sinfonieta, several chamber works, two piano concertos, a Slavonic Mass and many smaller works, including the rhapsody Taras Bulba. Several influences account for Jana- cek's unique style. He was the first Czechoslovakian composer born in Moravia, further east than Bohemia and possessing its own distinctive style of folk music. A second influence resulted from Jan- acek's visit to Russia in 1896. He was profoundly impressed by Russian music and grew to love it deeply. It is on account of this Russian strain discernible in his music that Janaček has often been called the ‘Mussorgsky of Moravia'. But Janacek’s own musical innovations accounted to a large extent for the originality of his compositions. He created his own musical system derived from folk elements in which melody and rhythm were patterned after the inflections and rhythms of speech, a system which Janaček termed ‘melodies of the language’. The world was reluctant to immediately accept this unorthodox musician, and recognition came slowly. In 1925 Janaček received an honorary degree from the University of Brno, and on his 70th birthday a complete cycle of his operas was performed in Brno. Then in 1930, two years after his death, an extensive cycle of his works was performed throughout Czechoslovakia. Juiiucek has now been dead fui fully years and his music is currently being discovered in one country after another. His fame is spreading steadily all over the world, especially in England and Germany. Perhaps the world at large is ready for this unconventional composer at last. Perhaps now, in an age v-b^n non-conformity has become the rule, the world will be able to look deeper into Janacek’s music, past its unorthodox nature, and realize its beauty and its unquestionable merit. 79 [pageend79]GLOBE & TRAVEL SERVICE ČEDOK COUNTRYMEN’S TRAVEL BUREAU MARTIN DUDÁK 179 ST.

But we should realize that Ibsen is almost the only author from one of the small nations of Europe who has joined the pantheon of the permanently great writers of Europe, and he, I have the impression, is losing somewhat in stature. Who except specialists or people with personal associations, knows anything about Dutch, Hungarian, Portuguese, Modern Greek, Esthonian, Latvian, Lithuanian Finnish and Rumanian literature? Among Czechs John Hus, John Amos Comenius and Thomas Masaryk are names known and honored in the West, but they are hardly known as writers. Only two Czech authors in the twentieth century have penetrated abroad; Karel Capek, whose plays R.U.R. and The Insect Play fitted into the post-World War I polemic against technology and collective fanaticism and Jaroslav Hasek's Good Soldier Svejk, a modernized version of the wise fool or of Sancho Panza: the do-nothing passive resister against the horrors of bureaucracy and war. Occasionally and ignorantly Franz Kafka is considered a Czech writer, as he comes from Prague and bears a Czech name Kavka means “jackdaw” in Czech). But of course he wrote only in German, and what seems Slavic in him is due rather to the influence of great Russian novelists: to Gogol, Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, rather than to anything he might have known of Czech literature. I remember when I was first in the United States I read an article in New York Herald Tribune Books (January 27, 1929, by E. Lengyel) — not an unfrindly one — which assumed that Czech literature dates only from the establishment of the independent nation in 1918, or that, at most, some feeble attempts had been made to write in Czech a few decades before. I wrote the Tribune an indignant letter (February 10, 1929), for in the case of Czech literature the idea of its novelty is particularly distressing. Actually, Czech literature is the oldest among Slavic literatures (if we except Old Slavic) and can compare in age with almost any of the major and minor literatures of medieval Europe. It can stand comparison with Middle English llleraluie. The Old Czech and the Middle English literary languages were established about the same time: in the Rein' 'Wellek is Sterility Prufexxor (Comp. Lit.). Yale Unirerxity late 13th and early 14th centuries. Old Czech literature in the later 14th century has all genres developed in full: the long chivalric romance the rhymed chronicle, the versified saint’s legend. There is a rich courtly love lyric in Czech; verse satires, verse debates, didactic poems and even liturgical plays have survived: among them the remarkable Perfumeseller (Unguentarius), which is rather a farce in tone and style. There are, besides, the enormous versified encyclopedias of Master Klaret, which cannot be paralleled in any other vernacular except Italian. The development of Czech prose in the 14th century is equally astonishing. There was a legal and historical literature, chronicles, legends, and a dialogue, The Weaver, composed in a sophisticated rhetorical style. Thomas of Stitne wrote on theological and mystical themes in Czech in an elaborate terminology. And later Hus and his precursors debated, in Czech and Latin, all questions of life and death, church and society. There is nothing similar in the medieval phases of the other Slavic literatures. Poland had no independent literature to speak of before the sixteenth century. The first Czech book was printed in Plzen (Pilsen) in 1468, while the first English book — incidentally the same popular Chronicle of the Trojan War — was printed in Bruges in 1475, and only in the following year William Caxton opened his printing shop at Westminster. The first Polish book dates from 1521, the first Russian from 1564 — almost a hundred years after the first Czech book. The Hussite wars brought an interruption of the literary tradition in Bohemia: its great medieval civilization was destroyed, as it was destroyed in England and France during the long wars of the 15th century. But then came the difference: while in France and England the Renaissance period created a great literature which became classical for these nations, the Czechs did not have a Renaissance proper; like the Germans, they were absorbed by the religious question. We cannot understand the old Czechs if we do not recognize that for centuries they were literally obsessed by the religious issue. In the nineteenth century and today under Communism, attempts have been made to explain the Czech reliqious movement, Hussitism and the Bohemian Brethren by social and national motives alone, but such explanations obscure its reliqious substance by an emphasis on peripheral and sec nndary phenomena. Czech Humanism in the sixteenth century had only feeble artistic ambitions and successes; it was if not religious, moralistic, didatic, or just learnedly formalistic. There was nothing in Bohemia comparable to the shortlived Renaissance in Poland and Dalmatia. Thus, paradoxically, Czech literature (in the sense of imaginative literature, of poetry and fiction) flourished again only after the Battle of the White Mountain (1620), when the nation lost its independence and even had to struggle painfully for its preservation. Hardly any secular verse had been composed between the Hussite revolt and the Thirty Years’ War. Most of what has been preserved are translations and imitations which dimly reflect the great Renaissance art of Italy, France and England. There was hardly any Czech drama or fiction. I don’t want to minimize the terrible national, political, social and intellectual catastrophe of the Thirty Years' War and its consequences — the emigration, the decline of the Czech nation. But precisely during this “Dark Age" a new Czech poetry was created: the Czech folk song and ballad composed in the 17th and 18th centuries, the centuries of the Counter-Reformation. Baroque poetry largely composed by priests belongs to the same time. About thirty years ago a group of scholars rediscovered this rich literature, which had been either unknown or neglected because if was Roman Catholic in temper and linguistically belonged to a tradition repudiated by the Czechs in the 19th century. It used a diction which was permeated with Latin and German words: a usage which to later times, insistent on pure Czech, sounded barbarous. Besides, the Czech Baroque often ran counter to the taste of the 19th century, which disapproved of its complex metaphors and the paradoxical feelings about life and death. Christmas plays, saints’ legends, pastoral poems, ornate sermons were edited in the period between the two wars, and some religious verse was reprinted, such as Bedrich Bridel’s What is God? What is Man? (1658) and the anonymous On the Four Last Matters of Man (1697), which express the horror of death, the vanity of human wishes and a trust in salvation in sublime tones which had been entirely lacking in earlier Czech verse. One must admit that this civilization, which was not only literary, but creative mainlv in music and the plastic arts, had its narrow limits. The Czechs lived as if in a stagnant backwater of peasant Catholic Europe. There was no trace of th« intellectual excitement of contemporary England and France. Just as the Hussite wars destroyer! Czech medieval civilization, so the Enlightenment and the French Revolution 81 [pageend81]destroyed the civilization of the Baroque. Literary tradition was again interrupted. We cannot deny that the leaders of the Czech National Revival were no poets; Dobrovsky was a philologist, Jungmann was a lexicographer and learned translator, Palacky was a historian, Havlicek was a journalist and witty versifier — even Kollar was a poet only intermittently, and his verse is didactic, erudite, contrived. Only in Macha did a really great poet arise: he created a poetic diction and style and made Czech verse melodious and complex. After Macha died, aged 26, in 1836, Czech literature developed without interruption of its tradition step by step in unison with the main European literatures. After romanticism came realism, naturalism, symbolism and all the diverse kinds of modernism. There is truth in Saida’s saying that Czech literature lives from foreign blood, but what literature does not, and especially what small literature does not live by it? Czech literature must not be judged by the success of translations into foreign languages, particularly if we realize that in the 19th century it did not produce a school of novelists comparable to the French, the Russians, the English and even the Americans. The Czechs lacked the stratified society of the English and Russians; they lacked a metropolis such as Paris. They rather cultivated the idyllic peasant novel, which will always remain local, though at least one 19th century book, The Grandmother (1855), by Bo- zena Nemcova, is a beloved and refined work of art. Besides, the Czechs cultivated the historical novel, which necessarily appeals to feelings of patriotism and local pride, and rarely can overcome its provincial limitation. But literature, any literature, is not the worse for being tied to its language. Ideas migrate all over the world, but poetry rarely crosses linguistic frontiers — even the poetry of the major nations. I wonder whether one can speak of a real understanding of the lyrics of Keats or G.M. Hopkins outside of the English- speaking world, or those of Goethe and Holderlin outside the German-speaking world, and similarly with other nations (always specialists excepted). The Czechs rightly cherish their great tradition of lyrical poetry since Macha: Erben,Neruda, Vrchlicky, Brezina, Sova, Hora, Seifert, Halas, etc. not because their poems can be translated and exported, but because in this poetry a whole world, a whole great structure of feelings and shades of feeling has been created which speaks to all Czechs and all those who know the language. It is, unfortunately, closed to others, just as none of us who does not know the originals can ever properly appreciate and enjoy the great poets of other nations. Only in very rare cases — mostly with epic and dramatic poets — have translations overcome linguistic barriers; but even such narrative poems as Push- 82 kin’s Onegin or Mickiewicz’s Pan Tadeusz fall flat in English translation, and the two translations of Macha’s May (one by Roderick A. Ginsburg, Chicago, 1932, the other by Hugh Hamilton Mc- Governe, London, 1949) can convey something of the old fashioned plot and the technique of composition, but hardly anything of its poetic quality, its sound patterns, the peculiar diction and syntax, the general aura. May in English is simply not an English poem. Admitting the almost unsurmount- able obstacles to a proper study of Czech literature through translation, we can, I think, show the interest of Czech literature for the outside in another way: we must see it as a literature at the crossroads of Europe, in its specific geographical and historical place, as an example of large general problems of literary and cultural history and of the situation of a small literature located between West and East, North and South, exemplifying the conflict between nationality and cosmopolitanism, universality and particularity in an almost model purity. The geographical situation of the Czech nation surrounded on three sides by German-speaking neighbors, the political dependence (more or less close) during many periods of its history on the Holy Roman Empire, and later on its successor, the Austrian Empire, suggests that Czech literature was mainly influenced by German literary and cultural developments. It would be folly to deny the impact of German civilization, especially in view of the influx of German colonists in the 13th century, again during the Reformation in the 16th century, and still later again during the Enlightenment and the Romantic Age. Around the turn of the 18th and 19th century German nationalism, German worship of folklore and popular poetry provided an important stimulus to the Czech Revival, as Herder, who had prophesied the great future of the Slavs and glorified their peaceful past, and Goethe, who late in his life learned even a little Czech, loomed extremely large on the literary horizon of the time. But it would be an error to think that Czech literature did not develop in its own independent way, often in explicit opposition to German literature, and that the Czechs did not seek and find ways of establishing contacts with the other European literatures, sometimes, at least at first, through German intermediaries. Their role must not be minimized, as the Germans themselves have absorbed, interpreted and translated foreign literature possibly more than any other major nation. To give examples from Czech 18th and 19th century literature, the first translations, in the late 18th century, of Shakespeare into Czech were from German; Macha read Byron first in German and then in Polish translations; Havlicek translated Voltaire's philosophical tales from German: and Vrchlicky, as Professor William on your Centennial MARIANOPOLIS ASSURANCES Dr. JOSEF KOTRLÝ 4676 VICTORIA AVENUE MONTREAL Tel. 484-9881 [pageend82]Compliment to LITTLE MARKET JIRÍ a LIDA MA1SNEROVI 132 BLOOR STREET WEST BRITANICA HOUSE - COLLONADE A. Harkins has shown, translated Walt Whitman first from German. Even the medieval Czechs were in constant relations with the more distant West and bouth; and the influence of general Latin civilization—ecclesiastical, erudite, didactic — was sronger than anything that could be considered specifically German. It would be difficult to adjudge the exact share of the main nations in this general European Latin civilization, but, for instance, the immediate source of the Czech Alexandreis, a Latin poem by Gualterus Castillionis, was the work of a native of Lille. “Kunhuta's Song”, one of the earliest and finest Czech poems, dating from about 1310, uses the sequences of Saint Thomas Aquinas, who comes from the environment of Naples: Thomas of Stitne translated Saint Bonaventure and Hugh of St. Victor, an Italian and a Frenchman both active at the University of Paris. Czech courtly love poetry, which ultimately must be derived from the troubadours in Provence, came to Bohemia via Italy and Austria through the early Minnesang, but even here there were direct contacts with Italian vernacular literature: the ‘Song of Zavis”, as Vaclav Cerny has shown, was composed by a Czech canon who studied at the University of Padua. The poem shows a knowledge of Italian poetry of the so-called dolce stil nuovo — the style of the precursors and contemporaries of Dante. Immediately after the Hussite Wars, the son of the King of Bohemia, Hynek of Podebrady, translated parts of Boccaccio's Decameron into Czech. But in spite of these foreign influences, Czech poetic diction, Czech metrics and Czech terminology during the Middle Ages were strikingly different from analogous developments in Germany and in the West. The linguistic peculiarities enforced a different prosody, diction and terminology, which can be explained only by the tradition of popular poetry common to the Slavic nations. Recognition of the great flowering of Czech literature in the 14th century, of its historical and documentary value, •ven its occasional aesthetic charm must not allow us to forget its limitations: the Czechs did not produce a great medieval poet such as Dante, Chaucer, Villon or Walter von der Vogelweide, who still speak to our time. There was no great oral poetry, which flourished in Yugoslavia, Russia, Iceland and Spain, just because Bohemia had become for a «hart period the cantor of a brillian court, of a feudal and ecclestiastical culture. The forged MSS of the early 19th century tried to create an illusion of a faraway romantic Czech antiquity and thus for many decades prevented a proper understanding and appreciation of the genuine old Czech literature. The same process of reaching out beyond the immediate surrounding German sea is also a leitmotif of the Czech literary revival early in the 19th century. The literary nationalismm ot the Romantic age did not preclude a concept of universal poetry. On the contrary, Herder’s concept of folk poetry assumed a universal, basically similar “nuluiul" poetry of all nations, as opposed to the artificial Latin and French tradition. The Czechs fully shared in this romantic universalism. Jungmann translated Milton's Paradise Lost and Chateaubriand's Atala, as well as Goethe's Hermann und Dorothea. Shakespeare became the Idolized god of the drama. Petrarch and Dante provided formal and thematic inspiration for Kollar's great cycle of sonnets. The Daughter of Slava; Macpherson’s Ossian combined with the imitation of Yugoslav and Russian folk epics to produce the style of the forged MSS. Even the old Czechs were acutely conscious of their kinship with the other Slavs. Roman Jakobson (in Moudrost starých Cechu, The Wisdom of the Old Czechs, New York, 1943) collected many violently anti-German passages from the 13th and 14th centuries which show not only local patriotism on a geographical basis — which we are often told was the only older form of nationalism — but also many expressions of Slavic racial pride. Still, literary contacts with the other Slavic nations were very scant before the late 18th century. It was largely a one-way street: Czech influences were strong in Poland during the 15th and 16th centuries, particularly on the development of the Polish literary language. But during the Romantic age the picture changed with the discovery of the Yugoslav epics and the Russian heroic songs. With the simultaneous rise of Russian and Polish literature, strong influences on Czech literature come for the first time from the East. We must not forget that for a time the illusion prevailed that there is a single Slavic language and that Czech is only a dialect. Russian and Polish words were imported wholesale, and the influence of Russian and Polish romantic poetry became marked: Pushkin and Lermontov, Mickiewicz and Slowacki had many devotees in Bohemia. But it seems a gross exaggeration to assert, as Professor Mukarovsky did, that "Russian influence on Czech literature was greater than that of all other literatures combined”. This assertion, prompted by political considerations, is refuted merely by the fact that no Russian literary influence can be discerned before the 19th century. The influence of Pushkin and Lermon- fuv wus liuidly piufuund und hardly concerned the major poets of the 19rh century. The influence of the great Russian realist novelists came late and was comparatively feeble. I know that Hav- licek translated Gogol, and that later Turgenev, Tolstoy and Dostoevsky were widely read and intensely admired, but the actual influence on writers of any significance was small, at least in the early stages of the Czech novel. The 19th century Czech novel belonged to differ- 83 [pageend83]ent traditions: it was either the historical novel, and thus dominated by the model of Walter Scott, or the peasant novel, which was rather influenced by George Sand and the now forgotten Bertold Auerbach. Turgenev must have influenced Bozena Nemcova, though I have not seen any study of the relationship. The master of the rising Slovak novel, Svetozar Hurban Vojansky modeled himself on Turgenev. But Tolstoy’s influence can be felt only very late, possibly in Ivan Olbracht, while Doestoevsky seemed to have colored the tone of naturalist novelists such as K. M. Capek-Chod (not to be confused with Karel Capek) and Ki Slejhar. Dostoevsky was Masaryk's life-long preoccupation. He served as a kind of touchstone on which he whetted his ideas about Russia. His great work, Russia and Europe translated into English as The Spirit of Russia) was to culminate in a third volume on Dostoevsky, of which only fragments have been preserved. They will at last be published under the editorship of Professor George Gibian of Cornell University. But Masaryk of course felt Dostoevsky rather as a great adversary, a mystic, a conservative who stood against his religious rationalism and political liberalism. But France and Italy became, in the history of Czech 19th century literature, the decisive liberators from German dominance. Neruda and his generation were still mainly under the influence of German poetry, mostly Goethe and Heine. Jaroslav Vrchlicky had the good fortune of becoming tutor in an Italian family in 1875-76, and there he caught his enthusiasm for Carducci, Dante and Italian literature in general. It passes belief when we think of the extent of Vrchlicky's translations. They include the whole of Dante's Divine Comedy in terza rima, all of Ariosto and Tasso in ottava rima, much of Calderon, practically all of Hugo, Vigny, Lamartine, Baudelaire, etc. Vrchlicky represents something like an analogue to Hugo, Carducci and Tennyson combined: he wrote in all styles, on all subjects, with dazzling virtuosity, though today we feel that his over-production and haste seduced him often into derivative work. Many of his translations are shoddy and inaccurate. Still, Vrchlicky achieved what he wanted. He broke the German dominance in Czech poetry. The Czechs were inundated with the flood of French and Italian poetry. "Inundated” seems the right word. Many of Vrchlicky’s successors were mere imitators and for a time, Paris became the cynosure of all Czech poets’ eyes. Baudelaire, Verlaine, Verhaeren, and later Apollinaire determined the general development of Czech poetry right up to the eve of the second World War. Nez- val, a somewhat irresponsible virtuoso, sounds often like Apollinaire and freely acknowledged him the "god of modern poetry”. Karel Capek early in his career (1920) published a brilliant collection of translations from modern French poetry. The impact of the French realistic and naturalistic novel came a little later. Zola in particular was widely influential around the turn of the century. K. M. Capek-Chod is, in intention, the Zola of the Czech bourgeoisie, and vaguely naturalistic assumptions underlie much of the social novel between the two world wars. But possibly even more important was the influence of French criticism. F. X. Saida, the greatest Czech critic, began as an expounder of Hennequin and Taine before he elaborated his own personal view of literature. He was a great portraitist and essayist in the wake of Sainte-Beuve before he became a severe judge of Czech literature who immeasurably widened the perspectives of criticism and raised its level far beyond its earlier provincial limitations. While France attracted the sympathies of most intellectual Czechs, England and America, though further removed geographically and in accessibility, also exercised a great influence on the revival of Czech literature in the 19th century. I have alluded to the cult of Scott and Shakespeare. Byronism, in different versions, German, Russian and Polish, was a main strand in Czech 19th century poetry. In the second half of the 19th century, direct contacts with the English- speaking world were established. The fine poet, J. V. Sladek, spent three crucial years (1868-70) in the United States. They have been studied very carefully by Professor Rudolf Sturm of Skidmore College. Sladek brought an excellent knowledge of English back with him, which allowed him to translate almost the whole of Shakespeare, much of Burns and Coleridge, as well as Longfellow's Hiawatha. Vrchlicky, a friend of his, translated also from English: Shakespeare’s Sonnets, Shelley’s Prometheus Unbound, and many poems by Shelley, Byron, Swinburne and others. But Julius Zeyer is to my mind the one Czech poet who is stylistically and spiritually nearest to the English, or rather to one strand in English 19th century poetry. Zeyer can be described as a Czech Preraphaelite. Much of his narrative verse reminds one of William Morris. There are even poems by Zeyer, such as Ossian’s Return and The Chronicle of St. Brandan, which could figure among the productions of the Irish Renaissance. The nature of the English and American influence changed in the 20th century. The old, basically romantic, tradition receded into comparative oblivion. Among poets, surely Walt Whitman was the most influential. Petr Bezruc, in his Silesian Songs' (1903), writes his free verse and wears the mask of the bard of democracy. But more importantly than English poetry, English prose affected the writers between the two world wars profoundly. Karel Capek wrote a thesis on Pragma- INTERNATIONAL AGENCY SERVICE MONEY MEDICINES GIFT PARCELS INTERNATIONAL AGENCY TRAVEL SERVICE ES) TELEPHONE: 537-3131 519 BLOOR ST. W. 84 [pageend84]tism, and his science fiction and sophisticated detective stories are modeled on H. G. Wells and G. K. Chesterton, there is something kindred to the Anglo-Saxon temperament in Karel Capek: something empirical, cheerful, optimistic, even ob- strusively optimistic. The Letters from England (1924) show his slightly baffled sympathy with the English people and their habits, but the affinity is deeper than the little book suggests. But of course Capek knew not only English literature, but also Pirandello and Anatole France and Gide. He and almost every recent Czech author illustrates the thesis of this paper: the openness toward the world, the situation at the center, the enclosure among the Germans, the deliberate attempts to reach beyond it, mainly to France and England; the peculiar combination of independence and grateful adaptation achieved in Czech literature. All great literatures have nourished Czech literature; but every one was subjected to a selection, to a choice and sometimes even a narrow choice and something new, local and of the soil was added. Cosmopolitanism struggled with nationality, but neither could or can ever win: a nation which merely imitated would be sterile, a nation which refused to borrow would be inbred, stunted. Czech literature is neither. A history of Czech literature could be written i* terms of these influences I have sketched, of these vacillations between cosmopolitanism and nationalism. The same could be said, with com«> rhanges of emphasis, of most other literatures. We simply cannot escape the fact that Czech literature is part of literature as a whole and particularly part of Western literature, which includes the great Russian writers of the 19th century. During the Counter Reformation an attempt was made to isolate the Czechs culturally, to protect them from the winds of the doctrine blowing from Western Europe and the attempt was successful for a long time. Today, in totally changed circumstances, a similar attempt is being made by the Communists, who have put Czechoslovakia behind the Iron Curtain. The country is of curse still open to Russian influences .and the socialist Realism is the official doctrine in literature and the arts. But the break with the West has been extravagantly sharp. Professor George Pistorius, now at Williams College, described in a careful monograph, Destin de la Culture Francoise dans une democratic populaire (Paris, 1957), how French cultural influence in Czechoslovakia was systematically destroyed after 1948; how the French Institute was closed, the Alliance Frangaise dissolved, the number of translations from French reduced radically, how French literature was reinterpreted in Marxist terms, could easily be written about the artificially induced decline of English and American influence. But the hunger for fare from the West persists. I remember that in 1957 people bought up the 20,000 copies of a translation of Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea in a few days, and that with almost pathetic eagerness anything was welcomed that was a sign of life in the West. The present artificial isolation of the Czechs cannot last. Even the Communist members of the Czechoslovak Association of Writers complain that they can get Western books only via Moscow. Czech literature will and must reassert its position as part of Western literature in lively exchange with the East. The image of a bridge is, however, misleading, as a bridge is a place of transit. Western influences will not travel east via Czechoslovakia or vice versa. Rather, we must think of Czech literature as being a center, a workshop in the middle, into which influences stream from all sides: north and south, east and west. Bohemia is still the heart of Europe. The heart pulsates and throbs, nourished with blood brought from all parts of the body, just as Czech literature has thrived on the influx coming from all directions. The attempt to allow only the influx from the East must fail. Czech literature will again be, as it was for centuries, at the crossroads of Europe.

Slovak dialects closely related to Czech but with a distinct identity of their own existed from the early middle ages, as surviving ballads and folk songs reveal, but up until the 18th Century there was no systematic attempt to establish an individual literary language. After the Hungarian conquest of Slovakia in the early 9th Century there were no traces at all of the use of a written Slovakian language for some centuries. In the 10th Century, Slovaks wrote in Latin as did other central European peoples. Then followed the Hussite movement, and due to its far- reaching influence the literary language was Czech. It was not until the middle of the 18th Century that a systemaic attempt was made to establish a written Slovakian language. During this era of reviving national consciousness, Anton Bernolak was the man who brought about this much-needed reform. In his grammar and dictionary, Bernolak codified a language based on western Slovakian cultivated usage, which was immediately taken up by numerous writers, pre-emminent among whom was Jan Holly, whose lyrics, idylls and national epics were in the language and orthography of Bernolak. However, Bernolak’s language was not accepted by the Protestants of Slovakia, who used Czech as their liturgical language. By the 1840’s, Slovak national feeling was so strong among the Catholic majority that they refused to accept Czech as their written language, and a third unifying language acceptable to both groups was needed. The time was ripe for the innovations of Ludevit Stur (1 815-1856). A brilliant linguist and an ardent patriot, Stur codified a new form of literary Slovak based on the central rather than the western dialects. The Slovak reading public soon adopted this language which is basically similar to that which is in use today. A large school of poets developed under Stur, the most significant of which were Andrej Sladkovic (1820-72), whose Marina is a national epic analogous with Pushkin's Onegin; Chalupka (1812-83), and Janko Kral (1822-76), the greatest poet of this time, whose hollnrls, epics and lyrics are amonq the most original products of Slovak romanticism. In the field of drama, the first Slovak playwright of note was Jan Chalupka (1791-1871), who, however, wroto in Czech. Jan Palarik was the first drama- lisl lu use ihe new Slovak literary Ian guage. His ironic comedies were of high literary merit; in mood and in subject matter they echo the Slovak society of his time. The novel was the last gendre to be established in the new language, its major exponent being Martin Kukucin (or Matej Bencur), a novelist or dramatist of unusual talent whose books vividly por- Irayed life on the Dalmation Coast as he experienced it. After 1918 Slovakian literature had truly come of age. Its chief strength continued to be found on the lyric, due mainly to Hviezdoslav, a lyric poet of the highest order. Slovak literature followed the general tendencies of Europe while retaini ng its own individual flavour. In contemporary trends, Slovak literature has kept abreast with the world in all the phases from romanticism to Dada and surrealism. This is no slight achievement for a literary language that is only one hundred and twenty years old. It provides undeniable proof of the vitality and creativity of the Slovak nation that despite its youth, Slovak literature has equalled and in some cases overtaken the literary level of other small nations. Of the Realistic School, the two best examples of outstanding Slovak writers are Kalenciak, whose novel Restauracia, or The Restaurant, foreshadowed the development of the large Realist School both inside and outside of Slovakia, and Pavel Orszagh, or Hviezdoslav, the greatest of all Slovak poets. Through his vast output, Hviedoslav enriched significantly the Slovak language, not only with his original work but also with a series of excellent translations from English, including many Shakespearian plays; Russian (e.g. Pushkin), German, (Goethe, Schiller) and Hungarian. Hviezdoslav was basically an idealist, but his epic poems reveal a strong realist tendency. Realism remained the main literary trend in the novel. In the post World War I era, Milo Urban (1904- ), with his vast chronicle of 20th Century Slovakia and Bo- zena Slancikova, pseudonym Timrava (1867-1951) are the major exponents of realism in the novel. In poetry, however, Symbolism was the vessel which brought forward Slovakia’s most illustrious modern poet, Jan Botto, (1829-1881), pseudonym Ivan Krasko, whose two volumes of verses are among the finest achievements in Slovak literature and whose forceful and moving epic, The Death of janosik, bears the Strong Stamp of Slavonic Romantic poetry. Later, the most noteworhy names in Slovak Symbolist poetry were Martin Razus (1888-1937), Janko Jesensky I 18/3-194) and Vladimir Roy. While it echoed and contributed to world-wide literary trends, Slovak literature from the beginning was individualistic in its strong nationalistic tendencies, exalting the ideals of fredom and inde- By HELEN NOTZL pendence. A central theme was the glorification of Janosik, the Slovakian Robin Hood, who became the symbol of freedom and a crusader for liberty against foreign dominance. In Sladkovic, Botto and Kral the national revival received its most idealistic expression. After the first World War, political interests dominated the literature of Slovakia, outweighing universal literary trends. Milo Urban, the most eminent Slovak novelist of this era, echoed this national feeling, manifesting strong separatist views. During the war, prominent Slovak literary figures were active in the fight against Communism. Outstanding in this group are Joseph Gregor, pseudonym Ta- jovsky, a novelis and dramatist, and Janko Jesensky, a novelist and poet, whose revolutionary verses cried out to the world the feelings of the Czechoslovakian legions in Siberia. During the Second World War, Jesensky, living at home in Bratislava, made himself heard again as he fought against the Nazis and condemned Slovak totalitarian tendencies in his political satirical verses which managed to get through to Paris and London to be broadcast on the BBC program “The Voice of Free Czechoslovakia”. J. Slavik in his article on the poetry of this resistence movement, states that Jesensky “grew in this new fight for freedom into a bard such as no other nation had In this struggle. Janko Jesensky became the Slovak conscience and no one carried the title of Poet Laureate with such great auhority". The present situation is less encouraging, as few Slovak writers have gained the foreground. Of those who remain at home, most are true to their national heritage; many refuse to publish, for they cannot with free conscience write what they do not believe, the only thing that is allowed and their works are forbidden and thus they are forced to write secretly, unpublished. Through them the revolt against oppression of the free mind and free self-expression is perpetuated. Communist Slovakia has failed to produce outstanding poets. F. Votruba, a distinguished critic and historian of Slovak literature deplores the literary productions of Communist Slovakia as immature, overexpressed and absolutely lacking in sensitivity. Although a few promising novels were published in the last five years, a radical improvement can only come about with a complete change in the political situation if Slovakia is to produce poets, dramatists and novelists to carry on the literary tradition it had so successfully established before Communism brought it to an abrupt standstill. 87 [pageend87]AVEBLA Limited 51 COMSTOCK ROAD SCARBOROUGH, ONT. COMPLIMENTS OF MARY and JAN SHOES 1484 QUEEN STREET WEST MAAROVI [pageend88]CZECHOSLOVAK FILM By Helen Notzl Who is the hottest name currently making the scene in the international film industry? Why Milos Forman, a Czech director whose production Loves of a Blonde is being acclaimed all over North America as the critics’ darling and one of the greatest box-office successes of the year. Czechoslovakian films have suddenly invaded the international culture scene, last year with the Best Foreign Film Oscar-winning Shop on Main Street, directed by Jan Kadar, and this year with Loves of a Blonde, which won the French Academy Award as Best Foreign Film and is a strong contender for the American Oscar in the same category. How does one explain this sudden blossoming of Czechoslovakian movies? Up until the past two years the art movie world was dominated by Swedish, French and Italian films. Now out of nowhere come these Czechoslovakians winning the honours away from those countries who appeared to have established a monopoly on excellent art films. The Czechoslovakians could not be held back for long. Until very recently the strong Stalinist influence with its concentration and glorification of farming and industry extended into every phase of life, stiffling the creativity of Czechoslovakian artists, paricularly film makers. Documentaries on mushrooms and landscapes and Woman Meets Tractor romances provided little opportunity for imaginative directors. There was a disinclination on the part of the censors to encourage any sort of human study — anything but people and faces was the order of the day. In 1961 the pressure slowly began to diminish, and two directors in particular have taken advantage of the slightly wider scope available to them. It was Jan Kadar who first opened up Canadian and American art movie houses to Czechoslovakian imports. After being bailed fiuni film-making for two years because of a film called Three Wishes which satirized bureaucracy — Heaven forbid!—Kadar tried again, and this time succeeded in creating a film which was allowed to emigrate; it was a smashing success throughout the Western world. Shop on Main Street alerted the critics and the public to expect great things from Czechoslovakian dlrecfuis, and great things did indeed follow in the form of Milos Forman’s Loves of a Blonde. Milos Forman, who is J'l years of age, has been called “the hottest young director in Europe”. A graduate of the Prague Film Faculty, he was forced to lie low for six years until the Stalinist ideology blew over, and then took a job as production assistant at Barrandov, the best known studio of the Czech film industry. He soon impressed his superiors wih his exceptional talent for directing and his keen eye for depth in photography. He became a full-fledged director, and Loves of a Blonde was the result. While Kadar's forte is emotional impact, rough, startling and brutal, Forman’s is depth through simplicity. Forman's number one rule is spontanaiety. He often uses amateurs, who after being instructed on a few lines necessary to the plot, are told to carry the scene ad lib. The result is a delightful, whimsical simplicity which nevertheless achieves an astonishing and illusive depth. Minute details build up solid characterization and we are given a subtle insight into life as Forman sees it. His creed is that no camera trick or obvious technique should intrude; no zooming camera, no time reversals, merely a logical and life-like progression from incident to incident. But his camera, catching every significant look and gesture and loading it with meaning, creates a far more striking and masterful effect than the most novel, unusual techniques. At present, Forman is conferring with Italy’s Carlo Ponti, whom he met at the New York premiere of Loves of a Blonde, and the two are planning to combine forces for their next film. Jan Kadar provides a distinct contrast with Forman. The subject matter of his film is much more serious and meaningful as he concentrates on exposing the terrors of Ilie Nazi occupation. He cxploroc greed, cruelty, fear and degradation. His aim is to shock his audience into numb realization. His skillful camera-work, his startling contrasts between misty dreamworld and harsh reality and his superb charucleiizuliuii creole a shocking ex pose of a sordid world in which even the qnod men are forced into evil through fear and desperation. These two directors, so diverse and yet both extraordinarily brilliant, lead us to anticipate great things from our Czechoslovakian film-makers. Inevitably, however, there arises the question concerning the limitations imposed on artists behind the Iron Curtain —Yes, Pierre, despite your incredible nalvele, Ilie huu Curtain docs exist, ovon though those responsible for it take every opportunity to employ dupes like yourself to proclaim to the world that it has virtually vanished. The art film is an intellectual medium, and the most powerful films in this category deal with the exploration of ideas. This is where artists in Communist countries encounter a considerable stumbling block. The ideas they may explore must be absolutely non-political (as is Loves of a Blonde), or they must extoll the virtues of Communist politics or condemn any others (as does Shop on Main Street). To an artist, freedom of expression is more than a right; it is a necessity, a way of life. To work at full capacity, an artist must be free to express himself, to materialize his thoughts and his beliefs. If they happen to differ with the prescribed beliefs, the artist will find his creativity stunted, his self-expression frustrated. Speculations on life and its meaning, and studies of attitudes toward different ways of life will always be delicate subjects, for questioning the Communist way of life and considering favourably any other is strongly discouraged, to put it mildly. While non-Communist country movie makers are free to explore all facets of existence—religion, society, government, authority, bureaucracy, freedom or what they will, those living in Communist countries such as Czechoslova kia will have to be content to deal with non-political subjects and philosophies that adhere shiclly lo Ihe Communist ideology. We cun only hope that Kadar and Forman, and others like them as yet undiscovered, will again rise above this severe handicap and continue to produce their award-winning films to show the world what Czechoslovakians can do. Let's hope a third film will soon appear to claim the Besl Fuieiyn Film Oscar for the third straight year! 89 [pageend89]Compliment to from ROCK DRILL ROD Company Limited O. J. SUCHANEK, PRESIDENT [pageend90]SOKOL Jan Waldauf Even a cursory look into the history of Czechoslovakia brings to light the profound influence Sokol has Find nn the development of this Nation. A study of events of the past 100 years shows that Sokol made a unique contribution to the development, maturity and stability of the Nation. ♦ ♦ ♦ Since the fateful Battle at the White Mountain, the Czechs were under alien domination; their political independence lost, their material and intellectual life crushed and their cultural and moral unity broken. Such was their humiliation and state of confusion that they lacked even the desire to rid themselves of the foreign domination that held them down and they accustomed themselves to playing the role of slaves and servants to those who were exploiting them. The Nation had no support. The upper classes were germanized. There were no Czech schools, no books, no art, no science, no industry and no trade. Czechs who wished to get on in the world had to abandon their name, their native tongue, their traditions, sentiments and customs. Neither Europe nor the World knew anything or wished to know anything of a Czechoslovak Nation. In this dark period of national despair there emerged a few men who took it upon themselves to re-awaken in the nation a sense of national pride based on the nation's rich history and past achievements. They endeavoured to arouse in their fellow countrymen a sense of human and national dignity and purpose. Outstanding among them was Dr. Miroslav Tyrs, Doctor of Philosophy and Professor of the History of Arts at the Charles University in Prague, the founder of Sokol. * » * From Dr. Tyrs’ study of history and the causes of the rise and decline of nations, he deduced that Darwin's theory of the survival of the fittest applied also to nations. He realized that freedom for his nation would be attained only through a physical, moral and spiritual regeneration. This, he reasoned, could best be achieved through physical education. With his friend Jindrich (Henry) Fugner they discussed various ways of how this could be achieved. In 1862 they founded a physical culture society called Sokol. Among members of Sokol were some of the outstanding personalities of the Czech national life; Count Deym and Thurn-Taxis, the famous scientist Jan Ev. Purkyne, the qreat Czech historian Frantisek Palacky, Ilie wiileis Tr. L. Celakovsky and Karolina Svetla, the educator Smerling, politicians such as both brothers Gregr, journalist and dynamic leader of students and workers Josef Barak, Thomas Cerny who later became the mayor of Prague, Professor Rudolf Skuhersky. Ferdinand Naprstek, painter Frant, Zenisek, and sculpture! Bohumil Snirch. The Sokol flag and Sokol uniforms were designed by the famous painter Joseph Manes. From an initial membership of 75, Sokol soon attained a membership of 1,000 and other Sokol societies— —Units as they are called—were established in other cities, towns and villages, and other countries as well. Because of its strict adherence to democratic principles, Sokol was, from the very beginning, suspect in the eyes of the hostile government and constantly under police surveillance; its activities restricted and hindered. Sokol was marked in the police files as "a school of democracy, republicanism and socialism". ♦ ♦ ♦ In a relatively short time Sokol transformed the whole Czech nation physically and mentally. In its ranks was united the whole nation. Members of Sokol were drawn from all walks of life, of all ages and of both sexes regardless of political or religious convictions. The Sokol idea is based on the principle that only the fittest will survive. To be fit, a nation and its individuals must be healthier and more active both in body and mind. This can only be achieved by continuous exercise and self-improvement. Sokol physical education aims at development of each individual to the best of his abilities and at the united efforts of all through co-operation. Sokol urges its members to work at continuous self-improvement in order to contribute to a greater extent to the benefit of the whole nation whose well-being is their highest goal. Sokol members learn to subordinate their personal well-being to that of the society and the nation. To work for one's nation is an honour and privilege which cannot be paid for. All work in Sokol is therefore performed without remuneration. Sokol requires from its members, especially its leaders and officers, many sacrifices. The considerable expenses connected with its activities are borne by Sokol members without outside assistance and this fact assures Sokol its independence for which it is justly famous. The leading motif of Sokol education finds its expression best in the fact that it does not serve an individual but the whole, the nation, and humanity as a whole. Freedom of the nation as well as the individual is hold as the highest value In man's life. Members of Sokol learn to respect freedom of others and to protect the freedom of all by self-imposed strict discipline. Sokol is a school of democracy. All its members are equal and Sokol is administered in a democratic way. Democracy in Sokol is refined into brotherhood which is more than democracy and more than equality. It is equality and love. Sokol members call one another “brother" and "sister”. Sokol education does not stop with physical education. It is manifold. It exercises the complete body and, in addition, uses all suitable means for attainment of physical fitness both in gymnasiums and in outdoor activities. The ideal is the ancient greek "kalokagathia". Sokol does not only want a healthy and strong body — not only beauty of a body but, just as important, it requires and seeks to create a beauty of the soul. The beauty and nobility is a characteristic condition of Sokol education. Its motto: Health—Strength—Beauty. An exhibition of Sokol work are the Sokol Slets held from time to time. To the nation they are what to the ancient Greek were their Olympic Games. Sokol made a small and largely unknown country famous by its victories at European and World Gymnastic Championships, Olympic Games and by its famous AllSokol Slets in Prague. * * ♦ The influence of Sokol was such that when the fateful hour struck with the outbreak of World War I the nation was ready for a struggle for its independence. The physical fitness of Sokol members and the patriotic education they received became decisive factors and Sokol ideals wore ucod ac a base for establishment of the Czechoslovak Legions which joined Allied forces in France, Italy and Russia. In Russia, following the Communist revolution in 1917, these Czechoslovak legions were the first army to combat Communists,- they fought their way through Siberia to European battlefields and back home. Following the end of World War I and Czechoslovakia having no army, Sokols restored and maintained order and safeguarded the new nation for democracy. When Communist llunyui y ullucked 91 [pageend91]the new and still weak state, Sokols formed special battalions of “Sokol Freedom Guards" and repulsed the attacks. In time of peace, between the two World Wars, Sokol became the strongest pillar of the Czechoslovak state which became a model of democracy in a Europe torn by internal strife and dominated by various forms of dictatorship and totalitarianism. The Tyrs' system of Sokol physical education was adopted by the schools and the army. Sokol expanded greatly so that almost every tenth man, woman and child belonged to it and took part in its physical education programme. This resulted in greatly improved fitness as well as in higher moral standards, discipline and leadership. With the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia following the sell-out of Czechoslovakia to Hitler at Munich and the occupation by Nazi Germany, Sokol became one of the first targets of German persecution. The organization was dissolved. More than 20,000 members of Sokol were imprisoned and tortured in concentration camps, over 8,000 members lost their lives in these camps or through executions. Still Sokols participated in the underground movement, from intelligence work to acts of sabotage, and those fortunate enough to escape, enlisted in the Allied armies, taking part as R.A.F. flyers in the Battle of Britain, as members of the famous Eighth Army at Tobruk, and many other battlefields on both the Eastern and Western Fronts. Great also was the Sokol participation at the Slovak National Uprising whose leaders, general Viest, general Golian and William Paulini were all members of Sokol. Sokol members played a most significant part in the assistance given to parachutists who executed Hitler's hangman Heydrich. During the last days of occupation of Prague, some 7'00 Sokol members lost their lives during the Prague uprising. The toll paid by Sokol was great but its payment was consistent with the interpretation of Sokol duty to the nation. * * ♦ The benefits from Sokol education became a subject of studies by other nations. Thus the Yugoslav and Rumanian governments, prior to World War II, decided to adopt the Sokol method for its schools and army. Prior to the Communist revolution, czarist Russia also decided to introduce Sokol methods into Russian schools and their army and although Communists dissolved all Sokol Units, the Tyrs’ methods of Sokol physical education are still being used in Soviet physical education. The President of Czechoslovakia, Dr. E. Benes who, like his great predococoor Thomas G. Masaryk, was a member of Sokol, acknowledged Sokol’s great contribution to the nation when he said that “the rise of our nation is unthinkable without Sokol, without the Sokol idea," and "the victory which we achieved was 92 a victory of the national and democratic idea basic to the Sokol movement.” ♦ * * Following the end of World War II Sokol immediately resumed and intensified its activities to compensate for the great losses it incurred during the war and attained a membership of over one million (in a nation whose total population was about 12 million). The Communists realizing its strength and influence attempted to infiltrate Sokol but could not succeed. Following their coup d'etat in 1948, Sokol became their prime target and again, as during both wars, Sokol was dissolved and its leaders and members persecuted. Great numbers of Sokols were imprisoned, the assets of Sokol confiscated, and the name Sokol became synonymous with "Western, capitalistic and bourgeois" enemies of the state. Today, the Communists of Czechoslovakia present their “Spartakiads” as original creation of their "fysculture” although people concerned with physical education the world over know that they are but a poor copy of the Sokol Slets of the past. Sokol Slets were based on voluntary work and discipline, the Spartakiads are only possible through compulsory participation and regimentation. Whereas Sokol Slets of the past were joyful expressions of the national life, the Spartakiads are but a soul-less assembly of masses of a tormented nation. * * * The history of Sokol reflects the strength, vitality and indestructibility of its idea. Neither the Habsburg monarchy, nor the Nazi bestiality could destroy it. We are firmly convinced that it will survive the onslaught of Communism and will once again fulfil its task in providing physical education to the nation. WHAT IS SOKOL Sokol is a world-wide organization in existence now over 100 years. The first Sokol unit was founded on 16th February, 1862, at Prague (Czechoslovakia). Because of its universal appeal Sokol soon spread to many lands and continents and over one and a half million people belonged to Sokol in many countries. (Over one million in Central Europe alone ) In Canada the first Sokol unit was established in 1912 at Frank, Alberta; in the United States in 1865 at St. Louis, Mo. Due to its strict adherence to principles of democracy and freedom Sokol was always a prime target for persecution by totalitarian regimes. During World War I Sokol was banned in countries dominated by the Central Powers and many of its leaders persecuted. Following the war, Sokol increased its strength and influence and scored some of its greatest successes. During World War II the Nazis banned Sokol in all the countries they occupied, jailed, tortured and killed most of the Sokol leadership. Soon after the War, however, Sokol again regained its strength and attained a new high in its membership. The Communist take-over of many countries saw once more the banning of Sokol and the jailing of Sokol leaders. Today, Sokol exists only in the countries of the Free World with some 100,- 000 people belonging to Sokol in North America (Canada and United States), South America (Argentina, Brazil), Europe (Austria, Belgium, England, France, Sweden, Switzerland), Africa (Morocco) and Australia. Sokol uses three original words which are not translated into other languages: SOKOL — Falcon, a bird known for its courage, endurance, speed, sharp eyesight and its love of soaring high above. Thus it symbolizes the ideals of Sokol: fitness, strength and high noble aims. SLET — Festivals of Sokol held at irregular intervals. These festivals are the "Olympic Games" of Sokol. Literally translated — “a fly-together” (of Sokols—falcons). NAZDAR — Greeting of Sokol members (meaning "To Success") Answer: ZDAR (meaning "Success!"). Sokol the world over is organized in three levels — local, national and international. The local organization is called a Sokol UNIT The national organization consists of one, or whoro groat numbers of members and local units require, of a number of Sokol DISTRICTS. The National organizations are then associated in the INTERNATIONAL SOKOL ORGANIZATION. [pageend92]HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF SOKOL ORGANIZATION The first Sokol Unit (founded 1862 at Prague) had a membership total of 75. Other Units followed and three years later there were 20 Sokol units with a membership total of 2,000. All these Units existed in the then Bohemian Kingdom, part of the Austro-Hungarian tm- pire. In 1865 the first Sokol Units were established outside of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Sokol spread to many lands. Efforts to establish a central administrative organization were forbidden by the Austro-Hungarian authorities for more than two decades. In 1884 the government finally permitted the establishment of the CZECH SOKOL ORGANIZATION which at that time consisted of over 18,000 members in 152 local Units and 11 regional Districts All Sokol Units established anywhere in the world became members of this Czech Sokol Organization. Sokol Units established outside of the Austro-Hungarian Empire were part of a special District of the Czech Sokol Organization called "District of Sokols Abroad". The only exception was granted to the Sokol units in the United States because of the restrictions imposed by the U.S. Constitution. The Sokols in the United States established their own national organizations but continued to look for and received assistance from the Czech Sokol Organization. Following the establishment of the Czechoslovak Republic in 1918, the central Sokol organization was re-named CZECHOSLOVAK SOKOL ORGANIZATION. More than one million people belonged to this organization, organized in 3,367 local Sokol UNITS and 52 regional Sokol DISTRICTS. One of these districts was the “District of Sokols Abroad" with Sokol Units the world over. During World War II when the Nazis banned Sokol, the "District of Sokols Abroad" became the representative organization for the Free Sokols Following the Nazi surrender it again became one of the Districts of the re-established Czechoslovak Sokol Organization. Following the Communist coup d’etat in 1948 and the resulting dissolution and persecution of Sokol, the Units of the "District of Sokols Abroad" together with new Units established by Sokol members able to escape from the Communist dominated homeland, founded in 1950 the "Czechoslovak Sokol Abroad” — the International Sokal organization which now represents the Free Sokols. The International Sokol Organization has five regional districts: 1. Australian Sokol 2. Sokol Gymnastic Association of Canada 3. South Ameiican Sokol District 4. Vienna Sokol District (Austria) Dr. ANTONÍN HŘEBÍK former President of Czechoslovak Sokol Organization now President of Czechoslovak Sokol Abroad Brother Hřebík marked his 65th Birthday on 24th February of this year; he was born in Řevnice near Prague into a Sokol family. His father and grandfather were co-founders of the local Sokol Unit and young Antonin belonged to Sokol since he was 4 years old. In 1919 he was elected Educational Director of his Sokol Unit and three years later to the office of Distri ct Educational Director. He was successively elected Vice President and President of the Prague Sokol District. From 1921 he was active in Sokol’s highest body, the Czechoslovak Sokol Organization. For many years a member of the National Educational Board he was elected National Deputy Educational Director and in 1940 a Vice President of Czechoslovak Sokol Organization. During the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia he was one of the leaders of the underground movement until arrested by the Gestapo and imprisoned in the Auschwitz Concentration Camp Out of more than 1.000 Sokol leaders imprisoned in that Camp he was one of the 68 fortunate enough to remain alive. For his part in the resistance movement President Dr. E. Benes deco- 5.

In 1945 brother Hřebík was elected to the highest Sokol office, the Presidency of the Czechoslovak Sokol Organiizlatipn. Under his leadership Sokol expanded greatly and its membership exceeded 1 million. In his struggle with Communists wlm attempted to infiltrate Sokol and establish a totalitarian form of physical education and sport in Czechoslovakia he remained successful. He frustrated all their attempts with the establishment of a democratic Czechoslovak Union of physical culture and was elected President of this Union whose membership embraced all forms of physical education and sport. Dr. Hřebík culminated his studies at the Charles University with a doctorate of law and had, since 1934, his own law practice. From 1945 he was also member of parliament where he clashed frequently with Communists especially on matters concerning the “retribution” and “nationalization” decrees; following the Communist coup d’etat he resigned his mandate. He refused to obey orders of the Communist government with respect to Sokol and, in May 1948, he fled the country together with his wife. Following a short stay in West Germany, Belgium, France and England, he arrived in October 1948 in the United States where he still resides. As President of Czechoslovak Sokol Abroad, the international Sokol organization, he continues his never ending work for Sokol. His great contribution in the field of physical culture was, on a number of occas- sions, recognized in a number of countries of the Free World and he received a'wards from gymnasts of Belgium, the French Order LeMérite National Francais. the Italian Order legion d’Oro. He was also named a member of the Italian Academy of Sciences and Art. "May I pay tribute to the outstanding and important work of your organization, the first unit of which was founded so many years ago in Prague, and which is now spread the world over training youths and aduluts so that they may become phy- sirally, menally and morally fit.” Lester B.

SOKOL SLETS The Sokol organization holds its own “Olympic Games’’ called Slets. These Slets are a display of the Nation’s physical and moral fitness. Sokol Slets are held on a District or National level at fairly regular intervals. Of special significance, however, are the All-Sokol Slets held at irregular intervals at which Sokols from all over the world participate. To date there have been eleven of these AllSokol Slets, all held at Prague, Czechoslovakia. FIRST SLET was held 1882 under the personal leadership of the founder of Sokol, Dr. Miroslav Tyrs. 1,600 Sokols took part with 720 gymnasts performing. In addition to Czech Sokols, Sokols from Croatia, Slovenia and United States took part. Second Slet in 1891 saw 5,520 participants and 2,300 performers. Among the many guests were also gymnasts from France. THIRD SLET in 1895 was directed by the great Physical Director, Jindra Vaniček. Over 7,500 Sokols took part with some 5,000 performing.

In the Slet display there performed 6,700 men, 2,000 junior boys and 860 women. Among Ihe Sokols from abroad were members of Sokol from Poland, Serbia, Bulgaria and Russia.

For the first time at this Slet and at all successive Slets the Czechoslovak Army participated in the programme. EIGHTH SLET held in 1926 commenced in January with Sokol Winter Games and the actual Slet festivities took place from 2nd June to 6th July. The count of participants approached 100,000. A New Slet stadium had to be used; the Strahov stadium became the site of all the successive Sokol slets. In 1926 if held 133,000 spectators who applauded the performances of 12,000 Sokol pupils, 35,000 junior boys and girls, 28,000 women and 30,000 men. NINTH SLET in 1?32 was held to commemorate the 100th birthday of the founder of Sokol. Dr. Miroslav Tyrs. The Strahov stadium was enlarged Io hold 150.000 spectators.

TENTH SLET in 1938 was held only a few months prior to the shameful Dictate of Munich and the subsequent dismemberment of Czechoslovakia and the outbreak of World War II. The Slet was a great manifestation of Sokol adherence to the principles of freedom and democracy. Some 200,000 participated and the Strahov stadium enlarged to hold an audience of over 200,000 was sold out for every performance well in advance Exercises were performed by 43,000 Sokol pupils, 57,000 junior boys and girls, 42,000 women and 38,000 men. ELEVENTH SLET held in 1948 was the first Slet following World War II and so far the last All-Sokol Slet because Sokol was dissolved by the Communists in Czechoslovakia. Similarly as in 1938 when Sokol stood face to face to the menace of Nazi Germany, the Eleventh Slet in 1948 turned into an impassioned manifestation for freedom and democracy and against the alien ideology of totalitarian Communism. The figures of participants and performers set new records. All performances were followed by capacity audiences (the Stadium was again enlarged and had a spectator capacity of 250,000 — the largest in the world) and the exercises were performed by 120,000 Sokol pupils, 85,000 junior boys and girls, 64,000 women and 54,000 men — 323,000 performers in all. Although Sokol is now banned by the Communists, Sokols the world over are firmly convinced that Ihe famous Strahov Stadium will once again be the site of All-Sokol slets! 95 [pageend95]MARIE PROVAZNÍK former Physical Directress of Czechoslovak Sokol Organization now Physical Directress of Czechoslovak Sokol Abroad Sister Marie Provazník was born on 24th October 1890 and commenced her Sokol activities in Prague-Karlin. In 1916 she was elected Physical Directress of her Unit. In 1921 she was elected to the National Instructors' Board for Women and in 1925 to the National Executive Committee of Sokol. In 1931 she was elected to the highest office for a woman in Sokol and became physical directress of the Czechoslovak Sokol Organization. During her dynamic leadership female physical education in Sokol achieved a high level of excellence previously considered as unattainable. Sokol women scored successes both in Czechoslovakia and abroad. As Physical Directress of Czechoslovak Sokol Organization, sister Provazník directed three great All-Sokol Slets: the Ninth Slet held 1932 to commemorate Tyrs’ birthday 100 years ago, the Tenth Slet held 1938 just prior to World War II and the Eleventh Slet in 1948. — Sister Provazník wrote numerous articles on all aspects of physical education, a number of books on the same subject and directed the extensive programme of physical education schooling of Sokol. She organized as well a number of national and international competitions. The Sokol women's teams under her inspired Leadership were victorious at many iternatio- nal contests, Championships and at Olympic Games. Sister Provazník was also instrumental in extending greatly physical education for girls in schools of all levels. For o number of years she served on an examination Board tor physical education teachers for higher schools; she was also a member of an Advisory Council for the Department of National Health and Physical Education. Sister Provazník played a prominent role in a number of international organizations concerned with physical education and sports and served as Chairman of the Women's Committee of F. I. G. — the International Gymnastic Federation. Following the Communist coup d'etat in 1948, sister Provazník completed her two duties — the direction of the Eleventh All-Sokol Slet which proved to the world the contempt Sokol held for the totalitarian Communism and leading the women's Sokol team to Olympic Games at London, England where her team placed first and won a gold medal. There she announced her intention not to return to her newly enslaved country and following a short stay in England arrived in the United States to teach physical education at Panzer College. Immediately upon arriving in U. S. A sister Provazník continued her Sokol activities. For some years she was Physical Directress of the Eastern District of American Sokol and Vice-President of Czechoslovak Sokol Abroad. She is now Physical Diretress of the international Sokol organization — Czechoslovak Sokol Abroad, edits its monthly publication "Czechoslovak Sokol Abroad”, teaches and lectures at physical education courses, schools and clinics in the United States, Canada and even Europe and is prominent in the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences in America. SOKOL AT INTERNATIONAL GYMNASTIC CONTESTS The Czech Sokol Organization joined the European Gymnastic Union (later known as F.I.G —International Gymnastic Federation) in 1897 and Sokol gymnastic teams represented the Kingdom of Bohemia and later the Czechoslovak Republic at all international gymnastic contests from that time on until the dissolution of Sokol by the Communists in 1948.

IMPORT EXPORT ARNOŠT J. KOPECKÝ PRESIDENT AND GENERAL MANAGER 79 WELLINGTON STREET WEST TORONTO 1 [pageend97]A LETTER FROM THE PUBLISHERS “Give Canada whatever you have, and she will do the same for you." It happened sixteen years ago: we had been in Canada just a few days and our first care was to learn English as soon as possible. In this way we met him, a Canadian teacher, and from him we heard those words, true and full of meaning, we put as a motto to what we are going to say. Canada is OUR country and the more we are able to give her from our heritage we brought with us from the “old” country and the more we are able to exert ourselves for her progress, the more we will get back from her. We are not second-rate citizens, we are full-fledged Canadians, we have the same rights and, of course, the same duties as all those who were born in Canada and are Canadian citizens by birth. Our teacher was right. Working for Canada we are working for ourselves — it is simply we who are Canada. There is no difference between us and anybody else living here. Since the day we heard it from our teacher we had plenty of occassions to see what he said was true. He showed us our way and trying to follow it we found out that we can only gain. What was our personal experience and left a deep impression in us from the first days of our staying in Canada, was also experience of thousands and thousands of our countrymen whether they came here before us or after us and we are proud to point to a special section of our centennial issue— “Contributions of Czechs and Slovaks to Canada”. It is only a few dozen names we are able to qimte, however, there are many and many more of them which we have to omit because there is not enough space in our issue. Our intention is just to show that the attitude of our “ethnic” group to Canada is a positive one. At the same time, the existence of so many Czech and Slovak shops and factories is also a proof that the immigrants do not take away employment from the groups which came before them, but on the contrary create jobs for many other people too. Not all of the new enterprises are, of course, of the same, exceptionaillly big size as the concern of the Koerner family, or the one of Slovak Stefan Roman, the Uranium ‘Denison’ mines, etc. and a few others, not forgetting Bata, of course. In this connection: it is interesting to know that Bata was a school for many other Czech or Slovak shoe- manufacturers, though rather much smaller, but nevertheless important too, as the quality of their production is as a rule not behind Bata. Of them are Vojtech Škubal, Tony Ronza, Walter Sedlbauer J. Svoboda and J. Valhar. All these small, medium or large factories, whatever they may produce, are a good illustration that the Czechs and Slovaks feel really at home in Canada. And it is quite possible that one day the Czechoslovak businessmen will found their own Business Club to pass their experiences to the fellow- countrymen and all other Canadians. Not everybody is of course able to seek and find living in business and industry, and it is not otherwise in our ethnic group either. Many people have other interests, intellectual and art interests, and help in their own way. Again, some of them we list in the section called “Professions” and again these countrymen of ours listed there are a living proof that we 98 are not just “exiles” but people who found already firm roots in 'this country. To achieve this was not too difficult for us as our artists, musicians, singers, actors, writers, and poets had always very warm relations to this continent and to demonstrate it we may mention for instance Ema Destinova, Otakar Marak, Karel Burian, who sang in the New York Metropolitan Opera, or Anton Dvorak, the composer of the “New World Symphony” or poet Josef V. Sladek and many others. Here is perhaps the place to mention also a Czechoslovak “specialty” described in details and in its history in several at tides of this issue: “The Sokol”, an organization of youth mainly, to take care of physical fitness. If the youth of today presents so many social and educational problems, the Sokd- Clubs are certainly worth to be studied as an answer what to put as an aim before youth who is helpless and does not know how to spend its free time. We have talked about our businessmen and intellectuals, however, we do not forget that the majority of our countrymen are quite ordinary people, workers either of blue or white collars. Some of them are highly skilled, have no probems and enjoy their staying here immensely. However, many other belong unfortunately to much lower brackets and face rather unpleasant fact that just now, in the Centennial year Canada is going through an inflation which is lowering too many people’s living standard substantially. On their behalf we would like to stress that one of the most important Centennial tasks of our Government should be stabilization! of prices and wages. This first of all. And at second, as the Government at all levels, municipal, provincial and federal, need more and more money everyday, they should try to earn it in the same way as every private individual has to earn it: by some productive activity. To increase taxes at every occasion is too easy and it is not difficult to understand that it has its limits. If, therefore, the Government may accept as its Centennial project the stabilization of prices, wages and taxes, it may be assured that it will have complete and warm support of our whole ethnic group. The Czechoslovak community has its own Centennial projects too. To point out some of them at least: to establish lectures on Czech and Slovak literature at the University of Toronto, to improve Czechoslovak recreation centre Masaryktown at Scarborough by providing a second large swimming pool there, to send gift of food to India, to publish, a History of Czech and Slovaks in Canada by Jan Smerek, to organize Sokol-festivai at Montreal Expo 67, and to publish Centennial issue of “Nase Hlasy”-“Our Voices” which you have in hand. To close, we express our sincere thanks to all who made this Centennial issue of “Our Voices” possible: we thank both the Editorial Board and the employees of our printing shop and all contributors. We are certain we did something that has its value and though we perhaps! did not give a complete picture of our life in Canada (it would be futile to try it,) we collected informations everybody would like to read not only now but also after many years later on.
