SECRETARY GENERAL AND HEADS OF STATE The Charter 77 movement sent the following open letter to Dr. Kurt Waldheim, secretary general of the United Nations, and the heads of the states that signed the Helsinki Declaration. "The Charter 77 civil rights movement has been active for 22 months in Czechoslovakia, a country which has acceded to the Declaration of Human Rights and the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference. This informal group has decided to watch over the implementation of human rights, guaranteed by our Constitution, in this country, and has pledged to enter into a dialog with the state authorities and all interested segments of society in order to point to violations of civil and human rights in public life and to suggest solutions as appropriate. Charter 77 has distributed 21 documents to the authorities and has requested intervention in a number of letters, suggestions and complaints. The authorities have not replied to a single one. Individuals who have signed the Charter and various groups affiliated with it have sent several hundred similar letters and documents to Czechoslovak institutions. Most of these remained without a reply. This is why, for the first time, we are addressing, instead of institutions in Czechoslovakia, foreign leaders, in order to draw attention to the rapidly deteriorating human rights situation in our country and to the steadily increasing persecution of those who try to advocate human rights in Czechoslovakia. We ask you to direct your attention to the situation in Czechoslovakia, to check the information and data published by Charter 77, and to try to persuade the government of Czechoslovakia to improve conditions and to respect obligations assumed under international instruments. "The Committee for the Defense of Unjustly Prosecuted Citizens which has evolved from Charter 77 and is active in its intentions has already published 50 reports making public the persecution of persons who committed 1 [pageend1]- 2 - no crimes other than expressing their views and acting according to their convictions. Still incomplete information at the Committee's disposal indicates that, at present, a considerable number of persons have been detained or imprisoned. Several dozen people who have signed Charter 77 or have otherwise supported it are in jail. "People have been arrested, for instance, after a few typewritten pages of Charter 77 documents have been found in their homes (e.g., Josef Brychta, Jiří Chmel, Michal Koval, Miloslav Lojek, Ivan Maňásek, Pavel Novák, František Pitor, Jan Zmatlík); or just for copying manuscripts of unpublished authors, or for taping music officially frowned upon (e.g., Petr Cibulka, Libor Chloupek, Petr Pospíchal, Pavel Roubal). More and more frequently the security police attempt to construct indictments for various criminal offenses against Charter signatories and others, and these people are usually imprisoned on such pretexts (e.g., Otká Bednářová, Václav Havel, Ivan Jirouš, Jaroslav Kukal, Pavel Landovský, Ladislav Lis, Jelena Mašinová, Tomáš Petřivý, Jan Šimsa). This recently culminated in the arrest and imprisonment of one of the Charter spokesmen, Dr. Jaroslav Sabata. Dr. Šabata was illegally arrested when he was about to attend a meeting of Charter 77 supporters with members of the Polish Committee of Social Self-Defense (KOR). He was accused of having assaulted a policeman. The opposite is true: when he was taken to a police station, he was attacked by the police without having given them any cause, and brutally beaten. This is not the first such case and the accusation against him is as absurd as in many previous instances. "Other people have been imprisoned for having sent manuscripts by Czech authors abroad (Jiří Lederer, Ota Ornest), for being in possession of foreign literature (Vladimír Laštůvka, Aleš Macháček), or for having drawn public attention to injustice they had observed (Zdeněk Kašťák, Petr Pohl, Oldřich Tomek, Jiří Veselý). "Although officials have repeatedly declared that the 'Charter 77 case' will be settled 'politically,' the practice just described continues: people who have signed Charter 77 continue to be provoked, accused of things they never committed, imprisoned for acts which are no violation of the law, and, in violation of the law, are being held in jail for months without trial. "There have been alarming incidents of terroristic violence, anonymous threats and all kinds of interference with people's private lives (as in the cases of Karel Bartošek, Bohumil Doležal, Jiří Kasal, Pavel Kohout, Pavel Landovský, Elžběta Ledererová, Ivan Medek and Věněk Šilhán). These incidents are never properly investigated and a strong impression prevails that these incidents happen with the connivance of the secret police. "There is an entire scale of less well-known and more subtle repressive acts against advocates of human rights; they are, however, also important because they signify attempts to suppress and make impossible even the most modest expressions of nonconformism and of free will. Increasingly active Charter 77 signatories are detained without any legal grounds for two to four days (e.g., during Leonid I. Brezhnev's visit to Prague or when the meeting with Polish dissidents was being prepared). Many are continuously shadowed by secret agents, others (Jiří Hájek, Václav Havel, Ladislav [pageend2]- 3 - Hejdánek, František Kriegel, Jaroslav áabata, Petr Uhl) are under constant police surveillance, virtual house arrest, and subjected to all kinds of harassment. Charter signatories and their friends are being called in for extended police interrogations (during the past two years there were virtually thousands of such cases). During the interrogations, these people are threatened with violence, and often physical violence is applied against them. There are constant searches of persons and homes without warrants. The police interfere with the most elementary rights, such as the right of people to meet with their friends or the right to step out of their apartments or leave their places of residence. Dozens of Charter supporters have had their telephones disconnected, their homes are stacked with listening devices, they are photographed and filmed at every step, and their mail is not delivered to them. Especially absurd is police interference with private lectures, discussion meetings and artistic performances. Recently, for instance, a large police detachment tried to prevent a reading of Shakespeare’s "Macbeth" in a private home, in which several outstanding actors were participating. People who wanted to attend the performance were stopped at the door, required to show identification, and then not permitted to enter. Some were led off for interrogation, others were followed by police. It must be quite horrible to imagine that in the second half of the twentieth century, in a civilized European country, Shakespearean actors must sneak through back doors and basement passages if they want to perform privately in front of a few friends. "The police also devote constant attention to typewritten texts by authors who are not permitted to publish. Those who copy these texts are persecuted, the manuscripts are confiscated in private homes or in bookbinders’ shops, and one writer was even jailed for having written a novel and having it circulated through samizdat (Gruša). "The police interfere with special vengeance against people who perform nonconformist music. They break up private concerts as if they were some meetings of the criminal underworld. In one incident a little country house which was a meeting place for young musicians was confiscated from the owner on the ridiculous pretext that just on that spot a bus stop was to be set up. The day when the family (that of Jan Prine) had to move out of the house, their home was blown up. "With the police giving the orders, openly or secretly, Charter supporters are being fired from their jobs, they are prevented from obtaining even the most menial work, they are deprived of their pensions, and their children are not allowed to attend high school or university, in some cases even kindergarten (Pavel Landovský). Their spouses are forced into divorce (Pavel Landovský, Břetislav Verner). There have even been some cases where medical attention was denied (Ivana Heublerová), or, on the contrary, where people have been forcibly detained in mental institutions. There have been two instances when physicians, under pressure from the police, contravening their Hippocratic oaths, have had perfectly healthy women confined to a clinic for venereal diseases (Zdena Etteltová and Zina Kočová). "This recital of injustice could be continued indefinitely. Most of the individual cases were recorded in various documents and petitions, published [pageend3]- 4 - abroad or in samizdat, or in complaints addressed to the authorities. They represent evidence that conditions of life in Czechoslovakia are deteriorating and that some elements in the administration are prepared to do anything to silence people who want to express their free will and to prevent them from leading peaceable lives. These people are not only denied basic human rights as granted by the Declaration of Human Rights and other pertinent international instruments, but they are also often denied rights considered in civilized countries so self-evident that they are not even fixed in legislation. An atmosphere of fear prevails in this country, and people are afraid not only to voice their views but even to have contact with those who try to do so. We are getting closer to 1984 and can only say with regret that conditions in this country are coming dangerously close to George Orwell's vision — a society that prevents individuals from leading free and dignified lives. "We do not say that the government of Czechoslovakia is directly responsible for the state of lawlessness we have attempted to describe. There are even some indications that some branches of the administration — mainly the police — have managed to get out of control and are trying to pursue their own aims, disregarding all the disastrous consequences, both for life within the country and for the country's reputation in the world. "Things must be put right, first of all, by the citizens of the country and by their institutions. However, international public opinion and foreign governments should not remain uninformed, and concern for what is going on inside Czechoslovakia should not be considered 'interference.' The idea of the United Nations is based on the conviction that the fate of citizens of one country cannot be a matter merely for the government of that country but must also be the concern of the whole international community. The Final Act of Helsinki explicitly confirms the right of all signatories to watch over its implementation, including in other countries. "This is why we are addressing you, in the hope that you will give these matters some attention. If, for the advocates of human rights in our country, the imprisonment of Dr. Šabata is a challenge and a threat to their future efforts, his fate should become a touchstone for the involvement of international public opinion and its ability to influence conditions in Czechoslovakia. Prague, November 6, 1978 Marta Kubišová, Ladislav Hejdánek Charter 77 spokesmen Committee for the Defense of Unjustly Prosecuted Citizens" In support of this letter, the Council of Free Czechoslovakia has sent a memorandum on the violation of human rights to President Jimmy Carter, President Valery Giscard d'Estaing of France, Prime Minister James Callaghan of Great Britain, Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany, Chancellor Bruno Kreisky of Austria, Secretary General Waldheim, Indalecio Liévano Aguirre, president of the United Nations General Assembly, and Leticia Shahani, chairwoman of the assembly's Third Committee, its committee on human rights. [pageend4]- 5 - THE COMMUNIST MYTH The sixtieth anniversary of the Czechoslovak Republic was an embarrassment for the communist regime. After the coup d'etat of 19^8, the Independence Day holiday of October 28 was changed into Nationalization Day and a new state holiday was declared for May 9 to celebrate Czechoslovakia's "liberation" by the Red Army in 19^5 (the U.S. Army's role being forgotten). Yet the anniversary could not be ignored. Czechs and Slovaks regard October 28, 1918, as the most important day in their modern history. Dialectically, the communists therefore decided to create a myth by declaring the Bolshevik October Revolution of 1917 to have been the decisive force in the creation of the Czechs' and Slovaks' new state. The press and other mass media throughout the country flooded their audiences with statements playing down the roles taken during World War I by Thomas G. Masaryk, the first president of the republic, Edvard Beneš and the Slovak leader Milan Rastislav Štefánik, as well as that of the Czechoslovak Legions, who were supposedly working and fighting "in the interests of the Czech and Slovak bourgeoisie." Little tribute was paid either to President Woodrow Wilson's declaration on the right of nations to self-determination. A "scientific" conference was held in Prague on October 5 (see Czechoslovak Newsletter, Vol. Ill, No. 10/25 [October 1978], p. 2) to refute "bourgeois propaganda" about the origins of the republic. The truth is, however, that there is not one contemporary document on the struggle at home or abroad that mentions the October Revolution and its influence on the establishment of the Czechoslovak state. A rally of Slovak workers on May 1, 1918, in Liptovsky Sv. Mikuláš (then still in Hungary), for instance, demanded the right of self- determination without the least reference to the events of 1917 in Russia. On the instructions of Masaryk (then chairman of the Czechoslovak National Council in Paris), the Czechoslovak Legion in Russia took a neutral stance toward the October Revolution and turned a deaf ear to propaganda exhorting it to join forces with the Bolsheviks. When the Soviets tried to disarm the Legion, it fought off the units of the Red Army and forced its way out of the country through Siberia. Under such circumstances, it was obvious that the Great October Revolution had nothing to offer for the liberation of the Czechs and Slovaks. With his declaration on the right of nations to self-determination, on the other hand, President Wilson is warmly remembered by the people of Czechoslovakia for the impetus he gave their struggle for freedom. To mark the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the Czechoslovak Republic, grateful exiles dedicated a plaque to his memory in Washington, DC. Professor Victor Mamatey of the University of Georgia addressed the gathering. His speech, published in this issue, is a telling answer to the communist myth about October 28, Czechoslovak Independence Day. Resolution of the Slovak Workers in Liptovsky Svätý Mikuláš, May 1, 1918 "We workers organized in the Slovak Social Democratic Party and Slovak citizens have adopted . . . the following resolution. "The world war that has already been raging for four years has claimed untold victims from all the nations of the world, including the Hungarian branch of the Czechoslovak race. . . . [pageend5]- 6 - ”1. The governments should seize any opportunity to conclude a just and permanent peace based on an honest solution of all international and domestic problems, a peace that will prevent new wars and bring desired peace and freedom to all the nations of Europe. ”2. As a natural consequence of the recognition of freedom, we demand unconditional recognition of the right to self-determination of not only the nations beyond the borders of our monarchy but also the nations of Austria-Hungary, and therefore also the Hungarian branch of the Czechoslovak race . . . Declaration of the Slovak Nation The representatives of all Slovak political parties gathered in Turčiansky Svaty Martin on October JO, 1918, ’’organized in the National Council of the Slovak branch of the single Czecho-Slovak nation," formally declared that they "stand on the principle of the right to self-determination." The National Council "of the Czecho-Slovak nation living in Hungary" resolved: "1. The Slovak nation is linguistically and culturally-historically part of a single Czecho-Slovak nation. The Slovak branch has participated in all the cultural struggles of the Czech nation that have made it known to the entire world. "2. We demand the unlimited right to self-determination based on total independence for the Czecho-Slovak nation." Charter 77 on the Sixtieth Anniversary Over the signatures of Marta Kubišová and Ladislav Hejdánek, the Charter 77 movement issued a declaration in Prague on October 28 in commemoration of the sixtieth anniversary of the "modern Czechoslovak state." The two-page declaration called for the preservation of the nation's "thousandyear-old heritage" and for a society based on justice, freedom of the individual, and independence. "A state is either a shared responsibility of all its citizens, or a bureaucracy behind a counter treating its citizens as someone disturbing the peace. . . . A state can exist only as an equal among other states. Otherwise it is a superfluous body for the cultivation of selfishness, chauvinistic emotion and political fanaticism." CZECHOSLOVAK PLAGUE DEDICATED TO WOODROW WILSON The following address was given by Professor Victor S. Mamatey of the University of Georgia at Athens, Ga., on October 26 in Washington, DC, on the occasion of the dedication of a Czechoslovak plaque to the memory of President Woodrow Wilson to mark the sixtieth anniversary of the establishment of the Czechoslovak Republic. "On this day sixty years ago, October 26, 1918, the courtyard behind the stately Independence Hall in Philadelphia was the stage for a dramatic scene, which would have surprised but delighted the American founding fathers. "A four-day conference of the newly created 'Mid-European Democratic [pageend6]- 7 - Union' representing almost a dozen oppressed nationalities of Central and Eastern Europe came to a conclusion in a colorful ceremony. On a platform stood Professor Thomas G. Masaryk, the president of the exile Czecho-Slovak National Council in Paris, who chaired the meeting. He was flanked by representatives of the union's member nationalities and delegates of American patriotic societies and political parties. To enliven the scene, the four- year-old daughter of a Czechoslovak immigrant unveiled a replica of the original Liberty Bell, and rang it as Professor Masaryk signed a 'Declaration of Common Aims of the Independent Mid-European Nations,' dipping his pen in the historic inkwell used by the signers of the American Declaration of Independence. Other children dressed in picturesque national costumes tolled the bell as each of the union's member representatives signed the declaration in his turn, and expressed gratitude to the United States and President Wilson. '0 you bell! 0 you country! 0 you President Wilson!' exclaimed the representative of the Ruthenians of Hungary, Gregory Žatko- vich of Pittsburgh. 'That this day should see the Uhro-Ruthenes free, free, free!' "'In our days of militant ethnicity, the Philadelphia scene sixty years ago might not be understood. But it was sincere. The 'Declaration of Common Aims,' which Masaryk read to the crowd, would not be contested. The declaration embodied six principles echoing the language of Thomas Jefferson and Woodrow Wilson: "First, that all governments derive their just power from the consent of the governed. "Second, that it is the inalienable right of every people to organize their own government on such principles and in such form as they believe will best promote their welfare, safety and happiness. "Third, that the free and natural development of the ideals of any state should be allowed to pursue its normal and unhindered course unless such course harms or threatens the common interest of all. "Fourth, that there should be no secret diplomacy, and all proposed treaties and agreements between nations should be made public — prior to their adoption and ratification. "Fifth, that we believe our peoples, having kindred ideals and purposes, should coordinate their efforts to ensure the liberties of their individual nations for the furtherance of their common welfare, provided such a union contributes to the peace and welfare of the world. "Sixth, that there should be formed a league of the nations of the world in a common and binding agreement for genuine and practical cooperation to secure justice and therefore peace among nations. "The time is lacking to analyze this fine document. The principles which it expressed were unexceptionable moral principles. Such principles are hard to attain. Masaryk was clearly aware of it when he presented the declaration to President Wilson. 'The reconstruction and regeneration of [pageend7]- 8 - Europe,' he wrote, 'is a difficult task; but every creative policy, not acquiescing in a given political and social formation, is difficult; it was difficult to defeat the German-Austrian autocracy; it will be difficult to put a new form of life into its inheritance.' And he appealed to the President for leadership to help to achieve the task: 'Mr. President, we see in you one of the greatest leaders of modern democracy and constructive policy; it is in making a sincere attempt to apply such a policy to our particular nations and to the whole of Europe that we hope you will engage your interest in our union's endeavors.' At the time, Wilson was optimistic. The war was approaching its end, but the tide of American moral purpose was still rising. In acknowledging receipt of the declaration, he replied to Masaryk that he thought it was 'admirable alike in substance and in temper'; that he regarded its principles and ideals as his own; and that he would 'deem it a privilege' to cooperate in their Realization. "The Philadelphia meeting of the Mid-European Union received an extraordinary amount of publicity in the American press. The American people were eager at the time for the United States to play the part of liberator and moral leader of the world, and saw in the declaration proof that the Americans were succeeding in their crusade for freedom. An editorial in the Philadelphia Public Ledger expressed confidence that the Mid-European Union's declaration would 'be heard in the echoing courts of the hoary Habsburg Burg in Vienna.’ Instead of the 'grandiose, imperialistic and predatory Mitteleuropa of which the two kaisers dreamed,' the editorial stated, the delegates of the Mid-European nationalities aspired to 'create a new, democratic, a benevolent Mittel- Europa. ' Photographs of the Philadelphia events were distributed under such captions as 'Professor T. G. Masaryk ... in the Independence Hall signs the Declaration of Czechoslovak Independence,' which gave rise to the mistaken belief that the Czechoslovak declaration of independence had been issued in Philadelphia. Actually, it had been issued a week earlier here in Washington under different circumstances. "Point X of the famous Fourteen Points issued on January 8, 1918, still assumed the continued existence of the Habsburg empire, although it postulated it as a condition of peace that the Habsburg government grant its subject nationalities 'the freest opportunity of autonomous development.' At the time the Habsburg government spurned the Fourteen Points program as interference in the empire's internal affairs. By October 1918, however, it invoked the Fourteen Points to save the empire from disintegration. On October 15, to satisfy Point X, Emperor Charles issued a manifesto announcing the federalization of the empire. It was to checkmate the imperial manifesto and forestall its impact on American public opinion that Masaryk, after hasty consultations with Beneš in Paris, issued the Czechoslovak Declaration of Independence in Washington on October 18. By coincidence, Emperor Charles's federalization manifesto and Masaryk's Declaration of Czechoslovak Independence were published in parallel columns in many American newspapers on October 19« Incidentally, if Masaryk feared that the imperial manifesto might dissuade President Wilson from supporting Czechoslovak independence, he was mistaken, for the President had already drafted a note to Vienna replying to an earlier Austrian peace note, in which he declined the Austrian offer to surrender on the basis of the Fourteen Points on the ground that since the issuance of that program he had committed himself to support Czechoslovak and Yugoslav independence, and that therefore Vienna should address itself to the Czechoslovak and Yugoslav [pageend8]- 9 - representatives as to what would satisfy them, federalization or independence. "After Vienna's acceptance of this condition, the Czech National Committee in Prague went ahead and on October 28, 1918, proclaimed the establishment of an independent Czechoslovak state. In the accompanying manifesto, the National Committee exhorted the Czech people to preserve law and order and make themselves worthy of their 'liberators Masaryk and Wilson.' The manifesto does not bear the signature of the chairman of the National Committee, Karel Kramář, for he, confident of victory, had already gone to Geneva to meet Beneš, coming from Paris, to discuss the practical steps necessary to fuse the personnel of the Paris National Council and the Prague National Committee and form the first Czechoslovak government. This was accomplished on November 13, when the Provisional Czechoslovak National Assembly met in Prague and elected Masaryk, then still in Washington, the first president of Czechoslovakia, and invested the first Czechoslovak cabinet under Kramář. "Meanwhile, on October 30, 1918, the Slovak political leaders met in the pleasant but remote provincial town of Turčiansky Svaty Martin. They were unaware of the proclamations of Czechoslovak independence in Washington or Prague, but they knew of President Wilson's note to Vienna, referring it to the Czechoslovak and Yugoslav representatives for negotiations. The Slovak leaders formed the Slovak National Council and issued the 'Martin Declaration,' calling for the union of the Slovaks with the Czechs in a common state. In addressing the gathering, Matúš Dula, the chairman of the Slovak National Council, reassured it that the Slovaks could look forward with confidence, because their fate was in the hands of the 'arbiter of the world' (actually, he used the Latin term arbiter mundi),* President Wilson. Such was the impact of the personality and ideology of the American president. "In the life of nations, no less than in that of men, there is a rhythm. Periods of exertion alternate with periods of relaxation. Periods of moral commitment are usually followed by periods when practical or pragmatic concerns are at the center of nations' interests. During World War I the American people were seized with a crusading fervor to fight for freedom of men and nations, which assured the Allied victory. By the middle of 1919, however, their crusading fervor was spent. A more realistic mood had set in. Much to President Wilson's dismay, the American people were beginning to lose interest in his peace efforts before these efforts were completed. In a desperate effort to save the peace treaties and the League of Nations, he set out on a speaking tour of the American Midwest and West. In town after town, in speech after speech, he exhorted the American people to make the additional effort necessary to bring to completion the great crusade for freedom and justice in which he had led them since 1917- He warned them that if in a spirit of shortsighted realism they abandoned the league, their democratic allies, and the small nations of Europe which owed their existence essentially to America's war effort, the structure of peace would crumble in a few years and America would face another great war. *The report in the Slovak newspaper Národnie noviny adds that at the mention of Wilson's name the audience rose to its feet "as if touched by a magician's wand and the hall resounded with a thunderous 'Long may he live!'" [pageend9]10 "President Wilson might have succeeded in persuading the American people to support his peace accomplishment to the end- We shall never know, for at Pueblo, Colo., on September 25 he tragically suffered a physical collapse from which he never fully recovered. Without his inspired leadership the struggle for the treaties and the League of Nations was lost- The American people turned to other concerns. "Paradoxically, while Wilson became the "forgotten man" in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s, his fame was never greater abroad. Before World War II the western traveler arriving by train in Prague would alight at the Wilson Station. Coming out of the station, he would face Wilson Square and Wilson Park with a statue of Woodrow Wilson in the center. When, as President Wilson had warned would happen, the structure of peace collapsed and Czechoslovakia was engulfed in the Nazi tyranny, the names of Wilson Station, Square and Park were changed and the statue removed. Although briefly restored after World War II, these symbols of the gratitude of the Czech and Slovak people to their American liberator were permanently obliterated when Czechoslovakia was engulfed in another tyranny—the Communist one- Nevertheless, Wilson has passed permanently into the pantheon of Czechoslovakia's liberators. As these exercises show, wherever the Czechs and Slovaks are free to speak freely, they are glad to bear witness that they still consider Wilson one of their prophets and liberators." APPEAL TO CARDINAL ARCHBISHOP TOMÁŠEK Eighty-four Czechoslovak citizens on October 31 sent a letter to František Cardinal Tomášek, Archbishop of Prague, "for the attention of the Holy Father, Pope John Paul II." The letter states: "Since the beginning of the Charter 77 activities, the state authorities have received numerous petitions asking for review of the cases of those unjustly prosecuted and protests against the illegal abuse of power by the organs of the Ministry of the Interior. ... No answers have been received. The petitions and protests have been filed by the state security organs for use against their authors. ... An especially abhorrent case was the recent trial of J. Chmel, who was sentenced to 18 months' prison, during which four witnesses declared that they had been forced to commit perjury. . . . We ask for justice together with those who believe in divine justice." NATIONAL COUNCIL OF CHURCHES APPEAL TO GUSTÁV HUSÁK The National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA has sent the following letter to President Gustav Husák of Czechoslovakia appealing for the release from prison of Rev. Jan Šimsa (see Czechoslovak Newsletter, Vol. Ill, No. 10/25 (October 1978], p. 4): "The members of the Governing Board of the National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA respectfully appeal to you to release from prison the Rev. [pageend10]11 Jan Šimsa, member of the Evangelical Church of Czech Brethren, for humanitarian reasons. "We appeal to you not only as the President of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic but also as a former prisoner and victim of violation of human rights. "Many people in our country and throughout the world will regard Rev. áimsa's release from prison as a proof of Czechoslovakia’s implementation of the Helsinki Final Act and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights." CANADIAN INTERROGATED IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA H. Gordon Skilling, professor of political economy at the University of Toronto and author of one of the best books on the "Prague Spring" (Czechoslovakia's Interrupted Revolution [Princeton University Press, 19761) was detained by police at the Czechoslovak- Austrian border on October 18 on his way from Bratislava to Vienna. He was taken back to Bratislava and interrogated for twelve hours. His notes and other written material were confiscated, including a paper by the Slovak philosopher Miroslav Kusý. The Canadian government has lodged a protest with Prague. Professor Skilling made a statement about the incident only after his recent return to Toronto. -0O0- [pageend11]
