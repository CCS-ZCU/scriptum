The annual meeting is a special event in odd-numbered years, but coincides with the biannual World Congresses in even-numbered years. The Montreal local SVU chapter, headed by Dr. Richard Drtina (Professor and Chairman of the Humanities and Philosophy Department, John Abbott College, Kirkland Campus in Montreal) was in charge of the program. The administrative meetings took place on Friday evening (October 23) and Sunday morning (October 25). A banquet for all participants and invited public was held on Saturday evening. There were several exhibits of interest. I. Dobroruka organized an exhibit of paintings, graphic art and ceramics by Czech and Slovak artists from the entire province of Quebec. L. Křivánek from the editorial board of Bohemicum was in charge of the collection of Czechoslovak books published in exile. And Anna Skvor of SVU Montreal prepared an exhibit of the literary work by her late husband, poet Pavel Javor. Most of Saturday (October 24) was dedicated to the scholarly program, which centered on the problems of energy. The Panel “Energy - Challenge for the World,” chaired by Vladislav Zajic A NON-PROFIT CULTURAL ORGANIZATION [pageend1](electrical engineer at the Institut de Recherche de l’Hydro Quebec) included the following papers: T.H. Pavlasek (McGill University, Montreal), Energy - Challenge for the World J. Teichman ( Universite de Montreal), Nuclear Fission - A Compromise Between Energy Needs and a Hazard to be Accepted V. Fuchs (Hydro-Quebec Research Institute), Thermonuclear Fusion - Promise of Tomorrow V. Zajic (Hydro-Quebec Research Institute), Alternate Energy Sources - Availability, Dispersion and Scale V. Zeman (Concordia University, Montreal), Progress and Humanity We will have details about the agenda of this successful Annual Assembly in the next issue; ★ ★ ★ Richard L. Drtina, President of the Montreal SVU local chapter since 1977, is a native of Náchod, Czechoslovakia. He earned his Doctorate of Philosophy (PhDr) in 1968 at Charles University, Prague, specializing in aesthetics, art, sociology and philosophy of culture. His position as a political commentator on Czechoslovak Radio during the Soviet invasion in August 1968 led to his expulsion from the university, where he was teaching, and eventually resulted in his immigration to Canada. In Canada he has done postdoctoral studies in sociology at Concordia University, Montreal. He has contributed, in Czech, to Proměny (Metamorphoses) on such topics as Svejk, the invasion, and Jan Palach. He gave a series of public lectures on major periods of Western art and culture during 1980-81 at the Cultural Centre in Montreal and has contributed reviews to the journal Central Europe published by the University of Arizona. ★ ★ ★ Bulletin, edited by Zdenka E.

Professor John F. N. Bradley has accepted the post of editor-in-chief and is currently putting together an editorial board. The provisional name for the journal is Cosmas. A Journal of Czechoslovak and Central European Studies, and the first issue is due to appear in the spring of 1982. It will be published twice a year and be based at the University of Manchester. Cosmas (1045-1125) was the first Bohemian chronicler-historian. To finance the journal and other publication activities SVU has set up a basic endowment of $40,000. Donations, which are tax-deductible, are needed to keep the fund operational on a permanent basis. Dr. Karel Absolón heads the SVU committee in charge. ★ ★ ★ Inventory of Czechs and Slovaks Abroad and of Individuals with a Professional Interest in Czechoslovakia The Executive Board of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences reaffirmed at its recent meeting in Washington, D.C. that one of the chief aims of the Society is to keep abreast of the professional activities of Czechs and Slovaks abroad with a view towards a critical evaluation of their contribution to world culture and world affairs. There is the general belief that there are thousands of outstanding individuals of Czechoslovak descent scattered throughout the world of whom only a small percentage maintains ties with a Czechoslovak organization abroad or whose ethnic origin is known. With time, it will be increasingly difficult to identify such individuals, which would be an immeasurable loss to Czechoslovak ethnic cultural history. Against this background, the Executive Board has decided to initiate immediate steps toward a systematic collection of information about Czechs and Slovaks (or other nationalities from Czechoslovakia) living abroad as well as those persons professionally engaged in the study of Czechoslovak culture and affairs. Dr. Miloslav Rechcigl, Jr., past President of the Society has been appointed to direct and coordinate the effort. The first phase of the project will focus on identifying individuals living or dead who belong to the categories stated above. The recently published Educators with Czechoslovak Roots (compiled by Dr. Rechcigl under SVU sponsorship and containing names, specialty and position of educators of Czechoslovak descent based at American and Canadian universities and colleges), will provide the groundwork for this inventory. In addition to updating the aforementioned publication, project coordinators will prepare a comparable inventory covering Europe and other continents. They will not limit their purview to academics but will also gather information on personalities in research institutes and industry, in the private and public sectors, i.e., scientists, technologists, scholars, artists, writers, architects, physicians, lawyers, legislators, government officers, diplomats, judges, clergyment, journalists, librarians, teachers, social workers, sports figures, businessmen , financiers, philanthropists, etc. 5 [pageend5]Apart from its historical and informational value, the inventory will have numerous practical uses for the society. It will help in membership drives, the selection of speakers for SVU Congresses, and the identification of experts for specific tasks (for example the review and editing of manuscripts). The inventory will also be of assistance during the preparation of Who’s Who Among Czechs and Slovaks Abroad, which has been in the planning stage for a number of years, but has never gotten off the ground because of the lack of just such basic data. The members of the SVU Executive Board hope that the undertaking will receive full support from both Society members and other interested parties with access to relevant information. There are numerous sources. Specialists in a given discipline know of other countrymen among their peers, either from direct contact or from reading the literature. Information about prominent individuals of Czechoslovak descent can also be found in numerous specialized professional biographical dictionaries or directories of professional organizations as well as in various national and regional Who’s Who-type publications. In addition, local newspapers, radio or TV often report on accomplishments of individuals in various fields of endeavor, indicating their ethnic origin. The Executive Board is thus appealing to all interested parties to assist the Society in the systematic identification of persons of Czechoslovak descent and/or professionals interested in Czechoslovak matters. The inventory will have immense value not merely for the Society alone, but the Czechoslovak community abroad as a whole. Specific suggestions or names of volunteers are most welcome. Information or inquiries should be addressed to: Dr. Miloslav Rechcigl, Jr., 1703 Mark Lane, Rockville, MD 20852. ★ See Bulletin I, 1, January 1980 for Miloslav Rechcigl. ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ Personalia We continue introducing members of the Board, contributors to the Bulletin, and others as they respond to our request for autobiographical information. Karel B. Absolon, M.D., Ph.D. - Plumber of the Cardiovascular System, Vice-President of SVU, Professor of Surgery, University of Illinois The First Vice-President of SVU is more than a plumber-surgeon. He states that he is not actually the First Vice-President, but is only listed first as his name starts with an “A.” Presently he is organizing the English organ of the SVU, the journal Cosmas mentioned above. He will give us more details about it next time. 6 [pageend6]Absolon divides his first 120 publications and books into three groups. Approximately one third are devoted to clinical issues, one third to experimental surgical matter, and one third to cultural items, including Johannes Brahms and music. His trilogy on Theodore Billroth, the famed Viennese surgeon who had such great influence on medicine in Bohemia- Moravia and who developed many of the twentieth-century practices of surgery, has won world-wide acclaim. In the past issue of the Bulletin we reported on the first volume. The second volume is now available (see bibliography). Absolon published his first scientific paper at the age of 14 in the Prague journal Vesmír, then under the editorship of the unforgettable Czech biologist Bohuslav Nemec. Clearly, it was influenced by his famed father Karel Absolon, the discoverer if the Macocha caves in Moravia, the classical 30,000-year-old Vesto ce statuettes, a group of musical instruments of the same age, ana >f some 400 new speleofauna. “Young” Absolon’s philosophy of investigation must also have been influenced by his great-grandfather Jindřich Wankel, physician and founder of Central- European prehistory (as the Danish scientist Stenstrop once stated.) Absolon received his M.D. degree from Yale University (1952) and M.A. and Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis (1963). The combination of degrees started him on a career of “scientist-clinician- educator,” according to Owen H. Wangensteen, the recently deceased giant of medicine at the University of Minnesota. His thesis at Yale was dedicated to Frantisek Neumann, his tutor in Pathology at Masaryk University in Brno, from which Absolon was unceremoniously dismissed in the turbulent times of 1948. When asked “Why did you go to Yale?” Absolon answers, “Siberia had a peculiar chill.” His Minnesota thesis and dissertation, under the guidance of the Mayo Clinic, confirmed his belief that medicine can and must be advanced. After founding open heart surgery programs in Dallas and Washington, D.C., he became Academic Chairman of Surgery at the University of Illinois (Urbana) and chief surgeon at the Veterans Administration Hospital there. He was a pioneer in coronary bypass surgery (1954), an operation presently more commonly performed than operations for hernia or appendicitis. He was the first to do liver transplantations in children (1963) and soon his renown had reached all corners of the globe. His technique of esophageal (gullet) replacement with intestinal grafts was a first for certain diseases (1968). So says Who’s Who in Science and Who’s Who in America. Presently Karel Absolon is directing the artificial heart program at the National Institute of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. “This is a new technology that we can conquer,” the optimistic Absolon states. “It won’t give us eternal life, but it will allow us to live better for a longer time. We also must consider the ethical implications of the issue. Absolon is a member of a number of learned societies throughout the world, and his books have been translated into many languages, even Chinese. If you want to know more about our Vice-President Karel B. Absolon, reach for the Surgeon’s Surgeon, his book on his alter ego, Theodore Billroth. An extensive review of the first volume by Stacey B. Day, M.D., will appear soon in Health Communications. ★ ★ ★ 7 [pageend7]Dr. Frank Meissner, Agricultural Marketing Economist of the Inter-American Development Bank and 1974-78 SVU Treasurer When the Editor asked me to submit my personal data for publication in the Bulletin, it suddenly occurred to me that at least ten of my Czechoslovak emigre colleagues have chosen to follow careers in the four major international development agencies headquartered in Washington, D.C. Eight of them have belonged to SVU, four before their untimely death. In alphabetical order the agencies are: Agency for International Development (USAID): Miloslav Rechcigl; International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank): John Adler and Antonin Basch; Inter-American Development Bank (IDB): Pavel Ehrlich, Milic Kybal, Patrick Lichner and Frank Meissner; and International Monetary Fund: Alexander Kafka, Jan Mládek and Ernest Sturc. I asked myself whether this was a random occurence or whether our overal experience predisposed us for work related to economic development of Third World Countries. Let me review my own trajectory and see what tentative hypotheses we can generate. 1. Bilingual Upbringing as Member of Minority Group I was born on September 28, 1923 in Trest (Triesch), an industrial town of about 5,000 inhabitants, located some 12 km from the old silver mining town of Jihlava (Iglau) in the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands, halfway between Vienna and Prague. Trest was founded in the mid-thirteenth century as an entrepot (warehouse) town; etymologists trace the name to trziste or market place. Although over 90% of the population was traditionally Czech, the local agricultural sector was dominated by the large landed estates of the von Sternbachs, hereditary German-Austrian aristocracy. The Meissner household was bilingual. My father had attended German schools and spoke mostly German; my mother and her father who lived with us, had gone to Czech schools and spoke mostly Czech. My brother and I were brought up bilingually. I had my first sudden insight when my first-grade teacher unscrambled the linguistic mixup by making me aware of the difference between German and Czech. That was my first official exposure to cultural differentiation and pluralism. The second cross-cultural confrontation arose when I had to learn to cope with antisemitism, i was obviously Jewish, a fact one could not hide in a small town where everybody knew everybody else. Furthermore, my father was the president of the Jewish religious community, the third generation of Meissners in that post. The discrimination was mostly subtle, though occasionally not so. In any case, those socio-economic surroundings turned out to be a first class training for international civil service. 2. Environment of Entrepreneurship By the turn of the century Trest has become a relatively prosperous industrial island in the predominantly forest covered highlands. The harsh climate (the highlands are often referred to as Moravian Siberia) and poor soil made for low productivity and much rural poverty. s [pageend8]Among the entrepreneurs who built bridges beween poor agriculture and relatively prosperous industry there were several members of my family. The extended family of the Meissners and the Gruenbergers (my mother’s side) set up a wood processing factory (clogs, furniture, matches) and a factory producing special machinery for butchers and bakers. Those members of the clan who could not find suitable employment in Trest sought opportunities elsewhere: a banker in Prague; merchants in Vienna, Brno and Bielsko (Poland); lawyers in Brno and Olomouc. The most venturesome one ended up in North America. Among the industrialists of Trest were the two generations of Schumpeters who created the local textile industry. They also brought forth Joseph Alois Schumpeter, the famous Harvard economics professor who “invented” the theory of economic development. Perhaps he was subconsciously inspired by the business organizations set up by his family, as well as by the highly innovative forms of worker-owned garment and furniture manufacturing enterprises. I use the term “subconsciously” advisedly because for one reason or other, Professor Schumpeter never once referred to Trest in his voluminous writings about entrepreneurship and socioeconomic development. 3. Travel - Some Voluntary, Mostly Not At the age of eight I first went abroad to visit my uncle in nearby Vienna; at the age of nine I spent the summer in Bled (Yugoslavia); at ten I went to a summer camp on the Adriatic Coast (Grado near Venice), and the year after to Tobelbad, a spa in Southern Austria. At eleven I moved away from home to attend high school in Jihlava, the county seat. Flunking out of the tenth grade (nowadays it is called “dropping out”), I became a lathe operator apprentice in my uncle’.s machine factory in Trest. In October 1939, as a member of Zionist youth movement, I went to Denmark to learn agriculture in preparation for emigrating to Palestine, now Israel. After the Wehrmacht occupied Denmark, I escaped in A fishing boat to Sweden, where I got a job at the Agricultural College at Uppsala University. In 1943 I volunteered for the Czechoslovak Armed Forces in Great Britain. After a couple of years in the 111th Squadron (Czechoslovak) of the Royal Air Force (RAF) I was repatriated to Denmark. My entire family had perished in German concentration camps, so there was little to go back to in Czechoslovakia. Nonetheless, early in 1948, after obtaining a B.Sc. in agronomy from the Royal Danish Agricultural University I returned to Prague as a reporter for the Czech Agricultural Gazette (Zemedelske noviny). That was a bad time for homecoming. In mid-1948, I grabbed the opportunity to come to the United States to do graduate work at Iowa State University, where I got my M.S. in agricultural economics. For a year I taught for the Veterans Administration G.I. On-Farm Training Program in, of all places, Denmark, Iowa. In 1951 I “emigrated” to the West Coast, where I studied and worked at the Giannini Foundation at the University of California in Berkeley and Davis; met gnd married Margit, a Morawetz from Prague; then moved across the country to Cornell University where I got a Ph.D. in marketing in 1956. It was at Cornell that I got to know Eva and Miloslav Rechcigl who subsequently became prominent leaders of SVU. 9 [pageend9]Mv first full-time iob was as market researcher with Crown-Zellerbach in San Francisco, one ot me largest manuracimers oi paper and pulp. Between 1959 and 1963 I worked as a consultant at Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in Menlo Park, California and taught, first at University of California in San Jose and then San Francisco. In short, since I left home at age of eleven, I have been on the go. Out of necessity I have continuously had to cope with different environments, customs, languages. Whether I liked it or not, I caught the travel bug early. When in 1963 the United Nations asked me to go on a Productivity Mission to Poland, my answer was “yes.” It so happened that in the end it was Buenos Aires, not Warsaw. A nine-month appointment turned into four years, and I became hooked on international civil service work. My next destination was the Latin American Group of W. R. Grace & Co., a New York based multinational company in chemical and consumer goods industries. For three years I virtually commuted between New York and T ima, Peru. That became a bit too much travel even for my taste, so in Í969 í therefore accepted a job offer from the Agricultural Projects Division of the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington, D.C. After a dozen years of challenging work, involving about three months of travel annually, I continue to enjoy myself and am looking forward to working on Third World problems as long as I can. 4. A Hypothesis Confirmed International civil service is a constant exercise in instant, unexpected adaptation to different modes of thinking. It involves careful listening, receptivity to subtle signals of non-verbal communication, and encouragement of constructive innovations in rradition-prone socio-economic environments. In retrospect I find that my background trained me reasonably well for this type of work: (a) bilingual Czech-German upbringing as a member of an ethnic-religious minority opened my eyes early in the game; (b) the family tradition of entrepreneurship demonstrated to me clearly that God helps those who help themselves; and (c) frequent moving from place to place and country to country was excellent in-service training for coping with cultural differences. I find traces of similar attributes in other Czechoslovak colleagues who chose careers in development. Incidentally my wife Margit, son Paul and daughter A me are equally internationally inclined. Indeed it seems that the predisposition for development work is contagious: on July 4, 1981 my son Paul was sworn in as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Ecuador, NEWS RECEIVED An exhibition of Contemporary Posters from Czechoslovakia is being held at the Main Building of the Newark Public Library, 5 Washington Street, in downtown Newark, New Jersey, from October 1 through December 31, 1981. The exhibition was assembled and lent by Zdenka Winters (Montclair State College) and Stanley B. Winters (New Jersey Institute of Technology), and was mounted by the Art and Music Department of the Library. 10 [pageend10]Assistance Wanted Jan Loewenbach Graduate Scholarship in Musicology A scholarship for research in Czechoslovak music has recently been established by the Department of Music, San Diego State University. The Jan Loewenbach Graduate Scholarship in Musicology in Czechoslovak Music will assist graduate students in the study of Czechoslovak music, initially working with the Loewenbach Collection at the university. Students applying are advised to acquire some linguistic background in Czech or Slovak. Initial funds for the scholarship have been provided by Karel and Vera Bala. Additional funds to establish a permanent endowment are now needed. Tax deductible donations may be made to: Loewenbach Scholarship Alumni and Associates San Diego State University San Diego, CA 92182-1900 Additional information may be obtained from Dr. Jaroslav Mraček, Department of Music, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA 92182-0217. ★ ★ ★ The Jan Zahradniček Literary Fund SVU member Jiřina Fuchs announces on behalf of the Czechoslovak Culture Club in Los Angeles that she is working on establishing a Jan Zahradniček Literary Fund whose purpose is to award prizes to promising new Czech poetic work as selected by a jury of exile literary and cultural experts. Zahradniček (1905-1960) is an important modern poet who maintained the ideals of Czechoslovak culture even under the most difficult cirumstances. Tax deductible contributions may be sent to: Czechoslovak Culture Club, Fond J.Z., 3564 S. Barrington Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90066. ★ ★ ★ Kokoschka Correspondence For a planned edition of an Oskar Kokoschka Correspondence information about or photocopies of letters are requested by: Olda Kokoschka, 1844 Villeneuve (Vaud), Switzerland, and Heinz Spielmann, Museum fuer Kunst und Gewerbe, 2000 Hamburg, Steintorplatz, West Germany. See Bulletin I, 2, May 1980 for the obituary of this famous painter and honorary SVU member. Organizers of the special Kokoschka exhibition in 1968, on the occasion of the Fourth World Congress of SVU, please look through your files. ★ ★ ★ 11 [pageend11]It seems appropriate to introduce the persons involved in the above requests and announcements. Jan Loewenbach, an honorary member of SVU, was born on April 29, 1880 in Rychnov nad Kněžnou. He studied law, but music was a strong avocation. Combining the two areas of interest led, on the one hand, to a specialization in copyright law - he represented many of the prominent Czechoslovak composers - and to extensive music criticism and scholarship on the other. Dr. Loewenbach was also very active in musical organizations such as the Umelecká Beseda and its publishing division, the Hudební Matice; the Club of Czechoslovak Composers, which he himself founded; the International Society for Contemporary Music, and others. He and his family left Czechoslovakia before the Nazi occupation and lived for short periods in Switzerland, England and Cuba. Finally, in 1941, they settled in New York, where Dr. Loewenbach worked as press attache of the Czechoslovak Consulate during WWII. In 1946 Dr. and Ms. Loewenbach returned to Czechoslovakia, only to leave again in 1948. From the time he returned to New York until his death on August 13, 1972 he and his wife lived in semi-retirement. After Ms. Vilma Loewenbach’s death their daughter, Vera Bala now living in Canada, donated his papers and memorabilia through the SVU music section to the Malcolm A. Love Library of San Diego State University. Jan Loewenbach wrote criticism for a number of dailies and scholarly articles for many music journals in Czechoslovakia. Later he contributed to New York Times, Musical Quarterly, Musical America, the British Slavonic Review, etc., mainly on Czechoslovak music. He is also the author of several entries in the Encyclopedia Americana. Among his larger studies are: Music in Independent Czechoslovakia (Prague, 1931, in Czech), Czechoslovak Music (New York, 1941), B. Smetana -- Genius of a Freedom Loving People (Washington, D.C., 1943), “Dvorak’s Significance in the Development of American Music” (in Tempo, 1946/47, in Czech), and many articles on Smetana, Dvorak, Novak, Suk, and other twentieth century Czech composers. He also translated some Czech vocal works into German and several works from German or English into Czech. He is the author of the librettos for Martinu’s opera The Soldier and the Dancer (1928) and Kricka’s The White Gentleman (1929). In addition to his writings he constantly promoted Czech music through lectures, exhibitions and organization of performances (e.g., of Dvorak’s Rusalka in Detroit and several of Janacek’s compositions in New York). His literary pseudonym was J. L. Budin. ZEF ★ ★ ★ Canadian born Jaroslav Mraček, Professor of Music at San Diego State University and SVU member, studied history of music and piano at the University of Toronto and earned his Ph.D. in musicology from the Indiana University in 1965. His major research was published in book form 12 [pageend12]under the title Seventeenth-Century Instrumental Dance Music in Uppsala University Library Instr. Mus. hs 409. Monumenta Musicae Svecicae. Volume 8. Stockholm: Editions Reimers, 1976. It is an edition and study of 213 compositions which form a repertoire recorded by Gustaf Dueben in Stockholm between 1650 and 1662. Among other works the edition contains the music of the French string orchestra at the Swedish Court of Queen Kristina. These French dances were originally performed at the courts of Louis XIII and Louis XIV, and the French manuscripts were destroyed during the French Revolution. Consequently, the music preserved in the Uppsala manuscript is unique. Dr. Mraček has recently contributed to the “New Grove’s” and coordinated with his colleagues the “San Diego State University Musicology Lectures” and “Colloquium & Workshop on Early Music Performance Practice” (October-Noven.I r 1981). His lecture in this series was “Castles, Cathedrals and Courts as S< urces for Music.” Another of his areas of research has been for several years the Czech Rorate chants. In May 1980 he presented the lecture “National Elements in Sixteenth-Century Rorate Chants” at the University in Ljubljana. He is also interested in the music of Janacek. In connection with the centenary of Jan Loewenbach’s birth he spoke on “The American Papers of J. L. (1880-1972) at San Diego State University” at the Tenth Congress of SVU (October 1980); and “J. L. in America. Music Critic, Author and Publicist” for the Los Angeles SVU Chapter (January 1981), as well as for the joint meeting of Northern California and Pacific Southwest Chapters of the American Musicological Society (April 1981). His efforts for establishing the Loewenbach Scholarship deserve the support of all friends of Czechoslovak music. ★ ★ ★ ZEF Jiřina Fuchs is a poet and the editor of Framar Publishers in Los Angeles (Box 66453, Los Angeles, CA 90066). She writes mostly in Czech and produces slim, graphically striking volumes that are of special interest to bibliophiles. One of her collaborators is Jiri Karger, a creative director at CBS Television, another Angeleno and SVU member. One of her collections is bilingual, however. She says about An American Baedeker (1975): “My decision to publish my first collection bilingually is based on the nature of the poems themselves. As a writer I thank Czechoslovakia for my childhood, my thousand-year old cultural heritage, and for the Czech language which, for better or worse, has become the tool of my artistic expression. To America I am grateful for my education (which for political reasons my country refused me), for the roof over my refugee head, and for the glorious freedom of action, thought and expression without which my Czech as a creative tool would be a wasted gift. Because the poems included in this book reflect the influences of my Czech origins as well as those of my present American environment, I felt they should be published in both languages.” She certainly uses her American freedom well, as her involvement in the community shows. She recently read her poem “Miracle” from the above collection, in Czech and English, during a very unusual event that took place on June 22 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. That day 9,700 immigrants became U.S. citizens in the largest oath-taking ceremony in history. In the Pre-Ceremony Tribute to New Citizens various musical and dance groups performed, and poems trom the Fifth Street Studio Theater’s 13 [pageend13]Original Language Poetry Series were read. We are proud that Czechoslovakia was represented along with Mexico, the Phillipines, Russia, Poland, Vietnam, Korea and India. Here is a shorter sample of Jiřina Fuchs’ poetry in English. ZEF The Street (1968) A colorful sunny day The world is folding itself into a poem A whitish caterpillar of a school bus slowly digests its variegated content In modest shadows of daring miniskirts you guilelessly sense all of the world’s seven wonders The inspiration like the proverbial winged horse is settling on top of the traffic policeman’s helmet yawns From the station a humming bee swarm spills over the parking lot I am heading West Under me toward the East i^arth rushes merrily ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ What’s Your Thing? Here is the continuation of “our things” for your interest. We plan to enlarge this section in terms of both categories and information. The Secretary General, all officers of the Society and the editors of this Bulletin (all of whose addresses appear on the first page) will be glad to serve as liaisons between SVU members and interested readers. Communication is one of our main aims. Masaryk Studies We may, perhaps, consign to Tomas (Thomas) Garrigue Masaryk (1850-1937) the historical position of a George Washington. Liberator President, State-Builder President, “Little Father Masaryk” are some of the epithets given to this pivotal personality of Czechoslovak history, who has been the object of continuous research and commemoration among the Czechoslovaks. The fact that T.G.M. belongs to relatively recent history only partly explains the continued interest in him, his philosophy and life. Masaryk’s Republic lasted only twenty years (1918-1938). If we compare that with the more than two hundred years of growth given to Washington’s republic, we will perhaps understand the depth of disappointment of the small nation that had firmly believed in the right of self-determination, democracy, freedom of thought and other ideals — and was overrun by the unpredic- 14 [pageend14]table events of the fast-moving twentieth century. In this light the First Czechoslovak Reoublic appears in retrospect as a kind of experiment to realize the Platonic ideal of a tree state led by a ‘"philosopher king,”, i.e., a highly mature and moral personality not interested in and even somewhat naive about the intricacies of violently irrational and implacable power struggles. Masaryk became a symbol -- almost a myth - for the “republican generation” nurtured by his teachings, but now a critical and often painful scrutiny of his opinions and practical decisions is goine on. All too frequently his precious “good” did not prevail in the face of the “evil.” One hundred thirty years after his birth we must accept the unfortunate conclusion that Masaryk’s motto “Truth will prevail,” the motto of the First Czechoslovak Republic, does not always work in practice, and that the reality of human life and national existence is a good deal harsher. A new publication, Tomas G. Masaryk 1850-1937. A Selective List of Reading Materials in English, compiled by SVU member George J. Kovtun and published by the European Division, Library of Congress (Washington 1981, 26 p.) is a valuable bibliographic aid and a pictorial document. It has three parts: “Writings by T. G. Masaryk,” “Writings About T. G. Masaryk,” and “The American Press, 1918.” The latter quotes the headlines relating to Masaryk’s efforts to achieve recognition of Czechoslovak independence. The bibliography includes all types of Masaryk documentation in English until 1978. One of the latest entries is recent thesis (1976) from the University of California, Berkeley, on “T. G. Masaryk, Educator of a Nation.” SVU member Josef Kalvoda (Saint Joseph College, West Hartford, CT) has published an article “Masaryk in America in 1918” in Jahrbuecher fuer Geschichte Osteuropas 27, pp. 85-99 (Wiesbaden: Steiner Verlag, 1979), using primary documents and showing a firm grasp on the literature. He specifically explores Masaryk’s dealings with President Wilson and Robert Lansing, Secretary of State; the so-called Tokyo Memorandum; the problematic Pittsburgh Agreement, and Masaryk’s contact with W. Somerset Maugham in St. Petrograd about the employment of the Czech Legion in Siberia. SVU has organized several Masaryk Conferences, e.g., a Harvard symposium and another one in Los Angeles (1975). A Conference in Interlaken, Switzerland, took place in May 1980, and Proměny (Metamorphoses) 17/4, 1980 published eight papers from it in Czech and one in German. We will comment next time on the just published book, T. G. Masaryk in Perspective, ed.. Milic Čapek and Karel Hruby. Among the contributors to this collection of essays are Roman Jakobson, Jan Patočka and Vaclav Cerny. Also on the occasion of the 130th anniversary the Paris Institut national d’Etudes slaves organized an international Masaryk Symposium in December 1980. The proceedings of this symposium are to be published soon. The Institute, founded from the initiative of the historian Ernest Denis, a close friend of Czechoslovakia, was opened on October 17, 1923 by the French President, and President Masaryk attended the ceremony. 15 [pageend15]A recent source in Czech are the articles “Masaryk, Benes, hrad” (“Masaryk, Benes, the Castle”), published in Studie (Studies), an organ of the Christian Academy in Rome, and reprinted in the monthly Ceske Sloyo (Munich). The author, Dr. Jaroslav Pechacek, 70, a retired journalist and editor/commentator of Radio Free Europe, has been living in New York .since 1975 and is a past editor of SVU Zprávy. He bases his study on documents collected by Dr. Jan Papanek, 85, until 1948 Czechoslovak delegate to the United Nations. The core of these documents is Masaryk’s letters to Edward Benes, which date from the late twenties and relate to political events then current. ZEf MUSIC * * * The concert pianist Rudolf Firkusny, an honorary member of SVU and for years a member of the Board, has recently published, in collaboration with Roland John Wiley (University of Michigan), an important review in Notes, Vol. 37, No. 4, June 1981. It concerns Piano Compositions by Leos Janacek, Series F, Volume 1 (1978) of the Complete Critical Edition, a joint publishing effort of Supraphon (Prague) and Baerenreiter (Kassel). The editors are Ludvik Kundera and Jarmil Burghauser, both well-known Czechoslovak musicians. The volume has an introduction and titles in Czech, German, English, French and Russian. All Janacek’s piano solo works, with some ealier versions, are included. The 52 pages of a critical commentary, however, are in Czech and German only. According to Firkusny knowledge of a supplemental volume, Edicni zasahy a smernice k notacni problematice klasiku 20. století (Editorial Principles and Directions Concerning Notational Problems of the Classics of the 20th Century) by Milan Sole and J. Burghauser, is essential for the understanding of the new edition. This important book (Prague: Supraphon, 1979) is in Czech, with rather skimpy summaries in German and English. It is well-known that Janacek tended to notate his compositions in an often idiosyncratic manner and made many changes as an afterthought. Firkusny who studied music with Janacek from the age of five had an opportunity to learn first hand authentic interpretation, for which the written notation was more often a mere approximation. He even owns a copy of On the Overgrown Path which “contains some corrections in Janacek’s own hand.” Yet he and all other Janacek interpreters have learned how to cope with the traditional printed scores. The new edition is attempting to achieve an unambiguous uniformity by making some drastic alterations, e.g., changing bar lines, key signatures, enharmonic accidentals, and expression marks, all characteristic of Janacek’s views of musical elements. Firkusny questions this new approach and gives detailed comparisons of particular pieces and specific passages. He finds the new edition misleading for a new interpreter and disconcerting tor those laminar wnn janacek’s music. He and his co-author conclude that “to the scholar, this edition promotes a willful departure from a composer’s original text in what is put forward as a critical, scholarly enterprise, a policy at best experimental, at worst of dubious validity.” We assume that these editorial principles apply to all other genres of the complete works and that they will provoke protests trom other Janacek connoisseurs of Firkusny’s artistic stature and integrity. 16 [pageend16]1 irkusny, whom Slonimsky in Baker’s6 , 1978, calls a “brilliant Czech pianist,’' has several currently available recordings completely devoted to Czech piano music. What follows is only a sampling. Leos Janacek, Complete Works for Piano Solo and with Instruments (Deutsche Gramophon 2707055, 2 records): Tema con Variazioni, On the Overgrown Path, Sonata “1.X.1905” and In the Mist. In Concertino and Capriccio he is joined by members of the Symphony Orchestra of the Bavarian Radio under the baton of Rafael Kubelik, another eminent honorary SVU member. Smetana, 10 Czech Dances (recorded 1974; Vox TV 34673, 1977) An earlier recording (mid-19. Ts), now a collector’s item. Dvorak, Piano Concerto in G -únor Vox QTV 34691 (1975) With Saint Louis Symphony C rchestra, Walter Susskind, Conductor. The original Dvorak version instead of the Vilem Kurz revision. Dvorak, Theme with Variations in A-flat Major, Op. 36; 3 Poetic Pictures, Op. 85; Silhouettes, Op. 8 (Candide CE 31067, 1972) Dvorak, Humoresques, Op. 101 and Mazurkas, Op. 56 (Can. 31070) Czech Piano Composers: Dussek, Piano Sonata in F-minor, Op. 77 (L’Invocation); Jiri Benda, Piano Sonata No. 9, in A minor; Vorisek, Impromptu No. 4 in A major, Op. 7; Tomasek, Eglogue No. 2 in F major, Op. 35. According to R. Firkusny, “in spite of the international environment in which these composers lived, many of the Czech elements prevailed in their music.” Rudolf Firkusny’s career does not need retelling here in detail. He studied in Brno (with Janacek and Ružena Kurz) and in Prague (with Rudolf Karel, Josef Suk and Vilem Kurz among his teachers). Later he associated himself with Arthur Schnabel’s summer master class. His first public concert took place in Prague when he was only eight, and he appeared in Vienna three years later (1923). Berlin, Paris, Italy, London, and other international engagements soon followed. He made his U.S. debut in New York in 1938 and settled there in 1940 after an adventurous escape from Czechoslovakia through France, Spain and Lisbon. He maintains his permanent residence in New York, though concert tours through both Americas, Western Europe, Israel and Australia take him on the road most of his time. His repertoire covers all styles from classical to contemporary, with much emphasis on Czechoslovak music. It seems appropriate that he is a member of the world’s oldest active club for professional musicians, The Bohemians (founded in 1906), a club with strong philanthropic leanings. We wish Rudolf Firkusny continued good health, satisfaction from his untiring service to music, and a happy seventieth birthday on February 11, 1982‘ ZEF ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ 17 [pageend17]THEATER On July 1, 1981 George (Jiri) Voskovec died in his residence in the Los Angeles .area at the age of 76. He was born on June 19, 1905 at Sazava- Buda, the grandson of the Czech painter S. H. Pinkas and son of Vaclav Voskovec, a Czech military band leader. He attended school in Prague and graduated from the Lycee Carnot in Dijon. He started to study law at Charles University in Prague, but instead of becoming a lawyer he soon found himself in the theater with his classmate and friend Jan Werich (1905-1980, Prague). All those who remember him as one half of the V + W team of the Liberated Theater of the thirties will agree with the obituary in the Los Angeles Times that called him “a legend in his homeland.” In a sense neither he nor Werich achieved alone the popularity they achieved together in their high-spirited social and political satire of the pre-Munich era in free Czechoslovakia. Their anti-fascist songs were a source of encouragement to their countrymen during WWII, when V + W found asylum in the U.S. The pre-war V + W répertoire was reissued (1962) on records in Czechoslovakia to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the death of the composer Jaroslav Jezek (1906, Prague - 1942, New York), the third important creative spirit in their Liberated Theater. Their original revues combined elements of Brecht, Chaplin, Svejk, American jazz and pop, fun for fun’s sake and serious topical political events into an inimitable Czechoslovak comedy, but a comedy based on the premise that laughter is very close to tears. The retrospective showing of their pre-war films in New York a few years back was a great success despite the cultural distance. After the war V + W went back to Czechoslovakia, but the atmosphere had changed. In 1950 Jiri Voskovec left again, never to return, first settling in Paris and then managing to enter the United States and build a new career in American theater, film and television. He became an American Citizen in 1955. He had lived in Los Angeles since 1979 with his wife and was for some time a member of SVU. Among his most famous theatrical roles here were those of the title character in Chekhov’s Uncle Vanya (1956) and Dag Hammerskjold in Murderous Angels (1970). He acted in such films as Twelve Angry Men, The Spy Who Came in From the Cold, The Iceman Cometh. Only recently he had portrayed Fritz Bremer, the fabulous chef in the Nero Wolfe TV series. He was writing his memoirs to be published by the 68 Publishers, but never seemed to be able to complete them to his satisfaction. See also a personal memory of him in the Reminiscences section.

HOW I MET GEORGE VOSKOVEC To my generation Jiri Voskovec is a legend. We never saw him perform on stage back home because while we were in kindergarten, he was in his second exile, beginning the second chapter of his life, no less monumental than the first. Yet we had come to know and love him. He stayed among us in the films he made with Werich, and by some strange, inexplicable process of cultural osmosis we came to know their songs. I never consciously learned them; I’ve simply known them as far back as I can remember Later, when the cultural climate in Czechoslovakia began to mellow, we read about his roles in American films, on Broadway, on television, and when we joined him here, in exile, his name, which back home had reminded us of the world he conquered with his art, reminded us, paradoxically enough, of home and the cultural past he had so profoundly influenced. In my mind Jiri Voskovec and George Voskovec are two different people. Jiri Voskovec is a remote, revered, wise, almost sacred personage who remembe-cd everything, had been through everything: the First World War, the twenties, the thirties, dada, V + W, the Liberated Theater He had had a hand in creating much of what we had only read about. And he was our Chaplin. Of course, his devices were different, uniquely his own, but he was essentially made of the same stuff, the stuff that lends the person possessing it something that cannot simply be acquired, learned, or bought: an ever-present air of distinction. George Voskovec, however, is very different. He is a man whose last concern in the world is his eminence in the Czech theater He is much too preoccupied with the here and now to think back. He is not at all remote; he puts you right at ease with one look of his warm, sensitive, yet deeply penetrating eyes. He is brilliant without being pompous, witty without being flip; his language is down to earth, yet consistently maintains a level of understated elegance that throughout the years has become the hallmark of the Voskovec style. But ah, those eyes, there they are again. Those warm brown eyes that underscore all he says with attention, amusement, concentration. Yes, it is in those eyes that Jiri Voskovec the legend and George Voskovec the reality come together in a unique, charismatic whole. I had the rare privilege of observing those eyes for the duration of one evening. And I seemed to find in them both past and present, wisdom and impatience, awareness of the presence of evil in this world and an iron determination to conquer it. On one’s own terms. Over and over. With a laugh or two. It was a great pleasure to have met you, Mr. Voskovec.
