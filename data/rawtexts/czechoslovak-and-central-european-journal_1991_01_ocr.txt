[pageend4]Comenius the Chiliast Radim Palouš Comenius was convinced that God, having created the world in a divine manner, gave man, His image, a divine attribute: the freedom to refer beyond himself to his Creator. But man went astray and succumbed to the devil’s wiles. The world was corrupted, the ideal of Creation violated, and God’s work remained open, in need of completion. If the world was to be made complete, however, man had to be made better. Hence Comenius devoted his life to the emendatio rerum humanarum, the betterment or reform of human affairs. But Comenius’s extremely intense life work had another strong impetus: he felt that the time for change had ripened during his lifetime and that there was an urgent need to stamp out the powers of darkness and usher in the way of light, the via lucis. Comenius saw his age as a decisive moment in world history, as a unique /caipoç in the history of the world. The millennium, Christ’s prophesied reign on earth, was at hand, and all men were obliged to prepare for its historical reality as rapidly and effectively as possible by reforming both themselves and their fellow human beings. This chiliastic outlook was by no means unusual for the time. Comenius’s influential teacher Alsted also believed in the imminence of the millennium; he too was certain that the way of the world as it was then known was about to come to an end and that it would be superseded by another, more enlightened age.1 When Comenius called for reform, he meant universal reform, for the end of the world is nothing if not universal. According to the Czech philosopher Jan Patočka, Comenius first formulated his position in historical terms in the “Conatuum Comenianorum Praeludia” of 1637. Earlier, Comenius regarded the course of history as a constant alternation between decline and reform; thus, the Middle Ages represented a fall, the Reformation a rise. Not until the “Praeludia” did he refer to the time in which he lived as the “period of an aging world” when “a great world, a definitive world” was in the making.2 [pageend5]2 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l Human participation in this historical turning point was essential, Comenius felt, to ensure the successful consummation of Christ’s work, the return of mankind to God.3 It meant denying one’s individual self to follow Christ (Luke 9:23), that is, giving up a life of self-sufficiency for a “partnership” in God’s world, which he tried to show man in all its glory by means of pansophy and pampaedia.4 If Comenius saw the essence of Christ’s teaching in the summons “Turn and follow me!” it was because all those who did so would take part in reforming the world. According to his understanding of Christ’s message, Christians view the world not as a mere given but as a call to participation; the world can be worked on, made better.5 To those with ears to hear, Comenius said, Christ held out a historical space that eludes many theologians. Rather than the eschatological dimension, the belief in the heavenly kingdom of the saints, he emphasized Christ’s earthly rule, thus reviving the often forgotten Old Testament tradition—the Hebrew tradition very much alive in Christ’s teachings—which holds that the kingdom of heaven cannot be merely a resting place for those who have lived a righteous life but is created by the poor in spirit, the righteous, the persecuted, the meek; “for theirs is the kingdom of heaven” (Matthew 5:10).6 In Lux in tenebris Comenius deplored the fact that Christians wishing to avoid the Scylla of involvement in earthly affairs tended to take refuge in the Charybdis of eternity and the heavens instead of trusting in Christ’s reign on earth.7 He felt that the hour of need would come in his lifetime and that he, Comenius, had the ability and the obligation to provide mankind with an overall view of the integral nature, the oneness of the world and time. Pansophy would make the natural structure of the world visible, in both space and time, to a benighted mankind; it would demonstrate the unity of the universe that so fascinated the Platonists and that becomes in Comenius not merely the awareness of cosmic harmony but an invitation to mankind to take an active part in perfecting it. The true Christian, therefore, joins the followers of Christ who have taken part in building the kingdom of God and helped to create good and beauty on earth. The Renaissance feeling for human creativity found a late but ardent proponent in Comenius.8 And it was the power of human creativity that would be decisive in the historical turning point Comenius saw on the horizon. The general decline would come to an end, the human condition improve, death slowly be overcome, life triumph; the finite would lose its grip over the [pageend6]COMENIUS THE CHILIAST 3 world, being in time become infinite being. Others before Comenius had perceived an ascending-descending pattern in world events, but Comenius was the first to make recovery and rise a matter of human endeavor, of man’s ability to learn from the world and nature, imitate it with his artistry (ars) and perfect it where perfection was wanting. The entire universe was waiting for man to act. By ceasing to concentrate solely on one’s own affairs, one is not merely engaging in ascetic self-sacrifice, not merely undergoing an inner conversion, not merely devoting one’s life to fervent piety (and when we say “merely,” we are aware of the depths and hidden bonds inherent in ascetic isolation); one is turning to the world and its fate, embarking on a “secular pilgrimage,” entering a concrete creative community. Hence, Comenius viewed chiliasm, the hope in the imminent coming of Christ, as a call to action,9 much as he viewed his own life and work as a call to action. Comenius was also the first to combine chiliasm with the reform of science, religion, and politics.10 Conversion was not enough; man needed to contribute to the perfection or completion of the things of the world. Comenius, for all his activity, for all his genius, could not “complete history” because everything he did was merely a contribution to the theatrum mundi\ though very much an actor rather than a spectator, he was merely a single participant. It is not a matter of chance that “his magnum opus remained unfinished: he was deeply convinced that it was dependent upon temporal developments that were about to reach a turning point.”11 Although Comenius firmly believed that the kingdom of Christ was at hand, his chiliasm must not be confused with the rather eccentric ravings of some chiliasts. He did not treat his vision as doctrine, he did not claim it to be infallible or a Pythian projection of the future; he made his own case for it—going into historical symptoms, the state of human knowledge, and the reasons for the current crisis—then called for a “general discussion,” as he named one of his treatises. That his chiliasm was anti-utopian is a point often made.12 But it was also a practical guide to preparing for the end of the world and, more important, a pretext to articulate an all-encompassing plan for education. The subsequent development of educational theory and practice has shown how realistic the plan was. Comenius the chiliast, then, was very much concerned with reality, [pageend7]4 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l with the chain of day-to-day events and practical ways of dealing with them.13 His chiliasm was rational in both conception and formulation and had far more in common with philosophical speculation than with emotional effusion. It is closely related to Campanella’s notion of the world as the downward road (ij k ú t u óôóq)—recalling in turn the Neoplatonic disintegration of the world by stages: from the ideal world to the angelic world to the material world (mundus archetypus, mundus angelic- us, mundus materialis)—to which Comenius appended the upward road (ij o Vg j o'60'çj.14 Under the influence of German mysticism (Meister Eckhart, Jakob Böhme) he gave the Neoplatonic descent into the world of “shadows” a positive interpretation: shadows tell us something of their models, and that something is God’s true world; moreover, God’s world can be more than seen, it can be revived, revived by human activity. While maintaining the Neoplatonic view of the ideal, Comenius transformed the passivity of the world of shadows into the activity of human endeavor and offered the world the possibility of reform, of a better future. The meaning of education for Comenius stemmed from its role in the betterment of man once the world had reached its historical turning point. The knowledge imparted by pampaedia was to be as broad, as universal as possible, its goal being eternity. It was meant to teach man to fulfill his role in history, not to perform specific tasks in society or the natural world. Knowledge lacking the catholicity provided by this higher goal was senseless—if not on a quotidian basis then in the broader scheme of things. If human knowledge did not keep time with the world clock, if it did not form an integral, active part of the theatrum mundi, then it was vanity itself, all the more so in the light of the catharsis that the human factor could provide. Given this ideal of education and the educated, the eschatological expectation of Christ’s coming led Comenius away from quietistic passivity to pansophy, that is, knowledge actively converting the world of finality to eternity.15 Thus, a philosophy of history based on the progression paradise/ruin/reform, where the reform takes place here below, was as important for Comenius’s didactic writings as for his writings in other areas. Education was to begin with the young, who were to be “instructed in all wisdom and in the true knowledge of God and all His deeds and thereby truly enlightened by the true light of true wisdom.”16 Education of this sort would benefit parents, teachers, schools, children, the com- [pageend8]COMENIUS THE CHILIAST 5 munity, the church, the nation, and the heavens.17 By introducing it as “the art of skillful teaching,” he is referring obliquely to the times being ripe for a major change. The reference is even clearer when he writes, “We give thanks unto God, who has now, after the erstwhile gloom of His wrath, begun to shine His sweet rays upon us.”18 Reform for Comenius meant more than what would occur at the turning point: reform was not the matter of a moment. True, we needed to renounce self-sufficiency and give ourselves over to God. But it was not enough to remove our spectacles of delusion and rub the scales from our eyes: the fate of the universe was at stake. What we needed was an entirely new orientation, an education encompassing all things around us, all parts of our lives. The world was given to us as more than a place to live; it was given to us as a school.19 A configuration of the world would serve as the basis for a configuration of reform, and since the opening scene in God’s theater was nature, man needed to learn nature’s secrets. The goal was not so much to dissect the natural world as to gain an insight into it, one which would reveal God’s ideas, the archetypal divinity embodied by nature, and the proto- structure of all being, and which would later serve as a model for human participation in the reform process and the continuation of the Creator’s work.20 The passing of time had a special meaning for Comenius: it was more than the continuous “and so on” of hour following hour, year following year, era following era; its rise and fall gave it a Koupóq of its own, and its non-secularized, religious quality opened the way for progress, a progression to something better—to the good, to perfection, to eternity—which, as Patočka has pointed out, Comenius expressly set forth in the Pansophiae Diatyposis of 1643-45.21 Reform then—the proper development of the world, progress towards a better future—required the rapid, effective emancipation of mankind. The time had come; God was about to be returned to humanity, to the world, and it was incumbent upon mankind to do its part. When Comenius spoke of omnes homines, he meant all Christians, his Europe not having attained the globality we expect of ours; similarly, his use of omnes and omnia (and the prefix pan-) reflects the usage of the times on the one hand and a certain hyperbolic spirit on the other. If we admire his pansophic vision today, it is not as an attempt to immure all the learning of his day in pansophy, the be-all and end-all of history and knowledge, [pageend9]6 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l but as evidence of a profound intuition for the oneness of creation. Further developments show that it opened up many aspects of reality formerly closed to those traditional European thinkers who preached that what was revealed by the Gospel was all that could be said about the world. Even so, we cannot accept Comenius’s pan- without reservations: history cannot be immured as Comenius envisioned it. Comenius intended to write a “panhistory,” which he first conceived as a summation of human knowledge but in the Consultatio transformed into a philosophy of history of cosmic dimensions.22 Even though a number of chiliasts, including Comenius, were inspired by Biblical quotations (and even such direct quotations of Christ as “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand” [Matthew 4:17]), chiliastic visions claimed to know what the Bible claimed to be unknowable (“But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only” [Matthew 24:36]). Comenius of course realized he was denied the “facts” concerning the end of the world. By citing Jesus’s answer to the apostles’ inquiry whether he intended to restore the kingdom to Israel (“It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power” [Acts 1:6-7]), he expressly acknowledged God’s will to secrecy. Yet he felt that investigating the auguries and harbingers was a show of “dutiful gratitude and respect” and a matter of “reaching out for God’s gifts” rather than an impropriety. All this may sound humble and pious, but the course of history shows that even such judicious musings encroached on forbidden territory and that despite the carefully garnered arguments in the Consultatio the turning point Comenius expected at any moment proved to be mere human speculation.23 Not only did Comenius see the end of the world at hand, he had a vision of a heaven on earth—the result of human initiative—immediately preceding it. He devoted Chapter Twenty-Six of the Consultatio to a description of “a better world or the blissful state of the world thus reformed.”24 All mankind would be enlightened by the true light and receive God’s instruction, there would be a universal body of educated people, and Israel would turn to its Redeemer; all kingdoms would become the kingdom of God, a kingdom of order and love with no burdens or plaints; all the earth would be a paradise “celebrating the great sabbath of the world.” But Comenius showed great optimism long before the end of his life [pageend10]COMENIUS THE CHILIAST 7 and the Consultatio. It ran all through his writings and leads Patočka to characterize his style as spell-binding. “What shall befall when all artisans, peasants, draymen, and even women are educated? I reply that each will have ample matter for thoughts, desires, efforts, and deeds... and that they will all know the direction in which to guide their actions and desires, the bounds within which to carry on their lives, and the means by which to defend their own place in the world.... In a word, they will learn to see God everywhere, to praise Him everywhere, to embrace Him everywhere, and thus make the best of our woeful life here below and look forward with greater hope and longing to life eternal.”25 And also: “If all this be found desirable, accepted, and put into practice, our schools shall flourish, our communities shall flourish, our church shall flourish, our nation shall flourish, the entire age to come shall flourish, flourish as gloriously as God’s beloved and glorious paradise.”26 To us this may sound more like devout euphoria than a sober political blueprint or prognosis of history. The centuries that separate us from Comenius have seen more than one fervently drafted “realistic” proposal for heaven on earth. Some have been so sober that they try to determine the “objective laws of history” and calculate even the consciousness necessary to involve the masses in creating the heaven promised them. But the people who make these proposals fail to account for the incalculable; they consciously reject the role of “higher forces,” scorn the transcendental. Their goal is to manipulate history. Everything must work on the level of the saeculum, that is, in a world without God. How does the eminently devout Comenius fit into the tradition of the heralds of heaven on earth who claim, “We have discovered the helm of history, and once we take it the world is ours?” How does he stand with the “Gnostic politics” of modernity, to use Eric Voegelin’s formulation?27 Clearly he is not an easy fit. Because his basic conception was religious rather than secular, his concern was to make the world God’s rather than ours. Yet he did feel he had the helm of his time in his hands: he believed he had diagnosed its ills, he believed a major turning point was at hand. What he shared with the “Gnostics”—the conviction of holding the key to the age and of grasping the ultimate form of history—bears a certain resemblance to elements in Descartes, whom Comenius otherwise roundly rejected. In Descartes the cogito or subject withdraws from the world; in Comenius the critic of history severs his ties with history to [pageend11]8 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l take up the elevated, divine position of the one who knows the measure of time. We have learned, through both scientific research and everyday experience, that we cannot withdraw from the world and its concerns, that we cannot maintain our distance and simply observe reality. (Not that Comenius was a disinterested onlooker; on the contrary, he felt he had been vouchsafed an important role in the world as evaluator and educator. There will be something vaguely analogous later in Hegel’s philosophy of history, where the spirit returns to itself, thereby completing its historical evolution.) If we are to remain loyal to our true condition, that is, our human condition, we have no choice but to remain “at home,” in the world, in history. Part of remaining in history consists of keeping an eye on the character of the times and an eye out for its critical moments; moreover, the Christian view has it that in a sense every moment is decisive for the fate of the world, that the kingdom of heaven is never far, that the coming of God’s kingdom means its pressing presence in every human and every now. But that is not the end of history. History is not the monotonous stream of one moment merging with the next; history has an agenda, a pattern all its own, and we can and must try to discern it if we want to play our parts to the best of our abilities. One of the missions of human thought is to conceptualize in terms of time, but there is no need to force it into a single, definitive view. Every thoughtful glance into the ocean of time both reveals and helps to create the features and structures enabling us to speak coherently of concepts like antiquity, the Middle Ages, and modernity. Today, at the end of the twentieth century, we clearly feel the age of modernity coming to a close. And if we sense the coming of a new age, a world age, we do not conceive of it as the ultimate paradise, an age of bliss, abundance, peace, and happiness; we merely wish to evoke the various associations that arise when we think back not only to the age we call modern but to the entire age we might call European.28 Today we can view the age coming to a close with considerable distance. One of its most outstanding features is that it has attempted to overcome the division of the world into “nature,” which only the natural sciences are fit to study, and “human nature,” which the scientific approach cannot exhaust because of its subjectivity. This attempt goes beyond a renewed involvement in the world and its vicissitudes to an integration of nature’s “objectivity” into what had until recently been the [pageend12]COMENIUS THE CHILIAST 9 exclusive province of subjectivity. The world is again emerging as an integral whole, its various elements—despite their great, impenetrable differences and inherently unique individualities—residing in a common home and revealing the same essential logos', they are analogous. In other words, the world is now coming to be perceived as and accepted as harmonious. In this context Comenius’s position acquires a timely character, more timely, in fact, than in his own day. At that time history stood on the brink of modernity, of the divided world, of the vertiginous experience of objective knowledge, which, much though it contributed to our understanding of the workings and structure of the world, deluded man into believing in the indifferent flow of a senseless universe. Comenius’s gropings, his attempts to make sense of historical periods, a sense that takes account of man and enables him to lead a purposeful existence, stands as a memento of something forgotten, even lost. More important, the sense he makes is not limited to mankind; it encompasses nature, the world, the universe. For all the reservations we may have about his chiliastic convictions about the crucial role of his time, his is a voice with a new poignancy. Indeed, the postmodern era of the world age shares Comenius’s proclivity for a synthetic understanding of the world: the world age claims genuine globality, a globality that goes beyond philosophical speculation to actual human existence on earth. While as recently as a hundred years ago there were uncharted regions on the globe, there is no longer a spot where the human eye cannot penetrate. The result is a new global perspective, a perspective of concrete globality. People can communicate across oceans, fly rapidly from any point to any other. Of course, the new globality has its negative aspects as well: besides opening up new prospects, it can cause damage on an unprecedented scale and tax nature’s ability to establish equilibrium to such an extent that irreversible catastrophes are now possible. Moreover, the overall perspective of the world age is gradually coming to include the space surrounding the globe, outer space. This whole, the universe, is becoming mankind’s true environment. The life-and-death interdependency of all creation is now obvious to a human race that until recently looked down on everything non-human as a collection of “objects” over which it held sway. Only now is it clear that we belong to everything as much as it belongs to us. Comenius’s view of history expresses substantially the same sense of [pageend13]10 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l belonging, the sense of belonging the coming age will impose on us. As we seek out the variables and constants of our works and days, as we look into the forms taken by various units of time, we, like Comenius, come up against the life-giving sense of reality without having to come up with a definitive mission for today in the chiliastic mode. Yet chiliasm has a healthy kernel we would do well to keep in mind, namely, not only the past elucidates the present, the future elucidates it as well. Just as the past is not “past” and thus over and done with but is “present”—vibrant, alive—in the influence it has on the theatrum mundi, so the future is not “merely” what is yet to be but is what as yet has no place in our here and now and nonetheless has a potent effect on our current choices, decisions, ventures, experiences. Hence, the future is very much a concrete part of the present. Mining the depths of the logos of time will never end; the depths of human activity are inexhaustible. New insights will lead to new truths about our age. Let us leave the last word to man’s devotion to an overall dramatic plot: the world is not an empty race from void to void; it is a magnificent theatrum with a beginning, middle, and end. Our task is to play our parts well and ensure the theater’s success. The dramatic plot is what excites us when we read Comenius and follow his thouhgts.

Woher bekommt er aber den ‘Bauplan,’ um neue Welten schaffen zu können? Auf diese Frage kann geantwortet werden: Die Welt wurde dem Menschen nicht nur zum Wohnort, sondern auch zur Schule bestimmt, und in dieser Schule wird er auf eine Sendung vorbereitet. Die erste Stufe neue Welten zu schaffen, heißt die Geheimnisse der Nature zu enthüllen. Die Natur entfaltet sich vor seinen Augen wie ein Theater Gottes, er strebt sie schauend zu verstehen und sie als lebendige harmonische Ordnung zu begreifen. Die Erkenntnis der Natur ist für Comenius keine deskriptive Analyse, sie ist eine Art des Schauens. Der tiefe Einblick in diese Ordnung enthüllt ihm die Ideenwelt des göttlichen Archetyps, die Urstruktur alles Seins, nach der die Welt von Gott geschaffen wurde und nach der neue Welten geschaffen werden können. Und von diesem Augenblick beginnt die Laufbahn des Menschen als eines Schöpfers und eröffnet ihm den Weg des Aufstieges zu höheren Welten und zur Vollendung des göttlichen Schöpfungswerkes. ” 21.

[pageend16]Josef Pekař: Interpreter of Czech History Milan Hauner Anniversaries, even if they are nicely rounded up to half-a-century since the death of the protagonist, should never serve as the main cause for celebration. In the case of Josef Pekař, however, to celebrate the anniversary is more than legitimate because over the last fifty years his name was not only neglected but became an object of outright slander. The campaign of defamation and calumny reached its lowest point after the Communist takeover in 1948, when Pekař and his entire conservative school of historians were given the worst possible names and his pupils were driven out of university positions into exile or, worse, imprisonment. Thus the Communist historian Jan Pachta castigated Pekař in his notorious pamphlet of 1950 as the chief class enemy in the guild of “our bourgeois historiography,” whose capital sin consisted of down-playing the heroic Hussite epoch and of depicting the “doba temna” (Age of Darkness)—the period of Catholic Counter-Reformation following the Battle of the White Mountain of 1620—as a culturally and economically flourishing stage in the development of the Czech nation. “Pekař’s views,” continued Pachta, “served the exploiters... weakened the resistance of our people and prepared the conditions for the arrival of Hitler...”1 Who was this remarkable magician endowed with such interpretative skills that he could change the significance of historical events by the mere scratch of his powerful pen, and whose name the high school students in Czechoslovakia heard for forty years in a pejorative association only, and whose books they were not permitted to read? Let me give you, at this juncture, some of my own symbolic reminiscences connected with the name of Pekař as I experienced them inside Czechoslovakia [pageend17]14 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l between the late 1950s and 1960s. The first image I have is that of a high-school student for whom the name Pekař was an official anathema. Our teachers loaded his name with so many slanderous epithets that we never dared ask why. Briefly, Pekař was an evil spirit who refused to interpret the “Age of Darkness” as a historical digression, and whose mortal sins could be found classified in alphabetical order in Jan Pachta’s pamphlet. The second image is a very special, even intimate, one because it has to do with my real discovery of Pekař through semi-clandestine reading of Kniha o Kosti, perhaps his most beautiful and popular work. In this book, Pekař depicts the “Age of Darkness,” the same era which I was invariably instructed to describe as the era of historical decline, ruthless exploitation, and stagnation in the development of Czech language and culture due to the influence of the alien form of Baroque with its pompous and decadent style. What a contrast I found in Pekař’s book on Kost! There was no cliché of a self-perpetuating class war between the nobles and their subjects; there was, instead, a picture of much more complex relationships: men and women full of blood, rich and colorful portraits supplied with an endless stream of quotes and figures from contemporary sources, all wonderfully integrated by Pekař’s masterful and elegant command of the Czech language. My third image of Pekař, or rather of his spirit as manifested through the deeds of others, was quite unique, given the date, which I remember very well. It was during the first week of October 1957—when Pekař was, of course, still persona non grata in Czechoslovakia—on the day of my matriculation at the Faculty of Philosophy, as we say over there, at Charles University in Prague, when the dean, Mirko Očadlík (1904- 1968), a music historian, began to address us freshmen. We anticipated that the dean would deliver the usual dull diatribes directed against bourgeois historiography and the need to follow the teachings of our elder Soviet brothers. Instead he surprised us with a rather charming story. The dean recalled his first day after matriculation, in the great institution called History Proseminar. In the auditorium, perhaps the very one in which we sat, the young arts students waited impatiently for the arrival of the well-known professor. At last, in sailed the stately body of the grandmaster, followed by a flotilla of assistant professors, each of them carrying stacks of books. He literally started throwing books at students, and each time a book landed in front of someone, he would announce the number of weeks when he expected a book review to be prepared. When [pageend18]Jo s e f Pe k a ř : In t e r pr e t e r o f Cz e c h His t o r y 15 the young Očadlík opened his assigned book, he found to his amazement that it was in Polish, a language he did not speak. He timidly raised his hand. “What is the matter, dear colleague?,” the grandmaster asked him in his firm voice. “Pane profesore, there must be a mistake. I’ve got a Polish book.” “And how many weeks did I assign you for the book review?” “Two weeks only, pane profesore.” “Well, that’s enough for you to learn a new language, my dear colleague.” “And that was it,” Dean Očadlík summed up his reminiscences which must have taken him more than thirty years back. “Pale as I was,” he continued, “I looked over my shoulder at my neighbor’s assignment and sighed with relief. At least my review book wasn’t in Portuguese.” Who was this strange professor, who behaved like a tyrant and yet impressed us with his high standards, we all asked the dean in unison. “Josef Pekař,” answered the dean, smiling broadly. Such was the contradictory world in which I was educated. My own teacher in the history proseminar was František Kutnar, who privately considered himself to be a devoted pupil and follower of Pekař, but seemed to have been so frightened by the Communists that he never dared to comment on his beloved teacher in front of us. But we surely received through Kutnar deep doses of pekařovština in the best meaning of the word, which survived the communist indoctrination. These doses consisted of a thorough linguistic and heuristic training, the trademark of the history proseminars which had been established under Jaroslav Goll during the 1890s, and where Pekař and his generation had been trained. The final two images of Pekař are interwoven. They lead from the Pekař Library in the Kinský Palace, where the books donated by the great historian were stored, in and around the office of Professor Polišenský, who was the first to ask me specific questions about Pekař’s interpretation of the Valdštejn conspiracy during one of my exams. It was not until the Prague Spring, however, that I witnessed the first genuine rehabilitation of Pekař.2 Several years later, when already in exile, I learned about the publication of a special volume which my teacher František Kutnar had lovingly prepared for the centennial anniversary of Pekař’s birth, and which must have only just escaped the re-activated censorship.3 There is no doubt that a tribute to Josef Pekař has been overdue by several decades. Apart from Kutnar’s volume and an earlier collection of reminiscences which appeared under the editorship of Rudolf Holinka in the year of Pekař’s death,4 we still do not have a full biography of Josef [pageend19]16 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l The reason that no study of Josef Pekař exists can be attributed to the true “age of darkness,” the Communist rule, but also to the complex problems of linking the controversial Pekař with the era of turbulent changes in Central Europe. Indeed, there are two contrasting ways, it seems to me, in which the great Czech historian can be commemorated: one is the way František Kutnar chose in the aforementioned collection, best described as pietistic; the second, which will be used here, must be based on a broad and comprehensive assessment of Pekař’s work in the context of his life as a historian, citizen, and patriot. This latter approach will have to fully recognize Pekar’s major ambivalent characteristic, namely that of a Catholic traditionalist, defender of the old land tenure system and the feudal Bohemian Constitution (České státní právo) who, at the same time, assumed the role of a systematic provocateur and great destroyer of national legends and myths.5 In sketching the career of the historian Pekař, I am deliberately laying a timeframe of six stages over his life, which Josef Šusta, Pekar’s colleague and Goll’s disciple as well, applied while presenting his masterful oration in memory of Josef Pekař in April 1937.6 How to Interpret Pekař Pekař, who was so significant in the political development of the Czech nation. Even his enemies could not deny that Josef Pekař was rightly called the greatest Czech historian since Palacký. There is no Czech historian who would not be attracted by his power to penetrate the “spirit of the epoch,” by the unique combination of analysis and synthesis in his work, and by his spirit which pioneered new insights in many fields, such as social studies and land tenure. He also developed an overall conceptual approach as he discussed the periodization of Czech history. Pekař, indeed, was the quintessential Czech historian of the 20th century. Pekar’s Lehrjahre The delineation of the first phase in Pekar’s creative life is not difficult; it includes his early works up to his nomination as docent (associate professor) in 1897, following the departure of Antonín Rezek from the chair of “Austrian History” which Pekař was to occupy at the Charles University for the rest of his life. (After 1918, the title of the chair was, [pageend20]Jo s e f Pe k a ř : In t e r pr e t e r o f Cz e c h His t o r y 17 as expected, changed to “Czechoslovak History.”) Already two years earlier, at the age of 25, Pekař published his first monograph, Dějiny Valdštejnského spiknutí 1630-1634, in which he demonstrated the qualities soon to become his trademark: a penetrating analysis of archival sources combined with a sensitive touch for the socio-psychological background of his main protagonists.7 During this period, Pekař still possessed his fighting spirit which marked the last stages of the campaign against the Manuscript Forgeries, which his university teacher Jaroslav Goll participated in, as did Jan Gebauer and T.G. Masaryk. Pekař resolutely voiced his criticism against national myths and legends, even when it made him unpopular and ran counter to the majority view. Although he stayed aloof from the great issues of the political struggle at the time, e.g. the language conflict between the Czechs and the Germans in Bohemia, or the fight for universal franchise, whenever the political issues involved strong historical references, say to Hussitism, the Reformation, or the Battle of the White Mountain, Pekař was quick to engage in long polemics. When the great German historian Theodor Mommsen attacked Czech nationalists as “the apostles of barbarism,”8 Pekař responded in a passionate defense reminding the neighboring Germans that it was Czech Reformation and Jan Hus who preceded German Protestantism and Martin Luther by a full hundred years and not the other way around. We shall never see Pekař again become so passionately embroiled in the defense of Hussitism and Czech Reformation.9 Pekař’s Lehrjahre,10 as Šusta calls this period of extended apprenticeship when remembering his older colleague, were to continue through the second stage, 1897-1902, which was earmarked by Pekař’s assuming the editorship of the Český časopis historický and by the impact he was to make on his students as a teacher. Although it was between 1900 and 1902 that he clashed, first with Jan Herben, and later with T.G. Masaryk himself, in an argument whereby he opposed the public cult of Jan Hus, Pekař did not yet want to be too much involved. Šusta considers two small works of Pekař as landmarks in his early career. His critical analysis of the Legend of Kristián challenged the established opinion of the revered Josef Dobrovský, who had considered the legend to be a fourteenth-century forgery. Pekař, contrary to Dobrovský, declared Kristián a genuine legend of the tenth century11—an event which led to some of the liveliest disputes in modem Czech historiography. The other early Pekař masterpiece, according to [pageend21]18 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l The following years, 1902-14, constituted the years of Pekaf’s “maturity” according to Šusta. To everyone’s surprise, Pekař produced Kniha o Kosti,13 which F.X. Šalda welcomed as a “beautiful and warm book... a song of praise and love” of the author’s native region in northwestern Bohemia.14 Even today, the book is one of the most readable works for a wide Czech audience by a professional historian. Extensively using patrimonial archives, Pekař succeeded splendidly in weaving together authentic documents, letters, accounts, bills of purchase, etc., to create a body-and-soul portrait of life in the castles and hamlets of northwest Bohemia during and after the Thirty Years’ War. His immersion into social and agrarian history of the era led logically to the publication of České katastry 1654-1789 in 1913 and 1915, in which he demonstrated how the ever-increasing tax burden imposed on the Bohemian Kingdom constituted by far the major financial contribution to the Habsburg state’s war chest. In Pekař’s unusually intimate and profound knowledge of the peasantry during the 17th and 18th centuries lay apparently the roots for his alleged rehabilitation of the “Age of Darkness.” In his Kniha o Kosti, but especially in his careful portrait of the Czech peasant and chronicler, František Jan Vavák, the bailiff of Milčice,15 Pekař showed that despite the destruction and terrible loss of population caused by the Thirty Years’ War and the Catholic Counter-Reformation, the bulk of the Czech peasantry was not only able to recuperate their losses and achieve a relative economic prosperity, but that it retained, though re-Catholicized, its Czech language and culture under the baroque layer, as the main source of the future National Revival (Národní obrození). Pekař again challenged the Czech majority opinion, fortified by the wide circulation of the historical novellas of the popular writer Alois Jirásek,16 by insisting and The Mature Historian Šusta, was a brief biography of Palacký, originally written for the Czech encyclopaedia Ottův slovník naučný12 in 1902. Both Pekař and Masaryk claimed Palacký as their spiritual teacher, but whereas Pekař selected as his idol the mature Palacký of the 1860s, the defender of the Czech historic constitution, Masaryk turned to Palacký of the revolutionary year 1848 as his model in order to emphasize the natural rights of the Czech nation over the historic Constitution of the Bohemian Estates. [pageend22]Jo s e f Pe k a ř : In t e r pr e t e r o f Cz e c h His t o r y 19 It was during this third phase, finally confronting several accusations thrown at him by the opposite camp led by Masaryk, that Pekař launched himself into the unending dispute about the “meaning of Czech history.”17 This dispute developed two points of view, one represented by Pekař, the other by Masaryk, about the origins and meaning of the Czech National Revival. Pekař tended to understate the Protestant tradition and emphasized the historic continuity and long-term impact of the Catholic nobility, defending its historical and territorial rights, and the Catholic clergy who, in his view, were inspired by genuine patriotism (e.g., Bohuslav Balbín). Masaryk, on the other hand, saw in the Age of Darkness a complete rupture which divided the Czech Reformation into two separate events, one culminating in the Hussite Revolution of the fifteenth century and the subsequent epoch of Czech Humanism; and the other, starting with the National Revival and reaching its peak in the middle nineteenth century. Furthermore, Masaryk never accepted the argument of Pekař and his ilk that the preservation of Czech culture and language against the threat of Germanization under the Lutheran Reformation was mainly due to the victory of the Catholic Habsburgs. Initially, Pekař ignored Masaryk’s visionary ventures into Czech history, e.g. his published essays, The Czech Question, which Pekař regarded as teleological mystification. His main reason, however, for not criticizing Masaryk openly must have been Pekař’s own restraint not to denigrate a fellow Czech in front of a watchful German audience, especially a colleague alongside whom he had fought during the Manuscript Forgeries campaign. The Gollists had never accepted Masaryk as a historian: “He did not impress us,” Pekař stated candidly. The historical school of Jaroslav Goll maintained that the task of a historian was not to seek a particular “meaning” of national history, otherwise historiography would degenerate into sheer propaganda. Pekař suspected that Masaryk, because of his strong urge for didactic preaching, had developed a pronounced propensity in that direction. The opportunity for Pekař’s open criticism of Masaryk finally came seventeen years after the publication of Pekař versus Masaryk proving that this Age of Darkness was not all that “dark” and that it was during this period that the continuity of Czech national culture had been preserved. [pageend23]20 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l The World War I transferred the heated debate on the meaning of Czech history to a more pragmatic field. During this fourth stage, Pekař emerged as probably the most politically versed historian in Prague.20 He used his solid knowledge of Czech history for the everyday analysis of the world crisis for the sake of promoting the political emancipation of the Czech nation. But his was a conservative, traditionalist, and legalistic position in sharp contradiction to those methods adopted by the revolutionary risk-taker Masaryk. Pekař’s legalistic demands did not exceed the traditional historic rights of the Bohemian Crown involving only the hereditary lands of the Kingdom. He explicitly excluded Slovakia. He regarded the coronation of the Austrian Emperor by the crown of St. Wenceslas at the Prague Castle as the culmination of Czech political ambitions. Masaryk’s revolutionary concept, on the other hand, advocated a joint Czecho-Slovak political, and later military, struggle in collaboration with the Entente Powers, aiming at the breakup of the Habsburg monarchy and the creation of an independent state. Pekař’s cautious legalistic concept was clearly displayed in his funeral oration for the Emperor Franz Josef I on December 4, 1916, whose name epitomized, according to Pekař, an entire era of positive cultural emancipation during which the Czech nation had been able to achieve the most sustained development in its entire history.21 But the Czechs, unlike their Hungarian neighbors, could not satisfy their political aspirations because Vienna systematically curtailed the historic rights of the Czech Crown. Moreover, Pekař was not prepared to endorse the revolutionary methods which the Hungarians had applied in 1897 to achieve their political aims. Here lies probably the main reason why Pekař, the staunch defender of the historic Czech Constitution, together with his teacher, Jaroslav Goll, Pekař and the First World War The Czech Question. The pretext was an unprovoked and slanderous attack against the Gollists by Masaryk’s acolytes, who called them cowards.18 Pekař was very upset that Masaryk’s camp failed to appreciate the delicate political task that the Goll school, of which Pekař happened to be the most distinguished pupil, had undertaken over the years in revising Palacký. “And what about my reply to Mommsen, my work on the White Mountain, on Wallenstein,” Pekař complained. “Were these not political performances par excellence?”19 [pageend24]Jo s e f Pe k a ř : In t e r pr e t e r o f Cz e c h His t o r y 21 Pekaŕ’s speech at the dawn of the regained Czech independence contains at least three immediately recognizable flaws. Nowhere in the text do we find the name of the founder of the new Czechoslovak state, President Masaryk. Secondly, Pekař’s address perpetuated the illusion that the new state was inhabited by speakers of the Czech language alone. Pekař mentioned neither the Bohemian Germans nor the Slovaks who found themselves included in the new state. Finally, it is unclear what Pekař meant by “our history.” Since he did not even faintly hint at Masaryk’s contribution to the restoration of Czech independence, did Pekař mean a combination of such factors as historical rights and the impact of chance and accident in history? Or was this perhaps an indication that the uncompromising empirical positivist was beginning to show signs of softening, readiness to accept perhaps some value judgments which he had so far steadfastly rejected? It was during the fifth phase, 1919-30, that we find Pekař grappling intermittently with these issues in the tradition of the great challenger and disputant. At first, however, one had the impression that Pekař’s world had died earlier, already in 1914 rather than in 1918, that Masaryk’s Czechoslovak Republic was the wrong place for someone with Pekaŕ’s distinct conservative tastes to live in. Fearing the consequences of the Russian revolution and political radicalism in general, Pekař moved New State and New Polemics and his colleagues Jaroslav Bidlo and Josef Šusta, refused to sign the Czech Writers’ Declaration of 191V.22 By contrast, Masaryk believed in the natural rights of self-determination, and welcomed the Russian February Revolution as the major catalyst of the disintegration of the evil empires in Central and Southeast Europe. Thus, World War I resulted in changes diametrically opposite to what Pekař had anticipated. Many regarded Pekaŕ’s legalistic obsession with the historical rights as sheer anachronism. But Šusta may also be right when he states that no one relished his own defeat more than Pekař, upon learning that Austria could not be salvaged and that the Czechs were to have their own state.23 However, quite a few considered Pekaŕ’s “most jubilant cry” in his welcoming address24 in favor of the new Czechoslovak state as the “most hypocritical” mimicry performed by a respectable historian.25 [pageend25]22 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l This brings us back to Pekař’s new stand made at the end of the 1920s on the resumption of the debate over the meaning of Czech history. To the astonishment of the impatient public, Pekař revealed in a public lecture at the end of 1928 that his own philosophy of history had been incorporated years before in the high school textbook, Dějiny naší říše (1914).32 Pekař emphasized four crucial factors. The first was the decisive influence of Europe, not only through Palacký’s idea of polarity, but also in the adaptation and reception of the more advanced Germanic and Romanic cultures. Second was the geographic position of the Czech lands to the Germans who acted as mediators of the more advanced Western civilization. The German factor, according to Pekař, was not only responsible for Czech nationalism, but “inspired [the Czechs] to emulate and compete with [their] neighbors.” Pekař continued, “if we are today farther than other Eastern nations in the application of our industrial skills, in administrative and labor discipline, this is because of German Pekar’s Philosophy of Czech History further to the right, blaming the Bolsheviks and the Jews alike for the collapse of the old order.26 Furthermore, his embrace of Catholicism in general, and of the Baroque era in particular, had intensified.27 He publicly criticized the land reform as an onslaught on tradition and stability because it weakened the economic position of the large country estate by carving it up.28 One of the most controversial confrontations which Pekař caused in the 1920s was through his massive new work on Jan Žižka, the military genius of the Hussites.29 While prior to World War I, Pekař followed Palacký in his interpretation of Hussitism as the great revolutionary upheaval of the Middle Ages and was proud of its achievements in the religious and national spheres as well as its social emancipation,30 now he began to stress the negative consequences of Hussitism in education, arts, trade, and in antagonizing the ethno-cultural co-existence between Czechs and Germans. Underlying the “Hussite controversy” were the old arguments from the dispute over the “meaning of Czech History.” Since we cannot mention here all the nuances of this controversy, it suffices to quote from Masaryk’s laconic reply to what did constitute the essence of the dispute: “Pekař is a Catholic and I am a Hussite.”31 [pageend26]Jo s e f Pe k a ř : In t e r pr e t e r o f Cz e c h His t o r y 23 Pekař used the topic of his lecture on the meaning of Czech history to emphasize his belief in the priority of the national idea as the guiding principle of Czech history against those who challenged him. He named Masaryk first, but quickly added that his former opponent “managed to correct his older theory in real life rather well.”34 However, it was the recent book of the remarkable Czech philosopher-moralist, Emanuel Rádi, The War Between Czechs and Germans (1928), which unleashed Pekař’s fury.35 Rádi ignored the Czech national idea as a “spiritual, cultural, and moral force in [Czech] history,” complained Pekař. He also profoundly disagreed with Rádľs emphasis on racial antagonism. On the other hand, Pekař did sympathize with the main purpose of Rádľs book which he saw as a plea addressed to the Czechs for fair treatment of the Germans and other minorities in the new state. Pekař, however, failed to appreciate Rádi precisely in those areas where he had the most to offer. Rádi, in Pekař’s view, went far beyond and ahead of Pekař’s rosy conception of “positive” nationalism which Pekař Versus Rádi education in the first place. ” As for the Magyars, Pekař thought that their role was rather beneficial because they had forced the Czechs to remain under the influence of the Germans, thereby having disrupted the links with Slav and Byzantine influences. Obviously, Pekař did not consider the thousand-year separation between the Czechs and Slovaks a tragedy. He did not even mention it, as if the official “Czechoslovak Nation” theory of the First Republic did not exist for him. Third, Pekař stressed the role of accident and chance in history, which in his view remained confined to the unpredictable deeds of individuals: thus the weakness of King Wenceslaus IV was directly responsible for the outbreak of the Hussite movement. Here Pekař refers to the power of historical myths, the belief in historical continuity, and the extraordinary proclivity with which the Czechs had used history as their main instrument of education and propaganda. Among such “history-creative” factors Pekař included the legends about the nation’s saints, St. Wenceslaus and St. John of Nepomuk, the Manuscript Forgeries of the nineteenth century, the cult of Hussitism (especially the slogan “Tábor is our program”), and even Masaryk’s thesis that the meaning of Czech history was above all religious; all of which he disapproved.33 [pageend27]24 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l In his textbook Pekař introduced his periodization of Czech history, in which he devised seven distinct cultural stages of European history: Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Enlightenment, Revolution, and, for lack of a better term, “the Franz Josef Era.”37 During his public lectures from 1928-31, Pekař returned frequently to the problem of periodization. Naturally, he encountered Masaryk’s criticism. The president, writing under a transparent acronym, regarded Pekař’s periodization with hardly concealed disapprobation. His criticism did not amount to a fundamental challenge of Pekař’s concept, nor did it shake the rather monumental periodization based on art history. Perhaps Masaryk realized how weak and ineffectual his criticism was, and in the last paragraphs included a more personal attack. The coverage and interpretation of the most recent period, the “Franz Josef Era” and the creation of the Czechoslovak state, in which he had played such a historic role, was, he insisted, utterly inadequate. “Professor Pekař prefers detachment,” complained Masaryk. And here the President himself became rather emotional. On the one hand, he demanded that “it is the duty of Czech historians to hold the mirror of historical truth before our generation”; on the other, he could not forgive the Gollists their pro-Habsburg attitude during the Great War. Masaryk felt strongly that “Czech official history was not a teacher of our nation during the World War and it is still not so for our growing republican and democratic generations.”38 Masaryk’s emotional criticism of Pekař reflected the President’s Last Polemics with Masaryk belonged to the era of Herder and was rather anachronistic when compared to nationalist demagogues of the Hitler variety. Rádi seriously criticized his fellow countrymen for their intolerance of minorities which, he predicted, would one day destroy the new Czechoslovak state. He clearly saw that Czech nationalism had been infected by the same “German” disease which originated in the romantic conception of Herder. Rádi felt he had to “de-Germanize” the Czech philosophy of history, and set out to do so with reckless determination practically single-handedly.36 Masaryk, who was in a unique position to give Rádi his moral support, not only because of his elevated function as the country’s “philosopher on the throne,” but also because of his mixed ethnic background, failed to do so at this critical juncture. [pageend28]Jo s e f Pe k a ř : In t e r pr e t e r o f Cz e c h His t o r y 25 The 1930s marked Pekař’s transition into the sixth and final phase of his career, characterized by the follow-up of the periodization debate and the redrafting of his first mature work, the history of the Wallenstein conspiracy.40 Furthermore, his involvement in current affairs, especially in the German Question, which was to dominate Czechoslovakia’s external and internal relations, had become increasingly erratic and anachronistic, notwithstanding his goodwill toward finding a compromise solution. In contrast to Rádi,41 Pekař failed to understand the dire consequences of Hitler’s dictatorship lurking just across the border. Ten years before Munich, Rádi prophesied in his The War Between Czechs and Germans The German Question understandable frustration that the Gollist school of historians, led by Pekař rather than by him, maintained their role as the chief interpreters of Czech destiny. It was they rather than Masaryk who upheld the intellectual monopoly in arguing over important issues concerning the origins of Czech Reformation and National Revival, and especially of the most recent period which saw the creation of the independent Czechoslovak Republic and Masaryk’s crucial role in that occurrence. Even as the president of the new state, Masaryk had little power to alter the content of Pekař’s textbook which was used as compulsory reading by subsequent generations in Czechoslovak high schools. Pekař displayed his unwitting mastery as the chief interpreter of Czech destiny at least once more, when he paid tribute to Masaryk on the latter’s 85th birthday. In a brilliant manner, so characteristic of his rich style, Pekař conceded that during the pre-war debate on the meaning of Czech history, Masaryk had, indeed, “impressed” him and his colleagues, “despite the fact that he [Masaryk] erred,” and thus corrected his earlier verdict of 1912 that “Masaryk did not impress us.” In the subsequent passage of his tribute, Pekař proceeded to reiterate his own view on the primacy of the national idea over Masaryk’s emphasis on the religious and humanitarian meaning of Czech history. “It was Masaryk himself,” Pekař concluded in triumph, elegantly underlining the paradox between Masaryk, the amateur historian, and Masaryk, the President-Liberator, who emerged as the victor in 1918 because he decided to embrace the idea of “Czech nationalism” rather than remain prisoner of his old religious preconceptions.39 [pageend29]26 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l that it was too late for the Czechs to establish a national state because the majority of Bohemian Germans, guided by their intelligentsia, could no longer be won over by Czech cultural and political ideals.42 Pekař’s lecture, “On the New Historiography in the Third Reich,” was a pitiful example of the old master’s helplessness in the face of the imminent Nazi threat.43 He was at pains to condemn Nazism prior to the completion of his analytical inquiry which he wanted to conduct “without prejudice.” Pekař admitted his irritation over the increasing persecution of Jewish scholars in the Reich, their colleagues’ readily acceptance of this persecution as well as their commitment to the National Socialist ideology. He seemed impressed, however, by the rise of energetic and ruthless young historians like Walter Frank, recently nominated director of the Reich Institute for the History of New Germany.44 Although Pekař did “objectively register” the persecution of the Jewish academics and the dismissal of Friedrich Meinecke from the editorship of the Historische Zeitschrift after 35 years of service (an interesting parallel to Pekař’s own long service as the editor of the Český časopis historický) he still refused to cast any negative judgments against National Socialism. As for the future impact of Nazi historiography on Czechoslovak historians, Pekař replied that “we must wait and see...”45 This inadequate reply by the former destroyer of historical myths raises some questions: Was it beyond his comprehension to understand the true nature of Nazi totalitarianism? The still brilliant but aging Pekař acted as if stricken by a sudden mental paralysis. Pekař thus became an easy prey to the unscrupulous German manipulators who deliberately selected the great Czech historian as the model intellectual advocating the reconciliation between Czechs and Germans for the sake of peace, which meant, of course, total submission to the interests of the Reich. Josef Pfitzner, professor of modem history at the German University of Prague, was one of the skillful operators who took advantage of Pekař’s political naiveté and physical weakness, and portrayed him as one of the most loyal pro-German representatives of contemporary Czech culture, as the alternative to Masaryk’s legacy.46 How Pekař would have reacted to the traumatic events of 1938 and 1939 had he not died in 1937, the same year Masaryk did, is a question impossible to answer. With all the imponderables which such historical speculation implies, it must be said, nevertheless, that under Nazi occupation, Pekař’s name was posthumously transformed into a model collabora- [pageend30]Jo s e f Pe k a ř : In t e r pr e t e r o f Cz e c h His t o r y 27 I have called Pekař the quintessential Czech historian of the twentieth century. That part of my judgement has been a relatively easy one; the more difficult one has to do with the question whether Pekař still has anything to offer us today, save pure aesthetic satisfaction derived from reading his works. What then, is Pekař’s legacy today? The,problem we must clarify first is which Pekař do we have in mind? The young Pekař of the pre-war years, the fearless defender of Czech patriotism, of Hussitism as the peak of national glory; or the rigorous positivist, who challenged the principal tenets of the new Czech humanist mythology formulated by Masaryk, in the contest between the Conclusion tor with Greater Germany. This was done in part by the propagandists in order to play down the legacy of Palacký and Masaryk. After the war, Communist propagandists in turn did not fail to continue the slander of Pekař and his work, to demonstrate the moral bankruptcy of “bourgeois” historiography.47 During the 1950s, it seemed as if the work of Pekař had become so heavily compromised that the older generation especially lost every hope of seeing it republished. It was only during the Prague Spring of 1968 that the name of Josef Pekař and a few other proscribed historians began again to be mentioned in public. Pekař was once more recognized as a major Czech historian, as the true successor to Palacký; his literary style was declared unmatched. “Pekař,” said one of his admirers in a complimentary epitaph, “can span bridges between the present and past with such lightness that the reader does not even realize how difficult the construction is, and can help one enter directly an epoch remote by centuries...”48 Perhaps no one showed greater perseverance in the rehabilitation of Pekař than his pupil František Kutnar (1903-1983). Introducing his master’s selected writings which he prepared for a special volume, the first published inside Czechoslovakia since Pekař’s death, Kutnar barely avoided the shadow of renewed censorship. “It was the preservation of national existence and of... individuality in times of national and European crises,” Kutnar wrote, “that was fundamental to Pekar’s work.”49 Seven years later, in Přehledné dějiny, his last major work before he died, Kutnar gave Pekař the prominence he felt his mentor deserved all along.50 [pageend31]28 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l two interpreters of Czech destiny throughout their lives; or Pekař arguing unceasingly the case of the feudal Bohemian Constitution against the acceptance of the principle of ethnic self-determination during World War I, and subsequently opposing the land reforms; or, finally, Pekař in his unofficial role as the political commentator during the First Republic, speaking on behalf of the silent Catholic majority and the “reactionary nobility” as well as for the non-achievable Czech-German reconciliation? Today, all these incarnations of Josef Pekař must appear anachronistic, even if some of us might seek inspiration from whichever of the four symbols we feel most attracted to, according to our own political and aesthetic inclination. The ensemble of Pekař’s historic writings, however, and the critical qualities of the writer himself in his vocation as the everpresent historian-provocateur and destroyer of national myths will, in my view, retain their significance as one of the greatest achievements of Czech historiography. They have not lost their significance today. We may return to Pekař’s writings as a beneficial cure against the dullness of one-dimensional Marxist interpretations and as a refuge against the contemporary invasion of modish “New Histories,” threatening to reduce the “Grand Old History” to an accidental collection of separate histories of underprivileged social groups (prostitutes, blacks, gays, criminals, minors, seniors, spouses, madmen, etc.), of miniature histories concerning tastes, symbols and fashions, toys, marriage and death. In this way, can history be reduced to mere pointillism? Can causation and the search for correlation of complex historic processes be abolished?51 Pekař, who, incidentally, could draw fascinating mini-portraits, particularly in the field of agrarian history, would have been outraged by this degradation of his muse Clio. His ambition was not to write a reductionist history, but to aim for an all-embracing synthesis capable of capturing “the spirit of the epoch.” In that, he was closer, perhaps, to art historians and literary critics of Max Dvoŕák’s and F.X. Šalda’s calibre. While recognizing Pekař as an effective antidote to Communist indoctrination (as my generation experienced it), one should at the same time also be aware of the weaknesses and limitations of his genius. During World War I, his judgments and forecasts proved deeply anachronistic. By the time World War II was approaching, in the wake of the Nazi victory in Germany, Pekař seemed hopelessly out of tune. Fighting what must have increasingly appeared as a rear guard action against a wide range of contemporary issues which he was unable or unwilling to [pageend32]Jo s e f Pe k a ř : In t e r pr e t e r o f Cz e c h His t o r y 29 comprehend, he visualized them as threats to tradition as he perceived it, giving them label which flashed warnings all around: labor movement, Slovaks, Jews, Communists, Bolsheviks, etc. Understandably, Pekař’s own reaction, firmly grounded in the value system of a pre-industrial society, must have been instinctively negative and hostile. While the majority of Czech intellectuals gravitated toward the left, Pekař remained solidly anchored within the ranks of the Agrarian Party. Also, despite his goodwill in trying to diffuse the Czech-German antagonism, he had no practical solutions to offer except moral appeals. In contrast, Emanuel Rádľs analysis of and response to the same phenomenon was miles ahead of Pekař. I cannot resist the temptation of saying that after 1918, Pekař simply lived in the wrong century in the wrong country. This may sound paradoxical, but he would have fared much more harmoniously in the type of social hierarchy and value system of nineteenth century Polish society, which was characterized by the dominant role of the nobility, the strong position of the Catholic Church, the loyal peasantry, and the absence of a working class. It is symptomatic for Pekař that his favorite poet was Mickiewicz and that his celebratory address on the eve of Czech independence in 1918 carried the motto from Pan Tadeusz. The obituaries written after Pekař’s death by his contemporaries gave him the highest credit for his achievements in the field of historiography. His agrarian nationalism was highly praised, and so was his endeavor to reach an accommodation with the Germans.52 The last item in particular attracted a wide range of statements in the German press, both in and outside Czechoslovakia.53 Whereas articles by Eduard Winter and Wilhelm Wostry were accepted by their Czech counterparts as more or less fair and objective,54 it was Josef Pfitzner’s irreverent release of two private letters written by Pekař just at the time the great historian was dying, which infuriated many Czechs.55 Pfitzner’s transparent objective—to make the maximum political mileage out of the letters for the Sudetendeutsche Partei, of which he was a prominent member—in a series of embarrassing comments by Czech historians, trying to mitigate Pekaf’s unambiguous comments, expressing his hostility toward the political left in Czechoslovakia and his sympathies for political developments in Nazi Germany.56 It was F.X. Šalda, whose untimely death followed that of Pekař by a few months, who provided what was perhaps the most open-minded [pageend33]30 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l summary of Pekař’s work. He described Pekař as a historian-classicist endowed with penetrating intuition, for whom history was both an epic and architectural experience. Although Šalda disagreed with Pekař’s defense of the historical Czech Constitution and its hierarchical social order, he conceded that “Pekar’s hyperconservative minus” was balanced by his deep and sincere moral nationalism striving to bring about a lasting Czech-German reconciliation.57 One of the intriguing topics open to wide speculation was Pekař’s failure to become a statesman. Šusta, for instance, in his detailed and elegant commentary, expressed his regrets that Pekař never showed ambition to become politician of the Catholic right in Czechoslovakia.58 He believed that Pekař should have entered the Constitutional Assembly to contribute to the drafting of the first Constitution. Had Pekar’s role not been reduced to that of a mere outside critical commentator, had he been right in the center of political activities, declared Šusta, the new Czechoslovak Republic would have been shaped in a fundamentally different way. This speculation leads to an important question: bearing in mind the crucial role Czech historians had occupied as “interpreters of the nation’s destiny,” could Pekař have conceivably aspired to become Masaryk’s political rival? Recently, a Czech samizdat author, K. Žádný, has regretted that Pekař was satisfied to conduct his polemics with Masaryk merely on “the scientific level” and failed to exploit the opportunity to become the spokesman for the Czech Catholic opposition to the official state doctrine of “Czechoslovakism,” associated with Masaryk and Beneš.59 This challenge raises some intriguing questions: would Pekar’s ideology of “agrarian nationalism” appear less militant and more cohesive than Masaryk’s “Czechoslovakism?” Would it be less antagonistic toward the Germans and, ultimately, helped to save Czechoslovakia from Hitler’s assault in 1938? My own answer to these speculations is a resounding “No!” These speculations are based on a profound misconception of Pekar’s personality and his genius as a historian. As I have tried to show, Pekař definitely felt most comfortable when confined to the routine framework of a professional historical debate, not outside it in the muddy waters of politics. Despite his frequent press commentaries on contemporary political issues, Pekař was not a bom political leader ready to leave his university position, his students, his book projects; in other words, to [pageend34]Jo s e f Pe k a ř : In t e r pr e t e r o f Cz e c h His t o r y 31 take risks to the same extent as did Masaryk, for example, during World War I. It is in this context that one should understand Gregory Campbell’s remark in his recent article that “Masaryk was never a research scholar; he was a man of action who centered his teaching and writing on the big political and social questions of the day.”60 Pekař, I would argue, was the opposite type. These differences must have been obvious even to those who considered Pekař for a while as a rival presidential candidate to Masaryk. Another kind of misunderstanding concerning the polemics between Masaryk and Pekař has pervaded, regrettably, the Charter 77 document, “The Right to History,” which led to a lively argument among the independent authors inside Czechoslovakia.61 The document pleaded for the right of an alternative Catholic interpretation of Czech history, but attributed the postulate of a “religious” interpreter of Czech history wrongly to Pekař. My second argument against the suggestion that Pekař might have become a feasible political alternative to Masaryk for the conservative and right-wing interests in inter-war Czechoslovakia derives from the analysis of what actually did happen in East Central Europe in the last fifty years. As the case of Poland shows, its pro-German foreign policy could not save the country when the German Drang nach Osten turned against it. (Those who bring up the case of Switzerland as the only neighbor of Nazi Germany able to avoid a direct invasion, should be reminded of the different geo-political configuration to which the neutral Swiss Confederation belongs, and the avoidance of linguistic nationalism in its entire history. Thus, Switzerland, despite its German-speaking majority, was not infected, like Czechoslovakia, by the spread of brown shirts originating in Nazi Germany.) Even if Czechoslovakia had developed a political system less antagonistic to Hitler’s taste than the one represented in 1938 by Beneš, it would have made, in my view, absolutely no difference to the inevitable threat of Nazi aggression. Consequently, even if one can imagine an alternative “anti-Masaryk” Czech government in Prague, already installed by the 1930s, it would have only extended the process of disintegration of the republic under perhaps somewhat less dramatic circumstances. The only chance for a radical improvement of the Czech- German relationship existed, I think, in 1918, when the new state was established. Ten years later, as Rádi warned, it was almost too late; twenty years later, the catastrophe was unavoidable. [pageend35]32 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l As we are today looking back wondering how to assess the legacy of a great Czech historian, it might be useful to recall how Pekař himself understood the significance of the greatest interpreter of Czech destiny, namely Palacký himself, on the fiftieth anniversary of his death.62 Pekař thought that two messages were particularly useful to his Czech audience of 1926. First, he reminded them not to forget, in the midst of euphoria over the newly established independent state, those who had made the greatest contribution to the achievement of Czech independence, providing the nation with “moral and spiritual capital,” and yet died, like Palacký, before they could see the fruits of their labor.63 Pekař’s second message, stemming also from the legacy of Palacký, was that after victory we should exercise wisdom and restraint in our national sentiments, not vengeance and hatred. He felt, quite rightly, that the preservation of national goals in an independent state was more difficult than the task of the linguistic awakening which our forefathers faced. He thought in the first place of the Czech-German relationship, which the survival of the new Czechoslovak Republic was to depend on more than anything else. The first version of this article was presented at the AAASS National Convention in 1986.

It was indeed Jirásek’s novel Temno, written during World War I as an anti- Habsburg and anti-clerical work of fiction, which gave the name to the whole epoch between the Battle of the White Mountain and the beginnings of the National Revival in the 1780s. The black-and-white simplistic plot of the novel is underlined by Jirásek who portrays the Jesuit order as the main carrier of the religious and national oppression in the early 18th century. Not surprisingly, this simplistic interpretation of Czech national history was seized and exploited by the Communists in the 20th century with the encouragement of Zdeněk Nejedlý, also a former pupil of Jaroslav Goll. 17.

[pageend39]The Idea of the Czechoslovak State: History, Theory and Political Reality Zdeněk Pinc In 1865 appeared František Palacký’s The Idea of the Austrian State (Idea státu rakouského), unquestionably the greatest Czech political discourse ever written. It should be useful—more than 125 years after its first appearance—to review its essential argument. According to Palacký, the idea of the Austrian state is historically divided into three segments. Chronologically speaking, first came the “Turkish calamity”—the defense of the Christian world against the Turks after the fall of Constantinople; second, the defense of Catholic Europe against the dangers of the Enlightenment, Protestantism, and liberalism after a century of religious wars. Palacký wrote his discourse at a time when the second idea became devitalized, when the state “by nature and by history called upon to be the shield and the safeguard of Europe” was beginning to deliquesce. At this juncture Palacký formulated the third idea of the Austrian state: “Southeast Europe is inhabited by many nations who differ from each other by origin, language, history, and customs, none of them strong enough to effectively stand up alone against its overpowering Eastern neighbor.”1 Palacký conceived of Austria’s new role as a defender of small nations, strung along the Danube, against two threats to European plurality: that of the unified Germanic element on the one side, and that of the Russian colossus on the other, a colossus which began successfully to assert itself in the European political arena during the past century. While Austria withstood the first two historical challenges, the third turned out to be its ruin. The new idea of the Austrian state, as formulated by Palacký, collided with the blind, uncultured forces of resurrected nationalism in the Empire’s individual countries. The damage was magni[pageend40]Th e Id e a o f t h e Cz e c h o s l o v a k St a t e 37 fied by the dissipation of the will for progress and for internal reforms on the part of the Austrians: “Spirit, after a long period of repression, will either wither and perish or, thanks to its own internal forces, break through the barriers, liberate itself, and enter the road towards progress. How such an outburst came about during the time of the great storms of the year 1848 every member of our generation vividly recalls. From then on this negation and reaction have ceased to be the principal rule and guide of the Austrian government, albeit under Minister Bach it appeared for a while as if it wanted to return to this policy. ”2 In this historical context, the place of the Czech element was not without its contradictions. In fact, the second idea of the Austrian state stood in radical opposition to the Czech Protestant community. Furthermore, in the nineteenth century there surfaced Jungmann’s concept of the role of the Czech language in the National Revival movement which contrasted with that of Bolzano—the “tschechisch” vs. “böhmisch” controversy. This concept led to the persistent view that the Austrian state was an instrument of Germanization, and therefore by implication a prominent enemy of the Czechs. In the climate of the periodic revival of Pan-Slavic illusions about Czarist Russia, Czechs with national feelings were capable of identifying with the idea of the Austrian state only with great reservations and many of them rejected it outright. It is useless to argue, I believe, about whether or not the dismemberment of the Austro-Hungarian Empire was a tragic mistake as it is to debate whether or not it was preventable. Masaryk’s belated and hesitant acceptance of the concept of an independent Czechoslovak state ought to be understood, first of all, in the context of his eschatological tenets according to which World War I was the final, and decisive, battle between democratic and autocratic forces. To him, this conflict was tantamount to the conflict between good and evil. Democracy was to Masaryk the very embodiment of the idea of the new Czechoslovak state. In an environment historically alien to democracy, he viewed Czechoslovakia’s dedication to this idea as a moral imperative which would assert itself also in economic and political areas. Czechoslovakia’s historical mission was to set democracy’s triumph in the Central Europe by its example. The concept of Czechoslovak state and its subsequent tragedy are rooted in this illusion. The triumph of democracy turned out to be temporary, and the country was not given even a half of the fifty years Masaryk thought necessary for the fulfillment of his prophecy. Czechoslovakia [pageend41]38 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l became smothered by autocratic giants which acquired after Austria’s fall a totalitarian character, and became that much more dangerous. Czechoslovakia had no choice but to face twice absurd confrontations with outside forces. In the interest of objectivity we must add that Masaryk’s concept of the Czechoslovak republic as a democratic enclave was accepted by the majority of its citizens purely as a figure of speech. It became a self-indulgent compliment, nurturing the need of the Czechs for universal recognition and admiration. Czech nationalism greeted the foundation of the republic not only as an occasion to score points in the nationalistic struggle with imperialistic Germany, but also as a justification of its own colonial ambition towards Slovakia. This dual ambition of the Czechs turned out to have catastrophic consequences. After World War II, this ambition asserted itself once again in the expulsion of the Germans from the Sudetenland and other parts of Czechoslovakia. In the same vein were its post-war imperial designs in Slovakia. These designs led to the allegations about the insidious plans of the Husák gang for making Slovakia a part of the Soviet Union. Perhaps the plan did not materialize only because of Stalin’s reluctance to devour only half of the prey, since he intended to devour it later on in its entirety. The sore point of Czechoslovak statehood continues to be the problem of the Sudeten Germans. The stronger the need for its reduction into temporal pragmatic formulas, the more divisive and painful will be the periodic reappearance of unacceptable and demagogic proposals on both sides. How else can one view the recent proposal by the spokesman of the Sudeten Germans, Neubauer, calling for the suspension of the restitution and privatization in former Sudetenland on the grounds that such a suspension would avoid a potentially prejudicial situation in the matter of the claims and rights of the Germans? On the other side of the spectrum is Rudolf Hilf s article “The Issue of Sudeten Germans Today,”3 which appears to me to be a fortuitous articulation of the problem from the German side. What makes the article that much more important is that it is not a reprint, but that it was written for and published by a Czech periodical. In one part Hilf writes: “In the beginning stands the will for truth, but also the will for identification with the feelings of the other. If Václav Havel was capable of holding up the mirror to his compatriots on the issue of the expulsion of the Germans as well as on the issue of the unjust policy towards minorities in the First Republic of the pre-war era, [pageend42]Th e Id e a o f t h e Cz e c h o s l o v a k St a t e 39 revered in the Czech historical consciousness as a period of immaculate purity which the Germans suddenly and without any reason violated, if, then, Havel had the courage to speak out against the historical myth of his own nation, then we must also accept the proposition that peace will never be voluntarily accepted by the Czech people, as long as the issue of borders [between Czechoslovakia and Germany] remains open.” Hilfs idea of the revival of the principle of German settlement in the Sudeten regions has a profound, truly spiritual meaning. In the name of law and equity, the right of the Germans to return to their homeland is indisputable. Something else is of course asserted in the utilitarian and temporary political agreements and in the laws and norms derived from them. But under no circumstances must the idea of the “homecoming” be devalued and undermined through transferring it into the sphere of petty disputes about property and restitution. Essentially, we have before us the revival of the idea of “Czechness” in the sense of “böhmisch.” As Hilf writes: “At the beginning of the year I said in my speech at the Charles University in Prague that during the last two centuries, Vienna and Berlin had their day. I also said that I hope and wish for Prague’s own day to come. Such a day could come if the Czechs and the Sudeten Germans, separated by a century of nationalism with all its excesses, would again find their way to each other and become Czech or German speaking Czechs.” The idea of the Czechoslovak national state, this utilitarian idea of Czechoslovakism, hastily concocted on the eve of the inauguration of the First Republic, has lost all its vigor and, ironically, is giving up its place to older ideas. Regrettably, a different and new idea began to take hold in post-World War II Czechoslovakia, one that was similar to that of the First Republic, albeit in an inverted form. The country was to become the industrial heartland and a showcase of “the peaceful camp of socialism.” This idea of the state is at the roots of Communism’s post-war success. Its acceptance serves also to clarify why until 1952 Communists ruled with the support of the majority of the population, and why even later on it was so difficult to see any challenge to the legitimacy of their rule. The success of this idea is tied to the subliminal, unadmitted, but nevertheless demonstrable stereotypical aversion of the Czechs towards their neighbors, including the Slovaks. In the case of the Germans this aversion is at least overt. That the very Czech word for German, “Němec,” is derived from the adjective “němý” (mute, dumb) is also indicative of this attitude. The [pageend43]40 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l Germans represent also the spirit of competition, though their success, according to the prevalent myth, lies in their guileful nature. At least they command respect—even though the most recent nickname for them, “vepři” (pigs), is hardly flattering. For other neighbors, though they may give them less offensive nicknames, the Czechs show less respect. The decomposition of the Soviet empire has revived the ideas of the state on the part of the successor regimes. It is therefore remarkable that in the Czechoslovak region little or no such effort is to be found. Instead, there is the cultivation of the slogan “back into Europe,” generally limited to the desire to share the brew of consumerist success with the West. Some scant attention is given to the revival of Masaryk’s idea of the democratic enclave, this time within the framework of the post-communist Eastern block wasteland. At the same time it is increasingly apparent that people have become unused to democratic principles. Gone is Czechoslovakia’s preeminence which it enjoyed in this respect before World War II. Also, gloomy predictions of the country’s Balkanization are not without foundation. In general, Europe itself is in flux. The mainspring of Europe’s unification was the presumed mortal danger of Soviet aggression. However, Soviet power appears to be for the foreseeable future paralyzed by internal strife, and German reunification has created a power equation which is to a large measure inimical to European unification. In view of these developments Czechoslovak preoccupation with the issue of whether the country should be awarded one or two seats in the future European commonwealth reminds one of the anecdotal dispute over what one will buy after a win in lottery, before one has purchased a ticket. By the same token, the idea of Czechoslovakia as a bridge between East and West, fashioned by a segment of Havel’s political entourage, has been ignored in foreign countries to the point of embarrassment. The only reaction, an understandably unfavorable one, came from Austria which itself has been benefitting from this status for several decades. Given all these circumstances, Palacký’s third idea about the Austrian state has attained new significance. It was expressed in an interesting fashion by one of the world’s most influential political pundits, Zbigniew Brzezinski, still during the first days of the “Velvet” Revolution, when he called for an overall attempt to create a Czechoslovak-Polish federation. It is surprising how indifferent, almost negative, a reaction this concept met in Czechoslovakia. What is at play here is probably the unadmitted [pageend44]Th e Id e a o f t h e Cz e c h o s l o v a k St a t e 41 conflict between the idea of a strong union in Central Europe, capable of resisting pressure from the Germans as well as the Russians, and the older Czech idea in the Saint Wenceslaus’s tradition: the Czechs’ good fortune lies in the peaceful coexistence with the German Reich. The fact that Havel’s first foreign visit as President was to a still divided Germany only underscores this view. If he had followed Palacký, Havel would have first travelled to Poland, which would have not been without its logic, considering the long-established contacts between the two leading dissidents, who in a short period of time both became the rulers of their respective countries. According to Karl Schmitt, politics involves first of all the decisionmaking process patterned upon the friend-foe formula. If we accept this principle, a vaguely delineated idea of the state must result in a muddled political orientation. It appears that our present political representatives have not yet faced this issue, in fact have not yet even started to contemplate it. At present, our thinking is dominated by an idyllic, but naive desire to be friends with everyone, a desire conditioned by the geographic location of our country. The instinctive, post-revolutionary overstated reaction to renounce “friendship till the end of time” (as our relationship with the Soviet Union was officially called), eventually backfired. That our intemperate, hostile gestures towards the East bore bitter fruit is known to everyone, not just to the economists. If our policy is to become structured upon the assumption that the Soviet Union is an enemy, it is difficult to understand the so-called Dienstbier plan which calls for American aid to the economies of Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland with the objective of rescuing the Soviet economy by the exportation of merchandise of relatively high quality, although this same merchandise would hardly succeed in Western markets. This contradiction seems to demonstrate once again that the present political leadership lacks a coherent approach to basic issues, and is floundering aimlessly from side to side. The Dienstbier plan is unmistakably an anti-German card in a political gambit and, in addition, an anti- European one as well. It creates a climate of unwanted and perhaps unfair competition in the contest for untapped markets. At this point I do not see more than two alternatives for the idea of our state. The first is derived from the Saint Wenceslaus tradition, i.e. an alliance with the strongest possible partner (this time it would be Germany); the second is based upon the acceptance of the third part of Palacký’s [pageend45]42 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l idea of the Austrian state. The latter alternative would require an all-out effort for a Central European federation. In this respect the Alliance of the Five was a step in the right direction, although there has recently been little along this route that would encourage optimism. Both alternatives are interesting also in their relation to the burning problems of Czechoslovak Federation. The resurrection of the political idea of the Austrian state tends distinctly to weaken the separatist movement in Slovakia. Contrary to that, the Saint Wenceslaus alternative, which presupposes a strong dependence upon Germany, with a revival of the idea of the Czech and Moravian federation within the framework of the German Reich (currently called Bundesrepublik) in its forefront. This idea is capable of evoking both beguiling and frightening associations. Viewing both ideas objectively, they are a first step towards Czechoslovakia’s “return to Europe” and neither of them has catastrophic implications. The Austrian route faces two roadblocks; rampant nationalism in the prospective countries, and the lack of enthusiasm on the part of the Austrians themselves. As it appears, the Austrians have little desire to return to the problems which invariably accompany political preeminence. In addition, the Austrians are well aware of the painful, protracted hangover that followed the Empire’s demise. On the other hand, in the northern part of the rapidly disintegrating Yugoslavia, the Austrian idea would be undoubtedly greeted with great sympathy. Czechoslovakia’s accommodation with the Sudeten Germans would be also aided by the Austrian state idea. For the Sudeten Germans themselves the issue appears to be clearly laid out as a choice between the idea of Großdeutschland for which they opted under Nazism, and the older, Austrian, idea. At this time the latter idea appears to them to be less advantageous, but upon close reading, it is the one endorsed by Hilf: “If we do not rise to the occasion and do not meet the challenge, neither of us faces a truly meaningful future. The Sudeten Germans will irreversibly cease to exist as a distinctive historical entity and will be absorbed by Germany. The Czech nation will be a small European nation on the edge of eighty million Germans and in its sphere of influence, but unlike in 1918 or 1945, without the protection of allies in the East or in the West.” The second, pro-German alternative, is implicitly anti-Slovak, a Western variant of the post-World War II attempt to deliver Slovakia to its Eastern “brother.” Paradoxically, the strong as well as the weak points of the situation are the result of past idiosyncracies. In the event of Czechoslovakia’s dissolu- [pageend46]Th e Id e a o f t h e Cz e c h o s l o v a k St a t e 43 tion, Slovakia’s future ceases to be a matter of choice, and becomes an unavoidable destiny. The earlier mentioned friend-foe dichotomy of Schmitt acquires in the concept of Václav Bělohradský a truly universal proportion: “Hegel once asserted that history is not a struggle between truth and lie, as dogmatics of all persuasions would like us to believe, but rather a struggle of one truth against the other. In this sense the demarcation friend-foe represents the struggle between two forms of truth: On one side stands man as a part of life on this earth and of nature (natura, physis); on the other side stands man as an embodiment of reason (ratio, logos) who understands the essence of phenomena, and his existence has therefore a higher meaning than that of other creatures.”4 Regardless of our wishes, the different standards of ecological-political thinking of our potential rivals plays an important role in the determination of which of them will become friend and which enemy. The Soviet Union does not comprehend the dimension of this problem, and due to its overextension it will hardly comprehend it in the near future. This circumstance puts it into a probable position of an enemy. Our continued dependency upon resources from the East represents at present our greatest danger. Moreover, our unsophisticated business practices, stemming from the decades-long collaboration with Russia, tend to hamper our relation with our Western partners. Thus our state appears in this regard a barrier against lux ex oriente rather than a bridge between East and West. Once the “heart of Europe,” we have become the West’s outpost, a future guarantee that the “Eastern light” will not turn into an uncontrollably spreading oil slick. Should the disintegration of the Soviet Union become a reality, a hardening of attitudes and relations will likely follow. The successor states produced by that disintegration will not only be poorer but also less magnanimous and hungrier than the Hydra of the Russian Empire. Should a Central European federation come into being, a vast area of potential political, economic, and cultural influence will open up. It could serve as an effective counter-force against any future Drang nach Osten. In the dispute between what Bělohradský calls “people of the earth and people of the planet,” our position with respect to Germany is substantially different with respect to Austria. At present, we may seem Austria’s adversary, posing an ecological threat to her (the issue of nuclear power plants). On the other hand Germany poses in the same [pageend47]44 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l sense a threat to us, principally because of the West-East direction of the air stream. How do these realities fit into the friend-foe formula? From a pragmatic, short-term viewpoint we should regard Germany as a friend, despite her inflicting ecological harm upon us. Of course there is a hope for reparations in convertible currency as well as the possibility of our reciprocation when we are the guilty party (e.g. the pollution of the river Elbe). Austria’s attitude, on the other hand, is more militant. She threatens us with litigation and retaliation. If we view these issues from a long term perspective, the offender is at the same time a desirable partner, and the solution of his problems are in the interest of the harmed party. Legal intervention is sometimes effective, but frequently it is not: the implementation of a verdict depends substantially upon the good will of the delinquent party, and sometimes it is practically unenforceable. Taking all these considerations into account, I venture to offer the following conclusion: Austria is for us potentially more a friend, and Germany more an enemy. The size and power of both economies seem to favor this conclusion: the big, overpowering economy of Germany threatens to engulf us, while the much smaller economy of Austria is an open invitation for cooperation. I do not pretend to be a prophet, nor do I campaign for either of the alternatives. I am offering merely an impassive analysis of what I see as flaws in our political strategies. It is certainly pleasing to hear Minister of Defense Dobrovský’s assurances that we have no enemies, but sound international policy is hardly possible without identifying the enemy. It is very nice to hope for a speedy integration of Europe and to ready oneself for the giant leap forward, but history teaches us to be sober. Political ideas formulated after profound social upheavals have been much too frequently modified, weakened, and even abandoned. Translated from the Czech by members of the editorial staff. 1.

Holeton Confirmation, as it is found in the churches today, has two distinct sources. As it is practiced in the Roman Catholic Church, confirmation has its roots in the second postbaptismal anointing of the Roman baptismal rite to which the Apostolic Tradition of Hippolytus is the earliest witness.1 This anointing, reserved to the bishop alone, eventually became detached from the unitary rite and began to live a life of its own. Once this post- baptismal ceremony became detached from the baptismal rite itself it began to take on a meaning independent of its baptismal origins. As a rite it could be celebrated at any time after baptism and was not directly associated with age or catechesis. The development of confirmation in this Roman sense has been well documented and is generally regarded as a distinctly Roman phenomenon and accepted as such among liturgical scholars. Confirmation as it is practiced in the churches issuing from the Reformation of the sixteenth century has quite different roots, roots that have been traced only in part. Early in this century Georg Rietschel2 noted an appendix to the section on baptism in a late fifteenth century Bohemian confession of faith which includes instructions for baptismal sponsors. The sponsors were directed to take charge of the child, instruct him and, when he is grown up, bring him to the pastor before whom he is to confess his faith and receive the laying on of hands for confirmation. The description of this rite sounds very much like confirmation as it came to be practiced in the churches of the Reformation and is quite distinct from confirmation in its Roman sense. Taking what otherwise might have been regarded as an isolated practice, Rietschel connected this Moravian rite to the Reformation prac- [pageend49]46 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l tice of confirmation through Erasmus’s knowledge of the Bohemian Brethren.3 In his Paraphrase on St. Matthew’s Gospel Erasmus commends a catechetical practice with striking similarities to the Moravian custom described in the confession of faith.4 A decade and a half after it first appeared, Rietschel’s theory was published in English in William Lockton’s pioneering work on the age for confirmation. Lockton’s sources, in turn, were incorporated into J.D.C. Fisher’s now-classic collection of initiation sources from the Reformation period.5 Fisher contextualized the earlier work by including further Bohemian sources and including a passage from John Wyclif’s Trialogus in which he disparages confirmation.6 (The Trialogus had been in Bohemia since the early fifteenth century and had been translated into Czech, probably by Jan Hus himself.) With Fisher’s presentation of the texts, what we appear to have, then, is the data for a nicely substantiated theory postulating that confirmation, as practiced in the churches of the sixteenth century Reformation, began with a Bohemian application of Wyclif which was then introduced to the reformers through the work of Erasmus. As such, the theory has appeared in a number of contemporary works on Christian initiation. There are, however, a number of questions which beg to be asked. Why, for example, would this passage from the Trialogus be implemented when very little of the Wycliffite program was, in fact, implemented in Bohemia?7 How was such an innovation possible when so much of reformed Bohemian sacramental practice was an attempt to restore what was perceived as the practice of the primitive church and when Wyclif himself had doubted that confirmation had any scriptural foundation.8 When, and by whom, was this new type of confirmation first practiced? The confession of faith cited by Rietschel assumes a practice which appears to be well established rather than something presented as if it were an innovation. Each of these questions must be answered if we are to understand the Bohemian origins of confirmation as more than conjecture. It is now my intention to pursue these questions. The Bohemian Liturgical Reformation Liturgical reform in the Czech lands had begun during the second half of the fourteenth century with the initiatives of Jan Milic of Kroměříž. At first, the principal areas of interest were the restoration of preach- [pageend50]Th e Mo r a v ia n Or ig in s o f Co n f ir ma t io n 47 ing in the vernacular and the frequent, at least weekly, reception of communion by the laity. By the end of the fourteenth century, the movement had come to include other reforms such as reading the liturgical pericopes in the vernacular and the growing use of popular hymnody.9 In 1415 Jakoubek of Stříbro restored the distribution of the eucharistie cup to the laity (a reform so central to the Bohemian Reformation that it was emblazoned on Hussite banners and remains the one reform known by all those familiar with the name Hus). Two years later the ancient practice of communicating all the baptized was restored.10 Of these various reforms, frequent communion, restoration of the chalice and communion for all the baptized each had implications for the theology of Christian initiation. As the momentum of the liturgical renewal developed in Bohemia, it was accompanied by an increasing corpus of theological reflection.11 Matthias of Janov, in his massive Regulae Veteris et Novi Testamenti, presented an extensive theological rationale for the necessity of frequent communion. Building a case on biblical, patristic, mediæval and canonical sources, Matthias posed the question: “If you are in communion with the church through the first mode [baptism], why are you not also in communion through the second mode [eucharist]?”12 It was the continued study of this dossier of texts that led Jakoubek to describe his restoration of the chalice as response to a revelatio13 and, as I have argued elsewhere,14 the same process led him to begin communicating all the baptized including infants and the very young. Each of these reforms would eventually raise a number of questions: what is the place of confirmation in the sequence of Christian initiation? what is the theology of the rite? what are the implications of these for the actual pastoral practice of the rite? Any new theology and pastoral practice of confirmation could emerge only from some adequate resolution of these questions. Confirmation: Pastoral Practice and Theological Rationale What was the theology and pastoral practice of confirmation in Bohemia at the end of the fourteenth century and the beginning of the fifteenth century? Were there ways in which either its theology or pastoral administration differed from the theology and practice which had become common in the rest of Europe north of the Alps? To answer those questions, we need to look at the general state of confirmation in the late Middle Ages. [pageend51]48 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l In actual practice the observance of confirmation was widely ignored. Confirmation had ceased to be seen as a basic element in the process of Christian initiation (baptism, confirmation, communion) and many Christians never received the sacrament. Dioceses often covered large geographical areas and, in an age in which travel was difficult, bishops often had little incentive to leave the comfort of their palaces. Such factors militated against the pastoral administration of confirmation. The difficulty theologians had in attributing any positive theology to the rite which, in turn, could be communicated to the laity gave the average lay person little incentive to seek confirmation for himself or for his children. Unlike baptism and the eucharist which were held “to be generally necessary for salvation,” no such claim was made for confirmation, diminishing its perceived benefits or necessity in popular piety. While synods often tried to impose legislation which assured that confirmation was a normative part of the Christian life, such efforts met with little success. Bishops often confirmed while on horseback. In many parts of Europe, ecclesiastical legislation required all those who were unconfirmed (infants, children, or adults) to appear by the roadside for confirmation should a bishop be riding within seven miles of their dwelling. Despite such legislation, confirmation continued to be widely ignored and, in reaction, synods continued to raise the age by which confirmation must have taken place, finally arriving at age seven. If this was the general state of confirmation in the late Middle Ages, then Bohemia appears to have been little different. The diocese of Prague was typical of many dioceses in northern and central Europe. Of considerable size and varied topography, it would have been difficult to carry out the regular administration of confirmation even with the assistance of auxiliary bishops. The primatial responsibilities which would have fallen to the incumbent of the archbishopric (as well as the secular obligations of being the first lord spiritual in the Bohemian realms) would have made the pastoral administration of confirmation extremely difficult. What we can conclude from the available canonical and liturgical information is that in the fourteenth century confirmation did not play a major role in the life of the average Czech Christian. There was no canonical legislation which attempted to enforce the observance of the rite. The size of the diocese would give the rite rather low profile in the popular religious consciousness. The liturgical evidence would indicate that the integrity of the sacraments of initiation as a unitary whole lasted [pageend52]Th e Mo r a v ia n Or ig in s o f Co n f ir ma t io n 49 When, in 1417, the general communion of all the baptized was restored, a series of debates among the university masters ensued. In this debate the question of confirmation played very little part.15 During the compilation of the patristic dossier for this debate, something much more important was to emerge which was to affect the emergence of a new understanding of confirmation. This centered around the use of Pseudo- Dionysius the Areopagite as a principal authority. The works of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite were to play a role of capital importance in the Bohemian sacramental debates of the early fifteenth century. Unlike for Protestants a century later for whom there was no church father called Dionysius, there was no doubt in the minds of any of the Bohemian academics that the author of the Dionysian corpus was one and the same person as Paul converted on the Areopagus (Acts 17:34). It is in the course of this debate over the communion of infants that a Dionysian text emerges which is, I would suggest, seminal to the development of the “new” confirmation. In the infant communion debate, those who opposed the restoration of baptismal communion claimed that Dionysius’s commentary on baptism16 was only concerned with adults, a claim for which they invoked Thomas Aquinas as witness. While both they and Thomas were correct on this point as Dionysius treats it in his chapter on baptism (c.2),17they both had overlooked the conclusion to the work as a whole18 where Dionysius appends a response to a question posed by Timothy (allegedly the companion of St. Paul) on the initiation of infants. Here the point is made “that what really could earn the ridicule of the impious is the fact that infants, despite their inability to understand the divine things, are nevertheless admitted to that sacrament of sacred divine-birth, and to the sacred symbols of the divine communion.”19 While Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite: “Witness to Confirmation?” longer in Bohemia than in many other “more advanced” parts of Europe. The existence of “substitution rites” for baptismal communion and equivalent folk customs corroborate this. As a result confirmation as a distinct ritual practice would have been less familiar to the average Bohemian Christian in the fourteenth century than it would have been to contemporaries in many other European countries. [pageend53]50 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l admitting “that not all divine things can be comprehended by our intelligence, ”20 Dionysius provides this rationale for the practice: Let me set down what our blessed teachers, in their knowledge of the earliest tradition, have passed down to us. What they say is this, and it is true. Children raised up in accordance with holy precepts will acquire the habits of holiness. They will avoid all the errors and all the temptations of an unholy life. Understanding the truth of this, our divine leaders decided it was a good thing to admit children, though on condition that the parents of the child would entrust him to some good teacher who could provide religious teaching as the child’s spiritual father and as the sponsor of salvation. Anyone thus committed to raise the child up along the way of a holy life is asked by the hierarch to the rimai renunciations and to speak the words of promise. Those who scoff at this are quite wrong in thinking that the one is initiated into the divine mysteries instead of the other, for he does not say “I am making the renunciations and the promises for the child,” but “the child himself is assigned and enrolled.” In effect what is said is this: “I promise that when this child can understand sacred truth I shall educate him and shall raise him up by my teaching in such a way that he will renounce all temptations of the devil, that he will bind himself to the sacred promises and will bring them to fruit.” So I do not think there is anything ridiculous if the child is brought up with a godly upbringing, provided of course that there is a sacred leader and sponsor to form holy habits in him and to guard him against the temptations of the devil. When the hierarch admits the child to a share in the sacred symbols it is so that he may derive nourishment from this, so that he may spend his entire life in the unceasing contemplation of the divine things, may progress in his communion with them, may therefore acquire a holy and enduring way of life, and may be brought up in sanctity by the guidance of a holy sponsor who himself lives in conformity with God.21 What Dionysius has described is, in fact, a catechetical practice distinct from both the eastern initiation sequence of baptism, chrismation, first communion (which he has described in their integral whole in cc. 2 & 3) and the devolved Roman initiation sequence known to the reformers of early fifteenth century Bohemia (baptism, communion, confirmation). Despite this, the text becomes of capital importance because it provides an apostolic22 rationale for a new rite. Dionysius has given his Bohemian readers a paradigm for confirmation as it later came to be practiced by the Reformation churches. Confirmation in Early Reformation Debate One factor which would have militated in favor of confirmation taking a new direction within the economy of Bohemian sacramental [pageend54]Th e Mo r a v ia n Or ig in s o f Co n f ir ma t io n 51 It is at this point that we can trace the development of reformed confirmation as a liturgical practice for which we have witnesses. The first of these are not liturgical texts of which relatively few survive but, instead, the confessions of faith which were produced during this period. In the Confesio Taboritum of 1431, the priests of Tábor accepted the position of Wyclifs Trialogus and rejected confirmation and its ceremonial as without scriptural foundation24 in reaction to Jan Rokycana’s defense of the sacrament and his attempt to find a biblical foundation for it in Jesus’s touching small children and in the accounts of Acts 2 and 19.25 In his Instruction on the Sacraments26 (probably contemporary with the Confessio Taboritum) Petr Chelčický takes the same position on confirmation against Jan Rokycana as did the Taborites. Following Wy- clif, he denied that the sacrament as practiced by Rome and the Utraquists had a biblical foundation but, rather, was invented by “some gathering of bishops” and, in time, was embellished with great pomp and pretense. Chelčický, however, does not leave matters at that. Clearly inspired by The Emergence of Reformed Confirmation reform was certainly the failure of the utraquists to obtain the historic episcopate. Such was the utraquist commitment to the catholic understanding of the historic (apostolic) succession of order that they continued to seek episcopi vagantes who would ordain their clergy and bishops who would give them the historic episcopate.23 While finding episcopi vagantes to ordain utraquist priests would have been in itself a difficult task, assuring episcopal confirmation in this fashion would have been impossible. The reality with which the Bohemians reformers had to come to live was that episcopal confirmation was an impossibility and, if there was to be something that stood in continuity with the rite which appeared in the pontificals, it would have to take on a radically new form. Either the rite could be delegated to presbyters as a part of a unified baptismal rite (possibly with episcopally consecrated chrism), or it could be allowed to disappear (which would violate the utraquist claims to continuity of catholic practice), or else, it could be allowed to develop in a new direction based on what could be claimed to be an “apostolic” model found in Dionysius. It was this latter course of action which was to be taken. [pageend55]52 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l Ps-Dionysius’s instructions to Timothy, Chelčický suggests that the Christian nurture of young children is best assured if believing parents raise their children until maturity and then take them to a priest who would then instruct them in the rigours of discipleship. The seeds for confirmation, in its Reformation sense, have been sown. The short confession of faith of 1468 is the first evidence of a liturgical rite based on this Dionysio-Chelchikian model which I have been able to find: Again there should be three sureties for the child, so that if the father and mother are somewhat negligent or dead, the sureties themselves may take charge of the children to guide them to what is good. And when he is grown up and has come to understanding, so that he can answer for himself, they should then bring him to the pastor, and give testimony concerning him how he has been preserved in the power of baptism, and has received instruction. And he should be questioned whether he will so persevere in the faith of the Lord Christ and in the Christian doctrine preached by the apostles. And when it is known that he is of age and reckoned according to the testimony of his sureties and his own confession by word of mouth, he shall receive him into the congregation and by laying on of hands confirm him, and pray that God will give him strength from on high with perseverance. And in the old church he was given a blow on the cheek as a sign that he must suffer for Christ, and this was called strengthening, whether of old or young. But today in the Roman Church they call it confirmation.27 Thus, by 1468, there was a practice of confirmation on mature profession of faith after catechesis. This, of course, does not have a precedent in Roman tradition. While the confirmands are asked to confess their intention to “persevere... in the Christian doctrine preached by the apostles,” there is no direct claim made for the apostolic character of the practice itself. This claim, however, is made obliquely in the reference to the ritual practice of the “old church.”28 What is important in the reference to the practice of the old church which “today in the Roman Church they call... confirmation,” is that it is quite clear that the ritual practice described in the confession of faith intended to be a renewed form of “apostolic” confirmation replacing Roman confirmation. In another confession of faith dated 150429 the claims being made for reformed confirmation are much more expansive. The rite is claimed to be apostolic. Its benefits are increased gifts of the Holy Spirit and reception into the fellowship of the church. Its minister is either a bishop or a priest: [pageend56]Th e Mo r a v ia n Or ig in s o f Co n f ir ma t io n 53 Our faith being taken from the sacred scriptures, we profess that the practice was observed in the times of the apostles. Whoever did not receive the promised gifts of the Holy Spirit in the years of youth received them for confirmation of faith by prayer and the laying on of hands in this manner. So also we feel with regard to infants. Whoever being baptized has come to the true faith and purposes to portray it in action, in adversaries and reproaches, to the intent that the new birth may be seen revealed in his spirit and life of thankfulness, such a one ought to be brought to the bishop, or priest, and be confirmed. And being questioned with regard to the truths of the faith and the sacred precepts, and also with regard to his good will, his firm purpose and works of truth, he shall testify and declare that he has all such things. Such a one should be confirmed in the hope of the truth he has attained, and in deed aided by the prayers of the church, so that there may come to him an increase of the gifts of the Holy Spirit for steadfastness and the welfare of the faith. Finally, by the laying on of hands to confirm the promises of God and the truth held in virtue of the name of the Father and of his Word and the kindly Spirit, let him be received into the fellowship of the church.30 There is a marked theological development between the two accounts. While both see the rite as in some way admitting to the ecclesia (“he shall receive him into the congregation” compared to “let him be received into the fellowship of the church”) something that would have been unthinkable apart from the time of baptism in Dionysius himself, the second account introduces an important distinction between the act of baptism and the time of coming to “true faith.” Both ideas are significant in the development of reformed confirmation which often came to be interpreted as the time of “joining the church” or attaining “full membership.” The second witness is also important in that it paves the way for the dichotomy between “baptismal faith” and “true faith” which will come to play such an important role in some reformed theologies. Finally, there is a clear equation being made between intellectual achievement, faith and ecclesial membership. Most of the qualities which became characteristic of the sixteenth century Reformation understanding of confirmation were now in place. The final piece is put in place about thirty years later when another confession of faith31 adds “personal salvation” to the developing model of confirmation. Confirmation, as it has now come to be described, was to take place when the adolescent had attained “years of discretion,” achieved an intellectual understanding of the faith and “begun seriously to love Christ.” And so when they have come to years of discretion, and understand the reason of their faith, and have begun seriously to love Christ, we [pageend57]54 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l bring them to a profession of whatever things they have been taught by their parents and godparents, or by the ministry of the church, that all those things they themselves of their own accord and quite freely and before the whole church for their own personal salvation may profess in their celebration of the rite of the laying on of hands. And this being done, their confirmation follows.32 The reformed model of confirmation was now complete. This liturgical and theological novelty had come to have a life of its own. It is quite clearly no longer the second post-baptismal anointing of the Roman rite which could take place either at the time of an infant’s baptism or, should there be no bishop present, at a much later time. The rite which “was called strengthening, whether of old or young” had become a rite in which adolescents publicly proclaim that they have appropriated the faith that was professed on their behalf by their parents and godparents at the time of their baptism. Their faith has become “reasoned.” Confirmation is now to come as the culmination of the catechetical process; parents and godparents appear to have no further responsibilities in this area. And finally, perhaps most important of all, the rite is given “apostolic” authority. In a gradual development clearly based on the Dionysian model a new rite has appeared, novel in the history of the church, but clearly meeting the needs of a church in which the humanistic value placed on a personal, reasoned, faith was paramount. Reformed Confirmation Justified In his massive history of the Bohemian Brethren,33 Jan Amos Komenský (Comenius) presents an account of the sacramental practices of his religious community. Writing after the defeat of the Bohemians in the Battle of the White Mountain and the subsequent banishment of the reformed Bohemian Church from the Czech lands, Comenius gives us a picture of a sacramental life which is well developed and clearly in place. Infant baptism remained a part of the church’s religious practice, but unlike in utraquist practice (based on the Dionysian model) it does not admit to the eucharist; instead, baptism admits to catechesis. At the end of the baptismal order presented by Comenius he notes: Finally an exhortation is addressed to the parents and godparents that, remembering their obligation, they carefully instruct the child until they can with approval set him, [pageend58]Th e Mo r a v ia n Or ig in s o f Co n f ir ma t io n 55 religiously educated and rightly brought up, in the presence of the church, and commend him to the pastoral care of the ministers.34 Comenius then presents the rite of admission to the brotherhood used for adolescents baptized as infants: But the juniors, having been taught the main points of religion by their parents and sponsors or by their teachers in school, are publicly in church committed to the care of the pastors, before the celebration of the holy supper (most frequently at the time of the visitation by the seniors themselves) in this rite: 1. There are first read the words of Christ: Come to me, etc. (Mat. 11:28) with the addition of a very brief exegesis. 2. The boys and girls selected for this, after having been examined for some time previously by the pastor, are placed in order in the middle of the church. 3. Then they are asked whether they wish to renew the covenant entered into with Godin their baptism (Deut.29:10 etc., Josh.24:22, Is. 44:5). 4. When they assent, the main points of the covenant are explained according to the form prescribed by the apostle (Titus 2:11-13), and they are ordered openly before the church to renounce Satan, the world, the flesh, etc. 5. A confession of faith is demanded of them: so together they all in a loud voice recite the apostles’ creed. 6. Then kneeling, the minister going before them, they pray God that he will forgive the sins of their youth, and will strengthen them with his Holy Spirit that they may do what is pleasing to his will: which later the whole congregation also does, praying for them. 7. In the prayers there is proclaimed to the novices as also to the whole church absolution and the right of the children of God to take their place at the table of the Lord. 8. Finally, there is added also the apostolic rite of the laying on of hands (Mk. 10:16, Heb.6:6, Acts 8:16-17), with an invocation of the divine name upon them for strengthening their hope of heavenly grace. What Comenius described is the classic Reformation rite and theology of confirmation. At baptism parents and godparents are exhorted to instruct the children in the faith until they can be brought back to the community, able to make their own profession of faith. When the time has come for that catechetical process to be brought to a conclusion, they are brought to the pastor for further instruction. While Comenius does not tell us the contents of this instruction, he does tell us that it is closely linked with preparation for first communion and could well have been primarily sacramental in its content. On the day of confirmation itself the candidates are first examined by the pastor at length and then taken into the body of the church itself. [pageend59]56 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l What follows is clearly modeled on the baptismal rite (with a rather heavy Reformation gloss). The candidates make the renunciations just as their parents and sponsors had done for them and just as they would, should they be baptized as adults. This done, together they proclaim the baptismal creed. They are then led through a confession of sin and pray that they might be strengthened by the Spirit. After an absolution the candidates are then declared communicants. The rite concludes with a non-pneumatic hand laying and the celebration of the eucharist. Here is the paradigm for reformed confirmation in its fulness. It marks the end of catechesis at home and follows an intense period of instruction by the clergy. The candidates are quite clearly asked to appropriate for themselves the promises made on their behalf by their baptismal sponsors. Here that is done directly by repeating the renunciations and baptismal creed. Unlike confirmation in the Roman rite, reformed confirmation makes no claims to being pneumatic in character (i.e. no theological claims are made that confirmation bestows the Holy Spirit—that remains the substance of baptism). The imposition of hands is accompanied by “an invocation of the divine name... for strengthening [the candidates’] hope of heavenly grace” rather than for the sealing of the Spirit of the Roman rite. Finally, reformed confirmation is completed by admission to communion for the first time. In a period of just over a century Bohemia gave the church a new rite, a rite which was to be adopted but unacknowledged by many of the churches of the second Reformation. This new rite of confirmation, as I hope I have shown, was bom of the Bohemian commitment to reform on the model of the primitive church. The rite emerged as a natural consequence of the reformed practices of frequent communion and the admission of all the baptized to the eucharist which were themselves based on a renewed theology of Christian initiation and not, as has been earlier suggested, on a reaction to the negative comments on confirmation found in Wyclif’s Trialogus. Pseudo-Dionysius, the principal non-biblical “apostolic” witness, presented the model for a rite which met the needs of a church in which catechesis was becoming increasingly important and where fidelity to the model of the primitive church was paramount. In time, that model was itself to develop, becoming more clearly the ancestor of confirmation as it is known in the reformed churches. That model is not without its problems. It is unfortunate that the rite as an occasion for mature profession of faith was allowed to separate baptism [pageend60]Th e Mo r a v ia n Or ig in s o f Co n f ir ma t io n 57 and first communion, effectively destroying the integrated, biblical, baptismal theology of the early years of the Bohemian Reformation. The result was to make the sacraments cerebral, to be received only by those who had attained certain catechetical proficiency. But while the imposition of confirmation as a rite of admission to communion is quite rightly challenged by the contemporary church on theological and pastoral grounds, it is time that we acknowledged our indebtedness to the Bohemian church for a rite which enables those baptized as infants to make a public profession of their faith. In the western church that was the first, and for a long time was the only, way by which Christians could consciously re-profess their baptismal faith. 1. Apostolic Tradition 21. 2.

Then they should be carefully examined in private by approved men whether they sufficiently retain and remember the things which the priest has taught. If they be found to retain them sufficiently, they should be asked whether they ratify what their godparents promised in their name in baptism. If they answer that they ratify them, then let that profession be renewed in public at a gathering of their equals, and that with solemn ceremonies, fitting, pure, serious, and magnificent, and such things as become that profession, than which there is none more sacred...

Wyclif shared with the medieval church in not making a clear distinction between the offices of bishop and priest. He claimed that the primitive church had only priests and deacons and that bishops were, therefore, unnecessary. The reservation of ordination and confirmation to bishops alone was unnecessary, if not illicit, and served only to aggrandize the role of bishops, cf.

Petr Cendát, chaplain to Lord Čeněk of Vartemberk, raised it in his reply to Jakoubek and argued that the Church orders confirmation to proceed the eucharist except in cases of necessity, citing three texts from Gratian as his principal theological source. In the much more extensive exchange between Jakoubek and Jan Jesenic the question of confirmation is never raised, allowing us to conclude that it was seen as peripheral (or at least unimportant) even by the conservative Jesenic. 16. Eccl. Hier. II. 17. The distinction is actually a medieval one and emerges from the contemporary pastoral practice in which there were few (if any) adults to baptize and in which there is limited historical understanding of the baptismal practices of the patristic church in which no distinctions were made between infant and adult candidates for baptism. 18. Eccl. Hier. VII, iii, 11. 19. Eccl. Hier., VII, iii, 11. “You might say, however, that what could really earn the ridicule of the impious is the fact that infants, despite their inability to understand the divine things, are nevertheless admitted to that sacrament of sacred divine-birth and to the sacred symbols of the divine communion. In effect, the hierarch may be seen to teach divine things to those incapable of understanding them, to pass on the sacred traditions to those unable to grasp them. And a further cause for laughter is the practice whereby others speak the ritual renunciations and the sacred promises on behalf of the infants. ” [pageend62]Th e Mo r a v ia n Or ig in s o f Co n f ir ma t io n 59 20. Eccl. Hier., VII, iii, 11. “Yours [Timothy] is the understanding of a hierarch and you must not be angry with those who are mistaken. Rather, you must take care to guide them to the light by lovingly refuting their objections and by making clear to them, as sacred law commands, that our knowledge is far from being commensurate with the divine mysteries, many of which remain beyond our grasp and with a meaning outside our power to understand. They are known only to the orders which are superior to our human condition and they have a status quite in keeping with their divine nature. Many elude even the highest beings and are known fully only by that all-wise divinity which is the source of all wisdom.” 21. Eccl. Hier., VII, iii, 11. 22. The apostolic nature of the rite is re-enforced by Peter of Spain’s commentary where his paraphrase reads: “Unde visum est sanctis apostolis secundum hune modum suscipere infantes ita quod pater et mater pueri tradent eum alicui bono pedagogo in divinis misteriis docto.” (Exposiçao sobre os livros do beato Dionisio Areopagita, Manuel Alonso, ed. (Lisbon: Academia, 1957) 240.). This passage is somewhat of an anomaly in itself as it is one of the few occasions in the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy when Dionysius is obliged to abandon his claim to being a contemporary of the apostles by invoking apostolic practice “...let me set down what our blessed teachers, in their knowledge of the earliest tradition, have passed down to us...” 23. In 1452 a delegation was sent from Bohemia to Constantinople for this purpose and it appears to have failed primarily because it coincided with the fall of Byzantium to the Muslims, cf.

Harkins Karel Čapek’s trilogy of novels might never have been taken for a trilogy as such were it not for the “Afterword” (Doslov) he published as an addendum to the third novel, An Ordinary Life (Obyčejný život). This “Afterword” opens with the curt sentence, “Konec trilogie” (The End of the Trilogy), although this is the first suggestion the reader has had to that effect in some five hundred pages. The three novels were published separately: Hordubal in 1933, Meteor (Povětroň) in 1934 and An Ordinary Life in 1934, and continued to be published separately in later editions. The English translations made by M. and R. Weatherall likewise appeared separately in 1934-1936, and when they were reissued in 1948 the English publisher (Allen & Unwin) employed the collective title Three Novels for the single volume, as did the American co-publisher, A.A. Wyn. Although several subsequent editions, including the most recent one,1 print the three novels within one cover, publishers have steadfastly refused to employ Čapek’s term trilogy for the three works. Whether this attitude proceeds from a hard-headed realism, or simply from a profound lack of interest in aesthetic and metaphysical questions, is hard to say. Granted, the three novels of Čapek’s Trilogy have, in terms of plots, characters and settings, absolutely nothing in common. What is in common is the development of a philosophical theme, as I shall try to show. It is not even clear whether Čapek had the concept of a trilogy in mind when he began to write Hordubal. I suspect that it came to him at some point while he was working on Meteor, but this is merely a hunch, and if someone were to assert that it came only as an afterthought, following the completion of An Ordinary Life, I should be hard put to disprove him. Still, so dense and coherent is the development of thematic ideas in the Trilogy, that they will submit to analysis even without the support of an author’s intention. [pageend64]Th e St r u c t u r e o f Ča pe k ’s Tr il o g y 61 Both Václav Černý and Jan Mukařovský have pointed to the dialectic nature of the three novels of the Trilogy, both within the individual novels and in the Trilogy as a whole.2 Černý, it is true, does not employ the term “dialectic,” but his argument on “oppositions” implies the same thing. It is interesting that those thematic traits we can find in common for the three novels all seem to possess this dialectic character. If we ask, for instance, where the action of the three novels is played out, we uncover a dialectic opposition between “abroad” and “home” that is fundamental to the Trilogy. The Slovakia of Hordubal was no doubt exotic to Czech readers of the novel, but there is little necessity to argue the point. Hordubal has been to America: America is both the source of his wealth and a concentrated symbol of his sufferings and his self-denial. It is also a measure of his love for Polana: he went away from her in order that he might return in glory to love and worship her all the more. Perhaps this is not dialectic quite as much as paradox, but the relation of “abroad” and “home” is still, I would submit, dialectical. In Meteor we have less of paradox and rather more of dialectic: Case X returns home because he has transcended the state from which he originally fled. His return is a kind of Jungian reassertion of self based on that wisdom he has learned abroad. In An Ordinary Life there is, of course, no “abroad” as such. But there is a kind of dialectic opposition in the dimension of time. The “ordinary man” works for the railways: he is a station chief. His father- in-law helped him get the position. This was under the Austro-Hungarian Empire, of course, and his wife is a militant Austrian patriot. But the “ordinary man” himself fights for Czech independence; this opposition poisons his marriage, but it is clear that he wanted it that way. The dialectic element enters because he has achieved his success under the Empire, but now perceives that he wants something different, something more than mere success. This dialectic of “home” and “abroad,” we might note parenthetically, was not significant for the classic Czech novel (Zeyer’s Jan Maria Plojhar is a notable exception), but has become very significant in recent times. The novels of Vaculík, Páral, Kundera and Hrabal are full of it. The reasons for this are not uninteresting, but they are at least to some extent obvious, and we have little time to pursue them here. Another dialectic, so obvious it would be easy to miss it, is that of men and women. Čapek lived in an unbenighted world in which the [pageend65]62 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l heroes of novels were invariably men, and these men found women who react to them in various ways, but always in ways that subordinate them to the hero. The heroes keep a part of their lives independent from their women, but the women do not have the same freedom. This state of affairs was largely unquestioned, and it is of course healthy that we have now begun to question it. This sort of subordination I would characterize as another kind of dialectic. It is so stereotyped that I see little reason to characterize it for Čapek. Polana is so related to Hordubal, the Cuban girl to Case X, and the German wife to the “ordinary man.” It is noteworthy, however, that they are there in all three cases, and that Čapek does create women characters who are significant and meaningful, and not present us with an all-male world as for example Conrad and Jack London so often do. A third dialectic, one that I am convinced is fundamental to Čapek’s world, is that of romanticism and realism. I say romanticism and realism, when I probably should say romantic and realistic styles, but to a great extent we cannot categorize. No doubt the reader will want me to define what I mean by romanticism and realism, and this is a fair demand, of course, though the task may exceed the scope of this paper. But the issue is not really very pertinent to us here and I explored it elsewhere.3 The point of that article was that in the novel there is an elementary dialectic of romanticism and realism. This is particularly clear in the focal symbol of the railways. The railways are a grimy, omnipresent symbol of the modem world, but they are also a route to the far-away, the exotic, the ineffable. This same dialectical character infects much of Čapek’s world, for, while he draws on the most ordinary literary materials which are at hand, he discovers and reveals in them that which is transcendent and meaningful. No doubt many other kinds of dialectic oppositions can be found in these novelistic texts. Parallel to the ambiguity of the railroads in An Ordinary Life, we have the symbolic opposition of horses and cows in Hordubal and the ambiguity of nature imagery in Meteor, in which the beauty of tropical vegetation is constantly opposed to its danger and decay. The critics of Čapek’s day, including first and foremost Černý, perceived the trilogy as a “noetic” (i.e. epistemological) work. In fact, this epistemological viewpoint was inspired by Čapek’s own “Afterword:” for Čapek, knowledge is the main goal. Concerning Hordubal himself, such knowledge is impossible, of course, but Čapek makes it [pageend66]Th e St r u c t u r e o f Ča pe k ’s Tr il o g y 63 possible for us through the miracle of artistic creation. No doubt this realization is not the author’s ideological intention, but a kind of “bonus,” albeit involuntary on his part. But if the ideological structure of the Trilogy, taken as a whole, is to such an extent dialectical, then is it not likely that the artistic structure of the three novels, in their relations to one another, is also dialectic? I have dealt with this question elsewhere,4 but perhaps enough remains to be said that it is worth the reader’s time and attention to look at the matter again. It is noteworthy that the Trilogy represents a progression from Ca- pek’s traditional relativism to a new absolutism, as Václav Černý noted.5 It was essential for Čapek to rescue himself from the relatively insipid and monotonous relativism of the 1920s if he were to progress beyond it; it was also essential for him to make this transition if he was to find his way back to the eternal themes of literature, which hardly include philosophical relativism. This very progression is marked in the Trilogy itself, in which Hordubal, the first part of the Trilogy, is still rooted in relativism: the police’s and court’s reconstruction of events cannot find Hordu- bal’s love or his grief, for the heart of another is unknowable. This is in fact the Hegelian thesis: we cannot know the heart of another. (The fact that we can in fact known them through the work of art is already a step taken toward absolutism, of course.) In Meteor the three divergent accounts of the story of Case X led many critics (but not Václav Černý!) to suppose that this was another instance of Čapkovian relativism. The reviewers were overly impressed by the fact that there were three accounts and three narrators, and that each narrator imparted something of him- (or her-) self to the narrative. But in fact the three accounts have much in common: a flight from self, a withdrawal and return, an invention or discovery, love ... And hence knowledge of another human being is possible: this is the Hegelian antithesis of the Trilogy. In the third novel of the Trilogy a retired railway official attempts to write the story of his life, but what he originally conceives as a simple, unencumbered, “ordinary” story suddenly becomes a thicket of tangles and contradictions. These can be resolved only by the postulation of variety, of a whole host of personalities within him, some buried and silent, others potential, still others alive in rebellion. And here we have the synthesis of the triad: the plurality of perspectives and persons without corresponds to a plurality of persons within the individual. [pageend67]64 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l Elsewhere I have called attention to the fact that such a view serves as a foundation for the existence of a democratic society, but this is well known, and can also be found in Černý.6 What can concern us here is rather another question: are there any absolutes in the Trilogy which antecede the application of the Hegelian triad? In other words, does Čapek begin as an absolutist, or does he rather talk himself into becoming one? Indeed there is one symbol that seems to possess an absolute value, even though it does become involved in a dialectic of cognition: this is the human heart. We encounter this symbol in all three novels of the Trilogy. After he is murdered, Hordubal’s heart is sent off to a laboratory for examination. But it is lost somewhere in transit, and the examination is never made. Case X dies of a heart attack, as does the “ordinary man.” This symbol of the heart stands over the entire Trilogy, and suggests to us, therefore, that the work may not be only about cognition and knowledge; it is also a work concerned with humanity and with human feeling. In spite of Čapek and his “Afterword,” the primary meaning of the Trilogy may not be noetic or epistemological. It is not cognition that is at issue, but human feeling. And although the possibility of cognition might suggest an optimistic conclusion (as Čapek’s “Afterword” would have us believe), that of human feeling and sympathy hardly does. All three heroes come to the same end—death. All three are lonely, unappreciated, unsuccessful, particularly in their search for love and sympathetic recognition. If the social view in the Trilogy is optimistic and democratic, the life prospects of the individual, in his loneliness and alienation, are certainly not. 1.

NOTES [pageend68]Karel Čapek on Science, Progress, and Responsibility Norma Comrada Critical reaction to the English translations of Karel Čapek’s anti-utopian, anti-absolutist plays and novels has generally ranged from favorable to enthusiastic, both when these works first appeared in the 1920s and in later decades. One body of criticism, however, has perceived his basic concern to be, in brief, our inability as human beings to quit tinkering and leave things alone. While this is an apt characterization, it is also misleading: English-language readers of Čapek have had little access to his extensive journalistic commentary on the nature of scientific progress and its relationship to responsibility. His journalism deals with these issues most directly. In his frequent articles and columns for Lidové noviny (The People’s Newspaper) and other publications he further explains and explores the concerns raised in his fiction; it is from his journalistic ouevre that most of the quotes herein have been taken. Čapek’s plays and novels can easily be read as arguments for a complete halt to scientific experimentation in order to avoid disaster. In The Makropolous Affair (Věc Makropulos), for instance, a mysterious elixir guaranteed to prolong life indefinitely leads not to the increasing betterment of the human race but to increasing boredom, and the protagonist loses all will to live. In R.U.R., robots that are manufactured by a similarly wondrous recipe to rid the planet of human toil apparently rid the planet of human life, instead. In The Absolute at Large (Továrna na absolutno), the invention of a potentially constructive atom-splitting device producing a free, unlimited supply of energy results in widespread religious as well as economic chaos. Krakatit explores the possible consequences of splitting the atom, but here the emphasis is on its destructive potential, and the book can be interpreted as suggesting very strongly the wisdom of leaving things alone. Čapek’s journalism, however, makes it [pageend69]66 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l clear that, while opposed to absolutism in all forms, he himself nonetheless believed profoundly in at least one absolute: not that of leaving things alone, but that of taking responsibility for other human beings as individuals and for society as a whole. Nearly all that Čapek wrote about progress and responsibility has relevance today, whether it is our single-minded devotion to building better mousetraps, or the all-too-human desire to impose a personal vision of truth on everyone else in order to build a supposedly better and happier world. But human nature is unlikely to change; at most, Čapek thought, after a thousand years, surely after a hundred thousand years, we would no longer settle our disputes the way dogs in the streets settle theirs. As might be expected, the most remarkable changes since his time have occurred not at all in human nature but in the fields of science and technology. Therefore our propensity for always trying to build better mousetraps will best serve the purpose of this paper. Even the most casual observer realizes that we live today in a world that is capable of changing—or being changed—beyond all human experience, beyond expectation, almost beyond speculation. What might Čapek make of this progress? Some would say that he predicted a good deal of it long ago.1 Whether or not these assertions hold, it is probable that Čapek would have approached today’s realities and likelihoods as he did those of his own age: by examining our definitions of progress, by raising questions of responsibility, by identifying the ethical and moral issues common to both of these abstract concepts, and by reducing that which is abstract to that which is not only concrete but ordinary and everyday. This is not to imply that Čapek mistrusted scientists per se or feared entirely for the future. On the contrary, evidence of his admiration for scientists abounds, as in his 1934 tribute to Madame Curie: Who, fifty years from now, will remember the names of today’s government ministers, marshals, and the other greats of the world? But the name of Madame Curie will survive; people will always remember that coupled with this name is one of the most profound changes in human thinking on matter and energy, on the unimaginably small atom, and on the astonishing architecture of matter.... Madame Curie-Sklodowska gave her life for the world.2 An earlier article, in which admiration and exhortation are combined, Čapek urged scientists to apply their unique knowledge and experience to the freedom of an educated, free-spirited nation: [pageend70]Ča pe k o n Sc ie n c e , Pr o g r e s s a n d Re s po n s ib il it y 67 [Even] the most specialized science has in principle a certain universal, clearly cultural purpose; all sciences grew out of a primordial need for knowledge, and in the end they return to this. Philosophers once said that “knowledge builds the world.” Well, even if scientific knowledge is not building the real world, it can build before our eyes a better and finer world, without which no work, not even scientific work, would make any sense. There is no science which should not be called to this task.... If a science wants to shut itself up inside its own inaccessible specialty, it is not committing a sin; its work will not be lost to the nation. But if, from time to time, it examines the vital events of the day with the tenacious idea that it would be better to take part, then let it do so.3 This article was written one year to the day before the creation of the First Czechoslovak Republic, and thus Čapek was urging scientists to make their unique contributions to the building of an as-yet-nonexistent state and, in doing so, perhaps proving himself once again a prophet. The point is that he was convinced as early as 1917 that scientists could and should direct their attention and efforts to the needs of society. As for inventors and inventions, for the most part Čapek deeply admired them. He praised Edison equally for persevering with his work at the age of eighty: “...he creates, he invents, he constructs; isn’t this the finest invention that Edison has given us?”4 True, the telephone behaved in a “frankly unruly manner” and needed to develop a proper code of conduct for itself,5 but it also provided all sorts of unpredictable and therefore satisfying experiences for parties at both ends of the line,6 even though for years Čapek refused to have one installed in his home and took calls only at his Lidové noviny office. If encouraging a telephone to function more decorously was problematic, the prospect of operating an automobile was to Čapek a daunting experience. “When I first sat before a steering wheel and learned to drive a car, I was consumed by a sense of fear. There is, in an intellectual, an inherent mistrust of machines and a fatal ability to envision a wide variety of outcomes. A more firmly rooted man has an easier time of it. ”7 Radios and gramophones, too, among other modem technological wonders, had their virtues as well as vices in Čapek’s eyes. Of the latter invention, in conjunction with his voluminous record collection of international folk music (of which unfortunately comparatively few disks have survived), he noted with pleasure: “I have the world at home in my cupboard.”8 He adored his Swedish vacuum cleaner and American coke stove and said that he longed to acquire, in addition, a three-stage internal combustion engine, a threshing machine, and perhaps even a roller for rolling plate [pageend71]68 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l glass windows.9 Inventions and discoveries, and the processes of invention and discovery as well as of production, fascinated Čapek. His concern was not our inability to quit tinkering, but our inability to cope with the consequences of our tinkering. An example of the misuse of technology at the lowest level of consequence, that of frustration rather than catastrophe, would be the shoddy goods resulting from irresponsibility on the part of manufacturers of everyday essentials. When the lack of a manufacturing ethic or standards produces matches that will not strike, envelopes that will not seal, or string that always breaks, both daily irritability and permanent mistrust are instilled in a nation’s consumers. It also gives that nation’s export goods an undesirable reputation abroad, and here Čapek’s plea for a greater sense of moral obligation appeals also to a sense of national pride: “Manufacturing standards or a philosophy of life; this is a requirement for quality. You can judge a country by its poets and philosophers; but you can also judge it by its matches, envelopes and string.”10 If Czechoslovakia’s matches failed to please by failing to light, their containers, or rather the manufacture of their containers, remained to Čapek an intriguing issue. Čapek’s earlier dream-list of home equipment for fun rather than for profit also included a machine that makes matchboxes. In Čapek’s eyes machines in and of themselves were not the problem: Our machines are benign if not genial; it is our social and human efforts that are more or less bungling.... The relationship of machines to people depends largely upon the relationship of people to one another, and the nature of this relationship lies entirely in our hands, no less than does the responsibility for the ultimate power of machines.11 We seem predisposed to imagine progress in the form of gasoline engines, electricity, and other technical contrivances.... If we wish to talk about progress, let us not carry on about the number of automobiles or telephones but point instead to the value that human life holds for us in our civilization.”12 Caring about the fate of others on this planet was the standard by which Čapek judged the actions of industrialists as well as manufacturers, scientists, and inventors. Those whom he held responsible for unsafe working conditions were the recipients in print of deep anger and scorn; his highest praise was reserved for those who took brave and selfless action when technology failed. If his hero in the world of political affairs was Masaryk, his heroes in the worlds of industry and commerce were [pageend72]Ča pe k o n Sc ie n c e , Pr o g r e s s a n d Re s po n s ib il it y 69 ordinary, unknown individuals such as the radio operator on the Titanic who stuck to his post and continued to send messages for help even as the great ship sank. What recalled this forgotten hero to mind was a news bulletin about a Polish miner who had descended three times back into the pit where his co-workers were surrounded by noxious fumes and flames. Twice the man was brought out unconscious; the third time, he was brought out dead; his name, Čapek noted with wonder, was Pronobis. Čapek termed both men, the Titanic’s radio operator and the Polish miner, “supreme examples of love and courage in the midst of all the evils which stun humankind.”13 Still another mining accident, this time in his own country, had trapped one hundred and thirty-six men beneath the surface of the earth. Whether they could be saved or would die of slow suffocation remained unknown when “Technology and Disaster” was written. After describing the tension and the horror, Čapek noted: Well, this time too, there will be an investigation; why this dreadful misfortune took place and whether any of the ordinary precautions for averting mining disasters were neglected. But is this the extent of the responsibility? Do you think it will adequately quiet our conscience and our dread, if the investigation finds there is no culprit? We would like to ask the technicians if they would swear on their honor that all possibilities for the protection of human life, in mining and other industries, have been exhausted, considering the state of technology and knowledge today. We would like to know if as much subtle ingenuity and resourcefulness have been exerted for safeguarding people under the earth and in trains as has already been expended in safeguarding of bank vaults. A bank vault is a marvel of security; it is equipped with the most perfect alarm devices, invisible beams, and God knows what else. Property is cared for splendidly; the question is whether the safeguarding of human life is also as extensively and resourcefully cared for.... We don’t know why science and technology have failed so shamefully in this respect; either devices for safeguarding the lives of working men are not those on which much money can be made, or there is simply no sincere or strong demand for them. God knows which.14 Such work, Čapek believed, could not be left to chance or good will. He proposed that a national fund be created for subsidizing and testing safety equipment, thereby identifying in addition a governmental responsibility: to insist that industrialists and manufacturers concern themselves with public safety as well as with acquisition. Čapek’s views on scientific and technological progress, like those of most people, alternated between admiration and apprehension. To automatically equate such progress with the advancement of civilization, for instance, ignores our inability to manage or regulate civilization in beneficent ways. Yet to decry progress [pageend73]70 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l or attempt to hinder it would be naive in the extreme. Čapek had hoped to make these points, among others, with his “robot play” R. U.R\ both his message and his original concept of nonmechanical robots, however, went badly awry. Fifteen years after the explosion of R. U.R. onto stages of the world, and the subsequent proliferation of “robots” in every known medium, he wrote in protest: I have been silent long enough... I kept my thoughts to myself as the notion became fixed that Robots have limbs of plate metal, and that their insides are cogs and wires or whatever... but when [the author] recently read that, in Moscow, they were finishing a magnificent film in which mechanical Robots trample the world underfoot by means of electromagnetic waves, he developed a strong urge to protest... he rejects all responsibility for the idea that metal contraptions could ever replace human beings, and that by means of wires they could awaken something like life, love, or rebellion. Well, this author is not to blame for what might be called the worldwide Robot humbug. The author did not intend to furnish the world with plate-metal dummies stuffed with wires, photocells, and other mechanical flimflam ... The world needed mechanical Robots, for it believes more in machines than in life; it is fascinated more by technological wonders than by the wonder of life.15 Whether caused by political decision or by outright military force, regardless of motivation or rationale, this was abhorrent in the extreme to Čapek: again, each of us must take responsibility for our actions; when the sense of individual responsibility wanes, civilization is lost. The wanton leveling, during the Spanish civil war, by fascist bombers of a small town occasioned the poem “When this century collapses, dead at last” that makes the point forcefully. In it, he comments on the passing into history of the twentieth century—an event more than sixty years in the future at the time of its writing—from a perspective which he could easily maintain today. Earlier, in 1925, Čapek had written that “the history of modem science proves how often the paths of discovery have been forced to go against current moral needs, against the exigencies of society and the heart. And still it has been a fruitful and successful path.”16 The key word here is moral, in that morality can be seen to underlie both Čapek’s ambivalence and his emphasis on personal responsibility. Alexander Matuška notes that Čapek did “not connect human happiness with science, but with morality; he recognizes only moral progress and progress in the realm of ideas.”17 Each of us has an inherent capacity for good and evil alike and a [pageend74]Ča pe k o n Sc ie n c e , Pr o g r e s s a n d Re s po n s ib il it y 71 capacity for choice—and the moral and ethical implications of our choices are unavoidable. Hope for the future lies in our acknowledgement of this and in the nature of our choices. From the vantage point of nearly seventy years in this fast-track century, the question is whether Čapek would have revised his analytical framework and, further, reached the same conclusions. Today, modem science and technology place boundless power at our disposal. For the first time in history, we not only can change life for the better but alter it radically from anything we have ever known. Alternatively, we have the capability of canceling life altogether. The coordinates anchoring Čapek’s analytical framework as expressed in these examples of his journalism suggest that he most likely would write now very much as he wrote decades ago: that, by exercising choice on the side of positive human values, perhaps we can yet acquire the wisdom to keep our discoveries and inventions from controlling us. “[People] should learn to live in harmony with the world into which they were bom and to take personal responsibility for it. This sense of responsibility is bom of service and participation in everyday human affairs.18 Čapek believed that his own responsibility was to warn against the blind pursuit of scientific and technological progress for its own sake, and against the blind acceptance of whatever resulted as being of human and societal benefit. His urgent appeal was never to “leave things alone,” but rather to be accountable for what we do and to put our best human instincts and characteristics to their fullest and finest use. If we fail in this, we may well find ourselves in the world he described so tersely in his 1934 column titled “Fables from the Future.” “Building Commissioner. From the standpoint of health, your cave is defective. It lets in air. Year 2200: The greatest invention of our times! Stainless flint tools!”19 This article is based on a paper presented at the IV World Congress for Soviet and East European Studies at Harrogate, England, July 1990. 1. Claims have been made that The White Plague (Bílá nemoc), for instance, presages the effects of radiation and possibly of AIDS. In the Times Literary Supplement (8 May 1981), Sir Cecil Parrott wrote that Factory for the Absolute also foreshadowed nuclear fallout. Certainly a good case can be made for Čapek as the first “nuclear novelist” in that Factory and Krakatit were written, respectively, in 1922 and 1924; and, of course, in Adam the Creator (Adam Stvořitel) the bomb goes off.

[pageend76]Bohemia Lies In the Sea: The Quest for an Anchor in Far from the Tree Veronika Ambros To live is to battle with trolls In the vaults of heart and brain. To write: that is to sit in judgment over one's seif. Zuzana Brabcová completed the manuscript of her novel Far from the Tree (Daleko od stromu) in Prague. But the book was published in Köln in 1987,1 and subsequently reviewed in Paris. Anyone familiar with the complex destinies of works of Czech literature over the past two decades knows that winding routes of this sort were all but unavoidable for reaching the reader. However, most of the manuscripts that commuted between the inner and the outer exiles came from the pens of established authors. Contrary to that, Brabcová’s name was unknown to the general public prior to the publication of her book. Twenty-four at the time of the book’s appearance, she was among the very few writers who represented the new generation. Sylvie Richterová, the distinguished literary scholar and critic, when reviewing Brabcová’s book, called it “mature” and one of the greatest surprises of Czech literature of recent years.2 Such an evaluation points not only to the uniqueness of the work but also to the unusual situation of Czech literature during the 1980s. The purpose of this study is to inquire into the structure of this remarkable work of modem Czech prose. Tempting as it may be, an examination of the book within the Czech cultural and political context of the eighties would go beyond this study’s scope. According to Richterová, Far from the Tree is a work that recommends itself to literary connoisseurs. In times haunted by the spirit of Ibsen [pageend77]74 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l postmodernism, one expects a literary work to be patterned upon such techniques as collage, interior monologue, and intertextuality. To start off the discussion of this book I wish to borrow a phrase from Milan Kundera: It is “the enigma of the self” that stimulates “a quest for the self.”3 Brabcová’s quest for the self is set out already in the title. It alludes to the proverb “The apple does not fall far from the tree” (Jablko nepadá daleko od stromu), i.e. children take after their parents. The method of the book is based on the premise that the distance between the apple and the tree cannot be determined unless both can be located in the flow of hic et nunc, i.e. in the subject of the narrative. The central character is a young girl named Věra, who is also the /c/?-narrator of the story. It is her perspective that dominates the narrative, in which fragments of her biography are pieced together. Each of the six parts relates some of the most salient events of her life. Frequently it is the intrusion of external forces, with a strongly political charge, that shape these episodes. For instance, Ivan, Vëra’s first love, decides to leave the country but is caught and jailed. In response to the situation Věra attempts suicide, an act which eventually lands her in an asylum. With her next friend she shares the experience of a madhouse and later a room across a hotel Europa. Confined to a cell, she withdraws into a world of her own in which she intends to plant a tree and, as her greatgrandmother had done, watch for those alive or dead to come. The action of Far from the Tree is of secondary importance. The novel is not just another account of the past, so typical of many Czech novels of the seventies and eighties, e.g. Jan Pelc’s ...And Worse it Will Get (...a bude hůř, 1985) or Pavel Kohout’s Where the Dog is Buried (Kde je pes zakopán, 1987). One of the novel’s characters, the librarian Bertin, comments on this “bunch of chapters filled with water,” with the words: “You have got the beads, but not the string” (Korálky máš, ale šňůra ti chybí; 122). By “beads” Bertin means the sparse fragmented events that are “reported.” They are often enclosed within a stream of consciousness so that the fictional world appears as a collage or a mosaic of images immersed in water. The focus is on the reflection of the outside in the inner world of the narrator. It is the narrator who holds the “beads” together as the unifying principle of the novel. The Narrator The narrative constantly oscillates between segments of a report and interior monologue. As a result the narrator often resembles the lyrical I [pageend78]Bo h e mia Lie s in t h e Se a 75 in a poem-in-prose. The fact that the narrator’s gender coincides with that of the author authenticates not so much the events as it provides an emotional perspective. The narrator’s quest for someone who shares her point of view is expressed as longing for a dialogue, and ranks among the most important impulses for her writing the novel. At first, her letters serve as means for the fulfillment of this wish. But none of the addressees such as the numb grandfather Václav or Jesus ever answers. During the course of the book, though, the narrator presents several characters who do “share” her world for periods of time. Some of them are merely imaginary inhabitants of her internal world, addressees of the narrator’s interior monologue which often turns into a dialogue. One of them, for instance, is Vëra’s classmate Řeháček who has no “voice” of his own. Others appear in both the reported and the interior worlds. Indeed, the majority of the characters supply the narrator with words, sentences, and specific phrases, thereby enhancing her language and the scope of her thoughts. Věra herself often leaves her narrational stance to participate in the dialogue. The most prominent among the interlocutors in the interior monologue is Josifek, the man with whom Věra shares her madness. It is Josifek to whom she addresses the first page and to whom she discloses her motivation for writing her book. As she confesses, she wanted to achieve two things in life: first, to give birth to a son and, second, to write a book. The first being impossible, the narrator sets out to complete the second. The process of writing is to facilitate Vëra’s drawing the dividing line between the I and the you (34), leading to a genuine dialogue. In this regard, Josifek replaces the silent addressees of the narrator in the earlier parts of the story, addressees such as grandfather Václav and Jesus. However, Josifek is not only a new partner in a dialogue. He himself contributes to the shaping of the issue by drawing a distinction between Rimbaud’s “I is someone other” and the “I am who I am” of the Old Testament. These two are identified by him as two separate subjects. But Josifek, too, longs to find the primordial I that Wehle, Vëra’s fatherly friend, refers to in his quotation of an ancient text: “In the beginning there was only my own self, and only it, and this self expressed desire” (Na počátku bylo jen já, pouze jediné, a to projevilo touhu; 139). This search for the 7 and the process of establishing the / as a subject in its own right is, in spite of Bertin’s claim to the contrary, the initial string holding the beads of the book together. The interior monologue, however, is often triggered off by an outside impulse. It is frequently a mode of the narrator’s escape from the psych[pageend79]76 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l The central setting of the book is Prague, but the countryside, as well as the steppes and prairies of Russia, play a role. Some spots, such as Kampa or the old Jewish cemetery, can be easily identified within the topography of Prague. The exact location of other places is obscured by the fact that the narrator likes to dislodge objects in the manner of Marc Chagall, whose name is often mentioned in the text. Prague is in the narrator’s eyes “a fantastic city without people, populated instead by double-headed cards” (Praha je pro mě nesrozumitelné, fantastické město bez lidí, zato plné dvojhlavých karet; 21). The double-headed cards refer to the contrast between the real and the reflected world. Usually it is home which creates one’s feeling of belonging. Relying upon the association with the opening line of the Czech national anthem, “Where is my home?” (Kde domov můj?) Brabcová, too, begins by asking where her home is. But her concept of home is only marginally based on geographical concerns. The word has several different connotations for her. Brabcová alludes negatively to the Czech national anthem as well as to a popular song that praises the beauty of Bohemia, “Bohemia, Thou Beautiful” (“Čechy krásné, Čechy mé”). Neither the fossilized connection between beauty and home, nor any of the common homeland symbols, such as Božena Němcová’s sentimental novel The Grandmother, or Bedřich Smetana’s mythical opera Libuše, or even Prague as the mother of Czech cities, is able to awaken patriotic feelings in her. These are to her alien concepts of older generations, promoted by teachers: “Professor Slavik enters the classroom. With an elegant gesture of his hand he makes us sit down so that he might presently discourse with a dreamy look, on beautiful Bohemia... again he will use sentences with the odor of starch” (Do třídy vstoupil pan učitel Slavík. Plavným pohybem ruky nás usazuje, aby se vzápětí se zasněným pohledem rozhovořil o Čechách krásných... zase bude používat věty s pachem škrobu; 11). In contrast to the notion of Bohemia as the epitome of beauty, the word Home iatrists’ or interrogators’ intrusion into her internal world. These intruders reflect alien values prevalent in the outside world. They provide frequently an ironic perspective to the situations. Their comments underscore the division between the two worlds. The confrontation brings out the “dullness” of the external world. In addition, the questioning has its structural function. The questions divide the text into segments and set the rhythm of the narrative. [pageend80]Bo h é mu Lie s in t h e Se a 11 “home” suggests to her letters of denunciation, believers in Communism, and prisoners behind bars (62). The search for home begins with Vera’s first friend leaving the country. After this happens, her geographical awareness becomes more prominent. With the departure of her second friend, it is only language that is left to represent home. The narrator calls her native tongue “a sweet poisonous scale” (sladká jedovatá šupina; 21). However, it is language that nourishes hope, in spite of the fact that it is mostly grief that language, the substitute for home, is able to adequately express. The narrator’s associative logic reduces home to the alliteration shouted by some young boys “Pivo, prdel, policajti” (Beer, bum, bobbies; 21). No wonder Ivan speaks about an alcoholic generation without an anchor when the notion of home has so little to offer. Alcohol is associatively linked to the meeting point of the members of the narrator’s generation: a pub with a bizarre name In the Suitcase (V kufru). The name suggests the narrow space of the only shelter available to the young people, but it is also suggestive of the displaced condition of the generation that cannot find its purpose, their only choice being between real and internal exile. Paradoxically, the pub is also a place where the illusion of belonging can be nourished. The term used by Brabcová is rather unusual. She uses the term vřazenost (being in line, or having one’s place). The word is derived from řada (meaning literally a row, the order of a military formation as well as social ranking). It is the establishment that would like to impose such an order on the children. But the children themselves, tired of their search for something different, frequently crave for a secure place in such a formation. A comparison of Brabcová with Pelc’s novel ...And Worse it Will Get underscores her different usage of the language of symbols. In Pelc’s book, a glass of beer in a pub creates a world of its own. Alcohol provides a means of escape from the pragmatic world. An individual’s space is reduced to the spot on which the glass of beer stands. In Pelc’s terminology such a glass is called “tykadlo” (feeler or antenna), in other words, a means of communication. It is beer which substitutes for communication. In the much more complex world of Brabcová, the pub is a forum publicum for the internal world. Yet another location of the internal world is the home which the narrator shares with Josifek across from the hotel Europa. Like the name of the pub, the name of the hotel has symbolic connotations. It suggests that the narrator’s home is mapped outside Europe. This home is a place of permanent insecurity, bullied by an unwelcomed hand that presses the button of the door bell. Vèra’s [pageend81]78 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l The narrative does not come to life through action but through the protagonist’s inner life and memory. As a consequence, it does not follow a chronological order nor it is tied to a particular place. There are swift flashes of different times and places. Time sequence is discounted by the narrator herself: “Understand, please, that behind closed eyes no succession exists” (Pochopte, prosím, že za zavřenýma očima žádné pořadí neexistuje; 22). Perception of time is created through references to history and to the lives of her grandparents and parents. They blend with the fictional world, with the narrator’s own experience, and with anticipatory scenes of future events. The narrator claims that it is history that offers the possibility of singling out two separate subjects. It is especially Czech history to which the book’s motto alludes by way of its connection to Vladislav Vančura’s book Pictures from the History of the Czech People (Obrazy z dějin národa českého). Further, the meaning of this literary reference is augmented by the fact that the paragraph in question introduces Kosmas, the author of the first Czech chronicle. Kosmas, according to Vančura, claimed that he had to push himself again and again into writing. The motto seems to imply that Brabcová, like Kosmas, faced ceaseless difficulties while writing. Aside from this information about the subject of the book, the motto also indicates that Czech history, rather than being reported, is presented as a story (as it is in Vančura), this time authenticated by the personality of the narrator. Allusions to the highlights of Czech history are countless. But they do not lead to the aware- Time Jewish Grandfather as well as her fatherly friend, Mister Wehle, serve as a basis for further examination of the term home. Actually, the book is dedicated to grandfather Jevsej, a Jew. Along with the mother figure, he symbolizes the breadth of the Russian steppe. Jevsej also breaks the national and religious boundaries. In Véra’s personality the different cultures intersect. In the gallery of Vera’s ancestors, grandfather Václav ended up in the Communist party, whereas his own father ended up in an asylum. Věra, the daughter of a priest, continues the family history by becoming an inmate of a madhouse too. Indeed, the madhouse is the only homelike place. It is also the only place where the feeling of “vřazenost“ can be found. In this context, one is reminded of Jaroslav Hašek’s novel in which the pub and the madhouse are also conceived of as shelters. In Brabcová the madhouse serves as the ultimate home for this generation without an anchor. [pageend82]Bo h e mia Lie s in t h e Se a 79 Another mode of “the quest for the self” is the confrontation of generations. Its purpose is to find out how far the apple has fallen from the tree. Ivan, one of the narrator’s young interlocutors, offers a description of his own generation: “Our generation, autistic, alcoholic, crawling with debts, melancholic and unambitious in the Eastern way, matter-of-fact and hurried in the Western way, our generation without anchor, because without a sea” (Naše generace, autistická, alkoholická, prolezlá dluhy, východně teskná a neambiciózní, západně věcná a zrychlená, naše generace bez kotvy, neboť bez moře; 71). As Ivan would have it, the difference between his own and his father’s generation lies in the pronominal definition: “When my father wants to talk about himself, he says on principle ‘us.’ When I want to talk about my generation, I always speak about myselP (Když chce můj otec mluvit o sobě, říká zásadně Generations ness of the nation’s firm roots. Rather, they lead to the sensation that history is full of symbols which, like empty cartridges, are devoid of sense: “From history, the only eye of [the one eyed] Žižka is staring at me” (Z historie na mě civí jediné Žižkovo oko; 21). Patriotism, manifested by some of the characters, is also treated rather ironically. Future belongs to the categories imposed upon Věra from the outside. She accuses her teacher of having prepared her future for her, one that deprived her of Řeháček, her best friend. As a result, future appears as not much different from the present and the past. It promises little else than jail, madhouse, or exile. In addition, the future is strongly connected to death. One of the chapters has the title “Pig-Slaughtering” (Zabíjačka); another chapter is titled “House of Life” (Dům života), a Hebrew expression for cemetery. Death is always comprehended as part of life: “We are still young and we have all of life ahead of us, all of death” (Jsme oba mladí a máme před sebou ještě celý život, ještě celou smrt; 124). Death awareness serves as a link between generations. Through this awareness Vëra’s grandparents’ presence is established, their lives being a part of the individual biographies of their grandchildren. The narrator recalls the inscription on a cemetery entrance: “We were as you are, you will be as we are” (Byli jsme jako vy, budete jako my; 17). The merging together of time and place is dramatized by the metaphor of a magic crystal ball in which all the images of past and future events are randomly intermingled. “Time has abandoned us all” (Čas nás všechny opustil; 23), the narrator concludes. [pageend83]80 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l ‘my’. Já chci-li povídat o své generaci, mluvím vždy o sobě; 39). Unlike their parents, who saw themselves only as part of a collective, those who belong to the young generation are concerned with connecting bits and pieces of their own selves. Of course, in spite of the “we” usage, the fathers’ generation was never a homogeneous collective. Thus the protagonist’s “venerated father” (ctihodný otec), as Věra calls him, differs significantly from Ivan’s. Vëra’s father is the one who, very much like the psychiatrists, insists on speaking about the linearity of time instead of its circularity. On the other hand, Ivan’s father belongs to the “walking legends” who in the past probably walked “behind the looking glasses” who, like the narrator, experienced their own “drowning. ” The contrast between the generations is made evident by the psychiatrists or the interrogators whose real identity remains concealed. Their superior status is established through the pronominal “you” (“vy” in Czech). It is they who represent the old generation and make the young people talk about themselves. In the novel, they are not shown as performing the function of their profession—to help patients to become independent. They are part of the establishment and as such they embody the danger of the external world. Those patients who are able to call up the demon Bengoro will eventually be released. But the world they will be released into offers no hope. “Bengoro,” the title of the fifth chapter, depicts one of the escape routes from the pragmatic world. Other escapes are suggested by the grandparents. Grandfather Václav’s hobby, for instance, was drawing of maps of nonexistent continents and countries. Such maps have no meaning in the pragmatic world. Ivan pays for this mingling of the two worlds. He tries to flee the country using one of Václav’s maps. Predictably, he is caught and sent to jail. The young people of Brabcová’s book concentrate on finding a niche outside the pragmatic world. The world of their ancestors provides an attractive model in certain respect. Theodore Roszak’s reference to the American youth’s of the 1960s “eclectic taste for mystic, occult and magical”4 interestingly enough holds true also in respect to the young generation of Brabcová’s novel. Brabcová’s bent for the mystical experience can also be seen as a special, East European variety of counter culture. Bohemia Lies In The Sea Far from the Tree exhibits several features of modem fictional style. Among the most important is what Doležel calls “dissolution of the [pageend84]Bo h e mia Lie s in t h e Se a 81 opposition of speech levels,” and the breaking down of the “barrier between the discourse of the narrator and the discourse of the characters ... a free flow of verbal means from one plane to another. ” Another is the use of what he calls “a specific, subjective ‘distortion’.”5 As a result, the actual world is submerged into the fictional world so that both appear to be an entity. Still another reason for regarding Far from the Tree as a work of modem prose can be found in its intertextual references. The novel is immersed in a literary tradition that lies outside Czech literature. This is reflected in the motif of water that dominates the intertextual references. All six chapters of this slim book are brimming with water images. To be more specific, the central image in the introductory chapter, “A Huge Building Amidst Waters” (Veliká budova uprostřed vod) is suggestive not only of the prenatal state of an embryo; it also evokes the Book of Genesis. Even more prominent is the allusion to Shakespeare’s notorious whimsy in The Winter’s Tale. The Bohemia of the play is located at the seashore and yet it has all the distinctive features of Arcadia. Set in a pastoral landscape, the plot develops the theme of the stubbornness of fathers. Alluding to the play, Brabcová’s novel underscores the clash between the pastoral model and the woods where dead birds fall from the sky. But the fictional world of Far from the Tree is deprived of a happy ending. Brabcová’s Bohemia does not lie by the sea but is turning into one. This imagery evokes a poem by the German poet Ingeborg Bachmann, “Bohemia Lies by the Sea” (Böhmen liegt am Meer). For Bachmann, it is only Bohemia’s connection with the sea which can furnish her with hope: “Liegt Böhmen noch am Meer, glaub ich den Meeren wieder. Und glaub ich noch ans Meer, so hoffe ich auf Land” (If Bohemia still lies by the sea, I believe in the sea. And if I believe in the sea, I can hope for land as well). The very premise of the poem, its reliance on the near supernatural, may serve as evidence that for the lyrical subject of Bachmann’s poem realistic hope does not exist. Bachmann’s Bohemia is no longer an exotic setting for a tale. Brabcová alters Shakespeare’s fictional topography into mere reverie. The actual world induces despair. The deluge appears inevitable. In Far from the Tree the fact that Bohemia is about to be deluged points up the absence of an anchor. The image of an anchor is associated with that of a harbor, symbolizing security, belonging, and perhaps community as well. In the course of a search for a home, the anchor is also a figurative representation of Christian faith, in which the anchor is symbolic of hope. In the language of symbols, the concept of language as “a sweet poisonous scale” suggests both the sea and the fish. Here, once [pageend85]82 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l again, the narrator touches on the mythical ground. Moreover, these symbols are inherent in the tenets of the “venerated father.” From this particular vantage point, the distance between the two generations appears to be not that great. Even though Bohemia, according to the narrator, becomes inundated, Far from the Tree offers neither anchor nor hope. Yet, hope glimmers in the last paragraph of the book. Here the narrator connects the two traditions of her ancestors. On the one hand, she wants to return to her father’s house; on the other hand, she intends to plant a tree and to wait for those alive or dead to come, hence imitating her great-grandmother. Because those who will come will be carried on the backs of fish, language (the scale) will be in abundance. And there is the tree to be planted. This place of hope is entirely within the interior life beyond the reach of the hand that rings the bell. And that is where the tree gains in importance. In this regard, the tree has yet another connotation beyond that of pointing to the Czech proverb referred to in the book’s title. A new tree also implies the beginning of a new book. Even more importantly, a new tree refers to a completed book, an assurance that history will be recorded and a dividing line between the subjects drawn. Interpreted in that way, however, the title’s implication is that “the quest for the self” is far from completed.

NOTES [pageend86]Czechs, Slovaks and Ruthenians in the U.S.: A Selective Bibliography Miloslav Rechcígl, Jr. This is a selective, yet comprehensive, bibliography of publications relating to immigrants in the United States from the territory of Czechoslovakia since the times of the Kingdom of Bohemia through the creation of the Czechoslovak Republic. Inasmuch as Subcarpathian Ruthenia was an integral part of the First Czechoslovak Republic, we felt it only appropriate to include Ruthenians in our coverage as well. The emphasis has been placed on English-language material, books as well as periodical articles; selected publications in other languages, particularly Czech and Slovak, are also included if they are singularly unique or if no comparable texts exist in English. Our compilation was undertaken to aid the serious student of American immigration and ethnic history as well as the general public interested in learning about the life and contributions of Czechs, Slovaks and Ruthenians in America. There is a perceptible gap in this area, which the present work will hopefully narrow down. The researcher interested in pursuing full-length bibliographies should be aware that there is only one exhaustive (over 7,000 titles) albeit not all-inclusive bibliography relating to things Czechoslovak in America, that being Czechs and Slovaks in North America: A Bibliography, by Esther Jerabek (New York: Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences in America, 1976, 448 p.). It is an invaluable tool for the advanced researcher with a reading knowledge of Czech or Slovak, but it presents some drawbacks for the general reader since Miss Jerabek was not selective enough and frequently listed obscure titles not readily accessible. The present bibliography is organized according to the outline given below. Under most major headings are listed general surveys, followed by more specific titles, arranged by ethnic groups, and further arranged [pageend87]84 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l chronologically. To increase the utility of the bibliography, a separate biographical section has been included under respective subjects whenever applicable. The selection, which includes both natives of Czechoslovakia and individuals with Czechoslovak roots, has been made solely on the basis of importance of the individuals. I.

Mendl, Jr. (College Station: Texas A & M University Press, 1991). 147 p. The last two decades have witnessed an extraordinary interest in American ethnic history. Having rejected the stilted “melting pot” theory, Americans are now eager to find as much information as they can about their ancestors, their beginnings in the United States and the country they came from. They put enormous effort into the preparation of their family trees and the younger generation goes to the trouble of learning the language of their grandparents. This interest in ethnic history has now reached the academic quarters as well. The book under review is a collaborative product between two educators, Clirton Machann of Texas A&M and James Mendl, Jr. of the Public School System of Taylor, Texas, both of Czech ancestry. The authors put together a handsome volume of ten first-person accounts of early Czech immigrants in Texas, accompanied with copious explanatory notes and a historical introduction. In a way, it is a sequel to their earlier historical monograph, Krásná Amerika: A Study of the Texas Czechs 1851-1931 (Austin, Tex.: Eakin Press, 1983). While their first publication provided good background and factual information about the Czech immigrants in Texas, the present volume reveals the soul of the early settlers. It is a book about their attitudes and emotions, hopes and frustrations, hardships and aspirations, their love of the land, their feeling about the American Civil War, the unique quality of the Czech cultural and religious heritage and the development of Czech identity in Texas. The individual stories first appeared in Czech in the annual Amerikán Národní Kalendář (American National Almanac), published by the Chicago Publishing House of August Geringer. The translation into idiomatic English must have been quite difficult, considering the different prose styles and different educational attainment of the settlers who wrote them. Machann and Mendl have done an excellent job in preserving the stylistic integrity of the original Czech; furthermore, their translations are delightfully readable. We recommend the book to anyone interested in Czech-American ethnic history. Inasmuch as these narratives were not heretofore available in English, and considering the fact that the Czechs constitute the third most important [pageend137]134 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l ethnic element in Texas, the book should be of value to historians of American immigration and ethnicity in general. Miloslav Rechdgl, Jr. Ter mina l Pa r a do x: The No vel s o f Mil a n Kunder a . By Marie N. Banerjee. (New York: Weidenfeld, 1990). 294 p. (ISBN 0802111270) There are at least two kinds of successful critical monographs: those that provide the reader with brilliant generalizations, such as Dmitri Merezhkov- sky’s classic study Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky, and those that call his attention to striking if often fine details concerning the author of the work under discussion, such as George Painter’s fine study of Proust or André Maurois’s work on Balzac. It is rare when a critical study, such as Ivan Morris’s critique of The Tale of Genji, accomplishes both tasks with equal success. Banerjee’s study of Milan Kundera’s writing falls rather definitely into the second category, though we do find occasional attempts to accomplish the first as well. Perhaps the most successful of the latter are found in the last two chapters—and especially the final one, on Kundera’s The Unbearable Lightness of Being, in particular in the meditation (following indications in Kundera’s own text) on Nietzsche and Parmenides. As an example of our second category, the present study is almost entirely successful, and brings a very great erudition as well as copious references to classical and French literature to shed light on Kundera’s writing, as well as great powers of observation and reflection. However, some readers, the present one included, might have preferred the approach of generalization as a first approach to Kundera. After reading the present study, it is still unclear what Kundera’s place is in contemporary literature, or even in the literature of the twentieth century. Kundera does deal very much with sex and love, of course. He has some black humor. But his characters are still persons, literary characterizations—the tendency to abstraction and dehumanization Ortega noted as so typical for the literature of the twentieth century is not found here. Perhaps the most striking feature that is modem in Kundera’s work is his existentialism and the existentialism of his characters, especially manifest in The Unbearable Lightness of Being as well as in his dramatic adaptation of Diderot’s Jacques the Fatalist. Kundera’s own view of love is existentialist: love frees us from the chain of necessity (only partly humorously expressed by Kundera in his many references to Beethoven’s [pageend138]Bo o k Re v ie w s 135 perhaps half-comic “Es muss sein!”). Still, we must ask if it is all really so. What, in fact, is Kundera’s view of love and sex? But the curious thing is that Banerjee treats all this rather cursorily, with the exception of the existential angle. And Kundera himself, for all his love of rationacination—a love that spoils the present Immortality, in my view-does not rationicate very much on the subject of love. When de does, he is often boring or trivial. A rare exception are several stories in his Laughable Loves, in particular “The Golden Apple of Desire,” in which the very sense and seriousness of love are simply explored humorously, though at times with a certain poignancy. Love and sex for Kundera are doubtless all-important, but more from the standpoint of physical desire than existential freedom. Life can scarcely exist without sex, but even so, if it does have a purpose, it does not seem to have very much value. True, it does ultimately serve as a gage of existential freedom, but Kundera hardly attempts to assay the worth of this anywhere in his writing. Love frees us from necessity, but that freedom does not seem to offer us very much. And in fact love lays down new necessities and obligations, as Kundera himself perceived clearly in Laughable Loves (I still regard that book as his masterpiece)—to our wives or husbands, to our mistresses or lovers, to those who assist or conspire in our loves. Banerjee does not seem to realize that the semiotic element is very important in these stories—the semantics of the lie and of counterfeiting. The Joke, too, Kundera’s first novel, shares this semiotic viewpoint. There is relatively little in this study about Communism, although all five of Kundera’s novels (with the partial exception of The Farewell Party) have a great deal to say about it. Curiously, Banerjee writes about “Communism in Czech society,” instead of “Czech (or Czechoslovak) Communist society.” Was this a slip or an intentional standpoint, one that might look forward to the coming demise of “Communism in Czech society?” Did Kundera foresee this demise too? I have the sneaky feeling that anti-Communism was too banal a subject, too “pre-modem,” to figure much in the present study. But, in the spirit of Kundera’s existentialism, love could be viewed as a release from the oppression of Communist society (as with Tomáš and Teréza in The Unbearable Lightness of Being.) Finally, there is very little in this study about Czech literature as such. Čapek and Nezval are named, it is true, but I don’t think a single one of Kundera’s great contemporaries, e.g. Škvorecký, Páral, Klíma, Vaculík, even Havel, is mentioned. It is true, of course, that Kundera does not fit well into the history of Czech literature. (But he does have some points in common with his contemporaries, for example his views of love and sex are not far from those of Vladimír Páral.) Banerjee is doubtless correct in emphasizing his ties to French literature. And this will go down better with his non-Czech readers, [pageend139]136 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l though present-day Czech readers are said not to care very much for Kundera. Still, it might have been worth pointing out that Karel Čapek, the great master of Czech literature, also drew relatively little from the Czech literary tradition—his roots are rather English than French. And Kundera still speaks of Čapek with respect. Kundera and Čapek are alike in their fondness for a fiction filled with the author’s ratiocinations, for philosophy, for their attempts (if very different ones) to be humanistic. In this they are both very definitely Czech. A Desc r ipt io n o f Spo k en Pr a g ue Czec h. By Charles E. Townsend. (Columbus, Ohio: Slavica Publishers, 1990). 151 p. (ISBN 089357211X). Long years of practical and theoretical work on the Prague variant of Common Czech (Obecná čeština) by Charles Townsend, one of the foremost American Slavists and Bohemists, has resulted in a concise, but very trenchant and systematic description of this linguistic entity. It has by now become almost a tradition that those focusing the most concentrated attention on this difficult subject are precisely foreign Bohemists and Czech teachers. Particularly the latter experience a very urgent and real need to prepare their students to deal with the language they will in most cases be actually hearing, but which most Czech grammars and dictionaries treat either not at all or only very peripherally. In fact, even among Czech linguists working on Common Czech many have had practical experience with teaching Czech to foreigners. The position of Common Czech—and its central, Prague variant—among the various forms of our national language is one of the most debated questions in the Czech language field. Before World War II the notion of a binary opposition prevailed: literary vs. non-literary. The dichotomy derived directly from the fact that Josef Dobrovský, when codifying Modem Literary Czech at the beginning of the 19th century, took as his point of departure the by now quite distant language of the Humanistic period. This language already differed substantially from contemporary usage, particularly in its phonology and morphology. The distance between the two norms, literary and spoken Czech, has even to this day shrunk only partly. Still, their mutual influence has become one of the most dynamic factors in Czech linguistic development, whose complexity is particularly apparent in the very difficult Czech morphology. The task of present-day language codifiers is further complicated by the fact that we observe a noticeable discrepancy between the way people actually William E. Harkins [pageend140]Bo o k Re v ie w s 137 use a language and the way they evaluate others’ speech. Particularly today, in the post-November period, there is a strong aversion to real or imagined instances of linguistic vulgarity (which people identify with the forty years of totalitarianism just ended). There is also the paradox, difficult for a dispassionate observer to comprehend, that codification still refuses to recognize most forms which are widely used but distinctly unprestigious. Townsend’s introduction also makes it clear that classification of the various kinds of contemporary Czech remains quite complicated. Though there are numerous cases of partial overlapping, one can use this gradation to identify the following linguistic structures: A. Standard: 1. Literary language (its written and spoken form) 2. Colloquial variety of the literary language B. Non-standard 3. Common Czech (4. Local dialects) It must also not be forgotten that in the Czech language community the deciding factor is not the status or the education of the speaker but, first and foremost, the circumstances of the communication. Here, too, numerous contradictions arise, for many speakers recognize that a formal (official or public) context requires a literary utterance, yet precisely in the area of the spoken language they are unable to meet this requirement fully. An undeniable advantage of Townsend’s book is that he correctly defines the role of Common Czech as a generally used uncodified standard, which nevertheless possesses established norms. The book offers a comprehensive description of Common Czech on the phonetic, morphological, syntactic and lexical levels. Particularly valuable is the realistic and contemporary nature of the examples he gives. From a theoretical viewpoint one can accept the author’s doubts as to whether there does exist a colloquialized variety of literary Czech which differs from literary Czech only by a certain relaxation of the norms. Townsend cites here his own experiences and those of his informants in claiming that Czech conversation does take place in Common Czech and this structure (or at least some of its characteristic elements) is used even in semi-official and official situations; for example, in professional and scholarly presentations. On the other hand, I do not agree with Townsend’s view that a codified (literary) spoken Czech is a contradiction in terms. What we are actually seeing is that the newly awakened oratorical style (which in every society and in every historical period goes hand in hand with the revival of democratic institutions) is substantially expanding the boundaries of literary [pageend141]138 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l Czech usage. For that matter the components of a linguistic situation are not just recorded linguistic utterances but also carry with them the speakers’ attitudes towards these utterances. And these speakers certainly do not hope for any increasing penetration of Common Czech into areas other than informal dialogue. The reader and user of Townsend’s book, which is not only a solid theoretical description of Common Czech, but above all a good language textbook, primarily wants to find out how people in Prague and the major part of the Czech area speak. And he will learn in this book many general and individual things (also to be praised here are a glossary of the most commonly used Common Czech expressions with their English equivalents and an extensive bibliography). Thanks to all this, Townsend’s book is a significant contribution to our knowledge of this difficult area in both Czech and international Bohemistics. Jiří Kraus In Vol.8, No. 1/2, 1989 issue, we published G.J. Svoboda’s “Wilson and Masaryk: The Origins and Backgrounds of their Personal Diplomacy. ” Its author has informed us that he never authorized its publication in CCEJ (or Kosmas) and that the article was published in T.G. Masaryk (1850- 1937): Vol. 3, Statesman and Cultural Force, ed. H. Hanak (London: Macmillan, 1990). Mr. Svoboda is correct: there is no record of his ever submitting this article to us, and we are incapable of explaining how it found its way to the editor’s desk.
