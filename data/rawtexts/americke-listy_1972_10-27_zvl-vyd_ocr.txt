AMERICKE LISTY - Special Issue OCTOBER 27, 1972 How the war in Vietnam started A verdict onAmerica In 1891 Anton Pavlovich Chekhov wrote a letter to his friend Suvorin about Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy: “The day before yesterday I read Tolstoy’s “Epilogue.” To hell with the philosophy of the great men of this world! All great sages are just as despotic and just as ignorant and insensitive as generals, because they feel so safe. Diogenes used to spit in people’s faces, because he knew that he would get away with it. Tolstoy slanders doctors, as if they were scoundrels; he proudly displays his ignorance of great problems, because he is another Diogenes whom nobody would lock up or even criticize in the newspapers. So the devil take philosophy of all great men of this world! That Tolstoy! He is not a human being—he is a superman, a Jupiter!” Chekhov has said hundred times: “I love Tolstoy.” He was a devoted admirer of Tolstoy’s literary art. but he was irritated when Tolstoy departed from literature and authoritatively pronounced his rather foolish views, for example, about medicine, of which Chekhov, being a physician, knew much more. In 1888 Friedrich Nietzsche, certainly a great philosopher and psychologist, wrote to his friend Over- beck that he. Nietzsche, felt in himself enough power to break history of mankind asunder and that, in consequence thereof, great historical developments would occur within the next two years. It seems that great men are much too often aware of their greatness and tempted to take destiny of mankind into their own hands. They may be great in one category, but far from great in another one; life must be, however, a compromise between the expansive great men and the more modest, not so great people, between the philosopher and the ordinary man. Tolstoy used his fame for an attempt to divert mankind off the road upon which humanity was progressing to that time. He tried to induce people not to seek medical help and to consider a physician as dangerous as a poisonous snake; to give up science (Continued on page 4) “Americké Listy" is a weekly newspaper of the Czechs and Slovaks in the US. They were coming in the second half of the 19th century to the US in large numbers, to seek better opportunities, some of them to seek freedom. Similar influx was then coming from other countries. The original group of Czechoslovak immigrants was enlarged later by political refugees, after Adolf Hiller seized the Czech lands in 1939, then in 191,8. after the Communist overthroiu of the government, and finally after Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. A member of the Australian Parliament once asked: “How can I be against Communism, if I know it only from books?" Our refugees do not know Communism only from books; they observed closely how it 's being done when a totalitarian power ivants to take over the country. It was their fate to learn that a totalitarian system, if it has sufficient strength, and enough opportunity, will never rest, until it seizes everything a nation has. The publishers of “Americké Listy" believe that they are expressing the opinion of the great majority of these political exiles; therefore, they decided , to publish a special English-language supplement, presenting translations of some articles that appeared in said newspaper. Those Americans who are willing to accept this offer, may find it of some interest to look at certain questions through other people’s eyes. Our political refugee is ready and willing to learn; he shows due respect as a man who is coming from a new democracy to an old one. He expects an encouraging view of the function and practice of an old. experienced democracy. Our refugee thinks that if he doesn’t know some answer, then Mr. Smith, or Mr. Brown, or Mr. Jones surely would know that answer. Sometimes, horvever, our refugee finds that' Mr. Smith has no such knowledge and that Mr. Smith feels himself carried away by a current, wlFle Mr. Brown and Mr. Jones are just shrugging their shoulders. Particularly in an election year our refugee does not feel that he is being offered the political enlightment he hoped to obtain here. Our refugee comes from a country where at one time the leaders of five political parties united in order to pilot the state through dangers and perils to safety. In this old, experienced democracy that has accepted him, our refugee does not notice any similar attempt at this moment, but sees more partisan and personal passions that he expected to encounter; he cannot help noticing that the usual gap between the two major parties is being dug deeper, into an unusual chasm. People too easily accept the possibility of never meeting each other again. America is a laboratory of mankind, where all experiments are tested. The United States is busy conducting the great experiment of freedom, just as the Soviet Union is busy conducting its great experiment of restriction of liberties. It must be kept in mind, that.in laboratory certain experiments can explode. Our refugee doesn’t doubt that the ferment and the search after the new vistas will bring great results one day and open new horizons — if there is time enough. Standing close by are dictatorial states who are trying to prevent the search of new vistas from affecting them. They are tigh- tenning the discipline every day. In agreement with the behest of their founding father’s, they never cease to think of victory; they believe that disciplined states will overcome the undisciplined countries in the end. Most of all they are convinced that a democratic state, which is so attentive to the fickle mood of free people, cannot sustain sufficient endurance and will which are necessary for a purposeful foreign policy They hope one day they will see the splinters which will remain of democratic society. Meanwhile, our refugee is surprised, to see how in a democratic country its flag sometimes is torn down and the enemy’s flag hoisted high, as if this were a natural thing for a pluralistic society; to see how some citizens slander their country more than the enemy would dare; to hear some citizens stating after a long deliberation that it is the Communists’ natural right to engage in an ideological struggle, while democratic- minded people do not have any such right; to see how univers.ties aie being seized and closed in the name of the most progressive ideas, although such actions used to be taken until this time only by the reactionaries. Our refugee feels that the world democracy stands and falls with the United States, the only true big democratic power. He does not think that he is intellectually retarded, if he strongly opposes the vieiv expressed by an American journalist: “The United States is the most dangerous and destructive power in the world." His own fate did not prepare our refugee to believe that international policies are not based on power. He remembers that in- international politics there exists negligence. In Munich in 1938, Chamberlain for Great Britain and Daladier for France both acted like sheep, because due to the internal political situation in their countries, their governments had nc- (Continued on page 2) The history of the war in Vietnam is the history of the United States over the past 15 years. Some Am- erica®? are now asking: “How did we ever get into this mess?” After the end of the World War II, men and nations were searching their consciences and their minds. Adolph Hitler's burned remains were found in the courtyard of the chancellery. How was it possible that this man, so ridiculous in many ways, could ever become such a menace to the whole world? To that question statesmen, historians and the United Nations, which was being organized at that time, gave a reply while these impressions of war were still fresh in everybody’s mind: It was.possible only because he was clever enough not to attempt to launch his attacks all at once and clever enough not to disclose his whole intent. He just went on grabbing one country after another, piece by piece, and each time democratic statesmen were able to persuade themselves as well as others that this or that particular piece of land, Austria or Czechoslovakia. were of no special importance anyway. Finally, after Hitler’s seizure of several basic parts of Europe, it became obvious that his strength had grown tremendously and that it would be dangerous to fight him. After a while it became unavoidable to fight him. but then the whole world had to be mobilized for that purpose and for a long time the result of that action remained very uncertain. When the bloody struggle was finished, various, statesmen, historians and the young Organization of the United Nations came to the conclusion that in the future, nobody would be permitted to seize the world gradually, almost inconspicuously. This collective determination provided the basis for the organization of the United Nations, and it is an “American tragedy” that the United States adhered to that collective decision longer than other nations. Some new states were created after the war, among them North Korea and South Korea. It didn’t take too long, and (Continued on page 5) Does Mr. Smith know? [pageend1]AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY . . . nistic toward any use of power. He was a follower of the classical foreign policy, and for such policy, there was no climate less favorable than that in America. The problems outlined by Forrestal have not been solved to this day; they became even more urgent. A new, outspoken generation has come to the fore and meets with derision everything classical, everything connected with the past. The theoreticians of tragedy tell us that tragedy differs from other literary forms in one aspect, namely: the tragic hero is in- noceht. In this sense, the international situation of America may be considered as tragic in many ways. The story of James Forrestal is now all but forgotten. During World War II he served as Secretary of the Navy, and after the war. while serving as the Secretary of Defense, he committed suicide. Political depression seemed to be connected with motives of his suicide. He left diaries where he says: “Our problem is to find some balance between our national idealism and the power which we now possess, and our unwillingness to use it when necessary. I find that whenever some American sug- ' gests that "’e must act according to the needs of our own security, he is called a damn fascist or imperialist.” DOES MR. SMITH KNOW? (Continued from page 1) glected to obtain modern arms and thus, Chamberlain and Daladier wanted to gain more time from Hitler, in order to make up for the lost time. Unfortunately. Hitler kneiv what, they, wanted. Modern military technology is very complicated, and in this respect, to catch up does not mean to catch up tomorrow but. in one, two, three years. Our refugee thinks that wide masses of American citizens periodically yield to a temptation to believe that the whole world is as good-natured as they are. President John F. Kennedy said: “Let’s not fear threats.” And he added: “Let’s not. feay to negotiate.” Since the development of nuclear bombs it is the supreme duty of statesmen toward mankind to try to negotiate. . On the other hand, a negotiator ivho cannot, discern reality under the words, could lose by negotiating more than an uncapable ntilitary commander can lose in a rear. A gullible negotiator does not fear such, threats, because he fails'to recognize them. ■ ■ The press in the West is constantly watching out for any symptoms' of neo-Stalimsm in the USSR and seems to be catching a sight of its shadow quite frequently. Our refugee who has seen things from a very close distance, th.nks that the word "neo-Stalinism" is obscuring the substance of the whole problem. He is convinced that it is not necessary to watch so much for a revival of Stalinism, but that it is necessary to watch how far Marxism-Leninism is still alive. Stalinism is a past episode of Soviet history; I; grew under circumstances which. no longer exist and which were possible only under the sovereign rule of one cruel individual. If the Soviets need to tighten the screws of their dictatorship, to mobilize the population for any purpose, to distort justice in favor of Party, to plan a global expansion, if they are aspiring to rule over the world, they certainly do not need Stalinism for such aims, since they can as soon find all ideo]o- gy they need in Leninism and in Marxism-Leninism. What these two state doctrines of Communist regimes order the Communists as well as other citizens to do. how far they lead the Soviets in their current- policies, these are enigmas that a Western statesman, cannot resolve during his visit in Moscow by discussion with his Soviet hosts; the answer cannot be divined from a superfical view of the Soviet life, as it will be shown to him. To go to the very heart of that problem — that task should be given to the institutions of political research which are so numerous here in the IJzesř. We do not know whether such a task is enthrusted to them. The Soviets are hiding their internal political life by an elaborate screen of secrecy, and nobody can be completely certain about the real actual trends in the USSR. Certain trends appear frequently on the surface and a completely different undercurrent is fluctuating below it. Therefore, a statesman who deals with the Soviets must be prepared for both possibilities. for the. better one, as well as for the worse one,; he must not put all eggs in one basket, under the label of “Hope”. This may seem like schoolbook wisdom, against which no special objections can be raised. Yes, indeed, it is the wisdom of schoolbooks, but can we be entirely certain that it will not be forgotten? Do Messrs. Smith, Brown and Jones think about these problems? They are the people, the last instance of democratic politics. What is their pleasure? One century ago, in a conversation with Danish critic Brandes. Henrik Ibsen praised Russia. “Great country,” he said w'ith a smile, “just think of the marvelous oppression there!” “What do you mean?" asked Bran des. “Just think,” said Ibsen, “of the glorious love of freedom that only oppression breeds. Russia is one of the few countries in the world where people still love freedom and are willing to sacrifice something for freedom.” Forrestal thought that the new. splendid time hadn’t come yet, when international politics could be reliably based on moral principles. He criticized America’s failure to demand that the peace treaty in 1945 be negotiated, while the American Army was still stationed in Europe and not when only one powerful force, the Red Army, remained there. It would be presumptions to say now that Forrestal was wrong. As it appears from his diaries, he was afraid that it would be difficult for the American democracy to find a way to create a systematic and logical foreign policy. He realized that the spirit of America is mostly antago- Certain circumstance- predestined America, with no fault of her own, to become a target of everybody’s criticism, if nothing else. The fact that it is not the Sovieto-Russian imperialism, but the American imperialism that, contrary to all reality, is being castigated throughout the world, is an extraordinary, almost fantastic success scored by Communist propaganda Were it not for certain circumstances, one would suspect that propagandists of democracy must be lacking any talent ať all. The American tradition is isolationist more than anything else. Whenever America was involved in world affairs, she always displayed a strong tendency to pull back into her own territory as soon as possible. Two world wars erupted entirely without her intervention; they erupted because of traditional hostilities between European nations. America regarded Europe as a continent from whence come catastrophe, suffering and countless war deaths. Two American presidents — Wilson and Roosevelt — were elected because of their ability to keep America, up to that .moment, out of the European conflict. If in 1916 the German submarine attacks had not become excessively brutal and if it had not endangered the United States, and if in 1941 the Japanese had not attacked and destroyed the American fleet in Pearl Harbor, nobody knows whether these two U.S. presidents would have been able to involve the United States in the war. although for some time they both •had seen the war as the last resort to save democracy in Europe. America participated in two world wars, but in each instance, immediately after the V-Day, she felt an irresistible urge to pull back and mind her own af- fairs. After the first world war the United States refused to join the League of Nations, which decision is considered by most historians as a grave mistake with possibly tragic consequences. It enabled European fascists to taunt the League of Nations with impunity, because it was loo weak without the U. S. support. The reasons for such American reticence were clearly expressed many times already; USA feared that her part cipation in the League would entangle her in disputes which were stirring up so frequently all over Europe, Asia and Africa. She felt no ambition to act as an umpire in world squabbles. Perhaps, among other things, she feared that she was not quite prepared for such a task. Right after the last shots were fired in World War II, the United States, under the pressure of public opinion, demobilized and hastily brought her troops home, leaving their arms scattered all over the world for anybody’s picking. The work was done—now let’s forget all about it as soon as possible! America saw herself as she really is: a country grown in its own manner on its own continent and wishing to go on living in its own fash on. In 1946. one year after the war, Winston Churchill came to USA to present here the real situation of Europe: stripped bare, poor, exhausted and powerless Europe looked like an easy victim. The American atomic bomb is the only thing that stands in the way of a Soviet attack upon Europe, said Churchill. Democracy was saved. but soon it could be lost again. Doesn’t the United States see that? asked Churchill. Once again, just as in 1916. just as in 1940, the United States was called to save democracy. In the name of democracy America once again appeared cn the world scene in a more active role. Her dec’sion must be judged by each individual according to his scale of values of democracy. The United States was forced into an active world role when she took —and perhaps had to take upon herself the duties of the greatest democratic power in the world. Britain and France were just recovering from their wounds. It would be absurd not to obtain support from the only power of democracy in the world, i.e., from USA. Here, however, the questions posed by the unfortunate James Forrestal come to mind again: Are the American masses sufficiently prepared for the discipline required for the long effort of a purposefid foreign policy? By their very nature the American democratic masses, i.e., the American people . are against kings and emperors and all those who resemble autocrats. These masses turn very easily suspicious that the rights of the individual could be violated. They have a vague p r o gr am: “Everybody should be happy!” They do not have a profound knowledge of the world; on two sides, the Atlantic and the Pacific separate them by thousands of miles from the main centers of activity in the world. The American democratic government must render accounts to these masses, that is, to the American people, even if the masses change their opinion dras- t:cally. Whatever is the reply to the questions posed by Forrestal, one thing remans indisputable: a country with a people of s.uph character, with a po- lit cal system so sensitive to the moods of the people, is the least probable place to develop imperialism. PAGE 2 AMERICKÉ LISTY SPECIAL ISSUE — OCTOBER 27, 1972 [pageend2]Unlike many other people who know exactly what the United States should do in Vietnam to end—or not to end—the war there, we do not claim any such knowledge. This is the most unfortunate war in the history of America. The whole discord existing in the world and inside America hovers over it. This is one war which America may fight, but not win. Never before was there a war so fused with politics. Until now wars used to be won by that side which defeated the enemy and occupied his territory leaving him no ground where to regroup and resume his struggle. Or wars used to be won when the ' enemy recognized that he was defeated and that any further fighting on his part would be futile. These rules, however, do not apply to the war in Vietnam. Nobody doubts that the United States would be quite able to invade the territory of North Vietnam and thus, to end the war. However, due to serious considerations, the United States must act as if the borders of North Vietnam were sacrosanct. The beaten North Vietnamese can always retreat across their own border without fear that they may be pursued there. They may decide when and where to strike next and they do not even have to fight if they do not wish to. Behind their border they can heal their wounds, and Russia and China always deliver to them new war supplies. The United States cannot destroy the enemy troops and must limit all military actions to the repulsion of their attacks in the time and space chosen by the enemy. The North Vietnamese themselves did not make their borders untouchable. This was done by the authority of Russia and China. Nobody can predict what these two great powers would do, should the American army cross the border of North Vietnam. There haunts a specter of the third world war. which in this instance would mean an atomic war. It remains a mystery why several years ago even some outstanding Americans. whose vocation is to study foreign policy, came to the conclusion that the world was pacified and that the cold war was a “thing of the past decades.”-They reached this conclusion while Khrushchev still issued ultimata on Berlin and threatened certain European countries with atomic conflagration and while Soviet Russia secretly supplied Cuba with atomic weapons. It seems that those outstanding A m er i c a n s should explain in detail the train of their thoughts. They probably misunderstood certain developments and interpreted them incorrectly. Indeed, certain changes have become known. After the Cuban crises, the United States and Soviet Russia made a more or less tacit agreement that the world and themselves must be saved from atomic catastrophe. At that time the hot line between Washington and Kremlin was established in order to make possible immediate explanation of any dangerous episode and to smother by mutual effort any spark near the powderkeg. This was called “peaceful co-existence.” However, that was all. Real peace is a matter of conviction. Basically, it means that fundamental problems are being solved. This “peaceful co-exis- tence”, however, failed to solve one single problem, and the Soviets see to it that no problem could be solved. Throughout the “peaceful co - existence” they keep on harping pronouncements that there may be peace, but no reconciliation. and moreover, that they will continue their struggle, bequeathed to them by Lenin, bj' other- means than war. They consider as a traitor anybody who interprets peaceful co-existence differently. There is much evidence to support this theory. Two years ago. after- their invasion of Czechoslovakia, Soviets declared in a rather pompous manner that the struggle between themselves and the others would take thirty years and end with the victory of Communism. This could be hardly anything but cold war. Those Westerners who unilaterally declared the end of the cold war, try to ignore this fact in the same way as Chamberlain used to ignore Hitler’s “Mein Kampf”. Anyone who is not ideologically blind, can see quite clearly that the cold war is at its peak in Vietnam and in the Middle East. The Soviet strategy has also its American chapter. The Soviets continue their experiment of unfreedom and the Americans continue their experiment of freedom. The Soviets may perhaps think that as a result of these two contradicting experiments, one of which maintains discipline. but the other does not, the Soviets would gain political superiority over the United States The Soviets are watching the American government as it tries to reason with a sect of pacifists and to justify each of its actions to them. It is of no interest to the Soviets that this is an admirable deed and that the American democracy thus endeavors to fulfill its promise of freedom. They are more inter- ested in the moment when this perennial dialogue with a sect of pacifists may render the U. S. government incapable of any energetic action on the international political scene. Ten years ago Nikita Khrushchev said to President Kennedy: “You are much too liberal, you will not fight!” Now the Soviets are trying to determine whether his statement has already come true. To put it briefly: they are interested to see whether chaos is already taking hold of the United States. The Soviets know full well that it would mean that their time has come. Famous democrats were aware of certain dangers inherent in democracy. One of such dangers is the recklessness of numerous political candidates seeking the . support of the masses. Nobody can doubt the existence of a strong anti-war sentiment in USA. It has several reasons. America spends in Vietnam money w h i c h would help solve various domestic problems. America fights in Vietnam not for profit, but for an idea which seems too abstract to many people. Assurances of certain generals that the war will soon end with American victory, proved to be false. Vietnam is much too distant and its fate does not evoke fierce passions. And’ the students, the nucleus of pacifistic demonstrations, naturally prefer to stay home than io go to war. The opposition and the government alike would gladly end this war. Some individuals propose a plan: all American troops should be immediately put on ships and taken out of Vietnam. That would settle everything. Two kinds of. thoughts lurk behind this plan. On the one hand, people think that: if this happens, it would not cause any serious consequences, the balance of power in the world woud not be changed, aggressors elsewhere in the world would not be encouraged. China, so they say, has peaceful traditions, and nobody will regard the United States as an unreliable ally. The other trend of thinking is more primitive, often the most primitive of all, and follows this line of thought: even if this would cause some serious consequences, so what ? Several years ago a conference of all four participants in the war in Vietnam has been convoked in Paris in order to end the war by negotiations. This conference stirred the greatest interest by its opening debates with arguments as whether the shape of the conference table should be oval or square. Impressions of the conference from more recent days are not so vivid. Rather, we are often not even quite sure whether that conference is still dragging' on or whether it has expired. The only certain thing is thät those who ceased to believe in the continuation of the cold war. would not understand that from its beginning the Paris Conference Was doomed to failure by half of its participants. Those who believe that the cold war goes still on, can understand this fact, full well. Regardless oi tne differences between Soviet Russia, China and North Vietnam,»they are all the same in one respect: the very last thing on their minds is to relieve the United States from the difficulties caused by the Vietnamese conflict. If the Communist front would be interested only in gaining South Vietnam, it would use several weapons from its tactical arsenal. It could, as the Communists have done more than once before, accept a compromise settlement. The compromise would be accepted and the Paris Conference would be declared a great success. The Americans would announce that their obligations were fulfilled, that nobody was defeated; the American troops would leave and everybody would know that they would not return. The isolated South Vietnam would be in the hands of the Communist Something not quite extraordinary took place in Sudan. Communist members of the ruling coalition revolted and took over the capital and the radio station for one day. Regardless of the geographic location, Communist minds have a fixed idea that they are predestined to be absolute rulers. With the help of other Arab states which accept Soviet economic and military aid, but which have their definite phobias of Communist dynamics, the revolt in Sudan was socn suppressed. The Sudanese government accused Soviet military units in that, country of aiding and abetting the rebels. The Soviet government rejected this accusation with the usual Soviet vehemence, but did not go into any particulars about the activity of Soviet troops in Sudan. It re- pfied to the Sudanse government in a brief and altogether general statement : “The Soviet L nion never intervenes in internal affairs of another nation.” This didn't fail to impress us very profoundly indeed. In 1939 the Nazis and the Soviets made a pa;... attacked Poland and divided it between themselves. Thus, the Nazis obviously intervened in Polish interfront free for taking. But this is not what the Communist front wants. It wishes to humiliate the United States as much as possible. The war in Vietnam has surpassed the dimensions of Vietnam long time ago. The Communists do not reject a temporary compromise because it would prevent them from seizing • power in Vietnam, but rather, because more than in Vietnam, they are interested in a clearcut defeat, of the United States The word about it would then spread all over Asia, Africa and Latin America and elsewhere where nations are considering the more powerful ally when making decisions about their political association. The main aim of the Communists is the balance of power which lasted already for a long time. On the democratic side, only the United States could maintain such a balance as the only real democratic superpower. If the United States shoud be weakened by the internal struggle of various fractions or if the . American influence should be cut down, the hitherto balance of power would be disturbed. That would most probably mean a new period in history. If this is true, how very, very far is this front the theory that the cold war is nothing but a “thing of the past decades.” nal affairs, but the Soviets did not. Why? Because they would never do any such thing. After the war, the Soviets annexed three Baltic states. Soon sealed railroad wagons began transporting the Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian intelligentsia to Siberia. Somehow the Soviets managed to do this without any intervention in the internal affairs of said countries. After the war, A. Vishin- sky said to the king of Rumania to get lost within 24 hours. In 1951 Soviet tanks fired at dissatisfied citizens of East Germany, all the time not. intervening there. In 1956 the Soviets invaded Hungary and killed thousands of Hungarian citizens in bloody battles, then executed scores of them, among them also the premier of Hungary, Imre Nagy, and all this without any intervention in internal affairs of Hungary. In 1968 the Soviets accomplished another invasion without an intervention in the internal affairs of Czechoslovakia. And to guarantee that the Soviets would never intervene anywhere, they declared the Brezhnev Doctrine, according to which they consider it their right to in- (Continued on page 4) The struggle with other means SPECIAL ISSUE — OCTOBER 27. 1972 AMERICKÉ LISTY PAGE 3 They never intervene - or do they? [pageend3]PAGE 4 AMERICKE LISTY SPECIAL ISSUE — OCTOBER 27, 1972 A VERDICT ON AMERICA . . . They never intervene - or do they? (Continued from page 3) vade any country where socialism seems to them endangered. The history of Soviet invasions is an open book, nevertheless the Soviets maintain that it is unthinkable for them to intervene in anybody’s affairs. We must consider the meaning of their words. They are not attempting thereby to deceive anybody, because nobody could be fooled so much as to believe that. The times are gone forever when Communist propaganda celebrated its triumphs, when considerable numbers of people believed that Communists have come to bring freedom and independence, to develop industry and prosperity above and beyond the dreams of the past, to create truly happy life on this ' earth. In 1956 in his speech about Stalin Nikita Khrushchev unmasked all the intrinsic evil of Communism. In early sixties, the same Khrushchev admitted also that the living standard in the West was much higher and would remain much higher, and that, there were “things of which the classics of Communism never had an inkling” ; furthermore, he said, Communist production did not pass the critical stage and Russian people were still living in poverty. The secrets of concentration camps in Siberia were unveiled. Thus, for the past fifteen years the Soviet propaganda was more on the defensive than on the offensive. People of democratic persuasion could think that they have won one decisive battle, however, the influence of the Soviets in the international political life is increasing steadily and quite fast in the recent years. If the Soviets unabashedly tell anybody such brazen intrinsics about their principle of non-intervention, that is no propaganda stunt; the purpose of propaganda is to make believe something. This, however, is a horse of a different color. While Soviet ideology was on the verge of bankruptcy. because p e o p le were learning the truth about the internal conditions in USSR, the Soviet military power was growing stronger. It is generally known that the armed forces are now being soberly administered by a c o 11 e c ti ve bureaucratic leadership displaying a great consideration to- ward the army, navy, atomic arsenal; this is not just purely bureaucratic consideration. For a weak man even his own truth may be fatal; however, no matter how big a lie may be, nobody wants to start a fight with a superpower which is armed to its teeth and which, having just recovered from the exhaustion of its last invasion, decided to declare publicly that it never intervenes in anybody’s affairs. Such statement is met by all Western statesmen with their diplomatic politeness. Truth is a real problem in the relations with a great power. If a strong superpower says about itself something totally unbelievable, some people feel quite resigned to take it as a fact of life, others pretend to be just bored by such repetitious lie, although they should do more than display their boredom; others, however,, even refuse to talk about such unpleasant matters, because they don’t want to get involved in the cold war. Nevertheless, some people see the simple truth as followers: in the international society, so to say, the Soviets have put their feet on the table: “This is how we are, this is what we say, if we feel like it, and this is how you must accept us and meet us within the limits we set.” If they declare that they never intervene, then they are really demanding that their actions be not observed, or — if it is unavoidable—that they must be above any judgment. For a good reason this situation must be regarded as a very unfortunate condition of the world. During his visit in Canada the Soviet prime minister Kosygin was asked by a reporter about the Soviet invasion of Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Pokerface Kosygin replied: “As far as Hungary and Czechoslovakia are concerned, I am sure that you know just as well as I that our Hungarian and Czechoslovak friends asked us to take the actions in both those countries, which we have taken.” The Canadian journalist evidently asked that crucial question because until that very moment he didn’t realize that he had allegedly known the reasons all along. Kosygin’s reply was quite brief, just three sentences, but their logic was something to behold. In the last sentence Kosygin stressed: “All these actions were taken in a complete agreement with the legitimate representatives of those countries and upon their own request.” Just notice how the “friends” in Kosygin’s first sentence evolve into “legitimate representatives” in the third sentence. So let us see who were those legitimate representatives of both those countries. In Hungary in 1956, Imre Nagy served as prime minister and that seems to be quite a legitimate office, yet the Soviets executed him after the invasion. The legitimate representative in Czechoslovakia was Alexander Dubček and it is well known where they kicked him. Also, the Czechoslovak government at that time could be regarded as a rather legitimate institution. That same government protested publicly against the invasion before the assembly of the United Nations, which, too, seems to be quite a legitimate forum. Kosygin failed to mention what other legitimate representatives were there outside the government and the prime minister. It was not necessary to spell it out, because he spoke to the people of whom he knew that they were fully aware that he was telling them lies, but of whom he also knew that they would not challenge him. The press in the West mentioned only the extreme sensitivity of the Soviet concerning these matters. It certainly requires an “extreme sensitivity” to cover such an extreme insolence. The international spiritual situation must be quite bad if the truth is scaled according to power and force. Soviet military power has grown, as the Soviets believe that the world is too soft and that they are strong enough to tell lies in the face of other- people. If their power will increase even further, the Soviets will lie with impunity about other things and act accordingly. However, politics must be conducted with regard to the circumstances and one of the circumstances, one of the facts of life is that the Soviets demand an acceptance for their lies without any protest whatsoever. In this respect they are fairly successful, because in the present era of international policy the main aspiration is to “maintain good relations”. The future will show how this can—or cannot—confuse and contaminate the international situation. (Continued from page 1) and to stop building schools; to renounce industry and to make one’s own shoes. Bertrand Russell was called, probably justly so, the greatest English philosopher of his" time. He was obviously well aware of his importance. His wife refused to receive in their home an old family friend who could not say with utmost certainty that Rus- -sell was a greater philosopher than Plato. The development of the atomic bomb was a critical moment in history. Three world powers, USA, USSR and China produced their nuclear weapons, Bertrand Russell became convinced that the world could be saved only if the Americans would disregard what the other nations are doing and give up her own atomic arms. Therefore, America must be forced to do just that. It has to be stressed here that Russell was thinking about the consequences. Freedom would be lost for a millenium, and only then it may be reborn. Lesser people than Russell know that this would nor avert any atomic disaster, since Russian and Chinese bombs would remain. As it looks now, an atomic catastrophe may very well erupt right on the Sino- Soviet border. Russel knew that it would be unrealistic to direct his crusade against nuclear bomb of all three countries for the simple reason that the governments of Russia and China would never listen to him. Therefore, being a realist, he attacked America, which permits shouting in the streets, demonstrations, abuse of the Administration. What Chekhov said of Diogenes that he would spit into people’s faces, because he knew well that he would not be punished for his insolence, the same goes for Russell’s furious invective against America. He said that American soldiers in Vietnam were cutting open the bellies of pregnant women and exhibiting their unborn babies. Nobody knows where such an exhibition was ever held. The greatest English philosopher of his time was living in his own world. Passions stirred the weakening organism of that nonagerian. He called an international tribunal to try America for the war crimes in Vietnam. Russell—like Jupiter —himself selected all 18 members of that court. Seventeen men and one ■woman met in Stockholm and called themselves—in the manner of Jupiter— a tribunal of law and justice and the conscience of. the world, although they completely disregarded the accepted court rules of the world. In the course of human history mankind developed certain concepts of justice and of due process. In Stockholm, however, one party was accused by a tribunal of 18 intellectuals and that party was silenced by them. The judgment was prepared in advance. The presiding French writer and philosopher Jean - Paul Sartre, succeeded completely in divesting himself of all doubts that usually haunt philosophers; with no embarrassment whatsoever, he acted like a general, like a propagandist of one political ideology. Eighteen persons, hand-picked by Bertrand Russell, declared that they were observing the legal precedent of the Nurnberg international tribunal for war crimes after World War II. This was not true. Nazi defendants before the Nurnberg court were permitted to express their opinions and their objections and their attorneys and witnesses were heard. Hermann Goering had an opportunity to voice his philosophy of power. However, it was a completely different story before the tribunal where Sartre presided. His tribunal refused to hear any witnesses, except those sent from North Vietnam. Nobody was permitted to speak in behalf of the United States. The key witness was the vice-chairman of the North Vietnamese investigation committee, i.e., the vice- chairman of North Vietnamese propaganda. In an assembly so one-sided and so one-minded, nevertheless. somebody dared ask: “How do you know?” Here an American biochemist, university professor, one of the eighteen, replied: “We rely completely cn the assurances given to us by the North Vietnamese.” Eighteen intellectuals heard what a few North Vietnamese wanted to state, and then rushed to pronounce the judgment which stated, naturally: “America is guilty of war crimes.” Despite all that, the meeting in Stockholm had its merits after all. For a long time some people could harbor some thoughts that Russell's- accusations contained some basis, some mysterious truth which would be unveiled before the tribunal, but all that appeared was a shop worn political trick: silencing the other party. Some people perhaps expected a thrilling combat of truth and untruth, but all that could be heard in the Stockholm hall sounded like an old, scratchy phonograph record. It was boring. The reticence of Communist reports on the Russell tribunal was astonishing. It gave one an impression that the Communists were ignoring the whole thing. The meeting was obviously called together for the benefit of the Communists; the Communists were evidently pussy-footing around for a while, awaiting some results. As old professionals, they seemed to recognize a flop early enough. Undoubtedly they shared the other people’s feelings that the Stockholm tribunal was handled by bunglers who were even unable to conceal their intentions and thus, they became completely transparent. Yet there were certain places that welcomed the meeting in Stockholm. An American reporter mentions that a former Nazi, accused of war crimes, approached him on a train in Germany. The Nazi looked quite exuberant and said: “Now who is accusing whom? Are you? The whole world is passing a judgment on you for your atrocities in Vietnam. Don’t you think that those are war crimes, too? Well, they sure are!” Thus, the Nazis have finally found an excuse for themselves. They had com- [pageend4](Continued from page 1) North Korea attacked South Korea. It seemed improbable that a small new country would have the audacity to violate on its own initiative the peace established with such difficulty. So a search went on for some strong manipulator operating behind the scenes. There was a suspicion that China was trying to seize the world piece by piece. The United Nations, following its still fresh and bright principle, sent to Korea an army to protect the attacked against the attacker. This international army consisted mainly of American divisions and of several smaller military units dispatched by fifteen other nations. When a little later China sent one million of her soldiers to Korea to fight against the U. S. Army, suspicions about China’s real intentions were considerably strengthened. Ten years later the United States went once again to fight in Asia, in Vietnam. This time the U. S. Army was not sent by the United Nations, because meanwhile the activity of United Nations was curtailed by the Soviet veto. However, the United States had every reason to believe that she was acting in the tradition on which the Organization of the United Nations was founded, although, due to the opposition of one influential member, that tradition was no longer observed. Just to show some action, United Nations requested that North Vietnam explain its invasion in South Vietnam, which North Vietnam simply refused. If the United States needed some explanation of her participation in the war in Vietnam, China unabashedly provided all the rea- mitted war crimes, now Americans are commiting war crimes, so it is normal io commit war crimes. Russell said that President Kennedy was a worse murderer than Hitler. The American Negro leader, Dr. Martin Luther King, caught on to this idea and adjusted it to the needs of the moment. He said that President Johnson was acting in Vietnam worse than Hitler in Europe. Such statements travel fast through the world and don’t fail to reach the Nazis. They are music to the Nazis’ ears, because they indicate that the Nazis were blamed unjustly for having done nothing more than the American presidents are doing. The Nazis can say this openly. Wir danken Ihnen, Herr Russell! sons. In an authoritative declaration of fifty thousand words, China unveiled her views on the war in Vietnam. “This war is not a result of an ordinary struggle in that country, but it constitutes a part of a global strategy for the world revolution; its mam target is the United States; its final purpose is to surround USA and Western Europe; Vietnam serves just as a training ground for the revolutionaries. This is our military doctrine,” stated the Chinese declaration. At this time it is almost certain that USA will leave Vietnam. Of all reasons thereof the most decisive here is the fact that USA is a democratic country and that a democratic system cannot ignore the will of the people, even though the leaders of that system may have valid doubts about the outcome of that whole thing. The American people on the whole are profoundly tired of this long and, as it appears, useless war. The prevalent view now is that the billions spent to finance the war in Vietnam should be used to benefit American population. Moreover, the whole world seems very ungrateful. In this century, America has come already twice to Europe to save democracy, but the sens and grandsons of the men who once begged for American intervention, regard now America with suspicions and accuse her of imperialist intentions. These people totally ignore the argument that fundamentally the same ideology led the United States’ interventions first in Europe, then in Vietnam. Writers and philosophers whose freedoms of thought and expression are protected by America, frequently spout furious attacks against America. Amcng them are even some individuals who wouldn’t be alive if America had not granted them an asylum. Now in the agitated political atmosphere they, too, often join the critics who are convinced that America must stand trial for her “crimes.” The behavior of a state may be touching. America sometimes touchingly attempts to prove to the world that she is really democratic. However, this effort fails to deter her critics. Wild accusations are hurled against her. On the other hand, the Soviet Union is criticized only seldom, and if so, then very cautiously, because, as one of the participants in a conference of neutral states explained privately; “Russia has a certain reputation. therefore, one must be careful when one talks about Russia.” After Canadian separatists strangled their hostage, a member of the Government they had kidnapped, the Canadian prime minister declared a state of emergency and said: “A new, frightening type of man has emerged.” Certain elements promise to step up terrorism even further. They are representing a “reality of passion”. Liberalism is more characteristic fo.r America than for any other country and under -normal circumstances, it serves everybody’s interests. Intellectuals reach their liberalism after a long process of contemplation, the American masses reach it spontaneously. Liberal- ism is represented not i-n just one, but in both great American political parties. Even conservatism in America proceeds from a certain liberal platform. Liberalism has its specific problems. It is a good fighter, but too often a bad guardian of its gains. It sweeps under the rug too many problems; sometimes it does -not know how to behave, when it has to face a powerful enemy of freedom from outside or inside. The liberals have often an even more fundamental problem: how to recognize the emergence of an enemy? When a movement called the New Left appeared, some liberals were afraid to treat it unkindly, others joined it for various reasons. This was a clear case of unrequited love. The New Left soon declared that liberalism in its present form belongs on the garbage heap of history, that the aims for which the liberals were fighting and losing their sleep, are ridiculous and petty, and that all great things are yet to come. The newcomers were very active and eloquent about their displeasures. American president Johnson has introduced so many social reforms as no other president before him. It did not help him in the eyes of the New Left. He was slandered by them as no other president in U. S. history. When another liberal, one with perhaps the most consistent liberal record ever, was running in 1968 for presidential office, he was attacked as if his election would bring the doomsday. The streets resounded with shouts of insults, buildings were seized, bombs were set up. politically motivated fires were burning, schools were changed into arenas of civic struggle, universities ceased to function. A leader of the New Left said: “If fascism is needed to destroy fascism, then we all shall become fascists!” Some liberals still failed to recognize with whom they were dealing, and most of all. they took special care to protect the terrorists from all harm. For a long time, ideologies were regarded as a typically European disease, against which the Anglo-Saxons and pragmatic Americans were immune. These matters, however, have changed. Liberalism, originally based on kind feeling toward one’s fellow man and on civic self-confidence, was transformed into an inflexible ideology by some American liberals.' The past experience with Nazis and Communists proved what ideology can do to people. Dogmatic American liberals have their apostates. One of them said with disgust that, a dogmatic lib; eral is capable of considering it as constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech, if someone in a full theatre starts yelling: “Fire!” There were people who told the crowd that it wouldn’t be such a bad idea to kill the President’s wife. Dogmatic liberals demanded that they be treated with kid gloves, otherwise their freedom of thought could be violated. The fate of liberalism, just as the fate of any other movement, depends on the . ability and willingness of its representatives to face reality. Liberalism stands and falls with the assumption that man is good and does not abuse, his free- dom, or at least, that p&5- ple with a sense of righteousness are always in considerable majority. After World War I, when ruins were still smoking, a German author took his pen and paper and began to write a novel entitled: “Man is good.’’ During World War II. special factories were built to gas millions, whole cities were destroyed and their civil- an populaton decimated. Of course, all this was started by the Nazis, but then .after all, Nazis were a part of mankind. The assumption that man is good was tragically undermined. If we look upon the contemporary scene, frequently it seems that there is more violence in the world now than in Hitler’s times, at least in the sense that under Hitler, violence was the work of specially trained and indoctrinated mercenaries of one government, while at this time violence is being committed by civilians and a fair number of students, both male and female, are preaching violence. History takes surprising turns. Marx and Lenin taught that state will wither away, but it so happens that their apostles in our times maintain a state so rigorous, so devoid of any discussion and with so manv rights over the individual, the likes of which have not been seen for centuries. It looks more like withering of state when under a liberal govern- ment radical groups are fighting for power on street corners, almost ,n every school, in many public buildings and in the dark of the night. Such situations may be called either direct democracy, or the right of the fist. The New Left calls it “politics of participation”. Direct democracy existed in ancient Greece and Rome, where a mob of people in the marketplace made decisions. European people had serious reasons for a replacement of such a state of things with a representative system. Democracy is not a natural order of affairs; it is a balanced h u m a n achievement. A democratic state can bear and absorb a certain amount of chaos and excentricities, but that amount is limited. If chaos is excessive and if the terrorists try to force decisions, democracy may take upon itself some dictatorial characteristics, as Roman democracy has done in times of national emergency. This is a veritable nightmare for a democrat, because then the Communist dictators may well tell him: “Now what do you expect from us? Leave us alone with your criticism! Haven’t we told you time and time again that people are unable to govern themselves?” We have already mentioned the American experiment of complete freedom, regarded sometimes as noble and sometimes as courageous. Let us review some preliminary results of this experiment, particularly in the foreign policy—as we see it. In 1956 Khrushchev divulged in his speech about Stalin many Communist secrets and ever since, Soviet Communist ideology began to lose its influence steadily, year after year; today it is like a burned^ out house where few would want to live. Since 1956 all revolts in Europe, be they violent or ncn-vi- olent, were revolts by Communists against Communists — by the Hungarian, Polish, Czechoslovak Communists against the Soviet Communists. Rumanian Communists are continuing their revolt in their own cautious way. In Yugoslavia such revolt took place sooner, in 19-18. In East Germany an uprising occurred in 1953. Hardly any Western intellectual, mindful of himself and of the current vogue, is still seeking the glamour of being a Communist. You will hear him saying today that Communism is boring. Democracy had enough time to prove that its ways lead with greater certainty toward the prosperity of the widest masses. If a group of Communists emerges these days, they regard themselves as followers of Maoism, which to Soviet (Continued on page 6) IN A WHIRLPOOL How the war in Vietnam started? PAGE 5 AMERICKE LISTY SPECIAL ISSUE — OCTOBER 27, 1972 [pageend5]IN A WHIRLPOOL . . (Cont. from page 5) Communists is just a repulsive as capitalism. Influence of Soviet ideology being in such a decline, it may seem that since 1945 democracy had never greater opportunities and the Soviet less opportunity. However, the scéne we see is completely different. The international power of the Soviet state has grown steadily and America is embarrassed. Her experiment of unrestricted freedom created in some ways a difficult and anarchistic situation and at times. America is paralyzed by her internal affairs. Here we must say a word about American liberalism. It was beneficial for the world, because it has freed many nations that sought to be free. It was perhaps the greatest force on the side of liberty after the 18th century French En- lightment. Many nations are free just because of American help. Civic self- determination in the world was strengthened by the American example. It was liberalism that laid the groundwork for the American standard of life. Conservatism was too timid to seek new paths in economy and had too many prejudices to understand that the production will be greatly expanded if workers’ wages are increased. and that big consumption and big industry are two sides of the same coin. All this may be said about American liberalism is general. Specifically, however. we must say that liberalism or any other political movement in itself cannot ennoble anybody. In every political movement, among the conservatives and among the liberals, there are, on the one hand, many wise a-nd conscientious, clear - thinking individuals, heroes and men with love for all hut manity, and on the .other hand, some hopeless romantics, parasites, egotists. adventurers, exploiters, fools and aggressors. At various times the former or the latter group comes to the fore. Under the protection of liberalism, there emerged the New Left, led by students who are calling for a general struggle against the entire older generation and against all its beliefs. With their usual patience and kindness, the Americans tried to dismiss this movement with the word “kids”. After a while, however, they had to give up the word “kids.” The New Left has united dangerous forces which are lurking in the 20th century. This occurs all over the world — in Germany, France, Japan. It is not a peculiar American problem. although America got into it — as into many other things—sooner than the other countries and with a greater intensity. PAGE 6 • AMERICKÉ LISTY SPECIAL ISSUE — OCTOBER 27. 1972 There is no doubt that the philosophy of “dissent” is an American-grown product. History of this era cannot overlook the question why the New Left, which regards itself as the most progressive m o v e m e nt, even more progressive than Communism, did not evolve when a conservative government was in power in USA and why didn’t it turn in anger against the conservative administration. The only possible reply is that the New Left finds it less risky to organize under the benevolent liberal administration which not only tolerates dissent, but even calls for it at times. President Johnson declared that “dissent is the vital breath of democracy” and lived to regret his words. Organized extremist groups took notice, followed him and for the first time in U. S. history made it impossible for him. the President, to speak in public. After 1945, when East Asia was freed from the Japanese, American liberals went there to teach the newly liberated people that dissent is the basis of democracy and therefore, that they must voice dissent against their governments. The more primitive natures understand this in the sense that the more a man engages in activities of dissent, the more democratic he proves to be. Dissent, however, is not a basis of democracy — dissent is a right of democratic people, which they either can use or can avoid, depending on the situation. Democracy, as any other institution, is based on an agreement concerning some fundamental things. America may emphasize the fact that several times in her history she has absorbed very rebellious elements. Yes, indeed, but for the first time in her history she has a powerful enemy at a close distance, due to modern technology. He is waiting for every error she will make, for every omission and weakness, or just for a semblance of her weakness. HELP THE MONOPOLY, PLEASE Thousands and thousands of articles were written on one subject in Communist papers, with a very urgent tone: one intrigue which allegedly prevents nations from peaceful co-existence has to be finally liquidated. The intrigue is against monopoly. As long as Communists were in opposition, they did not complain about anything as much as they complained about monopolies. It is one of the great- ' est.ironies of history that wherever Communists are now in power, they introduce not onb’ a monopoly, but a Supermonopoly. This did not happen by mere chance. Already an exile, Lenin said that the Communist monopoly would offer “a power unheard of in history” to those in charge. An unheard-of power over the people. As Lenin has stressed, monopoly denies its opponents all their sustenance. Compared with the new version, the old capitalist monopolies and cartels seem like clumsy experiments. A capitalist or a group of capitalists owned one enterprise or one concern, but the Communist monopoly owns all enterprises and all concerns, every single spade, hoe and shovel, all grain, all schools, all repair shops, all grocery stores, all bread. The old woman who sells carrots or violets on the street corner is an employee of that monopoly, too. The monopoly hires workers under its own terms a n d determines their wages and the prices. According to its own determination. monopoly permits—or does not permit —children to study and men to attain certain jobs. The Communists expanded the economic monopoly by an equallj’ all-encompassing political monopoly. If a citizen is tried before a court of justice, then the judge who declares the sentence, the prosecutor who demands the punishment and the attorney who goes through the motions of defense — they all are employed by the monopoly. The monopoly selects reading material for the citizens. All press and communications belong to the monopoly, as do all printing shops, paper mills and publishing houses. If an author has a disagreement with the ruling party, he may as well start writing on a piece of birch bark. Only that opinion which is in complete agreement with the government may be publicly expressed. Monopoly demands that poets give up their aimless introspection and instead of it glorify incessantly the monopolists. What an enormous power! And yet, when the monopolists ■ wake up in the morning, there is a black spot in their minds. Everything is not under the unrestricted control of the monopoly . . . About 15 years ago the United States and the Soviet Union, both fearing quite sensibly the possibility of an atomic war, agreed on a principle of a peaceful coexistence, which meant that USA and USSR would continue to dislike each other, however, they would not use the means of total annihilation of the world. As soon as this agreement was concluded, the Soviets became embarrassed, because it could bring an era of peace to the world, which is quite unacceptable from the viewpoint of Marx-Leninism. Their philosophy requires that the division of the world and the world struggle must continue, and so the Soviets accompanied the peaceful coexistence with numerous meaningful statements. The Soviet Communist Party convoked an ideological conference which declared as follows : “Peaceful coexistence never meant and never will mean a peaceful coexistence in the realm of various ideologies. A merciless class struggle was waged and always will be waged in the ideological sphere.” An official publication of the Soviet Communist Party says: “The basis for a peaceful coexistence is the highest form of class struggle.” Soviet newspapers occasionally mention that the ideological struggle would be stepped up over and above the stage at which that strug- AIR-INDIA Curtaintime Tours of London one Week - $290 gle existed before the peaceful coexistence. They quoted an anonymous authority: “A peaceful coexistence of ideas is the same nonsense as baked snow.” Individual ideologies always competed one with another, and if the Soviets intend to wage their ideological struggle, nobody has the right to reproach them for it. A world in which different ideas compete with each other, is a normal world. However, as the situation looks now, there is a question about the meaning of the ideological struggle. It used to be considered as ideological struggle when two parties tried to convince people by presenting to them their principles and arguments. Thus, the people got acquainted with them, obtained some experience with one or another party, and then they could make their decision. This is a competition for the minds of the people; on several occasions the Communists called it “a struggle for the soul of the nation”. However, they introduced violence in this competition and struggle for the soul of the nation by sending out an ideologist and a secret agent at the same time. When the people heard all the argumentsand had all the experience and made a certain decision, then Soviets use an invasion to suppress their decision. That is no longer an ideological struggle, that is a mixture of ideological struggle and brute force. The Communists demand an ideological struggle on their own terms. Their terms are: ideological struggle must be waged in the West with full force and the meeting of their ideology with opposing ideas must be militant. Such a turmoil, however, must never affect their territory with some 350 million, people. i,e.. Russia, Pola n d, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria. The ideological struggle in that area has been finished forever, nothing more is needed there, because the government decrees what may be believed, a n d whoever wants to discuss or re-examine any arguments, he is an enemy of the state. In their area “a peaceful coexistence of ideas is the same kind of nonsense as baked snow”. A l their policies are tailored in such a fashion that the people do not even hear about the existence of different ideas and arguments. At the same time, however, Communist ideas must be always freely expressed in the West. The West is obligated to guarantee this right, because it is guilty of being democratic If this stale of affairs looks like a privilege in favor of the Communists, they do demand such a privilege. After all. they say, what power would want to deprive us of this privilege? Now. when we have reached this state of affairs, let us begin our ideological struggle. That ideological struggle must be waged under the most unequal terms in the two parts of the world. Marx’, Lenin’s and Stalin’s collected works are published in the West, and if Leonid Brezhnev would ever write a book. it. too, would be published here. Universities and colleges offer courses of Marxism- [pageend6]ger zones the Soviet Union already possesses the advantage. both of geogra. phical proximity and of military and political ini- LaKve. In Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, Moscow can turn on the heat at will. Whether or not it does so, the mere fact that it can makes all the difference in the world. Thus, irrespective of the statistics on defense spending, missiles, and nuclear submarines, a basic political imbalance has developed between the United States and the Soviet Union. The problem facing Western Europe is one of survival, of maintaining its security and independence in the face of the gradual American retreat from globalism. The American retreat from globalism unquestionably creates a new situation. The balance of power is indeed changing. While A- merica is in retreat, the Soviet Union still has a globalist policy. As the U.S. opts for disengagement, the Soviet Union increases its commitments. To this extent, regardless of America’s economic performance and strategic might, the Soviet Union is now' in a superior position. The A- merican retreat is causing new power vacuums in the world. How they will be filled, and who will fill them, is the great question of the decades to come. Who is this lady? nation unwilling to exercise power, a -nation beset by a mood of pervasive defeatism, and r.dden with internal dissent. On the other hand, the Soviet Union presents itself as purposeful and dynamic, out to win the global struggle rather than to preserve the status quo. No guilty feelings are expressed in the Soviet Union on the subject of power; on the contrary, there is a great and growing sel^-confidence — which feeds on the American retreat from globalism. This description of the situation may seem grossly to overstate American weaknes s and Soviet strength. But the image counts as much as the reality—in Europe, in the Third World, and, of course, in the Soviet Union— and although as of today the belief that the American ship is sinking has not yet become widespread in Europe and Japan, and the Russians still have a healthy respect for American power, America’s image is changing, and for the worse This is not to say that the Soviet Union will risk a head-on confrontation with the U.S. in order to hasten the process. There is in fact no need for it to do so, even for strategic gain. Other things being equal, future conflicts a- round the world will be fought by conventional forces and their outcome will be decided by the local balance of power.

Yet when the monopolists wake up in the morning, they still feel a. black spot on their minds. Something is still missing. Abroad, there exists an unreachable and audacious part of six nations — the exiles. They are writing &nd broadcasting, and their words, judging from the reaction of the Communist governments, are hitting home. There are Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty. This is the last imperfection of the monopoly, its last gap. A peculiar situation occurs here: those states that do not have monopoly of public opinion, are requested to preserve and protect the monopoly of those states which created such monopoly. The heirs of tsarism demand this right from the heirs of Abraham Lincoln. either under the guise of artificial politeness or with coarseness which is more natural to them, and by threats of a split in the international relations and in diplomatic negotiations, they request that Western governments assist the Communist monopoly in silencing the exiles. Lenin taught the Communists how to debate with their opponents. He said: “Never deal in detail with the subject under discussion. Th s could create an impression that perhaps to some extent the opponent may be right and that he deserves some consideration. Just ‘kick him in the teeth’.’’ This instruction is now extended: If you yourself are not able to kick him in the teeth, persuade others to do it for you. troduced this precept: “The dialectic movement is characterized by the simultaneous existence of two antithetic aspects, the result of which is a new category. An exclusive attempt to eliminate one aspect shatters the dialectic movement into two parts”. Nevertheless, while always invoking Marx’ theory of dialectics, the Communist dictatorship is preoccupied most of all by strangling the other side and liquidating it arbitrarily, äs only a state mobilized for one single purpose is capable of doing. No matter what Marx tried to promulgate, the Commun'st governments wish to hear just their own voice and its echo. Within all their six countries, all academies of sciences, sports clubs, golf clubs, associations of hunters, fishermen, philatel- Leninism; any Communist publication finds its way unhampered to Paris, London and New York. Democratic countries are sufficiently self-confident to allow the flow of the Com- mun st propaganda. Yet there is no such, self-confidence on the other side, where the borders are closely guarded and the agamst any book and power of the state is used newspaper that are not approved by the administration. Communist systems repeatedly invoke Karl Marx, but their current form was developed regardless of Marx. There are Marx’ theories the Communists are quoting, there are Marx’ . theories they are not quoting, and there are Marx’ theories they are most afraid of. Into the principles of his dialectic doctrine Marx in- We touch here on a central issue. When military might has been neutralized, as it effectively has, other factors come to assume decisive importance: the appearance and credibility of power, and the readiness to exercise power in the pursuit of national interests. Political power, like justice, must be made manifest to be appreciated. In this respect the image of America as far as the outside world is concerned is more and more that of a In the economic and military spheres the United States is still ahead a-nd will in all probability remain ahead for the foreseeable future, while in the political and psychological spheres the Soviet Union is ahead and seems ready to increase its lead. out American help and guidance. is reason to suppose that th new mood would have developed anyway, perhaps inevitably. Any sustained effort to pursue a global policy must be based either on a missionizing ideologj' of considerable firmness and longevity, or cn a carefully calculated plan of action that combines ambition with farsightedness nad discrimination. Neither of these preconditions has been much in evidence in American foreign policy. It is easy to understand neo-isolationism as a mood: Americans have paid a high price for globalism and have received little enough in return. It is beginning to occur to some people that the world at large, which in any case has proved incurably addicted to turmoil and perversity, can get along with- The present moment in world politics is one of transition, and it is characterized on the level of theory and action alike by a great deal of confusion. Certainly one of the main contributing factors to the confusion is what has come to be known in America as neo-isolationism (it has also been called “the foreign politics of neo-humanism”) — that retreat from global ism which seems to be the defining mark of the current American mood. The retreat may -not in the end go as far as some hope and others fear, but no one can dispute that the impulse behind it is today a major presence in American domestic politics or that its repercussions on the world scene will be widespread and decisive.
