We read and hear in the West that strange things are happening now in Czecho-Slovakia: some politicians there have taken a fancy to witch-hunting and are inclined to conduct crusades. It is suggested that some Czechs and Slovaks are irrational and irresponsible, that they follow medieval or even more backward political and religious customs and are therefore not progressive at all. The Czech word lustrace is said to have a strange etymology. It is presented as a sinister word that means purification (while the word means review, investigation, survey, inspection). The Czechoslovak Federal Assembly set up a commission to investigate the events of November 17, 1989. Later, the commission was empowered to determine which members of parliament and other high-level government officials were registered as police collaborators. Amongst the objections to these proceedings, one could read remarks concerning fashion. We were informed that “Petr Toman, spokesman for the investigating commission, rose to speak wearing an oversized white sport jacket that looked more like a lab coat than a mantle of purity.” What Petr Toman said, however, seems more important than how he was dressed. In order to know what he said, one has to understand Czech, while rendering an opinion upon his attire merely requires the ability to see. [pageend7]6 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 Two attitudes are manifested in the discussion about lustrace. According to some people, communism was not very real; it was a dream that now belongs to the past. What exactly communism was is not known, and there is no need to know. We are told to look forward, not back, and warned against opening a Pandora's box. Others hold that communism did indeed exist and that the security police, with its network of collaborators, played an important role in sustaining the regime. True, collaborators often led pitiful lives, were blackmailed, and received meager rewards for their cooperation. The problem is that they were dangerous to those around them and may still be if they are blackmailed again. At present, access to records of the covert internal functioning of communism is a possibility. Some people have a desire to know and understand. This is what writing history is about. As someone once said, in order to write a new chapter, it's worthwhile to read and understand the last one. Gaining access to historical sources was a dream of sovietologists (at least of some of them). The files of the security police are a valuable source that could broaden our knowledge of communism as a social system. Yet some people have adopted an anticultural and antihistorical attitude in response to the prospect of access to this source. These people do not, for now, propose to burn books, but they do advocate the destruction of files — the annihilation of historical sources. We are persuaded to turn files into ashes (some communist police officers were easily persuaded). According to an antihistorical line of argumentation, everyone under a communist regime was in an equal position and everyone was responsible for the functioning of the system, which amounts to the dilution of individual responsibility. This alleged equality is not true, however. There were different degrees of involvement and collaboration. Opposition to the system likewise took different forms and occurred to different degrees. Indeed, it is the degree that matters here. Differences of opinion (and of knowledge) are apparent concerning the nature of collaboration with the communist police. What constituted collaboration? A classification is needed here, and — owing to the sources that have become available — it is being worked out. A candidate for a collaborator is not the same as a collaborator; there were different kinds of collaborators; they collaborated for varying lengths of time; they only informed or they filled additional functions (such as influencing the decisions of a group or an organization or planting a listening device in an apartment); those who informed provided information in greater or lesser detail. The data available in the police archives are apparently incomplete. If they are — and most likely this is the case — it does not render them useless. Practically all data analyzed to answer questions in historical and other research are incomplete. [pageend8]FILES INTO ASHES 7 In conducting empirical research or simply trying to identify things, two types of errors are possible if one attempts to determine which objects have specified characteristics. One could commit a mistaken exclusion, for example, one could overlook a police collaborator; or one could commit a mistaken inclusion. Usually the set, or list, is too narrow. A policeman can't arrest every criminal, and a doctor can't treat everyone who is ill. But sometimes the list is too wide: policemen occasionally arrest innocent people, and doctors sometimes treat healthy patients. The more detailed the evidence, the lesser the probability of a mistaken identification. Petr Toman spoke about this in the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly. It seems that some people hardly understand the procedure chosen by the Assembly. It did not conduct a trial, and therefore there was no show trial, as some observers have suggested. The November 17 commission conducted a parliamentary investigation. Those whose names were found in the police files had the right to defend themselves, but they had no right of appeal. This is usually the case in congressional investigations in the United States: Colonel Oliver North defended himself, but he didn't appeal because he had no such right. Some critics of the Czechoslovak parliament forget that in the British tradition, parliament “can do everything that is not naturally impossible,” as William Blaxtone put it. A parliament can investigate matters of various kinds, and parliamentary commissions and investigations are quite common in the Western democracies. Some commentators have written about the list of police collaborators as if only names were known. Fortunately, there is a good deal more to it than that. There are files of collaborators and of other people, which include detailed information about a given person, the reports he completed for the police, and the time, place, and character of his contacts with his police controllers. The more details are preserved the easier it is to verify the hypothesis that a given person was a police collaborator. The Czechoslovak parliament decided to conduct a rather narrow investigation. Most of the files will probably wait many years before they are reviewed by historians. It was clear, however, to many Czechoslovak citizens that certain professions must be free of people who collaborated with the security police. The role of a postcommunist politician, and especially the role of a member of parliament, hardly seems compatible with the role of a former communist police collaborator — among other reasons, because of the possibility of blackmail. This is why the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly decided to investigate its members to determine who was registered in the files of the security police and what evidence confirmed the supposed collaboration. [pageend9]COMMON PROBLEMS COLLABORATORS REVEALED The Parliamentary Commission's Report The following is the text of the speech read by Petr Toman, spokesman of the Parliamentary Investigative Commission for the Clarification of the Events of November 17, 1989, to the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly on March 22, 1991. Dear Mr. Chairman of the Federal Assembly, Dear Mr. President, Dear Representatives, I have been charged by the investigative commission with the task of acquainting you with our commission's work: the findings of the lustrace [review, inspection]. But before I share with you the names of our colleagues who are registered collaborators with StB, I would like to apprise you of the procedures used by our commission, and of the evidence we gathered. Our commission was constituted for the purpose of investigating the events of November 17, 1989. It consists of members of all the parties represented in parliament, with the exception of the Egyůttélés [Coexistence] party, which chose to be represented by another party. Since the parties were represented in proportion to their strength in parliament, it is impossible that the commission's findings have been directed against any particular party. Resolution 94, passed by the Federal Assembly on January 11, 1991, charges us with the task of determining whether any of the representatives, ministers, their deputies, employees of the prime minister's office or of the Federal Assembly, are registered as collaborators in StB files. The resolution also charged us with the task of informing those who were positively identified with the results of our investigation. If they fail to voluntarily relinquish their posts within fifteen days of notification, Resolution 94 requires us to make their names public.... [pageend10]COLLABORATORS REVEALED 9 In view of the current state of the investigation, we will only report our findings concerning representatives to the Federal Assembly. The findings of our investigation concerning other persons who come under the purview of Resolution 94 will be given to the chairman of the Federal Assembly and the federal prime minister. Afterwards, the commission will apprise the Federal Assembly of the findings and their consequences in regard to these persons. [On May 22 fourteen members of the federal government and sixty other officials were declared to have been collaborators.] We undertook the lustrace of the representatives with the knowledge that most of them, with the exception of those belonging to the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, had signed a declaration stating that they never cooperated with the StB and, we emphasize, that they assented to further investigation into these matters. In the course of its work, the commission made the surprising discovery that, with a single exception, its members were not the first since November 17, 1989 to look at the materials on the people it investigated. It follows that the commission is not the first to find out whether those under investigation are or are not registered in the files of the StB. Let us consider who had access to these files. First, StB officers who managed agents and other StB employees who administered the files. Second, members of screening committees, who had access to the materials during screenings. Third, employees of the Office for the Defense of the Constitution and Democracy [the organization that replaced the StB], who, under the supervision of three successive directors, had access to these materials both at the Office's central location and in the individual districts. Fourth, ministers of the interior at the republic and federal levels and the employees delegated by them. Fifth, when the ministry of the interior was headed by three people — and therefore in fact by nobody — during the period following the establishment of the government of national accord, conditions at the ministry were such that nearly anyone was able to walk away with StB documents. Thus it is safe to assume that documents pertaining to StB operatives are in the possession of a number of people. We have concrete proof that particular documents listed as destroyed still exist, and we have evidence that particular documents were photographed prior to their being destroyed. The only way to prevent blackmail, the continued activity of StB collaborators, and a series of political scandals that could surface at crucial moments is to clear the government and legislative bodies of these collaborators. From this perspective, the work of our commission does no harm and will not lead to political scandals. On the contrary, it will prevent them. The effects of unsubstantiated suspicions and misused information concerning StB col[pageend11]10 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 laborators can be seen in the development of the political situation in Moravia and Slovakia. Dear colleagues, before beginning the lustrace, we had to unambiguously define the criteria for determining who collaborated with the StB, and also decide whether Resolution 94 covers all types of collaborators. We decided to use the criteria set forth in the guidelines for agent operations issued by the StB in 1962 and the guidelines for work with secret collaborators of counterintelligence A-OPER-1-3 issued in 1972 and 1978 — in other words, the regulations governing StB collaborators from 1962 to 1989. We were further guided by the directives on intelligence work issued by the first department of the SNB [regular police]. The main administration of the VKR [military counterintelligence] was established by Directive 66 of the minister of national security on May 29, 1952, and is therefore an integral part of the StB. The official guidelines divide collaborators into two groups; secret collaborators and contacts. Secret collaborators were at different times undercover agents, agents, informers, occupants of apartments used in security operations, ideological collaborators, and secret collaborators with confidential contacts. From the wording of the directives one can determine the fundamental requirement for being considered a secret collaborator: awareness of the collaboration and agreement to engage in it. Those listed as contacts, however, did not always meet this requirement. There were contacts who were unaware that they were being used and contacts who received financial compensation, in some cases foreign currency, for their services. Therefore, in the case of contacts, we had to prove knowledge of collaboration. Another category quite separate from the others is that of candidates for secret collaboration. In this case, we also had to prove knowledge of collaboration, because the majority of candidates for secret collaboration did not know they were being used, although there were some who were in fact experienced agents. All the names of representatives which we make public are registered as agents of the counterintelligence service or are documented as secret collaborators of the intelligence service...We did not find any contacts or candidates for secret collaboration who were aware that they were in contact with organs of the StB, were willing to maintain contact, and provided information or fulfilled the tasks with which they were charged. What took place before someone was registered as an agent? An StB officer began the process by screening the person whom he believed was willing to collaborate. This consisted of preparing a proposal to establish a file for the person as a candidate for secret collaboration and drawing up a plan for the actual screening. If the person was already on record as having been screened or as hostile, there was no need for a new file, and the record of the screening was added to the existing file. After all the necessary materials had been collected, the StB officer prepared a “proposal for the recruitment of a prospec[pageend12]COLLABORATORS REVEALED 11 tive collaborator,” which included an evaluation of the person in question, an evaluation of family members, documents testifying to his willingness to collaborate, and any materials that could be used to compromise him. Then the officer signed the proposal and gave it to the department head to sign. Within thirty days of approval, there took place the so-called binding action, or recruitment. Those who took part in the process besides the officer who initiated it included the prospective collaborator's case officer and the officer's superior. During the binding action, the person in question signed a document committing him to collaboration. This document was waived only in special cases, when the signature might endanger the good relations of the prospective secret collaborator in the course of his collaboration with the counterintelligence service. In such cases oral assent by the person in question was deemed sufficient. Then the prospective collaborator, after choosing a cover name, was instructed in the main principles of collaboration.. .At the same time, he was assigned his first concrete task, instructed in the manner of its execution and the procedure for making contact, and given a password to be used for the duration of the binding action. In several cases the proceedings of the binding action were tape-recorded. At the end, minutes of the binding action were prepared and signed by the StB officers who were present and then forwarded for approval to the chief officer in charge of approving proposals for recruiting collaborators. Only after such approval was the person in question registered as a collaborator of a given category. We emphasize that actual inclusion in the registry of files was not performed by an employee of the StB, but by a member of an autonomous department of the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs. A case officer then signed a document confirming the validity of the addition of the new collaborator to the registry of files. Esteemed delegates, in the course of the lustrace we asked a broad selection of StB employees whether they were familiar with the procedures mentioned above and whether they abided by them. All of them confirmed that a person registered as an agent knew he was in contact with an employee of the StB...They excluded the possibility that a collaborator could be registered without his being aware that he was collaborating. They explained that the presence of the chief officer or his deputy was required during the binding action, and that meetings between StB officers and collaborators were supervised by superior organs. None of them knew of any case in which a person was registered who was not a collaborator. When asked about specific representatives to the Federal Assembly, several StB officers reversed what they had said above. But their testimony was cast into doubt by the testimony of other StB officers. We have documentation of repeated meetings even after November 17, 1989. We have documentation that one of the representatives in the files offered his case officer the position [pageend13]12 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 of deputy if the representative became a minister. These occurrences are far too serious to ignore. We consider the registry of files of the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs to be the fundamental evidence on which we have based our conclusions. It is a directory of all persons of interest to the StB, that is, secret collaborators, persons who were screened, those who were considered hostile, and so on, with separate sections for every region of the country. Each registry is organized chronologically. Every entry is marked with a registration number and a date. In addition, the registry contains the real and cover names of the person in question, his category, his date of birth, the name of the officer who directed that the entry be made, the officer's department, section, the date when the entry was completed, and whether it should be eventually destroyed or kept in the archives. That is, all the facts that are of interest to us. Each change in the entry is explicitly documented, including the date it was made. .. .All members of the commission rule out the possibility of falsification, that is, the possibility that falsification would not have been evident in the cases we investigated. Besides the fact that the individual entries were made line by line, numbered, and consecutively dated, it is possible to establish the age of the paper on which the entry was made, the age of the ink with which it was made, and the age of the ink with which it was stamped. In the case of an expunged entry it is possible to reconstruct the original.. .In conclusion, our commission considers the registry of files to be reliable. Despite the registry's credibility, we sought to confirm the entries in it with further evidence, in particular, by questioning the StB case officers, their superiors, and their co-workers. Other persons were also questioned. We have photocopies of materials from the statistics and evidence department and printouts of computer files. We verified this information by examining other written materials. Only after cross-checking the evidence we had obtained did we conclude definitively that the person in question was registered as a collaborator of the StB.... [pageend14]COMMON PROBLEMS AN EXCEPTIONALLY DELICATE MATTER by Marta Miklaszewska The following article appeared in the May 24 edition of the Polish weekly Tygodnik Soli- damošč. A few days ago, two top officials of the Ministry of Internal Affairs — Henryk Majewski, the current head of the ministry, and General Henryk Dan- kowski, the ministry's undersecretary of state during the communist years — made announcements that were widely reported in the media. According to PAP, Majewski said, Revealing the names of agents of the former security service (SB) is out of the question. Such things are not done in any country. There are only two cases when the confidentiality of this information can be violated: murder and treason. It is in the state's strategic interest to keep this information secret forever. At about the same time, General Dankowski (one of the suspects in the renewed investigation of the conspiracy behind the murder of Father Po- pieluszko) confirmed both the authenticity and his authorship of “special” secret document SVD-001427/89, dated June 26, 1989. This document, which was sent to provincial offices of the Ministry of Internal Affairs after the partially free parliamentary elections earlier that month, contains orders to urgently send [to the head of the SB] biographical profiles of recently elected representatives and senators who are secretly collaborating with us. Apart from other information in the profiles, please include the extent to which the collaborators have been involved with our agency, their [pageend15]14 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 obedience in performing tasks, and also the political organizations they represent.... Persons from the above-mentioned groups who are registered in Office “C” should be removed from the operational files. Their removal from the files, of course, should not entail the interruption of operational contact. On the contrary, various steps should be undertaken to ensure that these persons are more firmly tied to us and more obedient in performing their tasks.... This should be treated as an exceptionally delicate matter, and only persons directly involved should have information about the above orders. The inheritance of a network of infoimants by a democratic, law-based state's security service is a highly delicate matter — especially in view of the fact that the former security service of this country took over informants from the Gestapo, made use of them, and never disclosed their names. This document proves that secret collaborators of the communist political police are sitting, among other places, in parliament. We don't know how many, what functions they are filling, or which political groups they represent. Let's hope there are only a few. But even if there are only a couple, there are two too many, for their presence in parliament throws a shadow of suspicion over every member of parliament. In this light, Minister Majewski's statement takes on a special significance. Is it really in the state's interest to keep the names of informants a secret “forever”? Opinion polls reveal that the current parliament does not enjoy a great deal of authority, which is not surprising, since less than half of its members were freely elected. Would an investigation to determine which parliamentarians are collaborating with the former security police harm the public interest? Probably not. No one can deny the voters' right to moral satisfaction, nor the right of the representatives and senators themselves to an opportunity to clear up their morally ambiguous situation. More importantly, the failure to undertake an investigation could lead to a political scandal in parliamentary elections scheduled for the fall. The effects of such a scandal would indeed harm the public interest, or, as Majewski puts it, the “state's strategic interests.” Parliament and other leading public organizations should demand that the Minister of Internal Affairs reverse his position on this matter. Surely, the integrity and independence of those who will vote upon the future Constitution of the Polish Republic can be considered strategic interests of the state. Parliament must have the same status as Caesar's wife in ancient Rome: it should be beyond all suspicion. [pageend16]COMMON PROBLEMS AFTER DANUBEGATE by Zóltán Lovás Zoltán Lovás is a journalist for the Hungarian daily Magyar Hirlap. He wrote the following article for Uncaptive Minds. The demise of an East European security service may seem a relatively straightforward topic. It's not. In fact in Hungary, as in the rest of Eastern Europe, it hasn't really happened yet. And what has happened so far is highly complex. On Christmas Day 1989,1 slipped into the security police's headquarters. The evidence I uncovered then and subsequent revelations helped thwart the communists' plans to hold on to power. This episode, which was dubbed the Danubegate affair, is a good place to begin an examination of the communist security police's fate in Hungary and its effect on the political system as a whole. At midnight on December 24, 1989, some 100,000 people filled Heroes' Square in Budapest to participate in an ecumenical mass dedicated to the revolution then in progress in neighboring Romania. Everyone was aware of the Securitate's murderous assault on the people of that country. It was this bloodshed that prompted Major József Végvári from the Hungarian counterintelligence service to let the world know what his employers were up to. Two hours later, I was approached by the major. He wanted to know whether I was interested in helping him collect materials from the headquarters of the security police for publication. It was a staggering offer. But there was no time to think it over: we were to go in the next day, because it was Christmas and security would be lax. Of course if we were caught, we could expect no special Christmas leniency. Yet there was too much at stake. Végvári told me that the interior ministry was still spying on the opposition parties, in violation of the national agreement [pageend17]16 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 concluded in October 1989. Moreover, if evidence of the party-state's continued use of Stalinist security police methods were made public, it would cripple the Hungarian Socialist Party's [the former communists] chances in the upcoming elections. So I agreed to help him. I spent the next afternoon in the heart of the Hungarian security police, looking over documents and video taping them. Over the course of the next three weeks, we contrived to spirit out the evidence we had identified. Then we published it. The ramifications were far reaching. The Hungarian Socialist Party won only 10% of the vote instead of the 25-30% that had been predicted before these revelations. Afterwards, it was announced that the security police apparatus was to be dismantled. What did we find out about the dreaded Hungarian secret service? That it was not as well organized as the East German Stasi, nor as clever as the Czechoslovak state security, nor as brutal as the Securitate, and, of course, not nearly as powerful as the KGB. The Hungarian security police was the weapon of a dictatorship that had been softening since the early 1960s. And its personnel were the product of negative selection: party soldiers were motivated by privileges, not the communist creed. Recruitment was channeled through connections to the party leadership. The structure of oppression that Moscow had bestowed on us was perfect, but those who ran it were increasingly unsuited for the task. That an amateur like myself could penetrate into the very heart of the organization was further evidence of how far it had degenerated. The Hungarian security police consisted of a military and a civilian branch, both of which were divided into two bureaus: reconnaissance and counterintelligence. The Danubegate affair involved just one section — the in/m department — within one of these four bureaus. Altogether, the security police had several thousand in-house staff. The so-called secret staff, who were “installed” in other organizations, also numbered in the thousands. Then there were the tens of thousands who had been blackmailed into collaborating, along with the “social representatives” who informed out of conviction. What happened to this vast network? Well, it was never dismantled, nor even significantly changed. In January 1990, after the revelations, a few officers were kicked out; and a few more lost their jobs after the parliamentary elections. History shows that when there is a change of regime, the security structures are usually taken over by the new authorities, who use them for their own purposes. This appears to be the case in Hungary. A bold assertion, perhaps, but not without evidence to back it up. The post office still illegally monitors mail. The telephones of opposition leaders still click suspiciously. Members of the government have inadvertently repeated word for word statements made by opposition leaders in private. The National Security Office, which was set up to replace the in/m department, has been [pageend18]AFTER DANUBECATE 17 staffed with activists from the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), the leading party in the governing coalition. What's more, the Office's work was supervised by a group within the MDF until word of this highly unconstitutional arrangement leaked out. Perhaps the most damning evidence against the new authorities is the show trial they subjected Major Végvári to (although his sentence was light). When two real criminals were finally brought to trial, the interior ministry generals Ferenc Pallagi and József Horváth, the prosecutor himself asked for their acquittal! This was too much. The judge didn't dare let the spy generals off scot- free, so he imposed the lightest possible sentences. But even these may not be served: appeals are pending. Of course, no proceedings have been started at all against current and former communist leaders, who bear both political and criminal responsibility for the illegal operations of the security police — including Miklós Németh, Rezso Nyers, and Imre Pozsgay. These people may have secretly been granted immunity in the political deal between the former ruling elite and the elite that subsequently came — or was helped — to power. Certainly not everyone connected with the security police should be brought to trial and punished — indeed, only a tiny minority should. But the security police must be dismantled, and many of those now or at one time linked to it should be exposed. Again, not all informants and collaborators need have their names made public. Even if this were considered desirable, it would be impossible to bring tens of thousands to justice. But the top 1,000 or so positions in government, parliament, and the judicial system should be cleansed of agents and collaborators of the security police. There are good reasons for this. First, security police agents continue to give information to, and make decisions in the interests of, the police itself and the remaining structures of the old party-state; furthermore, former collaborators are and will always be susceptible to blackmail. Second, the failure to expose agents and collaborators will bring into question the moral credibility of the transition. A lack of faith in the government could lead to instability, especially when people are asked to make sacrifices for the sake of economic reform. Third, the continued presence of security police agents and collaborators in important positions is a threat to the sovereignty of the Hungarian state. We know that information collected by the Hungarian security police was automatically passed on to the Soviets up to the summer of 1989. This means that some high officials are not only susceptible to local blackmailers, but to blackmail by a foreign power. A bill on the removal of collaborators from these posts was introduced in November 1990 by two opposition deputies, Peter Hack and Gábor Demszky (who has since left parliament to become mayor of Budapest). Unfortunately, parliament has yet to start discussions on the bill. [pageend19]18 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 In April 1991, the government introduced its own bill on this matter. This bill suffers from a number of weaknesses. First, the number of positions subject to verification far exceeds the approximately 1,000 that fall under the purview of the Demszky-Hack bill. It also reaches beyond state positions to the media — the béte noire of the MDF. Second, it would cover agents and collaborators from the early Kádár era, that is, 1956 to 1962. While stretching the investigation back to these years is morally justifiable, it will be exceedingly difficult to collect the necessary evidence to hold fair trials for all those involved. Instead of rapidly cleansing important state posts, this bill proposes to take such a large bite that the whole process will be delayed, weakened, and could break down altogether. Let us take the benevolent view that this was not the intention — although considering the many agents that are almost certainly “installed” in parliament, such a scheme cannot be ruled out. The problem of the security police is complex and woven into the very fabric of Hungarian politics. Solving it will require patience, forethought, and the consensus of all the main political forces. If they can build this consensus — and that looks doubtful at this time — then the following broad steps should be taken: those who hold key positions should undergo verification according to the Demszky-Hack plan; action should be taken to prevent the abuse of the security police files; an agreement should be concluded with the Soviet Union on the return or supervised destruction of its files on Hungarian citizens; and last but not least, the entire Hungarian security police should be reorganized and pared down. [pageend20]LITHUANIA interview with VYTAUTAS LANDSBERGIS The following interview with Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis was conducted for Uncaptive Minds by Egidijus Meilunas, a journalist who has since become the deputy press spokesman of the Lithuanian government, on March 8, 1991 in Vilnius. NO OTHER CHOICE UM Mr. President, March 11 marks the first anniversary of Lithuania's declaration of independence. What would you name as the most important achievements in the effort to reestablish the Lithuanian state during the past year? LANDSBERGIS We are living according to the laws that we ourselves have established, according to our own traditions and our own customs. We do not need anyone else's permission to do so. We are able to handle the problems facing us — both the inheritance of communism and the difficulties our eastern neighbor is forcing upon us. We are relying on the clearly proclaimed wishes and the clearly expressed will of the Lithuanian people, and this distinguishes our country from the Soviet Union. Despite the presence of Soviet troops and the obstacles the Soviets are placing in our way, Lithuania is reestablishing direct contacts with other nations. Economic and cultural ties have come first, diplomatic relations are following. We have made use of the Lithuanian embassies maintained in a number of countries during the 50-year occupation of Lithuania. Some Western countries were very resolute in resisting Soviet demands that [pageend21]Protecting the Lithuanian parliament. [pageend22]Vilnius, February 1991. Referendum on Lithuanian independence. The voting cards here are printed both in Lithuanian and Polish. [pageend23]n UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 Lithuanian embassies be closed. We have inherited embassies in Washington, London, and the Vatican, plus a consul general in Canada. We are reopening our embassies in the Scandinavian countries and hope soon to open embassies in the Central European nations. Those are our most important successes in reestablishing the Lithuanian state. Also, we have defended ourselves against the psychological and economic war, the hot war, our eastern neighbor is waging against us. UM In late December 1990, Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze provoked a storm when he declared at the Congress of People's Deputies that the USSR was heading towards dictatorship. In May 1989, in the very same hall, you had warned of the danger of a coup d'etat. Later that year in New York, you pointed out that the Soviets might disrupt Lithuania's parliament, by force of arms if necessary. Were you speaking on the basis of intuition or analysis? LANDSBERGIS There has been a clear trend in this direction, and we have always kept in mind the possibility of the Soviets using force. In some parts of the world we are seen as idealists, but we have no illusions. We made a decision to fulfill our duty, knowing full well that the road ahead would not be easy or free of danger; we have prepared for the worst. Living with our eastern neighbor, we recognize the situation for what it is. It is the Western nations that are prone to illusions. They do not realize that the concessions the Soviets have offered were unavoidable — not acts of good will or a renunciation of their policy of aggression. We know all too well that the policy of aggression towards Lithuania has not changed in the least, and we know that the Soviet Union has not undergone fundamental change. Its attempts to expand its power throughout the world may have failed, but it still threatens Lithuania as much as ever. UM One manifestation of Soviet aggression against Lithuania was the series of atrocities Soviet troops committed in Vilnius in January. However, the Kremlin has recently changed its tactics. It is now holding a referendum on a new union treaty. Most likely, the voting will be rigged. There is also a chance that there will be an attempt to separate Vilnius from the rest of Lithuania; this idea has been [pageend24]Photo: Maciej Szymczak Vilnius, February 1991. President Landsbergis and Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorius. The studio of independent Lithuanian TV, which is based in the parliament building. Photo: Maciej Szymczak [pageend25]24 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 expressed by pro-Soviet organizations in Lithuania and in speeches by Kremlin officials. How can Lithuania resist this Soviet initiative? LANDSBERGIS I think it is mainly an attempt to blackmail us: I doubt they will indeed try to tear off the Vilnius region and “allow” the rest of Lithuania to become an independent state again. That would be acceptable neither to Lithuania nor to the rest of the international community. To my mind, this proposal is really a part of the propaganda and psychological war against Lithuania. The referendum will serve first and foremost as a means for Gorbachev to pursue his larger political goals. Gorbachev wants some sign of support, whether genuine or artificial, for his very unpopular policies. He emphasizes that his great goal is to preserve the union, and many people consider that important. People have been taught to be proud of the Soviet state and its military might, and to pay less attention to its inability to provide for their needs. Because of this tradition, many will vote yes; fraud will provide the rest of the votes Gorbachev needs. It is already evident that in some republics very few people will vote. The referendum will thus not be a true expression of popular opinion and popular will. Besides, it lacks clear purpose: people don't know what it is they will be voting for, perhaps only for some “improved” union to come. The referendum has no real substance; it has only political, even provocative aims. The most dangerous aspect of the referendum is that the results will allow the Soviets to continue using force against Lithuania, but with “legal” justification. The Soviets are masters at this game. UM Barricades surround the parliament and Soviet armored vehicles drive through the streets of Vilnius day and night. Given these circumstances, “negotiations ’ ’ might not be the best word to describe what Moscow has proposed. Be that as it may, what is the outlook for negotiations? Have there been any positive developments? LANDSBERGIS There have been no real changes for the better. The double-dealing of Soviet policy is obvious. After the West protested and expressed its indignation at the atrocities perpetrated by Soviet forces in Vilnius, the Kremlin made several gestures, for example announcing the formation of a new delegation to carry on negotiations with Lithuania. Nevertheless, they have not changed and they continue to ignore our grievances. The Soviets have not withdrawn their [pageend26]Photo: Maciej Szymczak Vilnius, January 1991.

Negotiating under such circumstances would mean reconciling ourselves to the occupation, it would mean surrender. It is very difficult, therefore, to say if, when, and how negotiations might begin. At the moment, negotiations would be virtually meaningless because our negotiating partner is intractable and violent. We would be negotiating with the violator. The desire for genuine negotiations must be mutual. UM Before the Second World War, there was talk of a union of the independent states of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. That idea has become topical again. How would you describe relations between the Baltic states, and what are the prospects for a Baltic union? LANDSBERGIS Our relations are very close; the cooperation among us is sincere. However, given the dangers confronting us and the goals we are pursuing, our relations could be firmer; our actions could be better coordinated. I am not reproaching our neighbors, however, for taking the actions they have taken. We have been keeping prewar achievements in mind. The relations among the Baltic states are based on the tradition of our prewar dealings with one another. We have continued in the tradition of the Baltic Accord and want to expand upon it. We have created the Council of the Baltic States to foster economic cooperation. At some point in the future, the conditions will exist for more uniform economic policies, and then we could create a Baltic common market or a “Baltic Benelux.” Such ideas are being discussed and are quite promising — provided, that is, that there is no attempt to suppress all three of the Baltic states. UM You have criticized the West for its ambiguous position towards Lithuania. On the one hand, the Western countries have declared for the past 50 years that they do not recognize the annexation of the Baltic states, while on the other hand, they have withheld recognition of Lithuania's declaration of independence. Iceland and Denmark have officially recognized Lithuania. Why do you think the major Western powers have not taken this step? LANDSBERGIS I think what has held them back is their false image of the Soviet Union. I do not believe that the Western powers are unwilling to [pageend30]Photo: M aciej Szym czak Vilnius, February 1991. Lithuanian with new identity card for the Republic of Lithuania. [pageend31]Photo: Maciej Szymczak Vilnius, February 1991. President Landsbergis speaks to the nation. [pageend32]WE HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE 31 help Lithuania politically or otherwise. In Europe there is strong sympathy for Lithuania, and many private initiatives have been launched to assist us. The governments of Western Europe, however, continue to deal as usual with the cumbersome and dangerous Soviet Union. The myth that helping Lithuania will harm Gorbachev remains strong, and so does the belief that full official recognition of Lithuania would destabilize the Soviet Union. Of course, Western recognition might to some degree destabilize the Soviet Union, but by undermining evil we promote good. There is no need to fear harming evil — that is, the remnants of totalitarianism, the forces opposing the rights of the peoples of the Baltic states and of the Soviet Union. It is only with the assistance of the Baltic states and the freedom movements in the Soviet republics that the Soviet Union can be transformed into a more just and humane state. Yet the West continues to worry more about whether the central authorities can maintain order than about the injustices perpetuated by those authorities; this way of thinking is obviously helpful to the Soviet empire. It is a shame that the policies of the Western states reflect the Soviets' own belief that human rights and the rights of nations are not the foremost concern. UM You have been called a moral politician who has proven that truth and conscience are the most effective weapons in combating hatred and evil. Do you think that morality could become a factor in international power politics? LANDSBERGIS It's hard to say. I doubt moral principles will become the decisive consideration in international politics. But the world has had opportunities to see clearly the horrors and dangers of politics devoid of moral content, such as the dictatorships of the left and the right that have plagued our century, and the emerging threat of a reborn dictatorship in the East. Even the comparatively liberal and flexible policies the Soviet Union has pursued for the last few years have lacked any moral orientation; they were based solely on calculation and self-interest. Hope of profit, not a sense of justice, opened the way for democracy and freedom. Of course, sometimes profit and freedom coincide; but lately the Soviets have reconsidered their calculations, and now they are prepared to defend the empire by force. [pageend33]32 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 UM You spend all day in meetings and tending to the business of state; as we speak, it is late at night; tomorrow you will no doubt have another very full schedule. What gives you the strength to carry on like this? LANDSBERGIS Perhaps because we have no other choice. And there is, of course, the belief in the meaningfulness of what we are doing. [pageend34]HUNGARY THE CASE AGAINST COMPENSATION by Viktor Orbán The following is a speech given in parliament on February 4, 1991 by Viktor Orbán, the leader of the Federation of Young Democrats' (FIDESZ) parliamentary caucus. The speech laid out his party's position on the question of compensation for property confiscated by the communist government after 1948. Respected colleagues! Ladies and Gentlemen! It is with mixed feelings that we greet the drafting of legislation on compensation, if only because of the stormy debate which preceded it. On the one hand, we are hopeful that Parliament can once and for all lay to rest the issue of property relations, which has unnecessarily burdened the political and economic life of Hungary's new democracy; at the same time, however, we fear that the government's overly zealous approach to the issue could lead to the breakup of the governing coalition. In essence, the current situation stems from missteps taken during the formation of the government which now appear irreversible. In May our prime minister, for reasons still unclear, united in his government two parties with completely contradictory ideas, the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) and the Smallholders' Party, in spite of the willingness of the largest opposition party [the Alliance of Free Democrats] to enter into a grand coalition [with the MDF], which in our view would have been the only workable alternative at the time. Even then, sober observers could see that the Hungarian Democratic Forum and the Smallholders' Party disagreed not just on peripheral issues, but on those issues most important to the Smallholders: privatization, [pageend35]34 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 reprivatization [returning property to former owners], and the issue of land ownership. These problems, which have undermined Hungary's governing coalition since the moment of its formation, threaten to become explosive. It is no coincidence that the coalition has changed its stand on the land question several times in recent months, offering several confusing variants. In the end, however, the issue comes down to one thing: who cheats whom? The draft legislation before us today is a product of such unfortunate wrangling — and we are becoming increasingly convinced that the Hungarian population as a whole will be cheated in the end. For no one can seriously expect this law to settle the questions of reprivatization, land ownership, and other serious issues which have kept the economy from functioning normally; nor can we expect that it will put an end to the squabbling within the government coalition. The proposal at hand is such that further legislation will be needed. Furthermore, it is clear that the legislation before us is not a compensation bill, but a land reprivatization bill masquerading as one. The positions of the various parties, as presented by their spokesmen, have differed on a number of points but agreed on one thing: they accept compensation as the sole method for creating a new property system, and, therefore, they all consider the draft law worthy of discussion. FIDESZ's view differs fundamentally from those already presented. We believe that true compensation is impossible, and that it is not the appropriate way of creating the functional economy based on private property that we all desire. For this reason, we reject the idea of compensation. We also oppose the draft legislation as presented because it does not meet the minimum standards to be expected from a law of this type. The arguments for and against compensation can be divided into the following three distinct groups: the issue of fairness or social justice, the question of legality, and economic arguments. For the sake of clarity, we should avoid confusing the different arguments. Therefore, it should be stated up front that the arguments relating to social justice are irrefutably strong. The confiscation of property led to numerous personal and family tragedies and destroyed the work of generations. One might also raise the question of whether a state which respects the rule of law can be built upon a foundation of injustice. On the other hand, it must be remembered that over the past 40 years the majority of people in our society — and not just property owners — suffered some form of injustice. Capitalists, landowners, Jews, Germans, peasants, craftsmen, merchants, politically suspect people, “class enemies,” and others were deprived not only of their property, but of their freedom, jobs, careers, educational opportuni[pageend36]THE CASE ACAINST COMPENSATION 35 ties, and even their lives. From the point of view of justice, these losses were at least as grave as the confiscation of property. Another strong argument against compensation is the fact that national income during the past four decades was generated under conditions of state ownership, and former property owners have no greater right to it than other people. We should further pose the question of why property relations of 40 years ago should be accepted as valid and just. Why was 1949 chosen as a cut-off point instead of 1945, 1947, or, for example, the first, indefensible intervention in property relations, namely the so called Jewish law from 1939? From the point of view of fairness and social justice, the most important argument against compensation — and by itself this is grounds enough to reject the concept as a whole — is that compensating former owners at the expense of the current generation, whose members played no part in the expropriations, would be immeasurably unjust. For it is clear that the costs of compensation are to be borne not by the state, but by taxpaying citizens, whose living conditions are deteriorating steadily as it is. Without a doubt, the strongest legal argument in favor of compensation rests on the notion that property is sacred, and that property law is not subject to change. We do believe that private property is a fundamental social institution, guaranteeing individual freedom and societal well-being. According to the leading theorists of liberalism, property also encompasses life, freedom and welfare; to deprive someone of property violates a basic right. (I might add at this point, however, that throughout history property laws have never been without restrictions.) Although at first glance the argument for the sanctity of property appears to be the most powerful argument of the supporters of compensation, it is on this point that they can be most easily attacked, for they are inconsistent in their attitude towards the old order. It is difficult to understand how, depending on their mood, they can declare certain laws from the past 40 years unjust while not questioning most of the others. From a legal perspective, compensation claims are only justifiable if every order and regulation passed under the old order is rejected. Our unwillingness to accept the “sanctity of property” argument as the basis for the legality of compensation, however, comes from the fact that some of those demanding compensation are asking for restitution of property which they themselves obtained illegally. In other words, the beneficiaries of the 1945 land reform [which broke up large estates and distributed land to individual farmers] obtained their property precisely because of the same violation of the sanctity of property as those who later received theirs as a result of collectivization [Laughter, commotion]. From a legal standpoint, there is no difference between the two cases. Supporters of compensation often attempt to cover up this weak point in their ar[pageend37]36 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 gumentation and often confuse justice-related and legal arguments. They advance the untenable argument that even if the legality of the redistribution of property after 1945 can be questioned in some cases, the justice of doing so cannot. The supporters of compensation invoke justice, though they are well aware that their demands for compensation will result in injustices being done to others. In the case of many compensation claims, it is precisely this use of the principle of the sanctity of property which is unjustifiable on legal grounds. Economic arguments can also be advanced both for and against the idea of compensation. In support of compensation, this Chamber has heard on several occasions the ridiculous assertion that the revitalization of agricultural production can bring the country out of its current crisis. Although the revitalization of agricultural production is without a doubt an important issue, it must be said that agriculture is not a leading economic branch anywhere else in Europe and that agriculture depends on government subsidies in almost every country. Furthermore, the number of people employed in agriculture in developed countries is one quarter to one fifth the number of those employed in agriculture in Hungary. Another economic consideration militating against the MDF-Smallholders' proposal is that in cases of restitution, property is divided not according to the principles of economic efficiency, but according to historical laws of a different kind. However, our primary reason for rejecting the idea of compensation on economic grounds is extremely simple: Hungary cannot afford it at a time when the nation's foreign debt has skyrocketed to $22 billion, when millions of Hungarians are living below the poverty line, when unemployment is growing rapidly, when support for social programs is shrinking. In other words, this country cannot afford the one hundred billion forint compensation would cost. The projected costs of compensation are enormous. According to estimates by experts, the cost of compensation would be equal to approximately one third of the amount paid annually to pensioners, or to one half of total income tax paid annually by Hungarian citizens — and this does not take into account the costs of running the state bureaucracy responsible for compensation, which could double the billions of forint already mentioned. Therefore, taxpayers' contributions will not be enough to cover the costs of compensation and the government might choose to issue shares without covering in currency, which by definition would lead to higher inflation. During the debate several parties were of the opinion that compensation, as outlined in the proposal at hand, merits the high costs already mentioned because it will contribute to the rapid creation of a much-needed property- owning class. However, FIDESZ believes that the distribution of compensation vouchers [redeemable for stock in companies undergoing privatization] will not lead to the growth of a class of property owners. The privatization vouchers to be issued will be bought up en masse by the already existing cap[pageend38]THE CASE AGAINST COMPENSATION 37 italist class at a fraction of their price. For this reason, those who favor the idea of compensation vouchers support, in effect, not the creation of a class of new private property owners, but the granting of state support to a class already in possession of capital — as these parties' first-rate economists know full well. Advocates of compensation — whether they know it or not — support the consolidation of certain existing monopolies, and therefore the interests of those in monopoly positions. This review shows, we believe, that none of the arguments for compensation advanced by the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the Smallholders' Party, the Hungarian Socialist Party, and the Alliance of Free Democrats, is convincing. Naturally, we cannot delude ourselves into thinking that our own arguments will change the minds of those who hope to regain their former property. There are probably still a number of people who — leaving the arguments presented aside — expect something from this law. They should not. The law before us would provide only a pittance to most former owners. Only former owners of large holdings would be in a position to regain a significant amount of property. This goes to show that the government plan is really a land reprivatization law disguised as a compensation law. It is, therefore, unconstitutional, since .it is in conflict with the Constitutional Court's ruling number 1057/B 1990. The failure to specify who is responsible for establishing the value of property at the time of confiscation and by what procedure, makes it all but impossible to carry out the government's plan in practice. The proposed regulations do not spell out clearly the issues of the sphere of authority, competence, and supervision, and, as a result, we can expect thousands of legal disputes and endless litigation to follow. Those who support compensation should also know that the privatization currently taking place in Hungary does not lend itself to the use of privatization vouchers. Former owners, their expectations raised unrealistically, are to receive useless (or usable only at some uncertain future date) paper in lieu of their desired property. If compensation occurs, no one will be satisfied: neither the former owners whose expectations have been raised, nor the taxpayers who will be expected to cover the costs of compensation. Both groups will end up feeling cheated, and rightly so. For all these reasons, FIDESZ rejects the idea of compensation, and advises the government to seek solutions elsewhere. It is our belief that a single law is not sufficient to meet all of the government's goals. The governing parties should abandon their position on land reprivatization, and deal with the issues of privatization and restitution separately. The return of property to its former owners should be initiated not through compensation, but through the modification of several existing laws which can be changed quickly and easily. The process could be begun by amending, in succession, the existing laws on cooperatives, the Company Law and the Trans[pageend39]38 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 formation Law [the latter two form the legal basis for privatization in Hungary]. Once again, we must emphasize that the seizure of people's property represents one of the previous regime's single most destructive actions. For this reason, the government should prepare a comprehensive law on restitution which would expand the provisions of existing laws to allow surviving former owners, in addition to prisoners of war and political prisoners, to be eligible for reparations. In establishing the amount of compensation to be awarded, an individual's current living conditions — and not the size of the confiscated property — should be taken as a benchmark. In this way, a person might receive a symbolic amount of compensation which would allow him or her to live in dignity. Our moral standards demand nothing less. [Loud applause.] [Despite FIDESZ's opposition, the governing coalition's plan to compensate expropriated property holders with vouchers and limited restitution of actual property — mainly land — was voted into law by the parliament. It now awaits review by the Constitutional Court.] [pageend40]OPPORTUNITIES Briefing NEWS AND ANALYSIS OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN EAST-CENTRAL EUROPE Responding to the information vacuum in the wake of the collapse of communism in eastern Europe, the International Freedom Foundation's United Kingdom office has been publishing since May 1990 OPPORTUNITIES Briefing, a bi-monthly newsletter on pertinent business transactions and political transformations occurring in the market economies.

[pageend41]HUNGARY POLITICAL DIFFERENTIATION DURING THE DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION by József Szájer József Szájer is a FIDESZ deputy and a lawyer. He read the following paper at a conference organized by the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Timisoara from March 25 to 27. The democratic transition of 1988-1990 gave rise to numerous political organizations in Hungary. Most of these organizations started in 1988 as political movements initiated by groups of intellectuals. By the time the parliamentary elections were held, the most significant movements had become officially registered parties enjoying moderate popular support. Since late 1989 the dominant actors on the Hungarian political scene have consisted almost exclusively of 5 to 7 political parties. The party politics engaged in by these parties have become the most characteristic feature of Hungary's new political life. The newly elected parliament has become the main arena for political discussion between the six parliamentary parties, which include: the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the Smallholders' Party, and the Christian Democratic Party, all three members of the governing coalition; and the Association of Free Democrats, the Federation of Young Democrats (FIDESZ), and the Hungarian Socialist Party [the former communists], which make up the opposition. Parties that failed to win a sufficient number of votes to enter parliament, such as the social democrats, the communists, and the agrarian-socialists, became almost complete outsiders to national politics. The parliament, although its main duty [pageend42]POLITICAL DIFFERENTIATION 41 is to legislate, also acts as a forum for political discussions framed by debates over drafts of new laws. The key issues have centered on the constitution, restitution of property, privatization, and freedom of the media. Hungarian political parties can be divided into three groups. The first group consists of parties established in 1988. These parties trace their origins to intellectual protests against the communist regime. They include the Hungarian Democratic Forum, which started as a debating club of the so-called “populist,” intelligentsia; FIDESZ, initially a legalist civil rights movement of young intellectuals; and the Association of Free Democrats, which began as the Network of Free Initiatives, and included many members of the opposition active during the 1970s and 1980s. These organizations emerged as a result of the political crisis of the ancien regime. The main issues they championed were the rule of law, human rights, parliamentary democracy, the unification of Europe, and a market economy. The second group of parties are those that reemerged 40 years after having been silenced by the communists: the Smallholders' Party, the Christian Democratic Party, and the Social Democratic Party. These parties, which were organized predominantly by old activists, appeared in the second phase of party formation. The issues they are concerned with are mostly connected to the injustices of the past 40 years. They support restitution of land and other property to former owners, and a restoration of national and spiritual values. Their political base is mainly in the countryside. The third group of parties appeared when it became obvious that communism had lost its fight with the new forces. As many as 70 new political groups, clubs, even one-member, one-issue parties emerged just before the March 1990 elections and disappeared rapidly thereafter. These parties were usually associated with marginal and often extremist issues. These three categories do not cover the organizational or ideological successors of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party: the Hungarian Socialist Party and the hardliner Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, which are in a category by themselves. Hungarian political parties are not differentiated primarily along ideological lines. This has tempted some political analysts to predict the rapid realignment of the Hungarian party structure according to the West European model. This grand transformation has yet to take place; in fact, it probably never will. The elections sharply delineated the parties, and intra-party cohesion despite some noisy internal debates has remained strong. The differentiation of parties is based on differences in policy, broadly conceived ideology (liberal-conservative), attitudes towards the former regime, the level of professionalism, emotional bearing, group or generational identification, and relation to the ideas of the nation, modernization, and religion. Political differences declared during the election campaign were reinforced during the debates over practical issues in legislative sessions. These debates, [pageend43]42 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 together with the efforts of the government and the opposition to inform the public, helped people to understand the policy positions held by each of the parties. The predominantly symbolic politics that immediately followed the demise of the old regime was replaced by a new kind of parliamentary or party politics that centered on specific issues. The process of party formation is evolving within the framework of the existing parliamentary parties. These parties may form alliances or restructure themselves, but this will be a long, organic process. Hungary's first parliamentary elections were held in the context of an already differentiated party structure. Not that there was complex debate over a wide range of issues: the main issue of the elections was the question of the ancien regime, and the democratic parties competed by trying to outdo one another in their rejection of communism. They also advanced positive visions of Hungary's future, but these were highly abstract and came with no assurances that the parties that put them forward would remain committed to them. Nonetheless, the pre-election period was a harbinger of the pluralistic future of parliament, and set the pattern for the principal political divisions. In this sense, Hungary reached the watershed of the first free elections with a developed pluralistic party structure in place. This state of affairs enabled the country to focus on the problems and perspectives of the future rather than the past. The creation of a mature party structure — for the first time in Hungarian history — established a politically balanced legislature with a firm basis for government, as well as a strong opposition that can pose as an alternative. The advantages of this structure — compared to the communist/noncommunist division that continues to be the most important political feature of the rest of Eastern Europe's political landscape — are enormous. Despite the substantial progress we've made in building a strong parliamentary system, the popularity of the parties has steeply declined since the elections. The three P-words — parties, parliament, politics — are held in low esteem by the public. Less than half of those eligible to vote would bother to do so if parliamentary elections were held today. The recent by-elections were met with voter indifference; voter turnout was as low as 8 percent in one district. The public's disenchantment with politics is probably the result of a number of factors. Most discussions in parliament have touched upon extremely sensitive issues, and emotions are running high. Televised debates on the floor of the parliament seem like an ongoing fight. After two years of transition, people would prefer to see the implementation of changes; specifically, they want a noticeable improvement in their standard of living. Owing to the live broadcasts of parliamentary sessions, people now identify politics almost exclusively with parliamentary debate. This has enabled the government's incompetence and its unpopular measures to largely escape public notice. [pageend44]POLITICAL DIFFERENTIATION 43 What can be done to reverse the decline in the prestige of parliamentary politics? My party, FIDESZ, has proposed wide-ranging negotiations modeled after the Moncloa process in Spain following the death of Franco. Talks would be held between the government and the opposition, with the participation of representatives from the six parliamentary parties. The idea would be to create a framework and an atmosphere of trust for government-opposition cooperation. Such cooperation will be particularly needed during the extraordinarily difficult economic transition that awaits us. However, it should stop short of suspending the traditional division of roles between the opposition and the government. The government would be responsible for implementing the agreement, while the opposition would ensure that the government lived up to its promises. Broadly speaking, the agreement should cover the major issues of the transition. This would be the best way to protect parliamentary democracy from the growing dangers of demagoguery and populism. [pageend45]HUNGARY BUILDING A MARKET ECONOMY IN HUNGARY by Gábor Demszky Gábor Demszky is the mayor of Budapest and a member of the executive council of the Alliance of Free Democrats (SzDSz). The following is a paper presented at the April 15-16 conference of the National Endowment for Democracy. It will be published in a book as part of the complete conference proceedings later this summer. In 1948, after they had seized power through rigged elections ^yid with the help of the Red Army, communist activists marched through the streets in celebration. “By tomorrow we'll turn the whole world around,” they sang. They understood this slogan absolutely literally. They were preparing, at Stalin's command, for the inevitable third world war, and at the same time, they were looking at the nation's social, political, and economic life. Subsequently, the leaders of Hungary and the other communist lands did indeed “turn the world around.” By abolishing market relations, by nationalizing almost all private property, and by their so-called economic planning they turned their countries into economic disaster zones. A few facts clearly illustrate the consequences of four decades of communist rale in Hungary. First and foremost is our national debt. Last year, the Hungarian government owed a total of $21 billion, some of it to Western governments, most to Western banks. Given that it has a population of ten and a half million, Hungary's per capita debt is roughly double Poland's and almost four times as great as Czecho-Slovakia's. The proportion of agricultural workers in Hungary's workforce is five times that in most Western nations, [pageend46]BUILDING A MARKET ECONOMY 45 and the per capita GNP is roughly $3,000. Just two years ago, 60% of Hungary's exports were to other COMECON countries. And finally, one simple statistic clearly shows how truly underdeveloped Hungary's infrastructure is: at the turn of the century, Hungary possessed one of the most advanced communications networks in the world, whereas today in Europe only Albania has proportionally fewer telephones per capita than Hungary. In the wake of the communist regime, Hungary remains a country where the state still owns 90% of the means of production, where monopolies are still the norm, where there are no accumulated savings or capital in the hands of the population at large, and where 40 years were spent trying to eradicate Hungary's traditional middle class. During the 1950s, for example, “bourgeois elements” were exiled to rural areas and forced to work in Soviet-style agricultural collectives. Their children were not admitted to schools or universities on the grounds that “the intellectual monopoly of the middle class” had to be broken. All the while the communist authorities were appointing shoemakers and butchers to high managerial positions on the basis of their political reliability. The regime was less brutal during the past twenty years, but the popular anti-intellectualism it had fostered persisted. Among the European nations, Hungary ranks first in the number of children who do not complete eight years of elementary education and has the third lowest number of students who receive university degrees. I mention these sad, almost horrifying, facts to show the obstacles Hungary faces in trying to become competitive in the European and world markets. When Westerners hear these facts, more often than not they ask how it was possible for Hungary to develop so differently from the other East bloc countries. Why, in other words, is it that economic and political reforms have gone the furthest here? To understand this situation, we must take account of the past. Hungary was the first country to confront the mighty Russian empire, directly and against overwhelming military odds. When Moscow launched its frontal attack against the government of Imre Nagy on November 4, 1956, it recognized that it would encounter genuine, not merely symbolic, resistance. The revolution was brutally suppressed and the harsh reprisals that followed were unprecedented in Hungarian history. As a result, certain concessions were made in later years. Moscow allowed Hungary a certain carefully defined measure of freedom for economic experimentation. There could be no talk of the demise of the communist order, of course; only its proper functioning and improvement could be considered. And even within these guidelines, the government often had to beat a hasty retreat from its reform efforts. Despite these restrictions, something developed in Hungary that occurred only much later, if ever, in the other communist countries. Hungarians realized that they could achieve a degree of freedom in the so-called “second economy,” in the gray areas of the official economy. These gray areas were [pageend47]46 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 greatly limited; according to no less an authority than János Kádár, for example, only 4% of the nation's economic production in 1987 came from the private sector. Another aspect of the Hungarian economy was to be of tremendous advantage to the nation, namely its openness. With a domestic market of only 10 million, there could be no thought of autarky. Hungary had to rely on both exports and imports because, quite simply, it was impossible to produce all the raw materials or finished goods the country needed, and exports were necessary to make mass production worthwhile. As a result, Hungary began to weave itself into the fabric of the Western economy during the 1970s. In the early 1980s — with the lessons of 1956, 1968 and 1981 still fresh in their minds — Hungarians seemed to have accepted their fate. They merely hoped to gain a bit more freedom within the confines of the communist system. In the second half of the decade, however, it became increasingly clear that the possibilities for piecemeal repairs of the grand communist edifice were exhausted. The question of the very survival of communism increasingly brought Kierkegaard's Either-Or to mind. We discovered, in other words, that there was no such thing as the “social market economy”: there was either socialism or the market economy. Likewise, there was no “socialist democracy”: there was either socialism or democracy. I have to admit that those of us who came to this realization in the mid- 1980s were rather pessimistic. We looked at the Soviet Union — with hundreds of thousands of Soviet troops in our country we could not ignore it — and had no reason to believe that it was about to loosen its hold on its empire. Remember Soviet policy towards Afghanistan, Cuba, Nicaragua, and El Salvador at this time. We looked, too, at our own government. Atop the governmental hierarchy of 800,000 bureaucrats and functionaries was János Kádár, the man who had hanged his legal predecessor for having declared that Hungary would withdraw from the Warsaw Pact. We knew we could not be victorious against these forces, and there was no sign whatsoever that the communist leadership wished to relinquish power of its own accord. Changes did occur, however, after the communists realized that they could not control the economic bankruptcy their policies had provoked. They realized that the populace would not continue to tolerate the steady decline in living standards that had begun several years earlier. They realized that Hungary would soon be unable to meet its debt payments and that the West would not extend new loans. They realized that they could preserve their power only by brute force and dictatorship. And they realized that resorting to force would make Hungary's isolation from the rest of Europe permanent. The authorities knew that Moscow had more than enough tanks to terrorize the populace, but they also knew that tanks would not cure the nation's economic ills. There was also the disciplined resolve and middle-class values of the Hungarian people. Four decades of communist doctrine had not induced the majority of the [pageend48]BUILDING A MARKET ECONOMY 47 nation to identify with the communist cause. Even many party members considered Marxism a necessary evil at best. So the communists initiated a plan designed to trade their political influence for economic control; that is, they decided to appropriate some of the country's most valuable assets as their private property “in exchange” for relaxing their hold on political power. Fortunately, they were not able to implement their self-enriching privatization plans on a grand scale. Before the party leaders and nomenklatura were able to assume legal title to a huge portion of state-owned property at absolutely no cost to themselves, the communist system collapsed. In Hungary's first free elections, held in the spring of 1990, the faction of the party still calling itself communist failed to gamer the 4% of votes required to enter parliament, and the “reform” communists who campaigned as the Hungarian Socialist Party received less than 10% of the vote. Since that time, disarray among the ranks of the old-style communists and so-called socialists has grown, and neither group now has any serious popular influence. The fall of the communist regime was, however, strictly a political victory. Now Hungary's democratic politicians must face the fact, as their communist predecessors eventually did, that it is much easier to overthrow a government than to build a prosperous economy. Unfortunately, the description of Hungary's current economic difficulties I offered earlier was by no means complete. What problems must the new democratic government tackle? First, the national debt. Meeting our loan payments requires that we withdraw between $1.5 and $2 billion from our economy annually. Hungary has not asked to be relieved of its financial commitments; on the contrary, the government has repeatedly affirmed its intention to repay its loans under all circumstances. If Hungary were to ask for debt relief, our obligations might be reduced by $5 or $10 billion, but we would then not receive the credit we need to transform our economy. Moreover, Hungary's debt, unlike Poland's, is owed primarily to private banks, and it is unlikely these institutions would be willing to write off our loans. From a moral perspective, Hungary has legitimate grounds for having its debts dismissed. The countries of Eastern Europe, after all, did not freely choose to participate in the Soviet sphere of economic influence. The West, on the other hand, endorsed Soviet ambitions by accepting the Yalta agreements. It is thus rather unfair that the nations surrendered to Soviet domination at Yalta should continue to bear the burden of an agreement in which they had no say. But, let me repeat, we in Hungary recognize that ethical standards do not necessarily apply in politics and economics. We discovered this painful truth in 1956. And so today we acknowledge that we have to meet our obligations, despite the economic pain caused by payments totalling several billion dollars annually, at a time when we must rebuild our entire economy. [pageend49]48 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 Under the communists, military production was the biggest sector of our industry. We must now reorient our economy towards the production of consumer goods. This task requires a tremendous capital outlay, as does the creation of an adequate social welfare system. During the communist era, unemployment did not exist officially. Anyone who remained without work for more than three months was threatened with imprisonment. Today, we have no choice but to allow scores of uncompetitive firms to go bankrupt, which will inevitably result in extensive unemployment. During this past January, the number of jobless grew by a third, to a total of 103,000. By the end of the year, there might be four or five times as many unemployed. Hungary's growing economic hardship today follows a six- to eight-year period of declining living standards. The GNP has shrunk during the past three years, and annual inflation stands at about 35%. According to recent statistics, a quarter of the population lives below the poverty line. Because of the recession, the city of Budapest, with two-million residents, has not been able to undertake construction of public housing for the past two years. In addition to the myriad economic obstacles that hinder the creation of a market economy in Hungary, there also exist fundamental legal problems. Quite simply, we must rewrite every law. For forty years, Hungary was ruled by a government that did not recognize market relations and was actively hostile to all free economic activity. Our legal system, as a result, is a wholly inadequate base for the introduction of a market economy. To overhaul the legal system, the Hungarian parliament needs to enact an average of two new pieces of legislation every week. Lawmakers in other democratic countries commonly have months or even years to consider and debate new laws. We simply don't have the time for such careful review of each proposed law. Nonetheless, the stakes are enormous. Within the next three to four years, the parliament has to reduce the share of government ownership in the economy from over 90% to less than 50%, that is, it must privatize some two trillion forint worth of assets within a few years time. History provides no precedent for a change of this magnitude. Faulty legislation could cost the nation tens of billions of forint. Many fundamental questions still need to be answered. Given the communist despoilation of private wealth, who is to benefit from privatization? To what extent should we allow foreigners to purchase assets in Hungary? Should privatization serve the interests of a broad middle class or rather those of a much narrower group possessing the capital resources necessary to compete with Western rivals? These questions can only be answered on the basis of a broad social consensus. The most difficult, even traumatic, of these questions is that of compensation for property confiscated during the communist government's unrelenting policy of nationalization from 1945 to 1962. Should the current government return property to its previous owners? If so, to what extent and to whom? The Smallholders' Party, one of the junior [pageend50]BUILDING A MARKET ECONOMY 49 partners in the governing coalition, argues above all for the return of confiscated land. But, if land is to be handed over to its previous owners, shouldn't we return apartment buildings, factories, shops, and businesses to their former owners as well? How are we to determine the value of assets seized forty years ago? What if, say, a factory has depreciated in value over the years? And what about buildings that were demolished at some point during the communist era or were sold to their tenants? These questions must be answered very quickly. Until property rights are clarified, foreign capital will not invest in Hungary. I, myself, am in favor of symbolic compensation. After forty years, it is impossible to reestablish previous conditions of ownership. Furthermore, not only the property-owning class, but all of Hungarian society suffered damages at the hands of the communists. Take, for instance, the workers who did not receive fair wages during the four decades Hungary was robbed by COMECON. They too are entitled to some form of compensation. But where is such compensation to come from? Given Hungary's $21 billion debt, I would argue that the proceeds of privatization [the selling off of state property] should first be used towards reducing the national debt and not for compensation. I think a majority of the population would support this action. I would also argue that we must open Hungary to foreign investment as quickly as possible; only through Western capital will we be able to meet our debt payments, to modernize our industry, to develop our infrastructure, and to create new jobs. The need for openness to foreign capital is all the greater because of the collapse of COMECON in the course of the past year. While Hungary has been able to negotiate hard-currency trade agreements with some former COMECON members, notably Czecho-Slovakia and the Soviet Union, other members of the former Eastern Bloc, like Bulgaria and Romania, are unwilling to take this step at the moment. The disappearance of the German Democratic Republic has been a serious blow to Hungary's foreign trade. Contracts with East German firms suddenly became invalid and since reunification, the former East Germany has considerably reduced its imports from Hungary in favor of West German products. At the same time, imports from the former East Germany must now be paid for in hard currency. Hungary had relied on East Germany for a number of goods and materials that are now no longer available or only on very unfavorable terms. Hungary does not have an auto industry, for example, and has long imported cars from East Germany. In the past year, the price of those cars has suddenly tripled due to dollar-based accounting. The cost of replacement parts has increased even more drastically. A similar situation has developed in our trade with the Soviet Union. Since the Soviets are now paying in hard currency, they are buying far less from us. Exports to the Soviet Union dropped by about 50% in the past year. Many of the goods we produce were designed to meet specific Soviet requirements and, as such, can be sold elsewhere only with the greatest difficulty, even after [pageend51]50 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 dramatic price reductions. Consequently, a growing number of Hungarian firms are facing bankruptcy; firms that have catered to the low standards of the Soviet market for the past forty years simply cannot be expected to break into world markets overnight. Agriculture had once been one of the most successful sectors of the Hungarian economy, but today, thanks to the collapse of trade within the Eastern Bloc, it is in deep crisis. Hungary was the only country to export large quantities of food within COMECON. Because of the unending food shortages elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc, Hungary was constantly under pressure to concentrate its exports to this group of countries. Now, however, our former COMECON partners can offer us neither hard currency nor quality products in exchange for the foodstuffs we produce. For well-known reasons, we cannot counterbalance lost trade in the East with increased agricultural exports to the West. The only way to respond to this combination of economic catastrophes is by “escaping forward.” We need, first and foremost, to implement a liberal policy towards imports to assure that Hungarian industry will become truly competitive. Today, most products can be brought freely into Hungary. Secondly, we must radically reduce subsidies for our exports. Hungary is still supporting agricultural exports with a 30% subsidy, which, incidentally, is considerably less than the export subsidies Western European governments currently pay their farmers. Subsidies for exports to the Soviet Union have — for all intents and purposes — come to an end. Because many Soviet customers were not able to pay their bills, Hungary's Ministry of International Economic Relations imposed the requirement of an export permit for each shipment to the Soviet Union. Exports to the Soviet Union subsequently fell off dramatically. Of course, Hungary is not eager to lose its hard-won share of the Soviet market, but we simply cannot continue sending goods to customers who can't pay for them. Not surprisingly, this policy has caused political tensions. The Soviets complain of Hungarian “ingratitude ” because we will not send them all they want without prior payment. But consider the practical consequences. Last year, Hungarian firms shipped $800 million worth of goods to the Soviet Union; generally, payment was not received from the Soviets until six months or a year after delivery of the goods. Thus, while we were forced to take out loans in international credit markets under extremely stringent terms, the Soviets were in effect receiving $800 million in free credit. Political changes have compounded the effects of the collapse of COMECON. As a member of the Warsaw Pact, Hungary manufactured weapons for other Pact members and procured weapons for itself from within the Pact. Military exports before the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact brought in an estimated 20 billion forints annually; last year, by contrast, military exports amounted to one tenth that figure. Furthermore, our own defense needs require that we purchase communications and security systems not manufactured in the Soviet [pageend52]BUILDING A MARKET ECONOMY 51 Union, an additional hard currency expenditure. I need not mention that there is not a single Hungarian who would have preferred that we had remained part of the Pact. All factors considered, our situation is much more difficult than was Spam's when it made the transition from dictatorship to democracy. Despite certain obfuscatory policies, Spain had more or less a market economy during the Franco era. In Eastern Europe, we face the twofold task of simultaneously creating market economies and building democratic political systems. However, despite all the aforementioned difficulties, I believe that Hungary stands better placed than the other Eastern European nations toward achieving this goal. Two decades of “reform” communism were, to an extent, a useful preparation for the transformation now underway. The population was able to become acquainted with certain aspects of market relations and was allowed to experiment with free enterprise within certain limits. The legal situation in Hungary is also comparatively clearer than in the other Eastern European countries. In the past year, half of all Western investment in Eastern Europe went to Hungary, the smallest country in the region. I suspect, Westerners regard investing in Eastern Europe an adventure comparable to the travels of a Marco Polo or a Columbus; from their perspective, Hungary is probably the least risky area for investment because, if nothing else, the natives are not as unpredictable as elsewhere. The past year has also seen Hungarian companies get a foothold in the world market. The country accumulated a large trade surplus despite the loss of exports to the Near East and increased oil prices due to the Gulf War. In the second half of last year as many joint ventures were established as those which had previously existed. While most of the investment is concentrated in the service sector and does not involve large amounts of capital, some leading multinationals — General Electric, General Motors, and Suzuki among others — have started to invest in Hungary. The country is making great efforts to modernize its infrastructure. Siemens and Ericson will build one million telephone lines within three to four years, and negotiations are also underway with Italian and Austrian firms to build highways. One of our most important long-range goals is to reduce our energy dependency on the Soviet Union. We would prefer to receive a greater percentage of our crude oil from the Near East instead of relying on the more and more erratic Soviet supply. A significant proportion of the working capital which is invested in Hungary comes to Budapest, which of course I as the city's mayor welcome. Given the city's location and history it is well positioned to serve as the gateway to the East and West respectively. [pageend53]52 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 The political orientation of the city is liberal. Of the 22 district mayors, 21 are liberal politicians in favor of free enterprise and foreign investment. After four decades of communist rule, the city is in a terrible state of disrepair. Tens of thousands of apartment buildings need to be renovated, new roads and traffic belts need to be built, and major investments have to be made to deal with air-pollution, sewage treatment, waste disposal and recycling. We must build bridges, super trams, possibly additional metro lines, not to mention hotels, business centers, and offices. Without foreign investment very little can be done. Let me say in concluding that, despite all our difficulties, Hungarians are well aware that our situation is far from hopeless. Our country has regained its independence and political sovereignty. We have no insolvable hostilities with our neighbors, merely resolvable conflicts. Our interests are the same as those of the Western European nations and our Czech, Slovak, and Polish neighbors: to join together as soon as possible in a united Europe. [pageend54]RUSSIA interview With VIKTOR KOGAN-YASNY Viktor Kogan-Yasny is a consultant to the Committee for Human Rights of the Russian parliament. He was interviewed for Uncaptive Minds by Egidijus Meilunas, a Lithuanian journalist. DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS: A FULL-TIME JOB UM What are the main issues of concern to the Committee for Human Rights ? KOGAN-YASNY The creation of a committee to deal with human rights issues by the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR was an unprecedented act. For decades, Soviet dissidents and Western human rights organizations fought to defend basic human rights in the USSR. It is, therefore, of enormous significance that the head of the committee, Sergei Kovalev, is a former political prisoner: he was released in 1984 after having served ten years of hard labor. We face two main problems. First, we must deal with the vestiges of totalitarianism in the Soviet legal system. The system set out to destroy the individual completely; the repression of dissidents was only one manifestation of this effort. Today dissidents are no longer subject to repression, but the personality-crushing system still exists. There are currendy 700,000 people serving sentences in Russian prisons. No doubt many are indeed guilty of having committed crimes, but many others were unjustly or illegally [pageend55]54 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 sentenced. Prisoners are often tortured or otherwise brutally treated. Even after their release, many prisoners find it virtually impossible to return to normal society. They have tremendous difficulties finding a job, and remain marked for the rest of their lives. Though they have the same rights as the rest of society under law, the courts are not willing to address their grievances. So, many former prisoners turn to our committee; they have no one else to turn to, nobody else will defend them. UM And the second problem ? KOGAN-YASNY The lack of specialists and of professionalism. The level of legal culture in Soviet society is very low. In a country where lawlessness prevails, legal culture cannot develop. So committee members try to investigate each case thoroughly and are constantly visiting prisons, camps, and courts. Our activities are unfortunately not very well organized, and I am not sure they have produced any tangible results yet. I have to say that the Gulag system still exists. We have therefore formed a subcommittee on penal institutions. But we need both legal and financial support. And to correct abuses, we need new prisons. Conditions in Soviet prisons are so terrible only the very healthy and the very strong-willed can endure imprisonment. UM With the collapse of the Soviet empire, refugees have become a major problem. Many are heading to Moscow. Has your committee tried to deal with this human flood? KOGAN-YASNY We have created a subcommittee to find a solution to the refugee problem. Hundreds of thousands of individuals are fleeing to Russia from other republics as a result of ethnic conflicts. I can't give you an exact number because nobody is keeping track. The political situation is very complicated, to say the least, and we need a pragmatic solution more than ever. All these hundreds of thousands of people need to be provided with food, housing, and employment. Most leave their homes with only their most necessary belongings, while many arrive completely empty-handed. Caring for these people is a new responsibility for the Russian republic. [pageend56]DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS 55 UM You mentioned that the repression of dissidents has ended. But are there still political prisoners in Russia? KOGAN-YASNY In a sense, all of us living in a totalitarian state are prisoners. At present, 16 people are imprisoned in Perm camp number 35 for political crimes such as “betrayal of the motherland.” By our figuring, they ought to be released. Article 70 of the Soviet Criminal Code, the clause making “anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda” illegal, has been repealed. But we do not know how many people previously convicted under Article 70 are still serving sentences. [pageend57]Photo: Aleksandr Belenky Squatters on Red Square, Moscow, October 1990. [pageend58]RUSSIA RUSSIAN POLITICS FROM LEFT TO RIGHT by Agnieszka Magdziak-Miszewska The following article appeared in the February 1991 issue of the Polish monthly Res Publica. Ms. Magdziak- Miszewska heads the Independent Center for International Studies in Warsaw. In 1985, at the beginning of the process that was later to become known as perestroika, Russian politics, aside from the official kind, did not — for all practical purposes — exist. In fact, Russia itself, which was perceived inside and outside the Soviet Union as the strongest link in the communist chain, did not exist. This is not to say that before perestroika there was no political ferment whatsoever in the largest republic of the Soviet Union; nevertheless, the various political groups, the dissidents, and the samizdat movement were almost without exception confined to the intellectual and cultural elites of the large cities. The political debates that took place in the kitchens of Moscow and Leningrad had virtually no effect on society at large. Russian society, to a far greater degree than in the non-Russian republics, was fragmented, a mishmash of groups and interests which Russian sociologists like to call “kasha.” Communism had been extremely effective in severing all natural social links and destroying all attempts at organization from below. The non-Russian republics suffered through communism as well, but there was a difference: the communist system was perceived as something imposed by a foreign power. The communists' brutal attempts to destroy all feelings of national and cultural solidarity outside of Russia ultimately failed. National sentiment, anticommunism, and anti-Russian feelings all contributed to social integration in the non-Russian republics. The popular fronts that arose in the republics over [pageend59]58 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 the last few years quickly became national fronts. Slogans in support of glas- nost and perestroika were quickly replaced with demands for sovereignty and even independence. The national reawakening that swept through the republics took political, economic, and cultural issues and spread them from the confines of elite circles to the broad forum of public opinion. This hasn't been the case in Russia. After all, the victory of communism was the work of the Russians themselves. Paradoxically, however, the system that made them masters of the empire deprived them of their homeland. All links with the culture of old Russia were severed — so completely, as I was told at a recent meeting of a democratic teachers' group, that the way of life described in Pushkin's Eugene Onegin is every bit as exotic and incomprehensible for Russian students today as it is for their counterparts in Bukhara or Alma-Ata. Russians have been raised to consider themselves citizens of the Soviet Union (as one popular song puts it, “My address has no house nor street, my address is the Soviet Union”), and this is precisely the way the younger generation feels. What, after all, are they supposed to identify with? A religion that has been reviled and ridiculed? A falsified history and literature in which the few positive prerevolutionary elements are treated merely as forerunners of the great revolution? As far as the outside world is concerned, Russia as such does not exist either: it has no representative of its own at the UN, unlike Ukraine or Byelorussia; and in the West, the words “Moscow” and “Kremlin” are synonymous. In Russia itself, Russian history and culture began to be mentioned only at the beginning of the 1980s. At that time, several young intellectuals founded an underground group with the aim of preserving historical Russian monuments and reclaiming falsified Russian history. Because its principal task was the “preservation of memory,” it became known as Pamyat (Memory). Unfortunately, these laudable goals were all but forgotten after the group was taken over by xenophobic nationalists like Dmitri Vasilev and Igor Shafarevich in 1985. As a result of Pamyat's rabid nationalism and anti-Semitism, Russian democrats began to shun words as innocent as “patriotism” for fear of being identified with the likes of Pamyat's members. As a result of this “Pamyat syndrome,” the word “Russia” has rarely figured in the manifestoes and political programs of the numerous Russian organizations, clubs, and groups that have been established since the late 1980s. Towards the Formation of Political Parties Political life in Russia began with the formation of various political clubs and discussion forums. In 1987 the two most important such groups were Democratic Perestroika and Moscow Tribune. They brought together people from a wide range of professions holding various political views, from anticommunists to party reformers. While Tribune was an elitist group, Demo[pageend60]RUSSIAN POLITICS FROM LEFT TO RIGHT 59 cratic Perestroika gave rise to the first Russian party with branches across the entire Soviet Union, the Democratic Union. This party, headed by Valeriya Novodvorskaya [who was imprisoned in March 1991 for “anti-Soviet activities”] and Aleksandr Podrabinek, adopted a platform at its founding congress in 1988 which speaks, among other things, of the need to eliminate the CPSU from the country's political life and of the republics' right to determine their own fate. The party has two newspapers, Svobodnoe Slovo and Express-Khronika, a veritable gold mine of information about new organizations, demonstrations, and arrests. From 1987 to 1989, the Democratic Union was the main organizer of anti-CPSU demonstrations and other protests. Its leaders, the first to lose all illusions about perestroika, accused Gorbachev of attempting to save totalitarianism almost from the beginning. For a long time, the Democratic Union was the only political party of note. Russian opposition activists preferred to form clubs and associations, because the word “party” was tainted: in the USSR, the word is associated with only a single organization. This psychological barrier was crossed only in 1989, after elections to the Supreme Soviet were held and the Interregional Group of People's Deputies, which fulfilled the role of a parliamentary opposition, was formed. Since then, the Russian political scene has been flooded with a wave of new political parties and groups which have been springing up, dissolving, and splitting apart virtually on a daily basis. In many cases, parties no longer exist by the time their programs or manifestoes appear in print. Thus, in writing about Russia's political landscape, I will present only those parties that have in some way distinguished themselves in political life — which, of course, does not mean that they still exist or have not split up, merged with other parties, or changed their programs or names. My description of the Russian political landscape will use the standard division of the political spectrum into right, center, and left — not the division that predominates in the description of Soviet politics, where the right wing refers to hard-line communists and the left wing usually to anti-communists. The Left Without a doubt, the most left-wing party on the Russian scene is the Russian Communist Party (also called the Party of True Bolsheviks), founded in 1990. Its leaders, Nina Andreeva and Boris Gidaspov, not only accuse Gorbachev of having betrayed communism and the principles of Marxism-Leninism, but openly defend Stalinism. The party, based primarily in Leningrad, has about 200 members. After Ivan Polozhkov became party head, the Communist Party of Russia emerged as the primary antireformist force in Russia. This party's represen- [pageend61]Photo: Aleksandr Belenky Lenin watches over children in a music class. [pageend62]Photo: Aleksandr Belenky Leningrad Punks [pageend63]62 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 tatives to the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Republic are the core of the anti- Yeltsin, antidemocratic opposition. Despite the defection of several members recently, the party continues to wield a great deal of influence. The Marxist Platform is a faction of the CPSU which groups together communists who reject Stalinism and who want to reform the party on “Marxist principles.” The United Front of Working People is a communist organization formed by the nomenklatura in heavy industry in response to the rise of the various strike committees. Its slogans call for the transfer of power to workers' councils and a struggle with corruption, privileges, and the black market. It supports the revival of Leninist principles in social, economic, and political life. Its leaders oppose privatization because it represents “bourgeois ideology and the surrender of workers' property to the hands of imperialist Western capital. ’ ’ A similar group is the Union of Russian Agricultural Workers, which seeks to unite the managers of collective farms. It opposes the private ownership of land while demanding economic and financial independence for state- owned farms. The Confederation of Anarcho-Syndicalists, founded in 1989, brings together various anarchist organizations and parties. Its central doctrine is the radical decentralization of power, and it favors “socially-owned” (as opposed to state- or privately-owned) property, the liquidation of all parties and political groups, the disbanding of the military and the police, the elimination of all special privileges, and social protection for society's weakest members. Its leaders base their views on the theories of the 19th-century anarchist Bakunin. Its main publications are Obshchina, Volya, Zdorovyj Smysl, and Nabat. The Socialist Party's principal aim is to create a new society based on self-government and democratic socialism “together with all democratically inclined left-wing forces.” It opposes all forms of monopoly (both political and economic) and unemployment, and is for strict controls of foreign investment. It believes the government's chief concern should be the defense of all working people. Boris Kagarlitsky is the party's leader and the editor of its paper Povorot na Levo. The Social-Democratic Party of Russia, which, among other parties, was formed by activists of the Democratic Perestroika Club, identifies with the traditions of Western social democratic parties. Its main goals are the creation of a civil society and a democratic parliamentary system, the granting of equal rights to all forms of ownership, and the maintenance of a social safety net for those most vulnerable. The Social-Democratic Party of Russia is one of the republic's most influential parties at present. Its leaders, Oleg Rumyantsev, Pavel Kodyukin, and Aleksandr Obolensky, are some of Boris Yeltsin's closest advisers. [pageend64]RUSSIAN POLITICS FROM LEFT TO RIGHT 63 The Radical Society for Peace and Freedom calls for the rapid dismantling of the Soviet empire and the elimination of the government and “all its organs.” It also advocates the abolition of all forms of monopoly, the legalization of narcotics, the elimination of all forms of censorship, and a universal amnesty for prisoners. In the spring of 1990, the Society gave rise to two new parties, the Radical Party and the Libertarian Party. The Center The largest and most important party of the democratic center is Nikolai Travkin's Democratic Party of Russia, founded in May 1990. Its paper, Demokraticheskaya Rossiya, is the most popular newspaper in the republic. The party's principal goal is the revival of a democratic, sovereign Russian government based on a parliamentary system. The party holds that the government should serve all its citizens regardless of their beliefs and should not espouse any ideology. It favors a market economy, equal rights for all forms of ownership, and a multiparty system. It staunchly opposes all forms of totalitarianism, nationalism, chauvinism, and religious, political, and racial discrimination. The Democratic-Constitutional Party, founded in the spring of 1990, views itself as a continuation of the prerevolutionary Kadet party. It opposes state monopolies of any type and the use of force to solve political disagreements. It believes that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights should serve as the basis for a new legal system, and that the only limitation on individual rights should be the rights of other individuals. The party favors the establishment of political, social, and economic pluralism. At present, it is one of the few parties to emphasize its ties to the political traditions of prerevolutionary Russia. The party's mouthpiece is Grazhdanskij Yezhenedelnik. The Citizens' Alliance in the Struggle for a Sovereign Republic of Rus was founded in 1988 in Leningrad. Its leaders call themselves national democrats striving for the spiritual, cultural, and political rebirth of Russia, and they make a point of distancing themselves from nationalism and anti-Semitism. They want the Russian state to be a parliamentary democracy. The Liberal-Democratic Party, headed by Vladimir Zhyrinovsky, upholds Western traditions. Its primary goals are the creation of a parliamentary democracy and a free market economy combined with the elimination of the welfare state. Igor Korovikov's Free Labor Party unites owners and employees of private businesses. Its goal is the restoration of private property and free competition. The two largest Christian-democratic parties, headed by Aleksandr Ogorodnikov and Father Gleb Yakunin, also belong to the political center. [pageend65]64 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 Despite differences on certain issues, they are united in their desire for the spiritual rebirth of the Russian people, the restoration of Christian principles in the life of society, and the creation of a democratic, pluralistic society. The Right The least conservative group on this side of Russia's political spectrum is the Society of Landowners, founded in May 1990. The Society represents surviving members of noble and aristocratic families. Its goal is the commemoration and revival of Russia's noble traditions. Father Andrei Golitsyn is the Society's chairman. Among the growing number of monarchist parties, the most right-wing is the Orthodox Monarchist Order-Union, which is headed by Sergei Engelgard-Yurkov. The party's goal is the restoration of the prerevolutionary order and the return of the Romanovs to power. Members of the Union hark back to the 19th-century Slavophile tradition in calling for curbs on Western cultural and economic influences. Without a doubt, the most extreme position on the Russian right today is represented by Pamyat and the related Leningrad-based Alliance of Patriots. These movements' ideology is largely based on conspiracy theories. Naturally, the ring leaders of these conspiracies against Russia are the Jews and Freemasons. Pamyat presents itself as a defender of Russian Orthodoxy and monarchic traditions. Its “action committees,” or vigilante squads, are modeled after the Black Hundred. As can be seen from this incomplete survey the political scene in Russia today is diverse and wide-ranging. Nonetheless, aside from the communist and social democratic parties and the Democratic Party of Russia, Russian political parties have little real impact on Russian society, let alone national politics. It seems that Ilya Zaslavsky is correct when he writes (in Demokraticheskaya Rossiya no. 4, October 1990) that the parties came into being prematurely. Because Russia has yet to break with totalitarianism, parties should be seen as a thing of the future. What the current situation demands is a broad alliance of all anticommunist forces that would aim to change the system and build a normal, democratic state. In order to achieve this goal, the reconstruction of Russian society will also be necessary. * Towards Civil Society One of the organizations most responsible for rousing Russian society from its moral and political lethargy is Memorial. Founded by a group of historians and journalists, the group rapidly became a mass social movement uniting people from many different classes and professions. At Memorial's founding meet[pageend66]RUSSIAN POLITICS FROM LEFT TO RIGHT 65 ing in January 1989, Andrei Sakharov was named honorary chairman. For many Russians, participation in Memorial-organized demonstrations, the collection of signatures for petitions and resolutions, and especially the recording of their own memories and documentation of Stalinist crimes were their first lessons in freedom, self-reliance, and democracy. The elections to the Supreme Soviet in 1989 and to the republican and local soviets in 1990 were themselves an important lesson in politics. At that time, the voters' clubs movement came into being, the first mass-scale, spontaneously created popular organizations in Russia. The movement had neither fixed organizational structures nor a strict program. The clubs were formed at the local level, bringing together people of different opinions, educational attainments, ages, and social classes. What united them was their hatred for the party apparatus and nomenklatura, their sympathy for democracy, and their rejection of extremist political views. The extent of the movement and the self- organizational mode in which it arose surprised everyone in Russia. Virtually overnight the movement became a significant political force, causing candidates to alter their political programs and wage authentic election campaigns. Prior to local elections, the voters' clubs joined with other democratic parties and groups to create a common electoral platform called Democratic Russia. The group's inaugural congress, which took place in Moscow on October 19-21, 1990, led to the foundation of a coalition with a common program of radical economic and political reforms aimed at the establishment of a sovereign Russia. For observers of the Russian political scene, the evolution of the strike movement was an even greater surprise than the appearance of the voters' clubs. During the August 1989 strikes, Russian coal miners demonstrated not only their courage and determination, but also their ability to organize themselves and rapidly master the rules of democracy. The Confederation of Working People, formed on May 2, 1989 from the various strike committees and workers' organizations, has since become an organization to be reckoned with. The Confederation, whose primary goal is the defense of workers' rights in the face of a monopolistic state employer, unambiguously supports a market economy and democratic political changes. It is worth noting that this group does not have a purely working-class outlook: its members emphasize the intelligentsia's role in fighting totalitarianism and its significance in building a normal, democratic system. In many industrial regions of Russia, particularly the Kuznetsk Basin and Vorkuta, the Confederation has become a de facto alternative to the local authorities. Further proof of the politicization of Russian society are the results of elections to city councils in the two largest cities in the Russian republic, Moscow and Leningrad, which are now controlled by democrats. [pageend67]UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 The New Russia Russia has rapidly transformed itself from the strongest link in the chain to the driving force for democratic change in the Soviet Union today. Boris jltsin's victory in elections to the republic's parliament and the June 1990 vereignty declaration have ushered in a new era in the republic's history, all appearances, the new Russia wants to be a truly democratic country the European mode. Yet its future is far from decided. The acute economic isis — empty shelves and factories that are literally falling apart — threatens become a source of social conflict. Nor has the authoritarian mentality dis- ipeared. How could it? Popular habits and stereotypes die hard. The habits passivity and irresponsibility, together with a deeply rooted egalitarian tra- iion, may prove to be a powerful drag on the reform process. Social conscious- ss — a factor long dismissed as subjective and therefore “unscientific” — s now become the subject of in-depth studies and analyses. It is still too early to know anything for sure about Russian society, but rat we already can see is surprising and interesting: the decline of the empire d the rebirth of sovereignty have not led to the resurgence of Great Russian iperialist consciousness on a mass scale; and despite 70 years of communist doctrination, the Russians have been able to reject ideology and begin the ocess of re-creating civil society. In building a new identity, the Russians e reaching back to the best of their democratic traditions, which were bru- lly interrupted by the October Revolution. [pageend68]UKRAINE POLITICAL PARTIES IN UKRAINE by Taras Kuzio Taras Kuzio works for the Ukrainian Press Agency in London. He wrote the following survey for Uncaptive Minds. Political pluralism and civil society have been growing quickly in Ukraine in recent years. Parties, covering the political spectrum from far left to far right, are now actively competing for popular support. Though none of these parties existed before the elections to the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet in March 1990, they will play an important role in the next round of elections. Below is a brief description of the most important parties presently on the political scene. Among the first of the independent groups established in Ukraine was the Ukrainian Helsinki Union (UHU). UHU saw itself as a successor to the Ukrainian Public Group to Promote the Implementation of the Helsinki Accords, which had been formed in November 1976. Like many of the groups that came into being during 1988-89, UHU championed goals that predated the Gorbachev era, including democracy and respect for human rights. Levko Lukianenko, who had been a prisoner of conscience for over a quarter of a century, was elected leader of UHU in 1988. In an essay entitled “What Next?” written that winter, Lukianenko described Ukraine as “crucified, pillaged, russified, and torn,” and went on to argue that the fate of Ukraine was bound up with the fortunes of perestroika. “The continuation of pre-perestroika policies,” he wrote, “would mean the total assimilation and destruction of our nation.” Acting on the belief that perestroika could succeed only with the support of the Ukrainian people, UHU encouraged the public to participate in the re[pageend69]68 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 structuring process. Fear was a formidable obstacle to mass participation, but the situation soon began to change. “The number of people who dare to speak the truth,” Lukianenko observed, “is growing; more and more, people are willing to sign petitions, participate in demonstrations, and join independent groups.” Lukianenko himself did not shy away from making clear his belief that independence would be “the most favorable condition,” for Ukraine, but he continued to emphasize that the first goal of UHU was to defend the rights of Ukrainian citizens and to bring cultural issues, particularly the language question, to the fore. UHU issued its “Declaration of Principles” during the summer of 1988. Written by Vyacheslav Chomovil along with Mykhailo and Bohdan Horyn, this text reflected a tactical compromise. By moderating its demands, UHU hoped to win broad support from a public still reluctant to push for radical change. The text explains that UHU was not a political party, but rather an organization seeking to encourage popular participation in the governing of the nation. UHU was also, in the words of the Declaration, “a federative union of self-governing human rights groups and organizations.” In other words, UHU saw itself as a de facto popular front uniting a broad range of individuals and groups opposed to the communist party. UHU scheduled its first congress for November 1989, but repeatedly postponed it. Among the reasons behind the decision to postpone the congress were, first, the founding of the Ukrainian Popular Movement and, second, the campaign for the elections to the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet. Many UHU members were critical of the decision to postpone the congress until April 1990; some asserted that the Declaration of Principles had lost its “radical edge,” and that, as a result, UHU had given up its position at the forefront of political and social change in Ukraine. The 495 delegates who attended the April 1990 congress represented 2,300 members, 190 centers of activity, and 28 local UHU branches, including two outside Ukraine. At the time of the congress, UHU was in effect the only independent party operating throughout the entire republic and the leading sponsor of independent publications. The congress voted to rename the organization the Ukrainian Republican Party (URP). Levko Lukianenko was reelected chairman, and Stepan Khmara and Hryhoriy Hrebeniuk vice chairmen. The URP has subsequently adopted a radical program that calls for full independence for Ukraine. Russian imperialism and chauvinism, the party maintains, are the “greatest dangers threatening the existence of the Ukrainian nation.” In addition to its call for a new constitution and the creation of a parliamentary democracy, the URP has declared its support for a number of specific reform measures: the depolitization of the judiciary, military, and police; the reappropriation of property held by the communist party; measures to protect the environment; the creation of a Ukrainian central bank along with the development of a commercial banking sector; and the introduction of a Ukrainian [pageend70]POLITICAL PARTIES IN UKRAINE 69 currency. As for the new union treaty, the URP considers it invalid because the government that signed it was itself illegitimate. Stepan Khmara has emerged as one of the URP's most vocal critics of the communist party and its most outspoken advocate of independence. In August 1990, for example, Khmara described the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet as “not a parliament, but a protoparliament,” and pointed out that although it provided the opposition with a forum for elaborating its views, real power remains firmly in communist hands. In late 1988, members of the creative intelligentsia, in particular the Ukrainian Writers' Union, began to organize a popular front, which was to call itself the Ukrainian Popular Movement for Restructuring, commonly known as Rukh. The communist party was intensely critical from the outset. The program Rukh published in February 1989, however, was very moderate, recognizing the “leading role of the party” and proclaiming as its objective “a demonstration of support for the revolutionary restructuring the party has set in motion.” The program went on to explain that Rukh aimed for a “new coalition of communists and nonparty members united in a struggle for fundamental social renewal in all spheres of public, governmental, and economic life in the Ukrainian SSR.” Rukh described itself as “a unifying link between the program of restructuring proposed by the party and the initiatives of the broad masses of the people.” Rukh announced it would put forward candidates in elections, propose legislation, and sponsor polls, as well as attempt to mobilize public opinion through demonstrations and similar activities. Other areas of concern were the promotion of Ukrainian culture and the defense of human rights. At its inaugural congřess in October 1989, Rukh endorsed the creation of a sovereign Ukrainian state that would carry on relations with other republics of the USSR on the basis of a new union treaty. This was a year and a half before Gorbachev himself finally called for a new union treaty. At its second congress in October 1990, Rukh's official program underwent substantial changes. Since a number of the positions put forward in the original Rukh program had subsequently been adopted by the communists, many activists decided that the time had arrived for Rukh to move ahead. The congress thus ratified the decision by the Grand Council of Rukh to drop the expression “for restructuring” from the organization's formal name. Rukh now declared that its principal objective was nothing less than to reestablish an independent, democratic Ukrainian state through nonviolent means. The congress rejected the idea of a new union treaty or even Ukrainian membership in a loose confederation. As one Rukh activist explained, “we realize that the only way out of the current crisis is to get out of the Soviet Union.” The congress also voted to deny membership to all members of political parties whose main base lay outside Ukraine, an unmistakable allusion to the communist party that underscored the change in Rukh's objectives. [pageend71]70 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 The Ukrainian People's Democratic Party, which began as the Ukrainian branch of the Russian Democratic Union, takes Britain's Conservative Party as its model. Under the name Ukrainian Democratic Union (UDU), this group had approximately 100 active members in Kiev, Dniepropetrovsk, Odessa, Kharkov and Rivne by the end of 1988. UDU scheduled its first congress for January 22-23, 1989, intending it to coincide with the anniversary of Ukraine's 1918 declaration of independence, but the communist authorities prevented the congress from taking place. Soon thereafter, it decided to end its association with the Russian Democratic Union and to establish itself as an independent organization. To signal this change, the group renamed itself the Ukrainian People's Democratic League (UPDL) in February 1989. It also sought to distinguish itself from the Ukrainian Helsinki Union. From the outset, the UPDL was an avowedly political group and unabashedly opposed to Marxism-Leninism. This self-acknowledged ideological orientation, the UPDL argued, clearly set it apart from the fundamentally apolitical UHU. In the summer of 1990, the organization underlined its political aspirations by renaming itself the Ukrainian People's Democratic Party. The Ukrainian Christian Democratic Front (UCDF) was formed in November 1988 under the leadership of two former political prisoners, Vasyl and Petro Sichko. The UCDF was founded in western Ukraine and draws most of its support from the Ukrainian Catholic regions there (Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Temopil). The highly developed national consciousness in western Ukraine and the region's ties to Western Europe provided a strong base for the Christian democratic movement. At the first meeting of the UCDF in January 1989, a program was drafted that declared communism incapable of solving the problems confronting Ukraine. Only by strengthening religious values, the program argued, could Ukrainian society overcome the current crisis. The program went on to demand religious freedom for all Christian denominations, an end to mandatory instruction in atheism in schools, and recognition of the rights of conscientious objectors. In addition to issues bearing upon matters of conscience, the UCDF program addressed the most pressing social, political, economic, and environmental problems confronting Ukraine. The positions the UCDF put forward were much more varied and distinctly more radical than those of any other independent group active at the time, including the Ukrainian Helsinki Union. Despite the hostility of the authorities, the UCDF was able to strengthen its position considerably toward the end of its first year. The de facto legalization of the Ukrainian Catholic Church in the winter of 1989-1990 was a tremendous boost to the group. Its authority was further bolstered by its stance during the elections to local councils and to the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet in March 1990. The UCDF called for a boycott of the elections, maintaining that, “No genuine elections can take place so long as Ukraine is an occupied territory.” (The elections were held despite the boycott, and non-communist candidates won an overwhelming victory in western Ukraine.) [pageend72]POLITICAL PARTIES IN UKRAINE 71 A tangible sign of the UCDF's success during its first year of activity is the rapid growth it enjoyed. Some 200 delegates representing a membership of over 2,000 attended the UCDF's second congress in April 1990; only 9 delegates had participated at the first gathering a year earlier. Young people are especially conspicuous in the UCDF's growing membership, a fact particularly encouraging to the organization's leadership. Among the decisions agreed upon at the second congress was to rename the UCDF; it is now known as the Ukrainian Christian Democratic Party. The prospect of elections brought representatives of 43 independent groups to Kiev on November 18, 1989. There, they decided to join together in a coalition called the Democratic Bloc and to contest the elections with a common program. The program they drafted consisted primarily of a critical description of the situation in Ukraine. After five years, Gorbachev's perestroika had proven to be a failure, the representatives proclaimed, and the time had come to decide whether Ukraine would become sovereign and independent or remain subject to the central authorities. Currently, they continued, there are no political or legal safeguards to prevent a return to Stalinist or Brezhnevite neo-Stalinist policies. The Democratic Bloc thus announced its support for “real political and economic sovereignty for Ukraine” and called on the populace to reject the communists and the ruin they had inflicted on Ukraine. With its critique of political and social conditions in Ukraine, the Democratic Bloc effectively set the agenda for the elections, and its program was to become the basis for the 1990 Declaration of Sovereignty. Similarly centrist in general orientation is the Ukrainian Democratic Peasants' Party (UDPP), which was formed in March 1990. In its first appeal to the nation, the UDPP described the rural population as the most vulnerable stratum of society. The appeal points out that rural labor is poorly re numerated, that rural standards of living are often frightfully low, and that the children of peasant families do not have the same access to higher education as children in urban areas. While the UDPP proclaimed its intention to defend peasant interests in its inaugural appeal, the program it adopted at its first congress, held on June 9, 1990, appealed to a broader audience. Membership was to be extended to urban workers as well as rural dwellers. Among the UDPP's goals were the transfer of land to peasant ownership and the creation of an independent and democratic Ukraine. Valery Moshkovsky, a member of the Kiev city council, took the lead in launching the Ukrainian Liberal Democratic Party (ULDP), in the summer of 1990. Noting the failure of all socialist reform efforts, the ULDP describes itself in its founding charter as adhering to the democratic and humanistic tenets of the European liberal tradition. It emphasizes the rights of individuals and the need for economic freedom. The fundamental objective of Ukrainian independence common to the centrist parties is shared by the small group of right-wing parties that have arisen [pageend73]72 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 in western Ukraine. The Ukrainian National Party (UNP) was established in October 1989 by Hryhoriy Pryhodko, a former prisoner of conscience and frequent critic of the Ukrainian Helsinki Union. The UNP maintains an avowedly “maximalist” position and refuses all cooperation with the “occupying power.” It demands, first and foremost, Ukrainian independence and the removal of all “occupation troops” from Ukrainian territory. Harkening back to the Ukrainian National Republic of 1917, it calls for the abrogation of the treaties making Ukraine part of the Soviet Union and for Western recognition of Ukraine's colonial status. The UNP was the principal sponsor of the Interparty Assembly, which brought together radical groups in June 1990. These groups all refused to have anything to do with the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet and denounced Rukh as ‘ ‘collaborationist” and altogether too moderate. The primary goal of the Interparty Assembly has been to register citizens of the future Ukrainian National Republic. When half the Ukrainian population is registered, the Interparty Assembly intends to call a “Citizens' Congress” to elect a government whose first act will be to declare Ukraine's independence. By the end of 1990, over one million individuals had been registered. The Interparty Assembly has also played a prominent part in supporting strikes: the Kiev Strike Committee, for instance, operates from the Interparty Assembly's offices. While the Interparty Assembly can claim an impressive number of participating groups, only two of the affiliated groups — the UNP and the Ukrainian People's Democratic Party — have broad popular bases. The others have received very limited support and do not exercise significant influence in Ukrainian political life. Tensions within the Interparty Assembly became evident during its third session, held in December 1990, when many of these less prominent groups signaled their discontent with the UNP. Charged with “undemocratic behavior” by a majority of the delegates, the UNP, led by Hryhoriy Pryhodko, walked out of the session. Like the UNP, the Federation for Ukrainian State Independence (FUSI) takes its cue from the past. It is organized along the Unes of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists during World War n. According to Ivan Kandyba, head of FUSI, the group intends to use peaceful methods to achieve Ukrainian independence. The founding charter warns of the danger of “fragmenting patriotic forces” in Ukraine and announces FUSI's intention “to mobilize the people for the estabUshment of an independent state.” On the left of the political spectrum, five parties are currently active. The early programs issued by the various social democratic groups generally devoted little space to the national question, which prompted criticism from a number of other parties and groups. Like their counterparts on the right, left- wing groups in Ukraine have been prone to internal dissension. At the inaugural congress of the Ukrainian Social Democrats in May 1990, for example, the assembled delegates split into two new parties. The more conservative fac[pageend74]POLITICAL PARTIES IN UKRAINE 73 tion, which takes the social democratic parties of Western Europe as its model, declared itself the Ukrainian Social Democratic Party; the more ardently leftist faction calls itself the United Ukrainian Social Democratic Party. The Chernobyl disaster of 1986 was the catalyst behind the formation of a wide array of independent groups. One of the first was the Green World Association, which was launched in late 1987. From the Green World Association developed the Green Party, whose first program was issued in April 1990 and formally ratified at the Greens' first congress that September. The program called for a thoroughgoing renewal of Ukrainian society and rejected all “antihumanist theories and the practice of bolshevism, national socialism, and totalitarianism.” In addition to their environmental objectives, the Greens support the goal of Ukrainian independence. They oppose a new union treaty on the grounds that “...it will be impossible to solve Ukraine's ecological problems if the totalitarian-bureaucratic regime and the colonial status of our country are maintained.” Like Greens elsewhere, the Green Party of Ukraine is pacifist and antinuclear. It is prepared to participate in a coalition government, viewing itself, in the words of one leading Green activist, “as an integral component of a strong left-center bloc of democratic forces.” Political pluralism in Ukraine has touched even the communist party. During the summer of 1990, members of the group known as Democratic Platform decided that working for reform from within the party was a hopeless task. Democratic Platform thereupon established itself as an independent party, and adopted the name the Ukrainian Party of Democratic Renewal(UPDR) at its first congress the following December. Its founding committee included 22 deputies of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet, and at the December congress it announced a membership of 2,340 people in 23 oblasts. The December congress revealed two currents within the UPDR, one liberal and the other social democratic. One commentator observed that the party lacks “Ukrainian character” and does not understand the national question, and many were disturbed by the fact that a majority of the speeches at the congress were delivered in Russian. Twenty percent of the UPDR's members are deputies of one sort or another, which some observers of the Ukrainian political scene see as a potential strong point. The UPDR, they argue, could play a prominent role in a centrist coalition government, perhaps in alliance with the social democrats, the liberals, and the Greens. “In the transition from totalitarianism to democracy,” one commentator argues, “an influential center party of this sort could play an important role.” At the end of 1990, a group of prominent members of Rukh and of the CPSU launched the Democratic Party of Ukraine (DPU). Yury Badzio, who had written several manifestos and drafted proposals for a new party during the two preceding years, was elected leader. The DPU supports independence and the establishment of a market economy; it differs from the Ukrainian Party of Democratic Renewal primarily in its greater emphasis on the national question.

[pageend76]ESTONIA interview With RIHO LAANEMAE and MART NUTT Riho Laanemae is the head of the information department in the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Mart Nutt is vice-chairman of the Republican Coalition Party and a cofounder of the Jaan Tonisson Institute. They were interviewed for Uncaptive Minds by Monika Agopsowicz in Warsaw in May 1991. DEMOCRACY WITHOUT PARTIES UM Please bring us up to date on the political situation in Estonia. NUTT The present situation is peaceful but we are far from optimistic because nobody knows when the Soviet tanks will come back. The only thing we are optimistic about is the end of the Soviet empire, which appears to be on the horizon. Some of us, however, fear what will happen before the final collapse. Some think the chances of a civil war engulfing the entire Soviet empire are 50%. Such a conflict could threaten the very existence of the nations that are currendy under Soviet occupation, especially the small ones. UM You seem to regard a hypothetical civil war in the Soviet Union as more of a threat than an opportunity to regain independence. By what route, then, do you foresee Estonia regaining its independence? [pageend77]76 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 NUTT Fighting a war of independence, like the one we fought in 1918-1920, is out of the question now. Our hopes lie in the peaceful disintegration of the empire, in our part of it at least. Every Estonian political party advocates the use of nonviolent, lawful means in the struggle for Estonia's independence. UM Do most of the parties in Estonia support independence? NUTT Every political party in Estonia demands independence, including the national communists and the Democratic Party of Estonia, which is dominated by ethnic Russians. UM You left out Interfront. NUTT Interfront isn't a party; it's a Russian movement that isn't even popular among Russians; only 4% of the Russian inhabitants of Estonia support it. However, its boisterous propaganda, which is generously funded by Moscow, makes it seem more influential. LAANEMAE Apart from parties, there are other political forces on the scene, such as the United Council of Workers and the Estonian Popular Front. These forces have a somewhat different understanding of Estonian independence than the parties. The heart of the dispute lies in the matter of legal continuity: whether an independent Estonian state should be based on the laws established in interwar Estonia or whether a whole new constitution should be drawn up. UM What constitution is in force in Estonia now? NUTT None, as a matter of fact. The 1937 constitution has not been in force since the Soviet annexation, and the Soviet one was suspended by the Estonian parliament on March 30, 1990. LAANEMAE The parliament drew upon a few paragraphs from the 1937 constitution to be able to govern the country during the transition to full independence. [pageend78]DEMOCRACY WITHOUT PARTIES 77 UM What is the make up of the Estonian parliament? NUTT The situation in our parliament is very unusual by European standards. Our parliamentary system is still underdeveloped because organized political parties are extremely weak, and thus unable to form a government based on clear political majorities. The current prime minister, Edgar Savisaar, was elected by a single vote margin. As a result, he does not control several ministries in his government — in fact, they stand in opposition to him. Let me give another example of the abnormality of our parliamentary system: of the 105 seats, 27 are occupied by Russian deputies who support the continuance of the Soviet empire. This number does not reflect the proportion of Russians in Estonia who hold this view in comparison to those who favor an independent Estonia. The latter, however, are not represented in parliament. Actually, the majority of Russians are politically passive. They are more or less intimidated by Moscow's propaganda, which claims that as soon as the Estonians proclaim independence, they will deport all Russians to Siberia, or at least cut them off from their relatives in Russia. At the moment the Russian democrats and the imperialists are fighting for the souls of the passive population. UM Who has free access to the mass media? LAANEMAE Theoretically, anyone. But in practice, the media is controlled by two forces: the Estonian Popular Front and another movement called Free Estonia. The latter was set up by the old partocracy under the leadership of the former prime minister, Indrek Toome. These people are communists who pretend to have changed. Free Estonia is also supported by some intellectuals who disdain what they view as the bent toward autocracy of the popular front's leaders. NUTT Some of the newspapers are genuinely independent, such as the Postman, a Tartu daily, or the Tallinn weekly Estonian Express. There are also independent magazines for the elite such as Academia and Rainbow. [pageend79]78 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 LAANEMAE Unfortunately, the free press, especially the dailies, is in an unstable situation. The country's biggest publishing house was formerly owned by the communist party, and there are rumors that the pro-Moscow communists want to take it over. UM Who is in control of the rest of the major dailies in Estonia? LAANEMAE The Voice of the People is the organ of the parliament and the Estonian government. The rest of the press is divided between Free Estonia and the Estonian Popular Front. UM Which Estonian party has been the most active of late ? LAANEMAE It's hard to say. People don't seem to believe in parties any longer. The communist party has completely discredited the idea of a political party. NUTT People believe in leaders instead. Therefore, if a leader is popular his party is popular. My party, the Republican Coalition Party, is an exception to the rule: we have no outstanding leaders, but nevertheless we have the most seats in parliament. Most of the deputies don't represent any party. Our elections were democratic, but voting was personalized — deputies were elected on the basis of their personal popularity. I think Estonians are tired of politics, of all the rallies, demonstrations, and elections. They need time. The only thing that would make them active now would be further Soviet actions against us or any of the other Baltic states. UM How strong is Estonian national identity? LAANEMAE The 1979 census included a question on native language and nationality. Over 98% of Estonians considered Estonian their native language. National consciousness is highly developed among our countrymen. The Soviets had a hard time finding Estonian communist leaders or activists. [pageend80]DEMOCRACY WITHOUT PARTIES 79 UM What are the differences between Estonia and the other Baltic states ? NUTT We share the same modem history, but we belong to different cultures. Latvians and Estonians are in the Scandinavian cultural orbit, whereas Lithuanians belong to Central Europe. Our language is very close to Finnish; Latvian and Lithuanian belong to an entirely different language group. We are predominantly Lutheran, Lithuanians are Catholic, and Latvians are 2/3 Lutheran and 1/3 Catholic. It would be wrong to view the Baltic states as an homogeneous group. UM What steps have you taken to establish relations with other countries ? LAANEMAE We are only now re-creating our ministry of foreign affairs. The ministry's chief aim for now is to prepare for independence. For example, we are opening information bureaus that would gain the status of consulates or embassies when the time is right. Our largest bureau is in Copenhagen. Its head is empowered to represent the Estonian Foreign Ministry. We have representatives in Stockholm, Paris, and London, although no bureaus have been opened in these cities yet. Finland hasn't accepted any of our political representatives. I am in Poland to discuss precisely this matter; we would like to see an Estonian bureau in Warsaw and a Polish one in Tallinn. An Estonian representative is going to participate in a session of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to be held in Poland later this month. It is important that we take part in the CSCE process — it's a deliberate step we're taking up the European political ladder. Because we have decided to go through a transitional stage on the way to independence, we haven't gained diplomatic recognition in the world to the extent Lithuania has. The Lithuanians have chosen a different approach to foreign relations: they don't want to establish any form of prediplomatic agencies abroad; instead, they want to open embassies that are fully recognized by their host countries. The Lithuanian way is better for Lithuanians; ours is better for us. [pageend81]CZECHO-SLOVAKIA SLOVAKIA: THE POWER GAME by Józef Darski Józef Darski is a Polish journalist who writes frequently about national and ethnic conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. The doctrine of “Czechoslovakism”, propagated by the founders of the Czechoslovak state, Tom!a;s Masaryk and Edvard Beneš, asserts that the Slovaks are a part of the Czech nation, or, in a more muted version, that the Czechs and Slovaks form two branches of the same nation. The Slovaks suspect that the Czechs continue to hold this view. This mistrust is a manifestation of a national inferiority complex that arose at the close of World War I when the Slovaks, virtually without an intelligentsia, entered into a common state with the Czechs. Previously, the Slovaks had been ruthlessly Magyarized under the Austro-Hungarian Empire. From the beginning, the Slovaks demanded a federal state, but Slovak self-rule would have been extremely difficult in the first decade of the Czechoslovak state owing to the absence of an educated class in Slovakia. It was the influx of Czech teachers that addressed this problem. Czechs also manned the state bureaucracy in Slovakia during the earlier years of Czechoslovakia. However, when the first generation of the Slovak intelligentsia entered politics in the 1930s, it began to compete with the Czechs. A sharp political conflict ensued. In the course of the struggle with Czech bureaucrats and Czechoslovakism, nationalists and fascists came to dominate Slovak politics. The Czechs hold the Slovak national movement partially responsible for the destruction of Czechoslovakia in 1938-1939, and abhor Father Josef Tiso's Slovak state, which was an ally of Nazi Germany. Today, the Czechs view the current Slovak movement through the prism of the 1930s, seeing separ[pageend82]SLOVAKIA: THE POWER CAME 81 atism, nationalism, and even fascism in every Slovak demand and gesture for greater autonomy. The Czechs' posture, in turn, makes it easier for nationalistic elements of a communist or authoritarian stripe to exploit anti-Czech sentiments in Slovakia. For the Slovaks, Tiso's state was not merely a fascist ally of the Third Reich. In the Slovaks' eyes, Tiso's execution after the war was an act of revenge on the part of Beneš. The Social Background to the Conflict Communism transformed Slovakia from an agricultural region into a center of heavy industry, and in particular, arms manufacture. Today, unfortunately, virtually all of Slovakia's heavy industry should be liquidated, and the conversion of arms factories has emerged as one of the fundamental problems of economic reform in Slovakia. The free-market reforms of federal finance minister Václav Klaus, which can be implemented in the more industrially diverse Czech lands at a lower cost, will almost totally wipe out the current Slovak industrial base. The impact has already been felt. In 1990, arms production fell by 50%. Unemployment in Slovakia is 50% higher than in the Czech lands. No wonder that Slovak economists — with the notable exception of the former minister for reform Jozef Kučerák, a political ally of Klaus — more or less defend the socialist economic model regardless of their political affiliation. The public, like the economists of the two republics, takes different views of the reforms. According to the polling agency AISA, 40% of Slovaks, but only 17% of Czechs, are not satisfied with the current situation; and 40% of Slovaks, as opposed to only 28% of Czechs, envision the possibility of limiting democratic freedoms. Moreover, 25% of Slovaks believe that “machinations by Western capitalists and Jewish freemasonry” lie behind the bad economic situation. Xenophobic attitudes are particularly evident among the 22% of Slovaks who advocate Slovak independence. The majority of Slovaks favor a treaty with the Czechs that would grant Slovakia a separate economic and political system. They fail to understand, however, that two economies would, among other things, lead to two foreign policies, and ultimately to the dissolution of the state. The Czechs and Slovaks are already divided by differences in foreign policy orientation: in Slovakia, confidence in NATO is lower than in the Czech lands, while hostile attitudes toward the USSR are much less pronounced. The tendency towards isolationism is greater in Slovakia, as opposed to the Czechs' marked preference for integration into Europe. Most Slovaks would like to see economic reform slow down, and they want the state to intervene to make reform painless. Many, in fact, desire the de facto maintenance of the old system, which would be easier to perpetuate [pageend83]82 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 in a more autonomous Slovakia. For Slovak politicians, keeping the arms industry alive has become a leading priority. During his March visit to Moscow, the Slovak prime minister, Vladimir Mečiar, apparently received permission from the Soviet Ministry for Arms Production to export tanks on Soviet licenses to Syria and Iran, who have ordered 400 tanks between them. Mečiar claims that Soviet orders alone will save 100,000 jobs in Slovakia. As a result of assurances such as these, Mečiar has become enormously popular. But not only arms industry workers fear economic reform. Slovakia currently has more graduates of secondary and postsecondary schools as a percentage of the population than do the Czech lands. A contracting economy will not be able to absorb them; thus, for many educated people, the state bureaucracy is the only career option. The Political Forces Traditionally, the Catholic Church and the political movements associated with it have been an important force in Slovak politics. However, the communist regime's repression of the church decimated its hierarchy and rendered it incapable of playing a meaningful political role when the communists fell from power. Not able to stand on their own two feet at first, the Christian Democrats, led by Ján Čamogurský, participated in the creation of Public Against Violence (VPN), the umbrella opposition group that arose in Slovakia during the November 1989 revolution. In March 1990, however, Ján Čamo- gursky's group left VPN and established its own party, the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH). (A few Christian Democrats, including František Mikloško and Ján Langoš, remained in VPN.) The nationalists entered the political arena in the form of the Slovak National Party (SNS). The communists, who renamed themselves the Party of the Democratric Left (SDL), joined SNS in its advocacy of Slovak national issues. The SNS, in turn, threw its support to the communist chairman of the Slovak National Council (the republic's parliament) when the body was being reconstituted in March 1990. Free elections to the Slovak parliament in June 1990 gave VPN almost 30% of the vote, the KDH nearly 20%, the SNS 14%, and the SDL a little over 13%. The Democratic Party (DS), a former satellite party of the communists, polled over 4%. VPN, KDH, and DS formed a coalition government, while the communists and nationalists found themselves in opposition. The SNS began its political career with an anti-Hungarian campaign: slogans calling for the expulsion of Slovakia's Hungarian minority were accompanied by legislative efforts to ban the use of Hungarian in government offices. The SNS also distributed pamphlets calling for Father Tiso's rehabilitation, and held rallies in support of declaring the primacy of Slovak laws over federal legislation. To be sure, the anti-Hungarian campaign cost SNS leader Vitazoslav Moric his position. And in local elections in November 1990, the SNS received only 3.5% of the vote. Yet Moric's successor continued the policy. [pageend84]SLOVAKIA: THE POWER CAME 83 The Christian Democrats received 27% of the vote in the November 1990 local elections and it appeared they were regaining their traditional position on the Slovak political scene. VPN, on the other hand, won only 20% of the vote. Mečiar, a member of VPN, concluded that only a campaign conducted with populist slogans and calling for the “liberation” of Slovakia from Czech domination could marginalize the SNS and prevent the moderately nationalist Christian Democrats from becoming Slovakia's leading political force. When Mečiar decided to play populist politics, the foundations for a split within VPN were laid. A group within VPN, centered around its chairman Fedor Gál, has steadfastly supported democratic reforms, union with the Czechs, and integration into Europe. They fear Slovak nationalism and clericalism, and they believe an isolated Slovakia would be more vulnerable to authoritarian rule. They also fear Soviet involvement. According to Daniel Butora, a student leader and member of VPN, the communist nomenklatura is fighting to hang on to its positions, and the Soviets represent an ally in this struggle.“It is no coincidence,” he wrote, that “a large portion of the Slovak press continually ignores the fact that Slovakia today lies in a sphere of competing powers' interests; that it possesses a direct border with a country that — despite important changes — continues to have a militaristic and hierarchical vision of society, a country in which the KGB continues to make decisions in important matters. The arsenal of this agency's methods directed against former colonies does not have to include only disinformation or political violence, which is already much less in use today. It can also be concerned with creating economic dependency.” Gál's group, however, is perceived as representing Czech interests, and it has been either unable or unwilling to dispel this image and establish an independent identity. As a result, the nationalist wave is forcing them to the political sidelines. Although Gál's group had a majority within VPN's leadership and among its parliamentary representatives, the membership base increasingly supported Mečiar. Mečiar, unfortunately, decided to adopt more than just a populist style. A former communist removed from the party in 1971, Mečiar became closely associated with Obroda, a group founded by former communist reformers who had gained important positions in the Slovak Ministry of Internal Affairs and who were advising Mečiar on economic policy. Moreover, he began to draw much closer to the nationalists. Slowly, an alliance between Mečiar's VPN faction, the nationalists, and the communist SDL began to take shape. Mečiar attempted to take control of VPN at the organization's congress in February, but failed. His proposal to remove Fedor Gál from the movement's chairmanship was rejetted by 160 of the 290 delegates. On March 6, 1991, the council of VPN, the majority of whose members supported Gál, declared that it would consider ai parliamentary motion to dismiss Mečiar from his position as prime minister. In response, Mečiar's supporters left the coun[pageend85]84 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 cil and established their own platform within VPN, which they called For a Democratic Slovakia (ZDS). Although Mečiar's stock was falling with the VPN leadership, it was rapidly rising with the Slovak public. In March 1991, polls conducted in Bratislava showed 28.4% of respondents supporting the ZDS, 9.9% the communists, and 8.2% the nationalists. At the same time, only 8.9% favored the Christian Democrats, 4.6% the non-ZDS faction of VPN, and 6.5% the Democratic Party, with 10% undecided and 3.9% opting for the Hungarian party, Coexistence. In April, surveys gave the ZDS 30%, the communists 9%, the SNS 8%, VPN 1 %, and the KDH 7 %. And Mečiaťs personal popularity rating far surpassed anyone else's, with 91% of the Slovak public considering him “a guarantee for Slovakia's democratic development.” This is an astounding figure when one considers that ethnic Hungarians constitute 12% of the population of Slovakia. Mečiar's political exploitation of resentment and hate, however, have endangered the prospects for democracy in Slovakia. There have already been several pathological outbursts, including a demonstration on March 14 in Bratislava when a crowd of 10,000 virtually tried to lynch President Havel, screaming “go back to Prague, you Jewish swine.” When Slovakia's minister of internal affairs, Ladislav Pittner, was asked to comment on the disturbance, he replied: it is possible that not only fascist or nationalist fanatics are behind this but that a third force is at work here, people who would like to create this kind of opinion of Slovakia. We do not exclude former members of the security police, chauvinist Czechs, or other foreign sponsors, who as early as last year were interested in seeing anti-Jewish slogans written on walls. At that time, I was working in the intelligence service, and we received signals that Western intelligence agencies (sic!) were financing this.. .In essence, money came here from Western countries to finance anti-Jewish, anti-Gypsy, and anti-Hungarian outbreaks. After all, we are in our Western neighbors' sphere of interest. Competing Visions of Federation and Independence VPN advocates a federal constitution to which the republics' constitutions would be subordinant. The Democratic Party supports Slovak sovereignty within a common state with the Czechs. The KDH also favors a federal state, but under the condition that a treaty be signed between the two republics that would specify the conditions whereby one side could leave the union. Foreign policy, internal affairs, defense, and foreign trade would fall under the jurisdiction of federal authorities. When some people suggested that the Czech regions of Moravia and Silesia be elevated to the status of a third republic within the federation, the Christian Democrats (KDH) — fearing that the Czech republics, [pageend86]SLOVAKIA: THE POWER GAME 85 Bohemia and Moravia-Silesia, would dominate Slovakia — reacted by proposing a confederation. Only the Slovak National Party (SNS) wants the creation of a separate Slovak state. For the better part of 1990, the federal government's main interlocutor in Slovakia was Prime Minister Mečiar, who emphasized the danger of the KDH's and SNS's separatism. The Czechs did not want to reach an agreement with Čamogurský, considering him, at the time, to be a dangerous separatist. Ivan Lamper, the editor-in-chief of the Czech weekly Respekt, wrote about “individuals from Čamogurský's KDH who are clearly oriented towards separatism,” and compared the KDH with the SNS. This was a mistake; the KDH — threatened with being crushed by the ZDS, Mečiar's faction from Public Against Violence (VPN) — has, of late, demonstrated more desire to compromise with Prague. Intrigue On April 16, Mečiar announced the dismissal of ministers from Gál's group within VPN. By doing so, Mečiar was violating procedural rules: first, the presidium of the Slovak parliament and then the entire parliament would have had to confirm these kinds of changes. A meeting took place the next day at President Havel's office. The participants included: František Mikloško, the speaker of the Slovak parliament who supports VPN, Ján Čamogurský, Fedor Gál, and Vladimír Mečiar. After the meeting, Gal remarked, “we found a path to common rapprochement with the KDH.” On April 19, the presidium of the parliament, in which VPN and the KDH together controlled a slight majority, declared that the government was unable to function and announced that changes were slated in the government. Prime Minister Mečiar was to be dismissed, along with other ministers. The presidium also set up parliamentary commissions to investigate the actions of the Slovak Ministry of Internal Affairs after November 17, 1989 (i.e., during the period when Mečiar headed it), and the circumstances of Mečiar's foreign trips as prime minister. The next day, Mečiar attempted to heighten the tension by pointing to “external influences” — meaning Prague — as the cause of the government's inability to function. On April 21, Ján Čamogurský, whose Christian Democrats had entered into an alliance with VPN, revealed that discussions concerning the reconstruction of the government had reached their final stages. He noted that “Vladimír Mečiar's departure, of course, would be necessary.” Fedor Gál noted that the coalition talks between the VPN and the KDH were proceeding “astoundingly easily. We are arriving at a consensus in all key problems.” On April 23, the presidium of the Slovak parliament formally dismissed Vladimír Mečiar and several other members of his ZDS. Ján Čamogurský was then nominated to be prime minister. [pageend87]86 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 On April 24, as many as 100,000 people demonstrated in Bratislava for Mečiar. Some tried to storm the parliament building. Amidst this ruckus, the parliament confirmed the presidium's decision. Seventy-four delegates voted for dismissing Mečiar, sixty-five voted against, and ten submitted invalid ballots. The ZDS ministers remaining in the government after the changes resigned. Now, the new government is threatened with minority status. The oppositionist troika — the ZDS, SNS, and SDL — will be able to block its initiatives easily. On the same day, the city's bus drivers held a 10-minute warning strike on Mečiaťs behalf. Some 5,000 people attended a public protest in Košice sponsored by the ZDS, while 20,000 inhabitants of northern Slovakia signed a protest against Mečiar's dismissal that included demands for new elections to the parliament. In Nitra, demonstrators demanded a strengthening of Slovakia's sovereignty. Several thousand people came to a public protest in Bar- dějov, and 8,000 attended one in Prešov. On April 29, Slovak miners organized a 15-minute protest strike, while the trade unions ominously announced that “further steps” would be taken. Surveys continue to indicate that more than 90% of the inhabitants of Slovakia support Mečiar. Čamogurský and his coalition partners, if they do not want to be swept from the Slovak political scene in the upcoming elections, have to solve two problems: how to enact a constitution that confers greater independence upon Slovakia, and how to at least soften the course of economic reform. Ironically, accomplishing the latter will most likely require greater dependence on economic help from Prague. The Charges Against Meciar On April 17, the presidium of the Slovak National Council made the following charges against Mečiar: that he had conducted unauthorized negotiations with the Soviets during his visit to Moscow, and that he abused security police archives. František Mikloško asserted that negotiations with Soviet generals had taken place. Mečiar admitted that the government had not been fully informed about his activities during the trip, but denied having made any treaties. “The presidium of the council was shocked by Mečiar's attitude towards the entire event,” Mikloško noted. Ivan Lamper, in Respekt, revealed that “the prime minister of the USSR proposed to Mečiar that his government adapt its economic and legal mechanisms to the norms applying in the Soviet Union,” which Mečiar's team accepted. According to Miroslav Kusý of VPN, “employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs abused lists of security police agents... Lists of security service agents in the government, radio, TV, newspapers, and among religious figures showed up on Prime Minister Mečiar's desk. He was not able to explain how these dossiers, whose contents he used in political struggles, found their way into [pageend88]SLOVAKIA: THE POWER GAME 87 his chancellery.” Kusy's statement was confirmed by František Javorský, a member of the KDH and chairman of the Slovak parliament's defense and security commission. Mečiar strongly resisted disclosing the names of agents who continued to occupy high positions. He prevented the publication of the names of Slovak security police agents in the Federal Assembly. He also demanded that the security police dossiers from Slovakia be returned from Prague to Bratislava. It seems Mečiar wanted to keep the files under his own control so he could use them as he saw fit. On the Way to Compromise The main issue dividing Prague and Bratislava is the demand put forward by the KDH that a treaty be signed between the Czech and Slovak Republics as between two independent states. Prague opposes this demand, fearing that it would only be the prelude to the federation's disintegration. Initially, Prague also opposed the idea of transforming Moravia and Silesia into a third republic. Now, however, some Czech politicians view a three- member federation based on territorial rather than national criteria as a means of “attenuating” national conflicts. Among other groups, the conservative Czech parties — the Civic Democratic Alliance, the Club of Engaged Non-Partisans, and the Christian Democratic Party — have announced their support for this plan. As a result of discussions within the Christian Democratic Union — which links the Czech Christian Democratic Party, the former collaborationist Czech People's Party, and the Slovak KDH — the latter changed its position. On April 15, Václav Benda, the chairman of the Czech Christian Democrats, announced that the members of the Christian Democratic Union had agreed that Czecho-Slovakia should consist of three territories, with the proviso that Bohemia and Moravia-Silesia could not outvote Slovakia in federation- wide matters. They also agreed that, from a legal point of view, the three republics should enter into the treaty as independent states. President Havel has rejected the idea of basing the federation on a treaty between independent states. Čamogurský concedes that according to the Vienna agreement of 1969 governing international treaties, this “would not be a treaty between sovereign states. ’ ’ Yet when asked on April 27 why such a treaty should be drawn up at all, he said that “perhaps this will be the first step towards recognizing it as an international agreement.” The Slovak state, if it were to detach itself from the federation with the Czech lands, would find itself boxed in by unsympathetic neighbors. Poland has not exhibited any interest in Slovakia. The Hungarians have been designated — by the Slovak nationalist movement — a more threatening enemy than the Czechs. Ukrainians are likely to turn a cold shoulder toward the Slovaks if the Slovaks classify their Ukrainian minority as “Ruthenian,” which they [pageend89]88 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 19 show signs of doing. An independent Slovakia would be able to count c on the Soviet Union. Czech politicians face a dilemma: if they continue to force their Slo counterparts in VPN and the KDH to adopt their positions, if they don't pet Čamogurský “to return from Prague with a victory,” then the KDH is lil to be crushed by a ZDS-SNS-SDL coalition in free elections. And if sue coalition comes to power, the Czechoslovak federation will collapse. If Czechs agreed to the enactment of a “state treaty,” they would strengt the position of the KDH and VPN in Slovakia by demonstrating that these gro are not “puppets of Prague.” Yet such a treaty would also open the waj the federation's legal dissolution should the party in power in Bratislava dec that union with the Czechs is not beneficial to them. Some Czech politicians, however, appear prepared to let Slovakia g< the Slovaks demand too much. Czech prime minister Petr Pithart has admit that the Czech government was devising a plan for independent economic ; political development in the Czech lands should the federation collapse. Me over, President Havel has not ruled out the possibility of holding a referend on the federation's continued existence. Independence for the Czechs, thou: would solve few of their problems — and create new ones. The Czech st would have an unstable Slovakia as a neighbor, from which masses of the i employed and gypsies would flow. President Havel should have publicly sta that “the Czechs will have to get used to the fact that the federation is mi up of two partners” much earlier than he did. [pageend90]CZECHO-SLOVAKIA FEDOR GÁL SPEAKS OUT by Benjamin Kuras The following article appeared in issue 21 of the Czech weekly Respekt (5/27-6/2 1991). Fedor Gál was until recently the chairman of Public Against Violence (VPN). “We face two major problems, the solutions to which will determine our future for the next twenty years: adopting a constitution that will ensure that the federative system satisfies both nations; and economic reform, without which our dream of democracy will disappear,” said Fedor Gál recently in London, where he came for a three-month respite from Slovak politics and the hatred of Bratislava mobs. Actually, one could say that Gál has been persona non grata from the very beginning. Gál, who is Jewish, was born during the war in the Theresienstadt camp, where it was forbidden to bear children. He had to be kept hidden in a box. In Bratislava, too, he has been practically living in a box for the last several months. He had to install armor plating on the front door of his apartment, and he could go outside only in the company of two armed guards. He received thousands of letters and telephone calls brimming with obscenities and hatred. Even his mother received such calls. And Gál isn't the only public figure who has been worn down by Slovakia's rough politics; in fact, several have suffered heart attacks. “What has been happening had to happen,” Gál explains. “For forty years people couldn't express their emotions, including the desire to spit on someone. They couldn't spit on Bilák [one of the old regime's most infamous leaders], but they can spit on Gál. It's like therapy for some people. They have a deeply-rooted inferiority complex and need to have an enemy.” [pageend91]90 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 According to Gál, Czechs fail to understand what is happening in Slovakia because they never had a problem with statehood. Slovaks, however, never had their own state, except during World War II, a dark period in Slovak history. They are trying to determine their identity, and they want to feel that they are free and equal partners. Yet only a relatively small proportion of them want an independent Slovakia: according to recent opinion polls, about 75% of Slovaks support the federation. Gál says that even Slovak politicians dedicated to federation were surprised by the Czechs' fundamental lack of understanding for the Slovak position during negotiations on the federal constitution. The Slovaks want to build the federation from below: theoretically, the sovereign citizen would delegate part of his sovereignty to the republic, and the sovereign republic part of its sovereignty to the federation. But Czech politicians, according to Gál, understand federation as a process of decentralization from above. Gál believes there are many dangers facing Slovakia — and thus all of Central Europe. A network of KGB transmitters exists on Slovak territory. At the moment, the network is not in operation, although a few trial transmissions have been picked up. The former political police, and certain exile organizations, are encouraging extremists. Slovak interior minister Ladislav Pittner recognized longtime security police agents in the mob that tried to break down the doors to the Slovak parliament after it voted to dismiss Prime Minister Mečiar. Miroslav Kusý [a former dissident and political prisoner, now dean of Bratislava University] recognized the secret policeman assigned to investigate him during the separatist demonstration in Bratislava on November 17, 1990. In the economic sphere, Gál points out that few Slovaks realize one inescapable fact: Slovakia cannot solve its economic problems with its own resources. There is no entrepreneurial class, and one won't emerge for several more years. Western businessmen would be disinclined to invest in an unstable Slovakia. And a future integrated Europe wouldn't want a destabilized or disintegrating Czecho-Slovakia. Slovakia could find itself looking in at Europe from behind barbed wire. Yet Gál thinks that things will get better. He predicts that by the end of the year, Czecho-Slovakia will have a new federal constitution and will begin the process of entering Europe as a united country. What is the source of his optimism? “Someone should notice that though Slovakia underwent very dramatic changes — much faster than other countries — not a single drop of blood was spilled despite all this very visible intolerance.” [pageend92]terra nova A Quarterly Journal of Economic Freedom and Political Thought The International Freedom Foundation proudly presents terra nova, a new quarterly journal of international affairs. terra nova rises to meet the challanges of the collapse of communism in eastern Europe. terra nova addresses problems arising from the transitions to democratic capitalism by many Third World countries. terra nova features renowned authors from around the world, with IFF contributing editors in London, Brussels, Hamburg, and Johannesburg.

[pageend93]CZECHO-SLOVAKIA THE UNFINISHED REVOLUTION by Martin M. Šimečka Mr. Šimečka is a writer and publisher from Bratislava. He wrote the following text for the National Endowment for Democracy's April 14-15 conference in Washington. Revolution is a magic word. Revolutionaries grow drunk on it, repeating it over and over until reality assumes the hue of their incantations — blood red. I remember how — a few days after the events of November 17, 1989 — we tentatively began to use the word. It quickly became popular, and soon acquired some attributes, one of the first being “gentle.” Later, further attributes were added, such as “wasted” “stolen,” “betrayed,” and “unfinished.” These adjectives testify to the revolutionaries' belief that something has gone wrong with the revolution. Moreover, revolutionaries seem to think that a revolution comes to a conclusion like a film or a novel, and that only then can people begin a normal, workaday life. In one sense, they're right — the revolution is indeed incomplete. But the problem is that any attempt to finish it in a revolutionary way would not bring it to completion, but rather transform it into a permanent revolution. Everyone remembers the gentle course the revolution took during its first weeks. But hardly anyone recalls that a commitment to civilized behavior and the principles of nonviolence was not the main reason why the old regime was overturned so peacefully. Rather, it was simple fear. People went to the streets to protest the violence committed against them by the regime, and many of them surely wanted to wrench the communists' heads off. But they didn't, because they were still scared. The crowd behaved much like the weaker of two animals in nature. At first it was extremely cautious lest it provoke its dangerous opponent. People realized that the riot police they so feared could be [pageend94]THE UNFINISHED REVOLUTION 93 disarmed if offered a handshake and thanked for not beating anyone. It was one small psychological step from this self-interested effort to calm the beast to an all-embracing euphoria of love and the discovery of the principles of tolerance. There were calls for forgiveness in the same breath as demands for freedom and an end to the communist monopoly on power. In one town square I watched as the crowd whispered its forgiveness of the Soviet soldiers who, 22 years earlier, had killed a 16-year-old girl on that very site. I felt great joy that day, but I knew that moment would inevitably give way to the hate that had been building up for decades. Today, a year and a half later, the hatred, frustration, disillusion, and pent- up aggression of those forty years have returned with a vengeance. Public opinion polls show a dangerous decline in civic consciousness. Two-thirds of those polled are no longer willing to bear the sacrifices that economic reform requires, and they are ceasing to believe reform will succeed. It's not difficult to understand why the inhabitants of this country are turning against reform. Having rid themselves of the burden that had blighted their lives for so many years, they found that there were no rewards for the enormous sacrifices they had already made; that, quite the contrary, they would have to pay a high price just to lay the foundations for the prosperity some of their neighbors have long enjoyed by virtue of living a little further to the west. Of course one can object to this view, pointing out that nations have the governments they deserve; that the great majority of our people accepted the totalitarian system, learned to live comfortably in it, and by means of their accommodation actually helped it to survive for so long. This is all true to some extent, but try telling it to the people of Eastern Europe: what they feel, above all else, is the injustice of their fate. They all consider themselves victims of the system; none of them feel they were the aggressors within it or profited from it (or at least no one admits to this). Everyone claims his rights and demands a better future. It is only the former dissidents who remind us that we were both the victims and the offenders — but no one pays them any heed. People absorbed a destructive collectivist mentality, which displaced the individual conscience. Now the nation sees itself as a collective victim, and this victim is looking for its tormentor. However, the old collectivist way of doing things is on the verge of disappearing, and people are terribly afraid of this — though once it was their fondest dream. This new fear has the same roots as the dread of the old regime during the first days of the November revolution. No wonder it has resulted in a desire for national unity and other social certainties. Nonetheless, it is depressing to read Slovak newspapers, which — with very few exceptions — have adopted the ideology of nationalism and now sing the praises of “the great leader of the Slovak nation,” Prime Minister Vladimír Mečiar. Watching TV and listening to the radio, you can feel the relief of editors who, after a year of groping their way through the unfamiliar world of freedom, have [pageend95]94 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 seized upon the certainty of a dictated opinion. And I can't even reproach them, because I understand how difficult it is to be free, and how it is harder still for those who devoted all their energy and ingenuity to accommodating themselves to the lack of freedom. It seems, then, that society is heading for a return to where it came — i.e. some sort of authoritarian regime. My social feelers and receptors, trained over many years of dissident life, confirm this impression. Yet reason tells me that everything is all right. Why does reason tell me this? First of all, during the last year democracy was established in our country. This democracy has certain formal characteristics: a parliamentary system with several competing parties; freedom of speech, assembly, and travel; free enterprise; and public control over the judicial system. Though these elements of democracy could still be taken away, East Europeans are not likely to part with them voluntarily. Nevertheless, the way these components of democracy are functioning sometimes verges on farce. Prime Minister Mečiar blames parliament for interfering with his work when it doesn't approve his policy initiatives, and then turns to the people and declares that he will only be responsible to them. One day he reveals that he conducted secret negotiations with Soviet generals, and the next he denies that he did so, claiming that whatever he said was just a joke. No one holds Mečiar accountable for what he says, and despite his outrageous “jokes” and lies, his popularity increases. It hasn't even been damaged by the strong suspicion that he is blackmailing his ministers with secret police files he managed to gain access to. The prime minister isn't the only one playing at democracy. A deputy was once again caught pressing his absent neighbor's voting button on the floor of parliament. Another deputy threatens to “tear down” parliament, and issues a program that directly contradicts the constitution. We are like a child who has been watching adults and who now pretends to act like them. The child keeps up the appearance of adulthood for a while, but finally loses interest and runs outside to play with the other children. No one seems to care what is being said at the highest levels of government, or even worse, what is actually happening there, because after decades during which the rule of law was absent, the public's tolerance for lies and illegality is much too high. Still, in spite of all these problems, I am optimistic. There is a broad stratum of people who, during the last year and a half, have made use of their opportunity to become free citizens. They will not let their freedom be taken away. These people have the courage to face the hysterical crowd and express their own opinions, to write articles that will elicit threatening telephone calls. They know they have to strive for democracy every day. Through their actions and attitudes they demonstrate to others that freedom is possible and, what's more, worth it. In so far as this revolution can be completed, it is these individuals who are doing the hard work necessary to see it through. Neither parliament nor politicians are capable of getting the job done without them. [pageend96]CZECHO-SLOVAKIA THE END OF NONPOLITICAL POLITICS by Petruška Šustrová Petruška Šustrová is the Czechoslovak deputy minister of internal affairs and a longstanding opposition activist. The following is a paper she presented at the Foreign Policy Research Institute's March 25-27 conference in Timisoara. Political life in Czecho-Slovakia seems to be proceeding in an orderly fashion along democratic lines. Since November 17, 1989, many political parties have been founded. Representatives of the most important parties were elected to parliament and have participated in the rebuilding of government institutions. Candidates from these parties also campaigned in the local and regional elections held in the autumn of 1990. Yet all is far from well. Each of the two victorious parties in the parliamentary elections — Civic Forum in the Czech lands and Public Against Violence (VPN) in Slovakia — recently experienced an internal split. These two movements played a crucial role in the events that followed November 17, and both sought to represent everyone eager for change. Civic Forum and VPN assumed that the majority of people were opposed to totalitarianism. The underlying features of their ideological stance, in my opinion, are anticommunism and “nonpolitical politics”. At the time of the Velvet Revolution, a movement incorporating all or at least the majority of antitotalitarian forces was clearly necessary to defeat the totalitarian regime. But Civic Forum and VPN are now paying the price for mistakes they made at the time of their inception. The decision not to have [pageend97]96 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 formal membership was their most serious error. The decisions taken by the two movements' leaders and activists were not submitted to a vote and, as a result, the actual extent of popular support for Civic Forum and VPN and the opinions of their supporters became clear only after the elections. Both groups are now trying to correct this problem. The absence of formal membership in both movements strongly reflects their philosophical underpinning: “nonpolitical politics,” an idea advanced above all in the essays and speeches of Václav Havel. Nonpolitical politics is based on moral, not political, beliefs. But, with the growth of political pluralism in Czecho-Slovakia, it has become a problematic idea to put into practice. Political pluralism is understood in Europe as competition for power among parties seeking to realize their particular visions of society. Civic responsibility, the main tenet of nonpolitical politics, does not offer, in itself, a specific vision of society. This nonpolitical stance was vital during the years of totalitarianism; it made possible the formation of the nucleus of a civil society. It taught the signatories of Charter 77 and their colleagues to be tolerant of different opinions, and made it possible for Charter to express views not necessarily shared by all its members. The idea of nonpolitical politics led the supporters of Charter to the realization that their main purpose was defending civil and human rights in the police state. Specifically, Charter's duty was to defend any individual imprisoned for his political views, regardless of those views. Most dissident groups in Czecho-Slovakia shared this goal. On the question of human and civil rights, they presented themselves as a united force. That they held a plurality of views was known inside the movement, but not expressed outside. Upholding the rule of law and complying with international agreements are not the main purposes of an ordinary political party. Adherence to these norms provides the foundations for social life within the state, but it does not provide an answer to how we ought to organize our economy, or how we should redress the injuries inflicted by the communist regime. Czechoslovak society has not yet fully understood a fundamental concept taken for granted in democratic societies: that unanimity is not required for deciding how to solve problems. Many people in Czecho-Slovakia are worried, even disgusted, by differences of opinion in the realm of politics, and have not come to terms with the contrasting approaches and solutions the various parties are advocating. They complain that the deputies to the Federal Assembly are unable to reach agreements, pass half-hearted laws, and come up with inadequate solutions. People wax nostalgic about November 1989, when citizens were united around a common goal. Public uncertainty is understandable. For several generations, the people of Czecho-Slovakia did not live in a pluralistic society. Political pluralism was absent, of course, during the Second World War, and the “national front” period that followed was hardly a pluralistic time. Some political parties survived after the communists seized power, but only as vassals of the communist [pageend98]THE END OF NONPOLITICAL POLITICS 97 party. Therefore, popular distrust of political parties — even distrust in general — hardly comes as a surprise. In the mid-1980s a thirty-year-old worker in a small town told me, “How can I believe you? The description of the situation in our country I hear on Western radio is totally different from the one Rudé právo gives. Who's telling the truth? I think the truth lies somewhere in the middle.” This is an example of the way many people in Czecho-Slovakia think, which is essentially a product of communist educational doctrine. In accordance with this doctrine, only finished truths were taught. Doubt was risky, as children quickly learned from their parents. The ability to form opinions on social matters for the majority of the population was stunted. With its propaganda machine, the state managed to block the development of social consciousness, much in the way Orwell depicts. The majority of Czechoslovak citizens have few clear ideas about politics or economics, about law or the constitution, and many fall prey to fantastic rumors. Journalists bear a large measure of responsibility for perpetuating such habits of thought. Even discounting those who collaborated with the security police, many journalists now working in the popular press are primarily concerned with their job security and are incapable of looking at matters from a larger perspective. Of course, some journalists are still linked to, or manipulated by, the remnants of the old police state. Charter 77 was denounced, last fall, by certain segments of the press for allowing “ideological diversion centers” and international freemasonry to control it. These attacks were often also anti-semitic: one article even drew upon the notorious “Protocols of the Elders of Zion.” Similar attacks have occurred almost simultaneously in all the other countries of the former East bloc. It is safe to assume that the KGB engineered the whole campaign, yet nobody paid much attention to it because, generally, our journalists are not in the habit of reading newspapers or magazines from other countries. The media are more concerned with sensation- alistic stories than with issues pertaining to the future of the nation. A further obstacle to the development of political pluralism in Czechoslovakia is the absence of an effective or influential left-wing party aside from the communist party. The term “left-wing” is itself vague; many people use it to describe the previous regime. Politicians who actually do hold left-wing views avoid using the term and sheepishly declare themselves to be in the center, seemingly unaware that a center implies the existence of two opposing poles. Proclaiming yourself to be on the left is not the best way to win popular support, but I believe the identification of the Left with the communist police state is fundamentally misleading. Totalitarian regimes, after all, have come from both the left and the right. I prefer to see left and right as two sides of the same coin. In the modern state, the right wing maintains that the individual is responsible for his own well-being and the rich have an obligation to help the poor. The left wing, on the other hand, insists that the state ought to provide support to the needy and that the welfare system cannot be based on charity. I think there is a good case to be made for each position — and that both [pageend99]98 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 are necessary. The absence of a genuine left-wing party in Czecho-Slovakia leaves the way open for demagoguery and exploitation of working-class grievances by the communists. Indeed, the leaders of the well-organized and well- financed communist party now speak about their desire to transform it into a modem left-wing party, but their efforts in parliament and their pronouncements belie their words. I believe it is important for the development of Czecho-Slovakia's civic culture that the Left organize itself and present a program to the nation. Only the Left would be able to challenge the demagoguery of certain right-wing politicians who have lately come to exercise a strong influence on public opinion. The difficulties confronting the development of democratic pluralism in Czecho-Slovakia are in many respects similar to the difficulties the other nations of the former East Bloc are experiencing. The nationalities issue is perhaps the most important challenge facing us. Nationalism has long been a problem in Central Europe; communism only succeeded in suppressing nationalist passions. But once communist oppression came to an end, nationalism returned to the fore; now we must come to terms with long-unsolved problems and long-standing injustices. Some political parties have mixed strictly political aims with nationalist concerns; as a result, groups espousing similar nationalist goals often have very different political orientations. We need more information about how other East European countries are dealing with these problems, including former members of the security police. I know from my own work at the Ministry of Internal Affairs that some people have tried to conflate this problem with nationalist issues. I was surprised to learn that my colleagues in Poland and Hungary have had to cope with similar problems. It is important that the public become more aware of the common heritage bequeathed to us by four decades of communism, and the problems confronting all the nations of the former Eastern bloc. More information about developments in other countries will help the public judge the performance of their own political leaders. And by increasing the public's knowledge and ability to judge, we reduce the chances that demagoguery and extremism will dominate the political scene. [pageend100]CZECHO-SLOVAKIA THE COMMUNISTS ARE PLAYING DEAD by Jan Urban Mr. Urban is a former opposition activist and presently an editorial writer for the Czech daily Lidové noviny. The following article appeared in the March 2, 1991 issue of that paper. A while ago we obtained a floppy disc, containing the equivalent of 110 typewritten pages of information, that was issued by the central committee of the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM). The central committee's spokesman, Petr Vilhelm, confirmed that the central committee is sending such discs to all 75 party district organizations of the Czech Republic every week. In turn, each district sends back detailed situation reports. This information, which is also stored on computer discs, is hand-delivered. “You should not send discs with recorded information by mail but deliver them by hand,” we read at the beginning of one of the texts. “In exceptional cases the disc can be given to a specific employee of the executive commission of the KSCM central committee.” Petr Vilhelm says that “this is not a case of secret instructions or information, ’ ’ and any citizen can have a look at them at any district secretariat of the KSCM. At a time when other parties are being weakened by internal conflicts, the communist party is working hard and efficiently. It keeps a low profile, steering clear of open conflicts with the government and other political parties. As a matter of fact, one doesn't hear much at all about the communist party these days. After all the defeats of the recent past, it has only one way to regain its political influence: to “play dead” for now and prepare to exploit the sen[pageend101]100 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 sitive issues that are certain to arise during the coming period of economic hardship. The party is doing so by building a disciplined organization and information network. The Czech government, on the other hand, doesn't receive information from the districts on a regular basis, and has no research organization to prepare analyses of the political situation. Only last February did it decide to publish a bulletin for district and local governments. The prime minister receives security briefs from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, but nothing more. The federal government gets only weekly evaluations of media coverage of its activity. The president's chancellery has its own information department, but it concentrates mainly on analyzing specific problems. The federal parliament has only a media-monitoring service and reports from its members. No other political party or institution is provided with the systematic, in-depth, and timely analyses that the communist party receives, and none are planning to establish an information network on a similar scale. In politics information is power. Those who don't have information can only guess at the course events will take, and must make their decisions blindly. I cannot emphasize enough how many opportunities this leaves for demagoguery, empty promises, and ideological arguments. On the other hand, those who have information at their disposal will be able to recognize problems sooner, and thus will have more time to solve them.

[pageend103]POLAND interview with HENRYK MAJEWSKI Henryk Majewski is the Polish Minister of Interna] Affairs and formerly a Solidarity activist from Gdaňsk involved in the documentation of government abuses during the 1980s. The following interview was conducted by Józef Orzel and Robert Te- rentiew, and appeared in the March 1,1991 issue of the Polish weekly Tygodnik Soli- darnošč. I FEEL LIKE A COP MYSELF TS The police still doesn 't get good press. What legal changes are needed to make it effective? MAJEWSKI The police is governed by laws that were enacted in 1989. We struggled for the freedom of the individual and we achieved it. But as a result, policemen, citizens, and thieves now enjoy this freedom. Thieves have an excellent knowledge of the law. It was right to liberalize the law, but we're not ready for it. Above all, we need to curb the bureaucracy. So for now I'm not going to speak about necessary legal changes. A committee is being formed at the level of the interior and justice ministries to look into these matters. The law must be enforced. TS I would like to live in a country in which no one need be embarrassed about being a policeman. Do you think Poland is such a country? [pageend104]I FEEL LIKE A COP MYSELF 103 MAJEWSKI No. But I've noticed that the odium that has long hung over the police is slowly beginning to fade away. People have begun to turn to their local police. In the past, children didn't admit that their fathers worked for the Ministry of Internal Affairs, but now it makes no difference. This change in public attitude depends to a great extent upon the press, not just us. TS Obviously, courting the public's sympathy is not the chief task of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. MAJEWSKI That's true. But it's essential that we publicize our activities so that people know who they're dealing with. This is the press office's job. We also hold meetings with citizens' committees and local government bodies; we work with the Solidarity leadership at the regional level; and we go to the factories to recruit young, capable people. This is only the beginning. The public must have the opportunity to evaluate the work of the police. TS When your predecessor assumed his position, he found an empty desk and the smell of burnt paper in his office. What did you find? MAJEWSKI Minister Kozlowski filled me in on all important issues of the day. He passed on to me the documentation related to the more important problems that he had faced. Also, I was able to talk with people. He hadn't been so lucky — he hadn't been able to talk with his predecessor. TS The Office for the Protection of the State (UOP) is an arm of the Ministry of Internal Affairs established in April 1990 to replace the security police (SB). The UOP conducts both intelligence and counterintelligence operations. Andrzej Milczanowski, who heads the UOP, states that his agency is apolitical. Is the entire ministry, including yourself, apolitical? MAJEWSKI Declarations in themselves don't mean anything. But it is true that there is no political activity in the ministry at present because there are no political parties. There used to be the Polish United Work[pageend105]104 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 ers' Party and everyone, whether they wanted to or not, had to belong to it. The ministry now has many new employees with various backgrounds, who have never publicly articulated their opinions. Prospective employees are required to withdraw from all political activity, even from the Freedom and Peace movement or Solidarity. It is also impermissible for ministry officials to pressure their subordinates into professing any particular political views. TS Has the category of “enemy of the system’’ indeed disappeared? In the democratic United States, for example, the FBI keeps the communists under surveillance. MAJEWSKI You are still in the realm of stereotypes — that the security police existed to track down opponents of the system. Who are the opponents of the system today? Well, that's difficult to determine. They could be internal or external enemies. It's the job of the UOP to keep close tabs on foreign intelligence agencies, and not only the Soviets'. There are various groups in our country — the anarchists, for example — who start public disturbances. As long as these are only demonstrations that neither threaten peoples' lives nor break the law, they have the right to organize them. Of course these extremist groups are under surveillance, but this cannot be exploited [by the government] for political purposes. Our democracy is very young, which is why we must act with particular caution. TS Do we face the threat of a counterrevolution, of a Fifth Column? Don't the people of the old regime, who lost everything, want to return to power? MAJEWSKI There is a threat, but not of the sort suggested by your question. The system has been disintegrating since 1987-1988, and its adherents have been taking over factories and other state properties, forming their own companies, and attaining economic power and influence. Today these companies — whether we call them nomenklatura-owned or not — are beyond the reach of all regulation. Thus the nomenklatura's seizure of economic power, its ability to determine which branches of production or foreign trade will be developed, could have consequences as dangerous as a coup ďétat, a highly unlikely event. We must control events, but this is a difficult task since we lack specialized departments and per[pageend106]UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 105 sonnel. Counterintelligence has a lot to say in this matter. Up until 1988, there were departments within the police whose job it was to combat economic crimes. Such departments would prove useful now. Currently we are going through a transitional phase, thus counterintelligence and economic police are urgently needed. But in the future, this will be the job for treasury department officers. TS What most upsets people is your ministry's policy regarding personnel. There are many rumors about this policy. For example, is it true that Marian Zacharski, a Polish agent of the former regime who obtained blueprints of American rockets for the Soviets, is regarded as a good patriot by the UOP and will soon obtain a position there? MAJEWSKI The ministry's policy regarding personnel is very clear: competence and loyalty. In the matter of Zacharski one should ask, first of all, whether he really was an agent of the KGB. There is absolutely no proof of this. He worked for Polish intelligence and obtained very important documents. The fact that we can't draw any benefit from this is another matter. But to accuse him of collaborating with foreign security services does him an injustice. In general, these are very delicate matters — after all, intelligence agents are in the field and they shouldn't feel as if they are in danger. A little while ago I spoke with a high-ranking officer of the CIA who visited us. I asked him how one should speak about the activities of agents. He replied that the only diplomatic answer was neither to confirm their actions nor to deny them. TS Did Zacharski really work for us? Is it we who needed the blueprints for Patriot missiles, or is it the Soviet Union ? Could Zacharski possibly be unaware of this? MAJEWSKI I will say once more that we have no evidence that Zacharski worked for any security service other than Poland's. TS In the West, banks, government tax agencies, and insurance agencies have their own investigative departments. Such departments have not yet been established in Poland. Is someone regulating foreign investment in Poland? We may someday discover that a Polish [pageend107]106 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 factory has been bought by the mafia or a Western front organization of the KGB. MAJEWSKI Why go so far afield? There are companies here in Poland among whose shareholders are representatives of Soviet interests. Those who know the history and the habits of the Soviet state would conclude that one of the reasons for getting involved in these economic initiatives is the opportunity they provide to conduct intelligence operations. Are we able to build intelligence agencies like those of Western countries or the Soviet Union? I think we can, but it's a question of time. We need professionals who are well versed in finance and contract law. There are many dangers: in the absence of adequate regulation foreigners could buy us up for pennies. This is why people must realize the importance of our security service. We must not search high and low for agents and former agents. Instead, we should create a positive atmosphere around our activities, so that the people whom we send abroad to study don't have to be ashamed to work for us after they return. TS Rumor has it that the Russian mafia has entered our market. MAJEWSKI We can't look only for the Russian mafia. As far as organized crime is concerned, we are already part of Europe. Take a look at Gdansk, Katowice, or Warsaw, where scores are being settled mafia-style. But even those whose lives are in immediate danger, and whose safety the police could guarantee, refuse to come to the police and cooperate with them. We need policemen who won't be bribed by criminal networks of narcotics smugglers or auto thieves. TS In order to attract untainted people to the ministry of internal af- fdirs, the ministry itself must be untainted, which brings us back once more to the matter of personnel policy. Milczanowski urges us to trust former SB agents who now work for the UOP. Until recently such a position would have been considered a bad joke. The appointment of General Zdzislaw Sarewicz to head the UOP post in Moscow is a real joke. Colonel Ryszard Kukliňski, who defected to the West in 1981, wrote that Sarewicz was a high ranking officer in the security service who helped make preparations for martial law. As late as 1990 he was the head of counterintelligence. [pageend108]I FEEL LIKE A COP MYSELF 107 Isn't he all too well connected with the KGB? MAJEWSKI Do you think we can rebuild our operations in Moscow exclusively with the help of new people? Sarewicz is experienced. TS We know that. But do we trust him? MAJEWSKI Gentlemen don't speak about such matters. Even over drinks. We Poles are often naively candid. And we don't think pragmatically. For example, we cut off Moscow from the government and police telephone networks. Sometimes it is necessary to make rapid contact — for instance, concerning the transit of Soviet troops. Every government uses people who were once its opponents. Perhaps many doubts will be dispelled by the fact that barely three people remain from the leadership of the old ministry, and these people hold civilian posts. That's all I can say; History will judge the rest. TS Or the next government will. Do you mean that the ministry takes responsibility for the loyalty of these people ? MAJEWSKI Yes. It's a government office, and every government office is under the supervision of another government office. TS Does someone in internal affairs control the UOP? MAJEWSKI Yes, I am the UOP's immediate supervisor. There is also the Inspectorate of Supervision and Control within the ministry. And first and foremost, there is parliament. TS If during your administration a scandal like the Tyminski affair occurred, would you resign? MAJEWSKI You can't put the matter in such terms. After all, Tymiriski's participation in the elections wasn't a crime. Which doesn't mean that [pageend109]108 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 we didn't keep an eye on him. But it's not for the ministry of internal affairs to decide who can run for office and who can't. The law must decide. After what happened during the last elections some kind of legal mechanisms must be enacted to prevent such surprises. Perhaps we should evaluate the views of every candidate? In accordance with the law, of course. But such an initiative would have to come from parliament. If it came from the police, it would mean we were returning to the old ways of doing things. TS Employees of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stationed abroad often work for the intelligence service. Is the replacement of diplomatic personnel being held up because of the shortage of qualified personnel in your ministry? MAJEWSKI In part, yes. TS What has happened to the riot police? People say that their barracks in Warsaw are empty. MAJEWSKI On August 1, 1990 the riot police, formerly known as ZOMO, came into existence under their new name — Prevention Squads. The officer corps of the former ZOMO were admitted to positions within the new service, provided they fulfilled certain criteria. Unfortunately, the rest of the service has yet to be manned. This is a dilemma — we are trying to create a professional riot police corps, but we don't have enough candidates for the several thousand positions that are open. TS Are there any matters that we have failed to touch on? MAJEWSKI Yes, mainly the matter of our relations with the press. I am looking for a new formula for mutual understanding. I've had good experiences with the press in Gdansk, particularly with the new papers like Tygodnik Gdaňski and Gazeta Gdaňska. The old papers don't have the credibility that these do. We need to settle accounts, but we also need to concentrate on our current problems. The press can command authority if it provides reliable information quickly. It has managed to convince the heads of some of the provincial [pageend110]I FEEL LIKE A COP MYSELF 109 police forces — though not without difficulty — that they must give the press access to information, so that newspapers don't spread rumors. We, on the other hand, would like to see the press write about the successes, and not just the failures, of the police. We strive to answer all questions, and when we can't, we ask for your forbearance. ^^Ka»^in«.WATYwvy we/ifcwiK ^•L.irvciwy The first POLISH CONSERVATIVE monthly magazine.

Stefan Savov, 66, is chairman of the Democratic Party. They represent, respectively, the left and right wings of the Bulgarian opposition grouped under the umbrella of the UDF. The interview was conducted for Uncaptive Minds by the Bulgarian journalist Katia Mitova at the end of February 1991. THE BULGARIAN OPPOSITION: TWO POINTS OF VIEW UM How would you characterize your party in relation to the other parties in Bulgaria? How does it compare to parties with a similar political profile in other countries? DERTLIEV Our party has a tradition going back 100 years. In contrast to other social democratic parties, our party — from the moment it was established — emphasized its reformist character. It advocated a democratic state structure, opposed dictatorship, and strove for economic pluralism with cooperatives as the basic unit of economic production. Cooperatives enjoyed great success here in Bulgaria before World War II. After Belgium, Bulgaria had the second most developed cooperative system in Europe. Following the war, the com[pageend113]112 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 munists brutally put an end to the system, although they kept up the appearance of cooperativism. At present, the Bulgarian Social Democratic Party does not differ conceptually from the parties of the Socialist International. Like the socialist parties of all countries, it is the only force in Bulgaria that can wage a real struggle against the communists. It must absorb the communists' supporters and steer them away from the extreme left to the political center, transforming their predilection for violence into tolerance and democracy. Instead of faith in the state and the monopoly of the party, the socialists must champion the equality of different forms of ownership. The Bulgarian Social Democratic Party has achieved greater and lesser successes towards accomplishing these goals. It can be proud of its completely modern ideology, which was modem even in the past; it can be proud of the successes it has achieved in the sphere of social welfare when social democrats were ministers. SAVOV The Democratic Party was established by the outstanding Bulgarian politician Petko Karavelov in 1896. It is heir to the ideological tradition of the Liberal Party, which was established in the 1880s, and may thus be considered the oldest of the currently existing political parties in Bulgaria. The Democratic Party has fought for a constitutional, parliamentary government; it has fought against regimes that have concentrated inordinate power in the hands of individuals; it has opposed dictatorship and totalitarianism. During its long history, the Democratic Party has never sullied itself with conspiracies, coups, or violence. The Democratic Party believes that the government established on September 9, 1944 was illegal, because it was not established by the freely expressed electoral will of the people. The party also does not recognize the outcome of the referendum that eliminated the monarchy or the so-called people's court and the verdicts that it handed down. The Democratic Party never accepted any of the dogmas of Marxism, and it is convinced that socialism has faded completely, both as an ideology and as a political system. The Democratic Party is not a party of any specific social group. It is a national party of the right in which all enterprising citizens wdl find their true place. We accord primacy to the inviolability of private property, free initiative, and a market economy, although we also support social welfare for those in need. We advocate a multiparty parlia[pageend114]THE BULGARIAN OPPOSITION 113 mentary system, the division of state powers, and the right of every citizen to participate directly or indirectly in government, without regard to social, racial, ethnic, or religious background. In the realm of foreign affairs, we are fighting for Bulgaria's inclusion in the institutions of the European Community, which are based on Christian values of universal significance. The Democratic Party shares an ideological affinity with the Christian- Democratic parties of Europe. UM What events in your life contributed to the formation of your political outlook? How did you become the leader of your party? DERTLIEV Ever since my early youth I have been a social democrat. I have been through all the vicissitudes a political activist could experience in Bulgaria: legal and illegal activity, arrests before and after the war, prisons, concentration camps. I have been in more or less all of the prisons and camps in the country. Through it all I remained a social democrat. Of course, my family background influenced me. You might say that I inherited social democracy: my father was a leader of the socialist trade union movement, and in our home we breathed social democracy with the air — we discussed it all the time. I have also experienced tragedy: the loss of spiritual sons, of individuals whom I had prepared as my spiritual successors. I was active politically as a prisoner as well as a free man. The authorities transferred me from prison to prison because I “had a bad influence on the young.” In this fashion, they presented me with new students; I should really be thankful to them for this. Unfortunately, two of the most talented people who were supposed to take my place perished before me. The one who should have become the party's theoretician, a true talent, Angel Dyakov, committed suicide in prison. There was another, a bom party leader — but he died at the age of 50. Thus, to a certain extent, I owe my position as party leader to the tragic losses in our ranks. I don't know whether I possess the qualities of a leader, but I certainly wish these two could be by my side today. SAVOV To have a proper understanding of the views I hold today, it's necessary to take a look at my family's past. Five generations of my ancestors were active socially and politically. Many of them were [pageend115]114 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 imprisoned for their activities; a few perished. I belong to the third generation of parliamentarians in my family. My decision to be politically active is completely natural. But there are other, more important reasons. My main interests have always been politics, sociology, and history. The totalitarian system imposed on Bulgaria did not give anyone who deviated from the official line the opportunity to be politically active. Only now, when I am in my sixties, can I be the politician that I feel I was bom to be. UM What do you think of the government's stem economic measures? DERTLIEV We social democrats differ somewhat from others in our approach to economic reform. We all agree that we must build a market economy, but it should be a social market economy. The people implementing reform themselves understand that reform would be impossible without a social welfare system. The absence of social measures in the vast project of reform could lead to unrest. In the matter of privatization — specifically the restitution of land — we believe it should be returned to its rightful owners. Bulgarian peasants, however, hold a broad range of views concerning this problem. The peasants would like to have land for their own use. But many of them also want to join cooperatives and other free associations, to return to the healthy, prewar cooperative traditions that existed here. SAVOV We did not put forth any of our own candidates for ministerial posts, and we did not participate in the formation of the government. We have called for a government of experts, not political personalities. Nonetheless, we support the government's economic program because there is no alternative. The two previous governments, headed by communist prime minister Andrei Lukanov, delayed the implementation of reforms, which was criminal. Lukanov should have begun the process of reform right from the start. The UDF ministers who are implementing economic reform have accepted a great responsibility; they deserve our complete support. In the UDF's original economic program, privatization and demonopolization of the large state-owned enterprises were to precede liberalization of prices. But all of these reforms have been delayed, significantly delayed, and now we have to make up for everything the Lukanov government failed to do. The most important thing now is to boldly implement demonopolization and privatization, [pageend116]THE BULGARIAN OPPOSITION 115 especially in small and mid-sized enterprises, because these measures will help check the rise in unemployment. UM Are you satisfied with the work of the Grand National Assembly? DERTLIEV Our parliament is not ideal; people chatter too much and say too many absurd things. But this is a parliament that has been reactivated after 55 years during which democratic political life did not exist. Even in the period immediately before the war, Bulgaria lacked a normal political culture. Considering the conditions under which our parliament has been reactivated and the ingrained patterns and habits of our people, I believe that it is a good parliament. And I am convinced the time will come when people will say: those people devised a good constitution. SAVOV I am not satisfied with the work of parliament. We are still stuck in the same place. Why? The blame falls primarily on the shoulders of the Bulgarian Socialist Party, the renamed communists. They are doing everything possible to slow down the implementation of political and economic reform. Such behavior is to be expected. After all, most of them don't wish to part with their special privileges. Many are also trying to transform their political power into economic power by, among other methods, creating joint-stock companies with party capital. For this, they need more time. UM Does Bulgaria have a chance, after so many years of political interference by external forces, to determine its own fate? Isn't there a danger that economic difficulties will make it dependent on other countries once more? DERTLIEV Bulgaria has more than just an opportunity to choose its own path — it has the ability to do so and, what's more, the obligation. We should not succumb to siren songs, regardless of where they come from. There is no easy way. I see no particular danger that we will become economically dependent. We are not a young maiden being courted by crowds of suitors. We are not the object of any particular aggression. I feel it is entirely possible that we can strike an equitable balance with our foreign partners. [pageend117]116 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 In general, I am an optimist. That I am here today speaking with you attests to the fact that I have always been an optimist. SAVOV Responsibility for the disastrous state of the country lies with the totalitarian regime the Soviet Union imposed on us after World War II. It is no coincidence that other European countries from the socialist camp find themselves in the same situation. However, I cannot overlook the West's contribution to our predicament. It was the Western powers that acquiesced to Stalin's plans, and Western passivity that allowed him to construct his empire, which only now, after nearly half a century, has collapsed under the weight of economic reality. Does Bulgaria have a chance to determine its own fate? Our country has lost everything several times over because it was much too closely tied to certain great powers, so now we feel that the solution lies in Bulgaria's incorporation into the structures of Europe. Bulgaria's problems will best be solved when we take our place in a politically and economically integrated Europe.

It is based on an interview conducted with Smaranda Enache, a Romanian puppet theater director and opposition activist from Cluj. Off one end of Tirgu Mures's main square stands a modest yellow building housing the city's puppet theater. Inside, strains of music and applause waft up to theater director Smaranda Enache's office on the second floor. This small, two-room suite is a refuge for Enache, who spends six hours a day immersed in the business of spinning tales for audiences too young to hate. Every day at 2:00, however, she returns to the activity that saps her energy and strains her optimistic spirit: the search for a solution to the ethnic problems that have torn her city apart. Smaranda Enache's life is a tale of Transylvania, a land that Romanians and Hungarians alike claim as the cradle of their culture. Romanian by birth and multicultural by upbringing, Enache emerged from the December 1989 revolution as an advocate of democracy and interethnic reconciliation in this city of 200,000, which is just about evenly divided between Romanian and Hungarian speakers. She is the Romanian who has stood up most consistently and publicly for the rights of Romania's Hungarian minority. It's a stance that has required courage on her part. Slanderous articles, hate mail, and threatening telephone calls followed her first interviews on television in the weeks after the revolution, and have not let up since. “The Hun- [pageend120]A TRANSYLVANIAN LIFE 119 garian party's chauvinist spokesman” is how one nationalist newspaper described her. Another deemed her a ‘‘zealous Securitate informer.” Enache admits that the vehemence of the attacks has frightened her. But she prefers to talk about the tragedy the city and the whole country are living through. ‘‘This city is paralyzed from every point of view: people are very suspicious, many friendships have ended, and even families have fallen apart because of this conflict,” she says. ‘‘We are the victims of a confrontation that is not ours.” The conflict Enache watched brewing for years exploded onto the world's television screens in March 1990, when Romanians and Hungarians clashed on the streets of Tirgu Mures for two days, leaving several dead and hundreds wounded. But Enache insists that the real struggle in Tirgu Mures today is between democracy and dictatorship. The ethnic coloring only makes the wounds that much more difficult to heal. Many of the key Hungarian actors in and around last March's blowup have left Romania, hounded out by threats. Others have left in despair. From time to time, Enache, too, has been tempted to leave Tirgu Mures. She is needed in Bucharest, to help organize the country's newest opposition grouping, the Civic Alliance. In some ways, life there would be easier for Enache: she would be surrounded by Romania's small band of human rights activists, have access to the lively independent press, and be much less isolated than she is in this small provincial city. But she has big plans for Tirgu Mures. Enache's immediate goal is to open an independent, Romanian-language newspaper to counterbalance the nation[pageend121]120 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 alist local press. The obstacles are great: her paper will have to share the city's only printing plant, and will have to rely on the local authorities — people who have exploited nationalist passions — for supplies of paper and printing time. She will have to find journalists willing, like she is, to risk slander, threats, and even physical attacks for publishing the facts, not to mention their own views. And not the least of her problems will be funding. Enache also wants to open an institute for interethnic dialogue in Tirgu Mures. As she conceives it, scholars who travel to Bucharest or Budapest would also stop here for conferences and workshops. Grassroots work with local citizens would round out academic discussions. Such an institute could magnify the rare gift she brings to the Romanian democratic oppositions ensitivity to the deep rifts between classes, professions, generations, and ethnic and religious groups — rifts that have made it easy for dictators to rule this country. She understands the psychologies of both oppressor and oppressed, which coexist in the inhabitants of Transylvania, whether Hungarian or Romanian. And she is free of the intellectual elitism — and isolation — that have limited the popularity and effectiveness of much of Romania's opposition. ★ ★ ★ Enache was born in 1950 and grew up in Reghin, a town about 20 miles northeast of Tirgu Mure$. She remembers her elementary school, which offered Romanian, Hungarian, and German classes, as a tolerant place. She performed with a local folk dance troupe, and felt she changed national identities each time she changed dance costumes. The children only rarely separated into national groups, and when they did — during schoolyard fights, for example — they kept it from their teachers. When one teacher made an anti-Semitic remark in front of the one Jewish pupil in the school, the teacher was transferred. “It was a consciously antinationalist time,” recalls Enache. It wasn't until the early 1970s that Enache noticed nationalism creeping into Romanian life. She remembers talking to her Hungarian friends about her feeling that “something wasn't right”; she carefully avoided the subject with her Romanian friends. Her life started to split in two as the Romanian and Hungarian communities were increasingly subjected to nationalist demagoguery. The first signs of the new nationalism were evident as early as 1965, the year that Nicolae Ceaujescu came to power. Banned national songs were once again permitted. The Romanian flag was flown in more public places. The works of patriotic Romanian writers that had been unobtainable began to show up in bookstores and libraries. Enache calls this period, which Romanians fondly remember, “the first phase of the nationalist transformation of Romanian culture.” It was a benign enough return to national values. Unfortunately, the “second phase” soon followed, which was not so benign. The works of every writer [pageend122]A TRANSYLVANIAN LIFE 121 who had emigrated were tom out of school curricula and theater repertories. After a while, the only cultural figures accorded any recognition were those willing to serve Ceaujescu's personality cult. An artificial folklore gradually crowded out genuine Romanian culture. “Real Romanian culture was amputated,” says Enache. There was artificial Western-style popular culture as well. Enache smiles as she recalls the concerts of Adrian Paunescu, one of Ceaujescu's court poets. At a time when rock music was out of favor with the authorities, Paunescu performed rock songs with lyrics such as “Ceau^escu, our helmsman” in hysterical, nationalistic performances all over the country. Young concert-goers joined in his chants of “Lumina, lupta, libertate” (Light, struggle, liberty), pumping their right forearms into the air as if they were saluting, with thumb and forefinger outstretched to form a backwards L. But the authorities wanted more than just an artificial culture. “The ethnic homogenization of the population was achieved very rapidly,” says Enache. “Ceau$escu even invented the titles ‘Romanian of Hungarian origin,’ ‘Romanian of German origin,’ and so on. It was an American model, which is perfectly fine in the United States where there is equality of opportunity, but which is much more difficult to realize in European nations, which are very sensitive about their cultural traditions and identities.” Enache says that Tirgu Mure§ was predestined to be the focus of the Romanian assimilation campaign because it had been the capital of the Hungarian Autonomous Region, which existed from 1952 to 1968. The region was created in the Stalinist mold: its territory did not coincide with the greatest concentration of Hungarians in Romania, although the capital was overwhelmingly Hungarian in ethnic composition and culture. “This was the city that Romanians didn't like, because it represented the Stalinism of Hungarians against Romanians,” Enache explains. Hungarians held the leading positions in the autonomous region — in the local government, the police, and the Securitate — and they were the ones who introduced restrictive measures at the local level. “What's a Hungarian to the local Romanians who suffered in those times? ‘The communist pig who came to collectivize them.’” But the tables were turned on the Hungarians. “Ceau^escu's homogenization specialists almost achieved miracles. In this city, where the vast majority of the population in the 1950s was Hungarian, they forcibly mixed the population until a 50:50 Hungarian-Romanian ratio was achieved. Hungarians were politically and economically quarantined: they were no longer directors or party secretaries. Ceaujescu began to lose confidence and eliminated Hungarians from the communist structures.” Through the 1970s and 1980s, zealous Romanian nationalism swept through the country's political life, culture, and educational system, alienating the country's 2-million-strong Hungarian minority. Tirgu Mure§ became the main stag[pageend123]122 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 ing area for Romanian nationalist campaigns against this minority. But as such, it became the most likely site for a Hungarian minority backlash as soon as the opportunity arose. December 1989 presented that opportunity. ★ ★ ★ Like many others in Tirgu Mures, Smaranda Enache first learned of the uprising in Timisoara on December 18, 1989, when Radio Free Europe started broadcasting news of army and police massacres of anti-Ceausescu demonstrators. There had been tension in the air since the end of October, when the Fourteenth Romanian Communist Party Congress re-elected Ceausescu in a shower of praise. This was in stark contrast to what was happening in neighboring states. Also, another winter of cold and deprivation was approaching. When even Bulgaria umed toward democracy, Romanians felt that they could no longer remain passive prisoners in the last communist outpost in East-Central Europe. In the wake of the massacre at Timisoara, they took to the streets. Enache remembers December 21, 1989 well. “It was a strong proletarian movement: mostly young people and workers; the intellectuals were on the fringes.” Yet everyone — workers, intellectuals, Hungarians, and Romanians — stood together as they faced the police, the Securitate, the fire trucks, and later the tanks. By evening, when the tear gas and the bullets came, the crowds had thinned. Six demonstrators died that night on Tirgu Mures's main square. The revolution awakened dormant hopes among all groups in Romania's divided society. For the peasants, it presented an opportunity to regain land the state had collectivized years ago. For the workers, it offered a chance to win back the wages that had been whittled away over the years and to shorten the work week from six and even seven days to five. For the intellectuals, the revolution meant an end to enforced silence. Everybody was free to speak, and they spoke everywhere, at the top of their lungs. The eerily quiet streets of the past decade were now the scenes of impassioned discussions. “It was as if we were flying,” recalls Enache. The Hungarian minority, like their Romanian countrymen, gave voice to a wide range of pent-up demands. But one demand stood out head and shoulders above the rest: the return of Hungarian-language teaching from nursery school through university. Within days of the revolution, the Hungarians had established an impressive political organization, the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR). Rallying around the language issue, the UDMR was strengthened by a unity of purpose unmatched by any other political grouping. Moreover, there was no competition for the Hungarian vote; just as the Union made no effort to attract members of other nationalities, none of the other parties attempted to win over the Hungarians. The Hungarians were in a separate political [pageend124]A TRANSYLVANIAN LIFE 123 world. They were highly visible, and highly successful — at first — in bringing their concerns to the top of the political agenda. Initially they got on well with Ion Iliescu, Romania's new leader, and they were pleased with the minority rights policies the National Salvation Front (FSN) had spelled out in its first communiqué. The Hungarians had a further advantage: they had been systematically weeded out of leading positions in politics, economics, and culture during the Ceausescu era. “After the revolution, when they wanted to replace a director, it was easier to find a Hungarian who had not been compromised from a political point of view, because Hungarians had been quarantined. So they found Hungarians pretty quickly. After two or three spectacular cases in the big factories of this city, where the compromised Romanian directors were replaced by Hungarians who were less compromised, it was very clear that if this process didn't stop, the Romanians in the nomenklatura would lose their positions. ’ ’ “So they appealed to people's emotions. They set up an organization, Vatra Romanesca (Romanian Hearth), whose known members are like any other people — painters, doctors, lawyers. But deep inside this organization there is all this scaffolding of economic and political interests, and people continue to be controlled by them.” “This is the city where Vatra Romanesca was founded. It's easy to appeal to people's memories here, because there were atrocities by Horthy's [the Hungarian leader from 1919 to 1944] troops, which occupied the northern part of Transylvania in 1940.” The fear of history repeating itself, together with the fear of incurring the wrath of the local authorities, who below the highest echelons remained virtually unchanged from the Ceausescu era, pulled many Transylvanian Romanians into Vatra Romanesca. These fears swelled during the postrevolutionary months, radicalizing even tolerant people who had simply joined to express their attachment to Romanian culture. Though Romanians and Hungarians had been united during the revolution, Enache knew it would be extremely difficult to maintain this unity. As early as January 1990, she warned of the conflict brewing around Bolyai High School in Tirgu Mure§. Until 1959, classes in this school had been taught exclusively in Hungarian. Since then, they have been taught in both Hungarian and Romanian. Tirgu Mure§ has a traditional Romanian high school as well. At the first meeting of the UDMR's Tirgu Mure^'s chapter, a Hungarian deputy minister of education from Bucharest told a local television reporter that “conditions already existed for those schools which had traditionally been Hungarian to become exclusively Hungarian once more.” High school students, including Enache's 17-year-old son, had participated in the revolution, and they came out of it with ideas and aspirations of their own. During the first ten days of January, Tirgu Mures high school students gathered to discuss proposals to reform Romanian education. The Hungarian [pageend125]124 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 students at Bolyai High School asked the non-Hungarians whether the school could be returned to all-Hungarian teaching. The Romanian students initially assented. But when the students met a second time, at a Romanian school, the school's principal protested the students' decision to split the schools, and initiated a media campaign against “educational separatism.” The local cultural committee of the National Salvation Front met on January 19 to discuss the schools question. It issued a communiqué announcing that classes at Bolyai High School would be taught exclusively in Hungarian as of the next school year. Enache had crafted the compromise. “If Romanian children were shown the door immediately, it would have been a jarring personal experience,” she reasoned. “This accident in their lives would turn them into chauvinists.” But the compromise came too late. Hungarians, encouraged by the deputy minister of education and nervous about the local Romanians' stiffening position on the schools, wanted to take back their traditional schools immediately. Explaining the Hungarians' rigid stance, Tirgu Mure? UDMR vice-president István Király says, “We'd had enough. It was like a toothache. We knew we could try antibiotics, but the pain from the preceding years was so great, we decided to yank. We had no guarantee that the situation in the schools wouldn't be the same in five years as it had been under Ceau§escu. This is why separate schools were needed.” Transylvanian Hungarian newspapers supported the Hungarians' demands, justifying them by pointing out the decline of Hungarian-language education, publishing, and culture as a result of Ceaujescu's assimilation policies. “But Romanian public opinion was not prepared,” says Enache. “Romanians didn't understand the homogenization that had taken place. They weren't the authors of it; perhaps they were the instruments. They knew one thing: that Romanians are the masters of this land. The Romanians were shocked to learn that the Hungarians wanted their own school.” “The Romanian press began to print articles to scare Romanians: ‘Things will be as they were in 1940! [when northern Transylvania was taken over by an undemocratic Hungary allied with Nazi Germany]. How far will this separatism go — to separate sidewalks for Hungarians and Romanians?’” On January 24, during a meeting with Romanian teachers, Enache gave her second television interview on the schools question. Among other things, she stated that Tirgu Mure$ could become the Nagorno-Karabakh of Europe. The local television station sent a tape of the interview to Bucharest to be broadcast during the Hungarian-language program. Instead, Romanian television broadcast the interview on prime time in Romanian after having tendentiously edited it. That was on January 28, the same day that miners and other workers first came to Bucharest and ransacked the opposition parties' headquarters. That night she received the first telephone [pageend126]A TRANSYLVANIAN LIFE 125 threats. Starting the next day, Hungarian and Romanian students began to accompany her to the theater for protection. At the beginning of February, a representative of one of the three strong prewar parties to re-emerge in postrevolutionary Romania warned the minorities not to demand new rights, because the new government that was to be elected in the spring might not accept them. “So the Hungarians thought the ruling National Salvation Front would be a better ally,” Enache sighs. “They thought they had to get as many concessions as possible before the elections.” On February 6, local Hungarian students went on strike and tried to close down their schools to press the issue of all-Hungarian instruction. The Romanian students said they wanted the schools to remain open. Both sides put up insulting posters about one another in the school. Enache asked the students to accept her as a mediator. She guided the initial discussion, between five Romanian and five Hungarian students, which lasted over two and a half hours. Enache sensed that by this point, the Hungarian students were inclined to wait until September, even if their parents were not. But the Romanians' position had radicalized. They came out firmly against separate schools. “This was a turning point,” says Enache. “People had become so fana- ticized that it was impossible even to have a dialogue.” Protests and counter- protests became increasingly frequent. On February 8, Vatra Romanesca held its first mass meeting, in the Tirgu Mures sports hall. Speaker after speaker struck the theme of the separatist danger posed by the Hungarians who, they said, wanted to bring Transylvania closer to Hungary. The Hungarians held their own demonstration for Hungarian schools on February 10. In mid-February, Káraly Király, a UDMR leader from Tirgu Mure$ who knew Iliescu from the days when they were both high-ranking members of the Romanian Communist Party, warned the president of the explosive tension in this region. He called on the central government to take measures, but got no response other than the visit of a three-man, three-nationality delegation from the ministry of education. The delegation's arrival coincided with a large demonstration of Romanian students. The ethnic Romanian member of the delegation addressed the crowd: “I see that the demands for schools are part of a much wider scheme — and we don't know what the final goal is,” Enache recalls him saying. He fed the Romanians' conviction that the separation of schools was the first step in separating Transylvania from Romania. At the local medical school, the Hungarians declared a hunger strike. The Romanians countered by setting up an organization to defend their interests. Then came March 15, the day when Hungarians celebrate their 1848 revolution against the Habsburg Empire. The Hungarian embassy in Bucharest had distributed wreaths with the Hungarian tricolor, which were to be placed at statues and plaques commemorating the 1848 revolution. In the days leading up to the anniversary, Romanian papers pointed out repeatedly that the rev[pageend127]126 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 olution's leader, Lajos Kossuth, had intended to incorporate Transylvania into Hungary. They also described how Romanians were killed and their villages destroyed during the revolution. Enache endeavored to persuade Romanian television to run a program on the positive aspects of 1848 for both peoples. Instead, the night before the anniversary, television showed a map — published in the United States by what Enache calls “nostalgic Hungarian groups” — depicting Transylvania as a part of Hungary. The television commentator added that the map demonstrated the Hungarians' true intentions. The sight of Hungarian flags on public buildings and of Hungarian wreaths below statues of Romanian heroes (who were not particularly sympathetic to Hungarian aspirations in 1848), together with the scare campaign in the media, terrified and enraged the Romanian populace of Transylvania. Tirgu Mures lawyer Elód Kineses, a Hungarian, requested that Romanian television broadcast the UDMR's protest against the program the following evening. His request was rejected, although he was allowed to read the protest himself over the air. This protest did not, however, calm emotions; instead, Kincses's slightly accented Romanian irritated Romanian listeners, reminding them of the “foreigners” in their midst. “The stage was set for war,” says Enache. On March 16, the proprietors of a pharmacy in Tirgu Mures posted a Hungarian-language sign alongside the Romanian-language one. People still differ as to whether the sign simply said “Pharmacy” or “Only Hungarian- Speakers Served Here. ” In any case, Romanian protesters objected vehemently to it. A few Hungarian schoolgirls unraveled a banner that read “Schools in our Mother Tongue!” from a balcony along the main square. A Romanian mob entered the building, tore down the banner, and threw furnishings and papers out the window. Someone called the police, who arrived at the scene but refused to intervene. Marches and countermarches crisscrossed the city. A car was driven into a crowd of demonstrators, wounding two people. The driver, a drunken Hungarian, was badly beaten, and his car was set on fire. Fistfights broke out on the street, and the confrontation rippled outwards from the city center to the concrete apartment complexes ringing the city. On his way home from school, Enache's son encountered a group of Hungarian students who slapped him when he answered them in Romanian. Enache had to talk him out of gathering friends to help him retaliate. When Enache saw her son's reaction, she realized how deeply riven her city had become. The atmosphere was supercharged with frustration and fear. On top of that, everyone knew the police would not intervene; thus the street confrontations became increasingly violent. On March 19, while Enache was in Budapest taking part in a Romanian- Hungarian round-table discussion, a Romanian mob led by Vatra Romanesca zealots — including peasants bused in from the countryside and armed with [pageend128]A TRANSYLVANIAN LIFE 127 pitchforks, shovels, and sticks — attacked the Tirgu Mures UDMR headquarters, brutally beating any Hungarians they found. The unchecked violence continued through the next day, as Romanians, Hungarians, and Hungarian-speaking Gypsies clashed in the streets. Only after two days of hand-to-hand combat did the authorities intervene, sending in tanks to keep order. Enache returned to a city paralyzed and in mourning. Eight people had been killed and 300 wounded in the fratricidal violence. ★ ★ ★ Smaranda Enache lives with her husband in one of the countless 1970s-era prematurely aging stucco apartment blocks Ceausescu bequeathed to Romania's cities. She spends most of her time in her son's room, where she writes. Her son lives in Berlin now, one of the many young people who left Romania as postrevolutionary disappointments mounted to create an atmosphere of hopelessness. Enache has litde time to write the lengthy articles she has been pondering for months; her work for the Pro-Europa Human Rights League, which she co-founded in early 1990, and the Tirgu Mures chapter of the Civic Alliance, consumes all of her time. Enache has just returned from Strasbourg, where she testified on the human rights situation in Romania before the Council of Europe. She knows Romania received its special associate status not because it met the requirements of the Council in the area of human rights; rather, it was the fear that Romania would be further isolated from Europe that spurred Council members to overlook the dark questions that continue to hang over the Tirgu Mures clashes and last June's miners' rampage in Bucharest. In her talks at the Council of Europe, Enache stressed the importance of building genuine democratic institutions in Romania to overcome the historic tradition that equates democracy with simple majority rule and pluralism with anarchy. The idea that the masses make national decisions is a myth still enthusiastically propagated by Romania's populist leaders. Since the revolution, officials have frequently justified their decisions as responses to demands made by roaring crowds. The first instance was the knee-jerk (and temporary, as it turned out) banning of the Romanian Communist Party in January 1990, which FSN leaders announced from a balcony to an angry mob below. There is a corollary myth, originating perhaps in the Orthodox Church's fear of schisms, that opposing viewpoints are by their very nature dangerous to the nation. It was the prevalence of this myth which allowed President Ion Iliescu to call the miners into Bucharest several times in 1990. “They have inherited a paternalistic attitude that is specific to the totalitarianism of the East,” explains Enache, referring to the present Romanian leaders. “They don't have the courage to let people have their own thoughts. This government is trying to legitimize itself by using every possible instru- [pageend129]128 UNCAPTIVE MINDS SUMMER 1991 ment — and one instrument is to repeatedly assert that there is an enemy. The image of the Hungarian as the enemy exists in our history.” At first, this image was not based on ethnic differences, but rather on class differences. Romanian peasants have constituted the majority of Transylvania's population since the early 18th Century. The peasants' natural enemy was the nobleman; and in Transylvania, the nobility was Hungarian. “Of course when I look back three centuries, I have to concede that our Hungarian rulers were swine,” Enache says with a laugh. “But the conflict we're living in isn't about history — it's about culture, and coexistence, and creating conditions in which all the people living here are content to be citizens of this country.” Upon her return from Strasbourg, Enache learned that a Vatra Romanesca leader had included her name on a list of those who should be put on trial for the events of March 1990. Enache, who was prohibited from running in parliamentary elections last May because petitions by “outraged” citizens blamed her for the March violence, has to take the threat of a trial seriously. These burdens are taking their toll on her. She complains about all the traveling she is obliged to do, inside the country and abroad, as a leading spokesman for human rights in Romania. She is constantly fatigued, both by the long hours and the sickening threats that come over the telephone or through the mail. And everyday life in Romania is exhausting in itself: the inadequate heating, the shortages of food, the bureaucratic wrangling and legal manipulation, the twisted words in the press and on television — all these wear down the mind and tax the spirit. “Prague and Strasbourg, and all the places I've been to over the past year seem to belong to a dream world. It's as if the reality here is the same as always, as if the differences we thought we perceived were only artifice.” Enache is struggling to give shape to the suspicion that nags Romanians: has everything they fought for been a mirage, a manipulation by the old apparatchiks? “This transition will take so long — and those of us who are interested in democracy are tired,” says Enache. “Here we are at the threshold, and then it's put off. We're out of breath.” “Sometimes I think there won't be very profound changes, because the nomenklatura, the Securitate — the mafia, that is — are still with us. The corruption, lies, deception, the false hierarchy of values — they will maintain all of this, and to do so they'll change colors many times. This is the knot we cannot undo in Romania.” [pageend130]transaction New Books on Politics and Society At your bookstore or direct from the publisher. Major credit cards accepted.
