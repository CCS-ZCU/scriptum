Our aim is to report Polish achievements and Polish problems from all over the world. Vie will ' also report events which have taken place in Poland, if they are of sufficient value and have not been reported already by the world s press. We are not a political organisation and we do not officially represent the whole of the Polish community outside Poland. We are acting on behalf of our Assoc- lation as a group of Free Poles fighting for our country s total independence and for the good name of the Polish nation all over the world. /16/JG-) CENTRE FOR FREE POLES The Frée Polish Community in London now possesses a large, newly-built Centre in the district of Hammersmith. This modern building which contains almost 90,000•sq. ft. on Six floors, cost about £2,000,000 ($4,000,000), partly borrowed and partly col- lected from free Poles around the world. The Centre provides modern accommodation for the Polish Library which has a collection of over 100,000 volumes, the Circulating Library, the Polish University College, the Pilsudski Historical Institute, the Polish Ex-Combatants Association, the Federation of Poles, the Union of Polish Writers /!broad, a youth club, and many other institutions and organisations. There are three large halls for meetings and conferences, including one for over 300 people, a book shop, a restaurant, a bar, a coffee shop, a social club and a boutique. Only the theatre remains unfinished, but this too should be ready to open within the next few years. The facilities offered by the Centre are used not only by Poles, but also by many British people as well as members of other ethnic groups from Europe. The Polish Library is visited by scholars and students from all over the world who study Polish problems; the Circulating Library supplies local British libraries throughout the country with Polish books. The Centre publishes, its own quarterly Bulletin and has now' started to publish this monthly News Agency sheet. The Centre is owned by the Polish Social and Cultural Association (POSK) which has a membership of nearly 7,000. ' י • V17/J&) NOBEL PEACE PRIZE FOR CARDINAL WYSZYNSKI? (Caracas/PNA) - The annual congress of the World Christian-Democratic Union ended,in the Venezuelan capital with a formal resolution duly cabled to Oslo by the Union s President, Signor Rumor, that Poland s Primate, Cardinal Wyszynski, be submit- ted as an official candidate for this year s Nobel Peace Prize. The Cardinal s efforts in the cause of preserving peace in his own country are well-known to Poles everywhere. He is loved by his people and highly respected even by the Communist authorities in Poland. A Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Cardinal Wyszynski would set the seal of world recognition on the heroic work of a man of ex- ceptional integrity and a true patriot. .,/i^/SDL) ' REHAKKABLE EXHIBITION (London/PNA) - A press conference was held in London to inaugurate an extra- ordinary exhibition organised by the Polish Social and Cultural Association. The ex- hibition, entitled ',Beneath, the Surface’1 , has come to London from Venice, where it had been brought from Warsaw. Its title alludes to the subject of a lecture by Stanislaw Baranczak, poet and literary theorist, which was to have been delivered at the Venice Biennale. However, the authorities in Poland refused to give Baranczak an exit visa, so the text was made available to the world s press and accorded wide publicity, not- ably in the London Times. ,Baranczak is one of the founder-members of KOR (Komitét Obrony Robotnikow - Workers Defence Committee), which is now called the K0R - Social Self-Defence Committee, who are the organisers of the exhibition. "BENEATH THE SURFACE" - consists of (mostly) smuggled, documents, photographs and reports of the activities of KOR SSDC and other groups, including, of course, the Catholic Church, in Poland. The groups are anxious at all times to stress the fact that they are acting with absolute legality within the framework of the Constitution, the Human Rights Charter, and various international agreements and covenants, in part- icular the Helsinki Accords and the resulting International Covenant on Human and/MORE [pageend1]POLISH NEUS AGENCY - PNA 2.1978 •15 '־ י REMARKABLE EXHIBITION (continued) Civil Rights, of which Poland is a signatory State., The KOR Committee was initially a tody of people who joined• together to provide legal, moral and material assistance and to defend those Polish workers who were imprisoned, beaten, up and otherwise vict- imis'ed by the authorities for participation in the strikes and demonstrations of June 1976. Last autumn, it altered its name and widened its scope of activities. It is now called KOR Social Self-Defence Committee. Piotr Bakowski, a meteorologist and member of KOR, accompanied the exhibit- ion to Venice and London. In England he was joined by Helena Nikolaj ska, noted act- ress and winner .of a State Award, who is a KOR found er-member. At the entrance to the exhibition is posted a selection of articles, reports and commentaries from leading British newspapers, on the developments in Poland and its dissident movement. THEEXHIBITION IS DIVIDED INTO TWO parts corresponding to its title: "Ben- eath the Surface". The "Surface" is a continuous run of glowing red propaganda post- ers end official photographs proclaiming freedom and friendship with the USSR, domin- ated by a giant-sized poster commemorating the birth of Feliks Dzieržynski, the well- known lover of humanity and freedom, who, among other things, founded the CHEKA, on which present-day KG-B is founded. A black curtain separates the room containing this "Surface" from the "Ben- eath" part of the exhibition. Here, among other things, we see the photographs and brief biographical details of KOR founder-members; KOR documents relating to its brief and activities; documents and photographs of the development of the Student So- lidarity Committee which supports KOR; photographs and reports about the work (and the obstacles placed in its way) of the Catholic Church in Poland; and numerous Samizdat publications. The most striking exhibits include a photograph of the so-called ״Ka- tyn Pit" in Warsaw s best-known cemetery, where people drop bundles of flowers and set down lighted candles in memory of thousands of Polish officers and men massacred by' the Soviets during World Ví ar II; there is also the photograph of a notice of a memor- ial service "to be held in Warsaw, on November 2, 1977, for our brethren murdered 60 years ago" - a clear reference to Poles murdered during the Russian Revolution; an artistic black-and-red woodcut on the cover of a Samizdat publication - "I Know It s Unjust" by Stanislaw Baranczak; and a red poster announcing a meeting of■ the Party s Basic Organisation at a university, in the centre of which an art student stuck a re- production of Breughel s "The Blind Leading the Blind"... ABSOLUTELY OPEN AND LEGAL: Every form of activity which the exhibition shows by way of photographs,”documents, etc., stresses its legality within the letter of the Polish Constitution and the Helsinki Accords. KOR SSDC and the other bodies are• mer- ely putting into 'practice what is guaranteed to them in theory by law. Therein lies their principal effectiveness. Apart from its cultural and political implications, the exhibition, though artistically unpretentious and - necessarily ■ on a modest scale, can■ nevertheless provide an object lesson in how to put something across■ both forcefully and with utmost economy of space. It is very well worth seeing and contem- plat ing. (PNA/19/SDL) SPURNING THE CARNIVAL SPIRIT (Munich/PNA) - It would appear that the Board of International Broadcasting Broadcasting demonstrated a fit of unaccustomed levity 7hen it suggested that Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty offer air time to Soviet and Satellite spokesmen to "correct the inaccuracies" about which they constantly complain. It seems that although members of th|• organisation's Polish Broadcasting Department sent a strongly-worded letter of protest to BIB s Director-General, Mr. J. Gronouski, the project was aband- oned because spokesmen of the Soviet mass media did not enter into the spirit of the season and bluntly refused to take up the invitation, which, incidentally, had been extended without prior consultation with the broadcasting body directly concerned, i.e. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. /20/SDL) PLEASE NOTE IMPORTANT EDITORIAL ANNOUNCEMENT ELSEWHERE IN THIS ISSUE. kF׳Cl) [pageend2]
