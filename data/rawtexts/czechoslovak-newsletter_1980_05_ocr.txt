(The sixth codefendant, Dana Němcová, was given a suspended sentence.) (Czechoslovak Newsletter, Vol. IV, No. 9/10 [September/October 19793) Before their transfer they were allowed a one-hour visit by relatives. The following reports on their condition, and that of Jaroslav Sabata, is based on their letters and on accounts given by their relatives. Václav Benda Sentenced to four years in the First NVS (Nápravná výchovná skupina — Correctional Education Group). Prison address since January 7, 1980: Prisoner No. 9Ó54/A2, NVU Heřmanice, P. 0. Box 2, 713 02 Ostrava 1J. Benda has no relatives save his wife and children to whom he may write once a week. Letters reach him very belatedly: as of February 2 he had received none of the six written to him by his wife. He works in the Vítkovice Iron Works, and plays chess in his spare time. ”1 am unconcerned by my life, things and free time,” he wrote in a letter, ’’and so I take everything as a joke. I am sure I shall put up with everything, and I secretly hope that everything I do will be in Christ and for Christ, for here we are all insignificant.” 1 [pageend1]2 His wife and five children were permitted to visit him on March 2. She is allowed to send him four six-and-a-half-pound food parcels a year. He was also given permission to receive a two-and-a-quarter-pound parcel of toilet necessities. His letters are heavily censored. Jiří Dienstbier Sentenced to three years in the First NVS. Prison address: Prisoner No. 9657/A2, NVU Heřmanice, P. 0. Box 2, 713 02 Ostrava 13. Dienstbier may receive letters from anybody, but is allowed to write only once weekly to close relatives. With problems with his spine and feet, his health is rather poor. He works at the Vítkovice Iron Works. ’’You know my capacity for adjustment to different circumstances,” he wrote in a letter. ”So far nobody here has tried to challenge me on my principles, from which I shall not budge one millimeter. ... My body will adjust to the situation, my spirit is strong, and even stronger under the present difficult conditions.” His family (two adults and three children) was allowed to visit him on March 9 and to take him a six-and-a-half-pound parcel. Václav Havel Sentenced to four and a half years in the First NVS. Prison address: Prisoner No. 9658/A2, NVU Heřmanice, P. 0, Box 2, 713 02 Ostrava 13- He wrote in a letter: ”My instructor told me that I may write that I am working in the Vítkovice Iron Works, but no more. Perhaps just that I am not being forced to lift objects too heavy for me to carry. I doubt, however, that I shall be able to meet my norm. ... It is a fantastic experience. There is unlikely to be any risk of mental derangement here as there was in solitary confinement, but I have no clear idea how I shall be able to put up with this for five years. I have been surprised and touched Eby how fellow prisoners try to help us]. I am not ready for any more profound existentialist and literary thoughts at present. Any attempt at them seems futile and premature.” His wife and brother visited him on February 24. Afterwards they said: ”0ur conversation last about one hour in the presence of a uniformed guard. Apart from cigarettes we were allowed to take nothing in or to take notes. Vitamins and food were given back to us as not permitted. Havel is forbidden to write or make notes. In his case this proscription is particularly strict. The only thing he may do is write letters to us, but with a rigid limit on their content (no reflections, etc.). Some were not put in the mails and were returned to him. Letters from his relations must not contain any foreign words, strange symbols, quotations from books, or anything that could be taken as allegorical. He may have no books of his own, but he may subscribe to selected newspapers and magazines out of his allowance. There is little time for reading, even on Sundays. On morning-shift days, watching the evening television news is compulsory. His great curiosity and interest in the extremes of the human condition are some help to him in dealing with the hardships of prison life [pageend2]3 Otta Bednářová Sentenced to three years in the First NVS. Prison address since January 25: Ústav SNV-ČSR, P. 0. Box 115/0, 746 49 Opava. Bednářová was in Pankrac prison hospital, Prague, for twenty days prior to her transfer to Opava in North Moravia. In January her petition was denied for an interruption of her term for reasons of health (swollen legs and lymph nodes). Her family believes she works on a sewing machine. Letters from her take two weeks for delivery. In one she wrote: ”1 weigh 121 pounds, but now I am getting the medication I need and am feeling better. ... On February 4 I received seven letters at once. One took 52 days to get here, a record. . . . The latest one took only 31 days to reach me.” Petr Uhl Sentenced to five years in the Second NVS. Prison address since January 7s P. 0. Box 1/7 789 53 Mirov. He may write letters only every two weeks, and receive them only from two of his family — his wife and his brother-in-law. Twice a year he is permitted one- hour visits by two adults, who may be accompanied by children. On each occasion they may bring him a four-and-a-half-pound parcel. In one of his letters he wrote: ”1 am feeling well, but I am a little concerned because I am sleeping next to a syphilitic. I read Rudé právo C the principal party daily] and may watch television, but they refused me the books I asked for on criminal procedure.” Jaroslav Šabata Sentenced on January 11, 1979t to nine months in the First NVS on a charge of assaulting a police officer. Is now serving out the remainder of an earlier eight- een-month sentence from which he had been paroled. Prison address: P. 0. Box 79, 412 81 Litoměřice. He is probably the only political prisoner presently in solitary confinement. He has now been in prison almost seven years, with only a 21-month gap. He has had two heart attacks (the second in prison) and has duodenal ulcers. His health is poor, and care seems to be inadequate. Until 1976 he had had to share a cell with a psychopath. His present solitary confinement has induced considerable mental stress. He may have books from the prison library, but not his own selection. He receives the Soviet magazine Novoye Vremya, but was not allowed the English edition of it, New Times. He may subscribe to daily newspapers out of his own pocket, but his relatives may not buy periodical subscriptions for him. He is prohibited from writing to his son Václav, who lives in Vienna. [pageend3]4 LETTER FROM PRISON Václav Havel, Václav Benda and Jiří Dienstbier have sent out the following letter from their prison in Heřmanice. ’’From the prison to which we were sentenced for our work with the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted we turn to all those private persons, government representatives and organizations at home and abroad who expressed their solidarity with what we were doing and protested against our unjust prosecution and subsequent conviction* We would like to give our special thanks and respect to the Polish friends who protested against our arbitrary trial with a hunger strike, and to all those who made special efforts to prepare and perform, first in Paris and later in Munich, a documentary play showing the European public the absurdity of that anachronistic but symptomatic trial in Prague. Though we have no contact with Petr Uhl and Otta Bednářová, who are serving their sentences in different prisons, we assume that we are formulating this letter of thanks on their behalf too* ’’With this expression of our profound gratitude, and with awareness of our continuing responsibility for the views, positions and activities for which we were convicted, we continue to uphold them as our moral and political right.” COUNCIL DECLARATION ON INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS The following is excerpted from the closing statement made by Mojmír Povolný, chairman of the Executive Committee of the Council of Free Czechoslovakia, to a meeting of the committee held in New York on March 15 and 16. ’’The Executive Committee of the Council of Free Czechoslovakia has held this meeting during a period of deterioration in the international situation caused by the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the revolutionary events in Iran. Both are having a profound effect on the Czechoslovak people and their quest for freedom, democracy, and independence. ’’Czechoslovakia is experiencing a deterioration of its own domestic situation. The chasm between the people and the communist regime is deepening. The public is politically apathetic. The government is ruling with an iron fist. The economy is sagging, increasingly lagging behind the industrial countries of Europe. Cultural life has been forced underground or into exile. The struggle for human rights goes on, but nowhere in the Soviet bloc does it face worse conditions. "The world is entering a new phase that will determine whether it is to be one of free, independent nations in cooperation, or an empire serving under Soviet domination. We are supporting the United States and the free world in their struggle against Soviet expansion. In a year when the Soviet Union is waging war on [pageend4]5 Afghani stan, participation in the Olympic Games in Moscow would be contradictory to the ideals on which the Olympic spirit is based® We appeal to all countries and sportsmen of the world to boycott the Moscow Olympic Games® ”We wish to remind the world that its freedoms depend on the unity of democratic countries. Since World War II the Soviet Union has used every means to undermine this unity in order to gain control over a divided world. ’’The West has dedicated allies among the people of the Soviet-dominated countries, but it has to mobilize its own forces to demonstrate to these people, who feel themselves to belong to the Western world, that they have not been written off. People in Czechoslovakia are ready to contribute their share to building a truly free world. ’’The Conference on European Security and Cooperation to be held in Madrid will afford an opportunity for human rights to be placed on the agenda of international negotiations again. We urge the free-world participants in that conference not to evade their responsibility for European civilization, and to act accordingly. Czechoslovak exiles in Madrid will be demanding what the Czechs and Slovaks at home are fighting for: the right to a genuinely free, independent and democratic state that guarantees human, civil, and political rights and basic freedoms for everybody.” COUNCIL APPEAL TO THE LEADERS OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA Hundreds of thousands of Czechs and Slovaks have been forced to leave their homeland to seek a new life abroad because of the historical events that have befallen our nations during the last decades. Natural and artificial barriers may separate us physically, but there exist no obstacles that can sever completely the ties between people at hone and abroad. On the contrary, the ties become even stronger when people at home have so much concern about their future. In various parts of the world now there are armed conflicts in which troops of the Warsaw Pact powers, of which Czechoslovakia is one, are involved. There exists a real danger that the Czechoslovak army might be deployed in the interests of its strongest ally. This has already been implied by suggestions of high Soviet military men that Warsaw Pact troops could take common action in Afghanistan. The apprehension of people at home and us abroad has been heightened because nobody in Czechoslovakia has objected to the use of the army outside the borders of the republic. While Rumania, also a member of the Warsaw Pact, has openly denounced armed aggression against other countries and affirmed the defensive character of its army, the Czechoslovak army has been put on the alert during every armed conflict anywhere in the world, most recently in connection with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. [pageend5]6 The democratic traditions and experiences of both the past and present generations of our nations demand a clear-cut declaration of the principles on which the Czechoslovak army has been based since its formation. Its task has been the defense of the country against any attack from abroad. It was not formed for aggression or above all, for use against independent nations in the interests of a foreign power. We ask you to make a clear, public statement that: * The function of the Czechoslovak army is defensive and for the protection of our nationa?. territory. * It will not be placed under foreign command by any treaty- * It will not be used beyond the frontiers of the republic. We are convinced that such a declaration by you would be an important contribution to the preservation of peace in the world and a stabilizing factor in Europe, and would reduce the fears of the people of Afghanistan and, even more importantly, those of the people of Czechoslovakia. New York, May 19^0 The Council of Free Czechoslovakia EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT CONDEMNS POLITICAL TRIALS The European Parliament at its April meeting in Strasbourg condemned the conviction of human-rights activists in Czechoslovakia. (It had also made "a pressing appeal” to the Czechoslovak authorities before last October's trial of members of Charter 77 and the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted "to respect the rights of man in accordance with the Final Act of Helsinki" by releasing the arrested.) All factions took part in the parliamentary debate, except the French communists who left the chamber before it began. The draft resolution was submitted by a German Social Democrat, Klaus Hansch. He told the assembly it had "a moral obligation" to express its concern, and assured it that it would not be "interference in the domestic affairs of another country . . . because Czechoslovakia is a contracting party to the Helsinki Agreement." Jiří Pelikán, a member of the Italian Socialist Party and a leader of the Czechoslovak reform movement during the "Prague spring," asked for more attention to be paid to the interests of people rather than government in communist states. He described the arrest, interrogation and trial of the Czechoslovak human-rights activists, and called on Simone Weil, both as president of the European Parliament and as a woman, to intercede on behalf of Otta Bednářová in prison. "It is important," he said, "for human-rights advocates in Czechoslovakia not to have a sense of isolation. Passage of the resolution should contribute to the cultural, polit- [pageend6]7 ical and moral unity of our European continent.” Lord Bethell, speaking as a representative of the European Democratic Party, said: ”People are not being tortured as they were in Hitler’s Germany or in Stalin’s Russia, but their souls and their spirits are being crushed in Czechoslovakia, and this in a country only a couple of hundred kilometers from where we are sitting now. ... I hope very much that the day will come in my lifetime when we will be able to welcome Czechoslovakia into our community.” Ulrich Irmer, spokesman for the liberal democratic faction, told the representatives: ”We call ourselves the European Parliament » . . but Europe does not end on the Elbe and the Bavarian-Bohemian border.” The people of Czechoslovakia are ”now enslaved by their own countrymen, who are executing the orders of a foreign power.” He criticized those Frenchmen who had spoken out against Chile but kept silent on Czechoslovakia. ”If that is what the French communists want for Europe, we should be glad that their influence is not greater.” At the end of debate the following resolution (here abridged) was adopted: The European Parliament . . . Expresses its respect for the courage evidenced by all those who try to protect basic freedoms in Czechoslovakia; Is of the opinion that such violations of undertakings recorded in the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference are likely to jeopardize the policy of detente which it wishes to see continued; Insists that any trials should be run according to procedures which afford all guarantees to the defendants and should be held in public and that, in particular, observers from independent human-rights organizations should be able to attend them; Requests the Foreign Ministers meeting in political cooperation: To continue their efforts to ensure that the provisions of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe are observed so as to put an end to violations of human rights in Czechoslovakia; To make it plain to the Czechoslovakian authorities that violations of the Final Act of Helsinki threaten the success of the forthcoming Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe which is to be held in Madrid; Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Foreign Ministers of the Member States meeting in political coperation, asking them to report to the European. Parliament, [pageend7]8 the Council and Commission of the European Communities on the action they have taken, and also to the Parliaments and Governments of the Member States. NEW CZECHOSLOVAK LAW ON FOREIGN TRADE The purpose of a bill to amend Czechoslovakia’s foreign-trade law was to ’’establish a legal basis for goals we are planning to attain,” Foreign Trade Minister Andrej Barčák told a joint session of both chambers of the Federal- Assembly in Prague on April 10. In defining those goals, Barčák said: ’’The developing countries have become an important force in implementing anti-imperialist policy Ci.e., in opposition to the West, especially the United States]. Conditions must be created for external economic activities that aim to strengthen 4hose countries’ economic and political independence and prepare the ground for the practical realization of a new international economic order. . . . The policy of peaceful coexistence presupposes a substantial increase in economic and scientific cooperation between countries with differing social systems. It is necessary to secure by appropriate measures not only an advantage for the Czechoslovak economy but also effective protection against efforts by the capitalist countries to penetrate the Czechoslovak economy in an undesirable fashion.” Barčák’s speech, published on April 11 in Rudé právoÝ the daily newspaper of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, did not disclose the actual measures Czechoslovakia plans to take in order to protect the developing countries against ’’imperialism” and itself against ’’capitalism.” PROTEST BY AUSTRALIAN NOBEL LAUREATE Patrick White, Australian winner of the 1975 Nobel Prize for Literature, has written to Jan Kozák, president of the Czech Writers’ Union in Prague, in protest against last October's conviction of six human-rights activists. In his letter he said: ”1 am writing to you about a situation which concerns me deeply as a writer: the sentence of the six . . . , in particular the playwright Václav Havel. ... I still believe one could create a state in which the interest of the many could prevail over those of a few, but with its members free to hold their own beliefs, whether intellectual or religious. ... Cl hope] you will appeal to your government for clemency towards the playwright Václav Havel and the other prisoners who . . . have been unjustly and unwisely dealt with.” [pageend8]
