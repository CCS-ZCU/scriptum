Some of our plans include a program which will include well- wisher greetings, regular business ads, articles and photographs of interest to our Sokol, but most of all, we want to include a little history of our Unit, including some memories of days gone by presented by relatives of our Charter members who are still available to us at Sokol San Francisco. In this regard, we are asking your assistance.

Katie Prossr is still teaching her class of "tiny tots", and we have six adults making a strong effort to learn the calisthenic drill for the Omaha Slet. Some of the class is also learning the Indian Club Drill. (That’s a very pretty drill, and we should present it here at some special event or dance.) At this time, it looks like about three of our hearty drillers will be attending the Omaha Slet. Join us now! There is still time to learn! OFFICERSHIPS We are still without a permanent Recording Secretary, Nacelnice, Nacelnik and B.O.I. Please consider these positions, and give Blanche Duffey, President a call if you can fill the void in our slate of officers. DUES - VĚSTNÍK SUBSCRIPTIONS- ADS Just a reminder that Annual Sokol dues are now payable. Also, those who subscribe to the Vest ni k should be sending us your $5 in order to continue the arrival of our Vestnik to your door. Likewise, advertisements are also renewable on an annual basis. It seems like a long time since we have seen this National Dance performed, and it seems a long time since anyone has been interested in learning the dance to perform it at Sokol Exhibitions, Community Events, Ethnic gatherings, etc. But we've heard, lately, an inkly of such interest, and we are putting out a call for such interested parties. In case you need some brushing up on the Beseda - it is done in a "square" with four couples and there are two versions of the dance - one we have always called the Beseda and the second one we call the "new" Beseda. If interested, please drop us a line at Sokol Hall, and we can start a regular routine for learning these lovely Czechoslovak dances.

S. to establish a shoe factory in the snail town of Belcanp, Md. These instructors and technicians were all young; sone single sen and wonen and sone married with small children. They were loyal, idealistic and hardworking people with a total dedication to establishing a thriving shoe industry in this country, and in making a new home with a promising future for themselves and their families. They were a mixture of Czechs, Moravians and Slovaks; all heartbroken at the knowledge that their loved ones and friends had a very uncertain future under the domination of the \nazis. There was also the sad knowledge that they might never see their beloved homeland again. 1939 brings back fond memories of those who have since gone to the far-flung corners of the globe; many served in the U. S. Military during World War II; some went back to Czechoslovakia to live, and many became U. S. Citizens. But — after 50 years, where are they today? We know where those who joined the Belcamp Sokol Organization are; but some have been swallowed up in this great country of ours and contact with them has been lost. Reminiscing brings back names such as Pikula, Smadek, Pavelkova, Indrychova, Klátil, Dupal, Dancak, Polášek, Rokytová, Smigurova, Svehlakova, Kourilova, Hlobil, Hanzlikova, Zacek, Kovar, Fejfar, Zajic, Zapletalova and scores of others.

BENEŠ BY JAN NEBUDA In a certain little wine-shop near the Carinthian theatre in Vienna it was usually lively, day in and day out, but today, laughter and shouts filled the entire side-street. This was the meeting-place of the singers and chorus girls of the court opera and of the members of the orchestra, all of them people free from every care, for if they had admitted the first care they would then have had to admit altogether too many. The less of sweetness life offered them the more feverishly they rushed into it. Even old gray Beneš, usually morose and short spoken, was as if transformed today. He drank, talked, drank and talked again. His expressive face was already flushed and was covered, with a perpetual smile. His classic cape, in winter and in summer always the same, hung behind him on a hook, but the old man felt the fire of the wine and had already removed his vest also. It struck no one as freakish that underneath the first vest of heavy material there appeared a second thick vest. They were thoroughly acquainted with Beneš and knew all of his peculiarities. Beneš had been an accompanist and rehearser of 81 Continued Page 6- [pageend5]SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO VĚSTNÍK MARCH, APRIL, MAY, JUNE, 1989 pag e CONT INUED 82 CZECHOSLOVAK STORIES operas for some forty years. The wider musical circles knew him as an excellent reader of parts, the inner circles knew him as a happy composer of delightful little lyrics, and all recognized in him an all-around good fellow, a little peevish, to be sure, but always willing to make concessions. Therefore, only to the lighter- minded ones of the company did his vivaciousness seem unsuspicious. The others surmised that it was probably more of a cloak, that Beneš talked constantly in order to silence something and that he drank much to drown much. These said nothing but they, too, were gay. “Aha—our Leon! I was sure you’d come in today!” called Beneš to a new-comer. He was a young man of quick actions, merry face and shrewd glance. Willingly they prepared a place for him. “Leon is a lion,” said some one in the rear. “Daddy Beneš, did you hear Leo today in church?” “You fellows would teach me to know him!” Beneš puffed up and the second vest was flung off. Under it appeared a third vest. “You dare to tell me what any one’s worth is! Better keep still! Leo will be a second Ronconi—Ronconi was also as small and with a voice like a thunderous flute. You people have heard a lot in life! If I say that someone will really amount to something, they will! I’ve foretold to this little minx here that she will be as happy and as famous as— as Sontag.” This name slipped from his lips as if by accident. Fr M'-PAGE 5 r’ h BENEŠ 83 k ■ “What’s that Daddy Beneš is saying?” a pretty, merry-faced young girl, sitting near him, asked in ■ f German. “Oh, nothing, minx,” said he, patting her hair. 1“ What’s new in Zlonits, Leon?” “Nothing for a long time, nothing at all! But, / thunder!—Daddy has a new cravat today.” Beneš I consciously drew his chin up high and stretched out his I legs. “And look at his finely polished boots, too. J Daddy is celebrating something today!” Benes frowned slightly. “ Don’t crowd up so close to me, Pauline.” And he turned again to the young girl. “Lukova is taking a shine to Daddy!” was the cry 1 from around the circle. “Daddy, haven’t you got some new songs for me?” asked the young chorus girl, destined later to become a renowned prima donna. Beneš paused to look at her. “You are pretty— but you haven’t such eyes as hers, after all! Well, it’s all one, you’ll amount to something—you and Leon here—but the rest won’t get very far!” “Oho—who can know that?” wrathfully exclaimed a young violinist opposite. “You, too, had talent, Daddy, well—and—” He did not finish. “Well, and what? What could an accompanist become other than an accompanist? I was one in Prague and I ^m the same in Vienna.” “But what if you had finished your studies in Prague?” 84 CZECHOSLOVAK STORIES “Yes—if! If I hadn’t run off to Vienna after Henrietta Sontag!” “She must have been beautiful, wasn’t she?” “I don’t even know that, absolutely,” burst forth Beneš with a lightness that was plainly feigned. “She was and she wasn’t. When I met her by accident in a Prague company I accompanied her on the piano for the first time and when she looked at me, all was over. Dear God, those blue eyes of hers! I would have followed those eyes further than Vienna!” No one questioned him further, but Beneš, nevertheless, did not remain silent. It seemed as if something goaded him on to speaking jocularly and lightly of that subject. “It didn’t even worry me that others also had come here on her account—a young lancer, for instance. I knew she was as pure as an angel. Dear God, those eyes so soft, so heavenly! Why shouldn’t I say so now’? What does it matter? I was insanely in love wnth her and I acted like a madman. I kept silent. She herself cured me. Suddenly she disappeared—it was said, on account of attacks from certain court circles on her virtue—and for me she left this w*ritten message, ‘I thank you fervently for your services and please accept enclosed three hundred as a reward for your difficult work of accompaniment.* So then at last I saw what I was to her—an accompanist! But for the first time in my life I had three hundred and—” He intended to say something humorous, but sud- i Í . BENES 85 denly became silent. His whole body trembled as if he were shaking with the ague, his face suddenly became rigid, his eye was fixed on the floor, his lips remained open. His folded hands quivered con- • vulsively. “And when did she die of that Mexican cholera—it can’t be so many years ago?” asked a close neighbor, speaking perhaps only to keep the conversation going. “On the eleventh of June, 1854,” answered Beneš in a lifeless tone. : “The eleventh—why today it is just exactly—” s Benes’s head sank down on his clasped hands. Within the room a sudden stillness follow’ed, no one speaking a word. It was a painful silence, broken only by the old man’s audible, unspeakably heartbreaking sobbing. i For a long w’hile the old man’s weeping continued, no one uttering even a whisper. Suddenly the sobbing ceased. The old man raised himself and covered his eyes with his palm. “Good night!” he said almost in a whisper and staggered towards the door. 3 3 I [pageend6]SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO VĚSTNÍK MARCH, APRIL, MAY, JUNE, 1989 PAGE 7 Spring’s a Child Spring is a child of golden curl, lips of cherry and skin of pearl. Her breath is lilac on the hill where robins sing and bluebirds trill. Her arms embrace the morning sun above the meadow where rivers run, Where roses bud and bloom at will and a child picks a daffodil. Spring’s a child in an emerald gown with rainbow ribbons in her crown, A lass so lovely I can see reflections of eternity. Clay Harrison The War Begins The first shot of the Revolutionary Wor was fired on a Massachusetts village green in April, 1775. Captain John Parker and his Minutemen awaited the British troops advancing to capture colonial military supplies in Concord. Both the militiamen and the redcoats had been ordered not to fire, yet in the tension of the moment, a shot rang out and the battle began. Do you know the name of this event?

(LATIN TRANSLATION) Bohemoslovenika is everything concerning the Czechoslovak people outside of their native land. It includes art, engineering, patents, poetry, theatre, sports, music, and in this case philately. The U.S.A, has Americana, Israelis have Judaica, Poland Polonia, Germans Germania and every contry has some collection of data that identifies that country and makes it unique. Bohemoslovenika will be a handbook emphasizing the unique contribution of Czechoslovaks. The philatelic clubs are working on this project. The first Czechoslovak Philatelic Club of America was founded in 1924 and two chartered members, Joseph Vond- rak and Louis Divis, are still alive. The Society for Czechoslovak Philately was founded in 1939 and is a national organization with a publication of ten issues per year. Many Chicago area members hold a membership in both clubs. Bohemoslovenika U.S.A, started in Chicago in 1893 during the Columbian Exposition. The 5c Columbian postage stamp has a picture by the Czech painter, Václav Brožík, of Columbia in front of Isabella Queen of Spain. But this famous painting has a twin, a large size done in oil. Another painting portrays John Hus in Court Constance, Switzerland; here his destiny was set to die at the stake by fire on the banks of the Rhine River. This happened in 1415 and started the Hussite Movement. Hussite wars lasted 205 years until November 6, 1620, where at the Battle of White Mountain the Czechs lost their kingdom and independence. The Columbia painting is in a Canadian Art Museum and the Jan Hus painting is in the Old Town Hall in Prague. We stamp collectors are trying to preserve the history of the Czechoslovak people in the United States. So far we have put together 238 pages of Bohemoslovenika U.S.A, and there are more pages to be added into this handbook. We hope to show you next October 28, 1988, for the first time, Bohemoslovenika. This celebration will be sponsored by the Czechoslovak American Congress. We hope to have a special postal cancellation, a postage meter, covers and maxim cards. We are grateful to the U.S.A, postal ser- vice for issuing the 5c Czechoslovak flag stamp in 1943, the T. G. Masaryk 4c and 8c Champion of Liberty stamp in 1960 and also the 5c Sokol Physical Fitness stamp in 1965. UNITED STATES POSTAGE ACROSS DOWN If anyone has anything on an envelope with or without postage, in Czech, Moravian and Slovak picture advertising, please send me a copy or lend it to us so we can complete the handbook. It will be recorded in history with your name. I am grateful to the officers of the club that for many years were and still are working without pay on this project. Their names in alphabetical order are Václav Šáňa, Rudy Severa, Jane Štěrba and Joseph Vitek. Respectfully, Joseph J. Janečka, President of the First Czechoslovak Philatelic Club of America 3.

[pageend7]SAN FRANCISCO SOKOL VESTNIK MARCH, APRIL, MAY, JUNE 1989 PAGE 8 Vysvětleni k taneční skugine Furiant. V poslední době se vyskytlo mnoho dotazu o neúčasti tanecni skupiny pri sokolských zabavach. Proto povazujeme za nutné podat členům nasledujici vysvětleni. Když se před 21 roky utvořil tanecni soubor Furiant, Sokol San Francisco jej plné podporoval. Dal mu k disposici sokolovnu k nácvikům, ale i 5% ze zisku z našich zabav pod podmínkou, ze se stanou cleny Sokola. Soubor tótiz vystupoval pod hlavičkou Sokol San Francisco. 3 členky ( z osmi) teto tanecni skupiny se v te době rozhodly prozatím do Sokola nevstoupit. Vedouci skupiny na schůzi pozadal o dels! dobu na rozhodnuti, coz se take stalo. Po 21 roku trpělivého cekáni vedeni Sokola je opět pozadalo o konecne vyjádřeni; tyto členky mely možnost bud stati se cleny Sokola, nebo platit! čtvrtletně prispevek $ 20.00 na kryti výloh, ktere Sokol v te době mel. Protože tyto 3 členky tanecni skupiny ani tehdy na naši nabidku neodpověděli, vedeni Sokola se obrátilo o radu na zupni vedeni, Odpoved a rozhodnuti zupy v originálním zněni otiskujeme. Nejen clenove jednoty, nybrz i všichni návštěvnici našich zabav by vřele uvitali opětně vystupováni skupiny Furiant, aby nas pod hlavičkou Sokol San Francisco opět representovala. We have had many inquiries about the absence of our Sokol Furiant! dancers. Since the Board of Directors of Sokol San Francisco have been wrongfully accused of '‘forcing Furiant! dancers out", we would like to correct these accusations. When the Furiant! group was formed two and half years ago, Sokol San Francisco gave them use of Sokol Hall and all facilities. In addition to the use of the hall they received 57. of the Sokol Dance profits of dances at which they performed. This was approved with the understanding that all members of the dance group would become members of Sokol San Francisco. Three of the dancers chose not to join Sokol at that time, and Sokol was asked to give them more time - which we did. After two and half years of patiently waiting, the Board once again invited them to join Sokol or pay a registration fee of $20 per quarter. Once again the three non-Sokol members of the group chose not to reply to our request. After a reasonable waiting time, the Board of Directors asked the advice of our Sokol Pacific District. The District reply reprinted below is se 1f-explanatory. The Sokol San Francisco Board of Directors and members and the Czechoslovak community in the Bay Area would be happy to see the Furiant! dancers continue to represent us.

As it was reported, a motion was passed saying that active members of the dance group which is a Sokol department, must be members of the American Sokol Organization. It waa reported also that some of the members of the dance group refuse strongly to do so. This matter was discussed thoroughly at the said meeting, inclu= ding the attitude of many of our fellow immigrants who came to this country recently. They probably are still trying to draw the line between totalitarianism and the American concept of freedom. Please try to explain them that being part of of an American organization, one has nothing to do with the American government, but with a completely independent community of people who share the same ideas. In addition, the requirement to become a member has it's practical, moral, financial and safety reason§n^xists everywhere. And it would be unfair to other Sokol members to let non-members have the same rights.We understand that they are being active in Sokol for at least two years which is a sufficiently long period of time to make a decision. Please keep the Pacific District informed. Nazdar! WE CAN: Choose to love — rather than hate. Choose to smile — rather than frown. Choose to build — rather than destroy.

VEAL CUTLET GOLDEN MUSHROOM Recipe of the Golden Mushroom Restaurant (Serves 4) 4 6-ounce prime veal cutlets cut from seamless top round or loin, completely free of any sinews (Provimi, Plum de Veau or other top quality veal) salt, pepper, flour '/□ cup clarified butter V/2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms — any variety 1 tablespoon chopped shallots ’/a cup rich beef broth or roast juice V4 cup Armagnac '/z cup heavy cream Using a mallet, flatten cutlets to ’A" thickness, taking care not to tear them. Preheat a dry, heavy 12" skillet to smoking hot. (All cooking is done over high heat.) Sprinkle cutlets with salt and pepper, dip in flour on both sides. Shake off excess flour. Pour butter into hot pan and immediately place in the cutlets, flat. Brown quickly on one side and turn over. Add mushrooms and shallots. Shake pan. Lift cutlets up, letting mushrooms drop to the bottom of pan. Place cutlets on top. Sauté, shaking pan, 20 seconds. Add beef broth and Armagnac. Remove cutlets to a warm dish. Cook juice in pan down to 2 tablespoons. Add cream and continue cooking until sauce thickens. Return cutlets to pan, stir sauce over them. Transfer to serving dishes, sprinkle with chopped parsley. Rice, noodles or sauteed potatoes make a suitable accompaniment; so will a simple green vegetable, such as Irach nroon haanS or DeaS. Houby Hunting i A legend from the neighborhood of Leipa in Bohemia says that Christ and Peter were walking through a village begging for bread and biscuits to satisfy their hunger. Now and then crusts were thrown to them and so they continued * on their way happily enough. They eventually reached a large forest, and as they walked through they munched the bread and biscuits, baked of white and brown flour. Wherever crumbs fell, up sprung a fungus. You will probably have already guessed that the toadstools growing from brown flour were poisonous and inedible, whilst the white flour produced the edible kinds. In Silesia there is a legend about the well-known spring mushroom, the Morel: The devil was in a bad temper when one day he met a wrinkled old woman in the wood. He seized her and cut her up into pieces, then strewed the pieces around the wood. Wherever a piece fell, there grew a morel — which with a little imagination, can be thought of as wrinkled. For this reason an old women is, in Silesia, called a “morchel”. Morel STUFFED MUSHROOMS WITH CRABMEAT Recipe of the Golden Mushroom Restaurant (Appetizer for 4) 14 ounces large fresh mushrooms (any variety large enough to stuff) 2 tablespoons butter 6 ounces crabmeat (king, blue or back- fin), picked free of cartilage 1 tablespoon chopped onion 1 teaspoon chopped parsley '/z hard boiled egg, chopped 1 tablespoon sour cream 2 tablespoons mayonnaise 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 2 drops Tabasco '/a teaspoon lemon juice salt and pepper to taste Wash mushrooms (do not soak).

CZECHOSLOVAK AMERICAN ETHNICS IGNORED IN COMMEMORATION THROUGH U.S ASSASSINATION INDEPENDENCE ANTARCTICA Three groupings shown above will, with some study, suggest a form of discrimination against those of Czechoslovak and/or Bohemian American ethnicity. The lint group illustrates American individuals who were assassinated in the pursuit of their beliefs and principles, and is conspicuous by the omission of Anton J. Cermák, Mayor of Chicago, who was slain in 1933 while attending a public reception for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The second group reprsents stamps celebrating the independence of Mexico and Finland, but excludes that of Czechoslovakia a nation constituted through and by the efforts of President Woodrow Wilson in October 1918. It’s constitution was patently modeled after that of the United States and it’s independence was announced on October 26,1918, by Tomas G. Masaryk, seated at the historic signatory desk in Philadelphia’s Independence HaH, cradle of our own and Czechoslovak liberties. The third group shows four individuals who have contributed to the discovery and exploration of Antarctica. Pahner and Wilkes never set foot on the land, observing their discoveries from the decks of their sailing ships and were never within the South Pole by air and merely flew over the site. Admiral George John Dufek, (not shown) bom of Czech descent (1903), a graduate of the United States Naval Academy; veteran of four Antarctic visitations; seeing service in World War II as an aviator and commander of an escort carrier; commander of the carrier „Antietam” in the Korean conflict; finally was the first American to set foot on the South Pole itself, where he planted the American Flag on October 31,1956. These three examples suggest a pattern of discrimination against everything dear to the hearts of Czechoslovak ethnic groups. Historically, people of Czechoslovak birth, descent and heritage have always entered the mainstream of American culture without reservation. POSTAL ISSUES In colonial times Augustine Hermann (b. Prague, cl6O5 - d. Cecil County, Maryland, 1686) was prominent in defining the boundaries of Maryland, the Old Line State, through surveys for which he was granted thousands of square miles of land. Karel Jonas (1840-1896) founder in 1860 of the first Czech periodical in the United States; United States Consul to Prague (1886-1889); Lieutenant-Governor of Wisconsin, (1890-1892) and the author of the Bohemian-English Dictionary that did much to prepare the immigrant in his quest for American citizenship. Edward Rosewater (1841- 1906), founder and editor of the Omaha Bee, a newspaper unique for its time and notable for its innovations in the annals of American journalism. Rudolph Friml (1879-1972) Prague bom composer who came to America and gave to the entertainment world such timeless musicals as „The Firefly”, „Rose Marie”, „The Vagabond Kmg”, with such unforgettable individual songs as „Giannina Mia”, „Indian Love Call”, „Song of the Vagabonds”, „Only A Rose”, and „The March of the Musketeers”. In the early 1890’s, Antonin Dvorak, the first Bohemain composer to achieve world-wide recognition, visited America as an instructor of a musical conservatory and left behind the monumental symphony „From The New World”, the stirring „American String Quintet”, and the all time favorite „Humoresque”. Even in modem Space history Czechoslovak Americans have distinquished themselves in the persons of Eugene A. Ceman and James A. Lovell, Jr. There are many more that can be added to this list but let those mentioned illustrate the enterprise that Czechoslovak Americans have contributed to American culture. They are only thumbnail sketches of a few individuals and do not adequately reflect the contributions of the great mass of Czechoslovak Americans in all walks of life. One would think that, at this point in time, someone of Czechoslovak American ancestry would have found a place among the dozens of small definitive stamps illustrating celebrated Americans, some of them indiscriminately. The Sokol, a strictly Czechoslovak American cultural and physical association established in St. Louis in 1865 has prepared countless thousands for decent citizenship, a contribution that has shown Czechoslovak Americans to have a very high degree of literacy and correspondingly low level of delinquency with the resulting factor of minimal crime among its members. Due to physical fitness through Sokol activities, Czechoslovak American inductees in the armed forces are near the top among non-commissioned officers. The FBI will bear out these facts without question. One comes to the reluctant but obvious conclusion that Czechoslovak Americnas, as an ethnic group, has been grossly discriminated against, neglected and short-changed in the area of philately, as a propaganda medium that the postal service is inclined to boast about. This instructive message has been prepared and passed on to those, like yourself, involved in American leadership, at the expense and effort of private indi- vidual(s) in the hope that it will give you food for thought and serve as a reminder for you to react in Czechoslovak American favor should the opportunity present itself.

Antonin Petrof, and many other outstanding personalities, masters of their art, helped to shape it. Their present successors in the Czech piano-making school still profit from their experience. In 1984, the Year of Czech Music, we also observed the 120th anniversary of the establishment of the Petrof factory. Let us glance briefly at a few pages written by history. What arc the origins of the PETROF trademark? In 1864, Antonin Petrof built his first piano in a small joiner's workshop at Hradec Králové, owned by his father. Antonin Petrof, who had learned the trade as an apprentice with his Czech-born uncle J. Heicman in Vienna, thus virtually iaiding the firm foundation for the Czech school of piano-making. He continued to live and work at Hradec Králové until his death in 1915. In his time, Antonin Petrof was a man of highly progressive views, moreover diligent, vigorous, ambitious, and clever at learning promptly all novelties in the making of grand and upright pianos in the world and at applying the newly-won knowledge in his own firm. He studied systematically, was a great traveller, and continued to establish new contacts. He was a very demanding employer, particularly with regard to his three sons, Jan, Antonin and Vladimir, who continued his work after his death. There is every indication that the founder of the Petrof firm was fully aware that the building keyboard instruments required highly skilled, high-precision and artistic work, closely inter-linked with the performing art. The work of the present Czech piano-makers is rooted in all such past experience and tradition and develops in close cooperation with prominent Czechoslovak pianists, while also respecting the requirements of foreign artists and the best experience available from them. For instance, the Petrof firm cooperates closely with pianists of the calibre of František Rauch, Josef Páleníček, Ivan Moravec and Valentina Kameníková, all of them professors at Prague’s Academy of Arts, and many others. Petrofs research department, in particular, is guided by the views and opinion of the Piano- Building Assessement Commission headed by Dr. Ladislav Vachulka and Dr. Václav Holzknecht. Prominent world pianists have performed on Petrof pianos on concert stages in all continents. One meets Petrof grand and upright pianos in schools of music, conservatories and radio and TV' studios. Petrof upright pianos are intimate companions in many thousands of tnusic-loving families in more than 70 countries of the world. Petrof master instruments have won much praist from the world’s leading pianists, including A. B. Mi chelangeli, Sviatoslav Richter or Julius Katchen. as wei as Oscar Peterson, Count Basie and Ray Charles in th< jazz field. Petrof grand and upright pianos have beer awarded more than 40 medals at world exhibitions anc international fairs, including a Gold Medal at the Brus seis EXPO, the Quality Prize in Spain in 1974—- 1976 a Gold Medal at the 1978 Brno International Consume: Goods Fair for the Mondial I model, and a Gold Meda: for the Petrof IH/3-A model at the same fair in 1984. Many leading musicians and film personalities also own Petrof pianos, including Gilbert Becaud, Charles Aznavour or Sofia Loren. The popular singer Ude Jurgens was highly successful with his white Petrof at many concerts on his 1983 LIVE TOUR of Austria Switzerland and the Federal Republic of Germany. Czechoslovak-made Petrof keyboard instruments are exported to more than 70 countries throughout the world by the Prague-based Musicexport foreign trade organization, whose good commercial work over the past 20 years has further helped to strengthen the Petrof trademark’s position on many foreign markets. Rich, lovely tone, sophisticated sound in all ranges and elegant design — those are only some of the strong points of the Petrof grands and uprights, which combine the beauty of Czech and Slovak music with the master skills and experience of their makers. Instruments of perfect tonal harmony, they reflect the high aesthetic and artistic standards of the Czech piano-making school and the rich work and technical experience of its protagonists. There are fine Petrof models (particularly uprights) to satisfy the average pianist, as well as Petrof master instruments for the most discriminating concert players. They are made in Bohemia by true masters of the trade, who carry on the great tradition bequeathed to them by their grandfathers and fathers, sustained by their great love for their art and their confidence that the instruments will serve in peace the art of music the world over.

In 1986, they released their first tape which consisted of Czech Christmas carols and religious hymns which the ladies learned as children at home and in school. The tape includes such favorites as Nesem Varn Noviny, Narodil Se Kristus Pan, Pujdem Spolu do Betlema, Zdravas Maria, Tisickrat Pozdravujeme Tebe, etc. These songs originated in Czechoslovakia and were brought over by parents, grandparents and great-grandparents when they immigrated to America. Before these songs are lost to generations to come, these ladies thought it was important that they be preserved in some way. Response to the tape was excellent especially from older Czechs who remember the singing at Czech Masses. Since that time, the Singers have released two other tapes, consisting of polkas and waltzes, again featuring original Czechoslovakian songs brought over by ancestors; such favorites as Black Gypsy Waltz, Annie Cutting Grass Polka, Green Meadow Waltz. Also included with each tape are sing-a-long words for those who enjoy singing along.Musicians featured in these cassettes are Georgie Losack, John Dujka, Mark Dujka, Rod Mathews, Will Strieder and Scott Walzell. These individuals are truly accomplished musicians, and produce a beautifully COordinated accompaniment to the voices of the Singers. The tapes are recorded in stereo. The singers are Martha Viktorin, Birdie Hlavinka, Margie Vacek, Martha Janik, Georgoe Losack, Marge Hlavinka and Yvone Krenek. The Singers began their group in 1986 although they had been singing together for 25 years for weddings, funerals and Sunday Masses. They have performed at many functions in the surrounding area including various Czech and Koiache Festivals. They most recently performed at the South Texas Czech Heritage Festival in Corpus Christi. The Singers were featured in an article complete with full color picture in the May 1988 issue of "Československy Svet", Czechoslovakia’s couterpart of "Life" Magazine. Quoting the women, "We are an amateur group living in a small town....70 kilometers west of Houston, Texas. We are all of Czech descent. Our parents and grandparents immigrated to Texas from Moravia 75 to 100 years ago, settling and farming here. We try to retain some of the customs of our ancestors and try to retain use of the Czech language. We love to sing the songs we learned to sing as children." The magazine featured only one other United States Czech singing group which was the Czechoslovak Moravian Club of Endicott, Pennsylvania. See advertisement in this Vestnik for further info.
