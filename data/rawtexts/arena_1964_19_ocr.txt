[pageend2]ARENA THE WRITER AND SEMANTICS : LITERATURE AS LANGUAGE, CONCEPT AND MEANING International P.E.N. proposes to hold a Congress in Oslo this summer, at the invitation of the Norwegian Centre. The theme is « The Writer and Semantics ». This theme allows for and demands a number of subdivisions. In our century, semantics is and has revealed itself to be a study with universal application and crucial significance. For a writer, it is a very practical concern and one can go so far as to say that his personal attitude towards the words and concepts he uses reflects not only his attitude towards the world and towards human and social life, but may provide a key to his stature and value as a writer, and even to the kind of writer he has become. This has a special application to P.E.N. for P.E.N. is an organisation of writers which stands for certain CONCEPTS. These are formalised in its Charter to which individuals and centres must subscribe on joining. They include freedom of expression and freedom from racial discrimination and oppression. The basic concept is just FREEDOM. But Freedom is after all never a 1 [pageend3]pure abstraction : it is always FOR or FROM. That entails that it can only be recognised in concrete and particular circumstances. In practice, all concepts have roots in conditions of time and space, in the history and the cultural activities that have given any community its character. Quite apart from any questions of distortion, prejudice or propaganda, writers who are born, as all human beings are, into a particular society with a particular history, have to come to terms with the concept of freedom in its local meaning. This is true of all the concepts they encounter but I suggest that « freedom » has and al- ways has had a peculiar urgency for writers, for however it is used it must entail the question : How far can any writer function authentically within any given group or society ? How far is he essentially an Outsider, a nonconformist, the grit in the oyster, the thorn in the flesh ? the one who simply does not like the face of any authority ? How far can he MEAN what his society MEANS (and means to have). Broadly we have tended to identify the Occident with curiosity, revolt, experimentation — which may lead to scientific discovery or to originality in art and which is based on self-assertion (a fact which may make it easier for us to organise aggression or violence).. To the West anyway, the Orient on the other hand has meant passivity, fatalism, acceptance and a POLICY of non-violence (meaning at least that the fights are private and are not automatically idealised or glorified). As the East and West approach each other in the one world, the psychological distinction reduces itself maybe to a greater or lesser acceptance of authority. All this can hardly fail to provide a valuable and stimulating background of discussion, and no doubt a controversial one, since this particular discussion will be barren if not hypocritical unless it opens up profound 2 [pageend4]divergencies. That is all to the good: for otherwise there is no chance of healing them or even of making them realistic. The Oslo Congress is going to be a meeting of writers : but if it were of politicians or master-bakers, some preliminary semantic discussion would still be relevant. In practice, the study of semantics, how we say or fail to say what we mean, still receives little attention. This neglect particularly among writers is remarkable because in practice much of the actual argument at meetings and conferences boils down to definitions, claims and counter-claims about what anybody means (though this may often be still part of human warfare, sidetaking instead of disinterestedness) : and also because language, its uses and abuses, is now perennially topical. Whether they realise it or not, writers are profoundly affected by the discussion, now some generations old, about language, which is their medium and livelihood. They have been affected directly in the kinds of ways in which it is possible to use language and speech : and indirectly through living in a world which for good or bad has been forced to pay some attention to its ways of communicating : whether the results have been some new current of realism, a local heightening of honesty and self-awareness and therefore of human understanding : or whether, on the other hand, there has been nothing but a tightening up and perfecting of the techniques of lying. From Nazism to advertising, the moral history of our time unfortunately suggests that human beings learn the destructive applications of any new study more quickly than the creative ones. It even seems that George Orwell’s novel „1984”, whose most interesting aspect is the description of NEWSPEAK, a language of lies which is being evolved to a mathematical accuracy, could have been antedated some twenty years. 3 [pageend5]The social aspect of language — using « social» in the fullest sense of moral, psychological, intellectual and cultural — has indeed received a great deal of attention. The English philosopher, the late Susan Stebbing, is worth mentioning, for two books, THINKING TO SOME PURPOSE and PHILOSOPHY AND THE PHYSICISTS, which are lively studies of both the structure and content of language in their misapplications and abuses of meaning. These books are important because coming comparatively early in the history of modern English linguistics, they show a realisation that the science of logic, the abstract study of professional logicians, cannot be quite assimilated to logic in use. Philosophers, English ones in particular, have somewhat dangerously and misleadingly neglected this realisation. Partly this has been because they were unduly impressed by the precision of results obtained in the mathematical sciences and erected on this basis a very abstract standard of « correct » thinking. This developed into a tendency to deny that you were thinking at all if the results of your thinking could not be objectively verified or tested : and also to insist that there should be an objective and measurable standard of meaning or sense (and all the rest is non-sense). Professor Stebbing realised that the structure of one’s thinking greatly depends on the direction of one’s needs and interests : thinking among other things is a process of relating the objects of one’s attention (and attention is what one lives by). In other words, one’s meanings are not to be sharply distinguished from one’s intentions: and one’s intentions can be honest and realistic adaptations to necessity, to what goes on whether we like it or not: or they can be misdirected, and fail in this submission to the given realities. She spends much space on the linguistic distortions of journalists and politicians. But she gives as much or more to the false abstractions of scientists, significant 4 [pageend6]scientists like Eddington or Jeans whom she admires but who, she shows, can talk high-minded nonsense outside their expert spheres : who, to put it briefly, have not developed a logic of complete applicability and whose more general concepts often represent some of the habitual and unexamined assumptions of their ideological life. She is entertaining without being satirical: and she can only be seen to be even ironical against our present exaggerated expectations from the «scientific» approach to all our problems, material and personal. All of us, scientists or not, have to learn to accept and be conditioned by our real experiences, to discriminate what is the case, any case, from what is not, and not even to hope that our habitual assumptions are in any way privileged. Even science is too serious a matter to leave to the scientists. Our words or concepts are at best representatives, giving a more or less honest report of the events of existence. The late Count Alfred Korzybski, writing and teaching in America, put this in a kind of slogan : WORDS ARE NOT THINGS. His best-known book, SCIENCE AND SANITY is an admonition that we must always be aware in speech and writing that we are abstracting from reality. It is also an analysis of the different levels at which abstraction operates. Korzybski attacks Aristotelian logic which particularly misleads us by the status it has given to the little word « is ». This has given rise to grammatical forms which make it appear that two distinct existences can be identified: and hence a load of semantic woes, not only confusion about what we actually refer to in discourse, but confusion in our cerebral and nervous states. For Korzybski believes that the neurotic attitudes of our civilisation arise from semantic malfunctioning : our afferent and efferent nervous system is getting many of its signals wrong or mixed: and indeed he 5 [pageend7]hoped by sorting out our semantics to build a system of psychotherapy. This system is called General Semantics and it has produced an Institute in America which has been able to effect a permanant influence. In this necessarily shallow sketch, Korzybski is relevant because he regards language as our essential business and is determined to make us mind our business: and further because he regards the exact relevant because he regards language as our essential standard. In my view this leads him to neglect Aesthetics, both in the special and the general sense. His theory of perception, that is, does not properly allow for the artist’s or the poet’s way of looking at the world. To give one brief example: an apple, according to Korzybski, exists at different levels of abstraction. To Korzybski, the «sensed» apple is more abstract than the « scientific » apple (by which he presumably means the exact account of its physico-chemical composition). This seems to be PREJUDICED in favour of scientific description or discourse, in other words in favour of some sort of discursive representation or reference, compared with the attempt to use words or some artistic medium to render direct apperception. For we must take this rejection of the apple’s uniqueness as a real and particular object of SOMEBODY’S perception, in conjunction with Korzybski’s other idea that reality is non-verbal and cannot be reached by words, or any form of discourse, alone. There is a point where they are ALL on the same level of remoteness from experience. Let us remember that the apple can be eaten as well as looked at or described. It has been held by some primitive races at least that eating is a way of knowing ! The apple can also be painted or be part of a poem. Korzybski, it appears, is helping towards the demotion of the poetic and imaginative uses of language. He is indeed rather weightily on the side of the dichotomy 6 [pageend8]— we could almost call it « split» — between thought and feeling which has run through linguistic study in our century and which involves all our other attitudes and investigations. It is this aspect which is most important to writers, and 1 shall give it the rest of my space. To begin with, let me contrast two statements. Both are concerned with the beginnings of modern semantic inquiry. The first is from THE MEANING OF MEANING, by C.K. Ogden and I.A. Richards, which was first published in 1923. It concerns the « ... speculations of the late F. de Saussure, a writer regarded by perhaps the majority of French and Swiss students as having for the first time placed linguistic upon a scientific basis. The author begins by inquiring: „What is the object, at once integral and concrete, of linguistic ?” He does not ask whether there in one, he obeys... the primitive impulse to infer from a word some object for which it stands, and sets out determined to find it. » The quotation which heads the other side of the dichotomy is from J-P. Sartre (WHAT IS LITERATURE). « The crisis which broke out in language at the beginning of this century is a poetic crisis. » Yves Bonnefoy who has written very wisely and with profound knowledge on the difference between English and French literary criticism would say that there is significance in the fact that one of these quotations is from an English, the other from a French source. So there is, but I don’t want to labour the distinction. The point here is that the English one is very English indeed: it was sired by the history of English empiricism in philosophy : and its dam is the English attitude of love-hate towards poetry. 1 should not like to try and say how French the other one is. 7 [pageend9]For my present purpose, the most important aspect of THE MEANING OF MEANING, an immensely influential book, is the division it makes between the two uses of language, the scientific or informative, and the evocative or emotive. Thinking or meaning depends on reference to some object : it is CAUSED by experience. Evocative (or «emotive ») statements (including poetry and ethical statements) are non- referential. One of the co-authors later distinguished himself by excellent poetic and literary analysis (and also as a practicing poet) : and there is little doubt that the original aim of the two authors was by no means to impeach poetry or to undermine the value of poetic usage. Their aim might rather have been to relieve poetry of unfitting moral and didactic responsibilities and so to purify our idea of it. (This approach has a certain antiquated air of chivalry about it, faintly resembling that of gentlemen of the old school who don’t want woman to be smirched and burdened by civil rights). Later unfortunately there were powerful auxiliaries to this great divide which came from philosophy, via the Vienna Circle, the Logical Positivists, Wittgenstein, and an emphatic little book, called LANGUAGE, TRUTH AND LOGIC, which was later, but only tacitly, disowned by its author, A.J, Ayer. This book made a much more ruthless cleavage: meaning or sense was what you knew in principle how to verify : and all the rest was not meaningful — or non-sense. Poetry and moral statement were again described as « emotive », but now with a much more pejorative force. The book made a great stir and the polemic about it died down only a few years ago. It frightened ethical philosophers. However, many of them have since crept out of their holes with books in their shaking hands. Nevertheless a kind of subservience to a scientific ideal remains: the scientific being considerably 8 [pageend10]identified with the demonstrable or testable. In fact, the absolute standard of referentiality, that thought IS reference to an object, still strongly affects what we mean by meaning. I don't quite know how this continues to affect poets. I suspect that it affects imaginative fiction which nowadays suffers in my opinion from some documentary bias : it would be a brave novelist who would put the Zoo in Padua as Shakespeare would unhesitatingly have done! I suggest that those who have insisted that thought or meaning is referential or causative and that we may take this as the standard of SENSE, are harking back to a slightly earlier philosophical theory of truth — that what is true is what corresponds to some external and discoverable « reality ». Opposed to this is another theory — the coherence theory of truth — which claims that what is true depends on the necessary relations within a system. Most of the scientists I have talked to who hold any philosophical views about their work adhere to this rather than to the former theory. To go back now to Sartre’s statement which I quoted earlier « The crisis in language... is a crisis in poetry », I should like to amend this by saying that the crisis in language was caused by the realisation of an opposition between poetic and scientific or informative meaning. Nevertheless in its original form Sartre’s statement is highly relevant because it refers to the new and formative contribution (influenced of course by Mallarmé and Poe) which Paul Valery made to poetic theory and poetic semantics. Infiltrating into English poetry by way of T.S. Eliot in particular, these ideas have happily had more effect I should say than the slighting semasiology of philosophers. Nevertheless it appears that Valery’s ideal of a « pure » poetry may have been affected by a wish to preserve poetry's semantic virginity in a harsh world of scientific objectivity. His idea of meaning was influenced by the mathematician 9 [pageend11]Poincare, and depended on the internal relations of a poem not on its external references. But it is of great significance that Valery grasped the nature of scientific imagination more fully than many of those who have too sharply and unfavourably opposed the scientific kind of mind to the literary. Valery understood that original scientific thinking shares something subjective with the poetic kind. This is clear from his INTRODUCTION A LA METHODE DE LEONARD DE VINCE where he shows that « out of the disorder of interests and curiosities, the great mind has first to unify not its subject-matter but ITSELF ». This notion of a self-unifying mind and imagination has been left out of most of the discussion about Two Cultures, the literary and the scientific, which lately has gone on to the limits of boredom in England and America and which is coupled with the name of Sir Charles Snow. It looks as if by science Snow means technological achievement, not a certain imaginative approach to the world. And it is significant that he leaves poetry out of the account. At Oslo it may be realised that the « Two Cultures » is the ultimate production of the great dichotomy to which I have been referring : and that it too is a semantic issue. KATHLEEN NOTT. 10 [pageend12]HANS GEELMUYDEN THE BEGINNINGS « Yank journalism is hopeless ! » my Afrikaner friend cried. «They say South Africa has twelve million Coloureds !» «In America, Colored means Non-European, not Coloured. » « It’s wrong !» « An American speaks American. You speak South African. » «Is Negro right for Bantu too ? » « Negro and Bantu are two things. » «All over Africa, Coloured is mixed breed only... » «... not Non-European, in Europe Non-White, Coloured in America. If I want an American visa, they ask if I’m Caucasian, which I’m not, because I’m White, while you are European after 300 years in Africa. American Whites are Europeans to you, while black men in Europe are NonEuropeans — and if Aryans are Caucasian, and so are Jews probably, they aren’t Aryan if you are a Nazi. » «What does Coloured mean in Europe ? » «Among black and white Europeans, Coloured is understood as Coloured in the American sense. » « What do you mean ?» « Piet, in your Afrikaans language, Kleurling means African Coloured, and in Dutch, American Coloured, Non-European to you ; and in all your heated debates in Holland, you say Kleurling to Dutchmen who retort Kleurling. » « That’s right.» « Only the English language seems to distinguish Southern Africa from South Africa, and an African is black, and an Afrikaner a white Boer. All Teutonic languages seem to call both of them Afrikaner, so Boers, Bantus and Negroes are the same. » 11 [pageend13]« What’s a South African ? » « To you, Piet ? » «Both English speaking Europeans and Afrikaners are South Africans really, but in practice, we mean English speaking Europeans by it. We are 60 % Afrikaners and 40 % South Africans. » « Non-Europeans are not South Africans ? » « They are Bantus, Coloureds and Indians. » « In Europe, plain South African means Bantu, more and more, Bantu only. People like you are White South Africans. » « Are you mad ? » «If you say African for Bantu and European for White, you admit that you don’t belong in Africa. » « What are our Coloureds in Europe ? » « Not on the map. » «But last time the National Party won the Parliamentary Election, the opposition papers’ headlines said : ALL SOUTH AFRICANS IN SORROW. What did Europe say ?» « ALL SOUTH AFRICANS IN SORROW, including the winning majority. » « You mean that after a Conservative Parliamentary victory in Britain, South African papers ought to say: ALL BRITONS IN SORROW ?» « That’s right. The Afrikaner press too. » This happened in Cape Town ten years ago — I thought of Piet now, when I read in a paper that only 3 % of the Natives learn English, so oppressed are the 12 million Coloureds. As Christians, Afrikaans or English speaking or bilingual, and civilized, with no tribal background, the Coloureds are Sociological Europeans with African admixture, not the other way round. Let us say Afrikaans is the first language of 600,000. Ignoring its existence, cheating by making out that a 12 [pageend14]million Coloureds are the same as twelve million NonEuropeans, 400,000 English speaking Coloureds are magically transformed into 3 % of 12 million Bantus. All the figures are obsolete, incidentally. If there is one country about which everybody has a dead certain opinion without having been closer to it than 6,000 miles, it is South Africa — yet you hardly meet any person anywhere who does not mix all the terms for all the people who live there. If the Afrikaners contend that they are being oppressed by the South Africans, this will appear in the press, even the British and American, as white oppression of the Bantus, while it means that the white Boers are oppressed by the white English speakers. It matters little if this is done deliberately or not. The falsehood is the same in its consequences. In a world-renowned American publication, I read: « Afrikaans : a weird mixture of English, Dutch and Swahili». Swahili is spoken in East Africa. At a P.E.N. Congress, a Delegate handed me some plays : « Lees dit en se vir my more wat jy dink » — « Read it and say for me morn what thou think ». The Swahili dash made this very tough, and though Afrikaans did look halfway between Dutch and Norwegian to me, this was my first contact, so the first play took me several hours to read. Some weeks later, this Afrikaner emerged beaming from an Ibsen performance in Oslo : « The last twenty minutes, I understood every Norwegian word». Some time later, an Embassy fellow told me that Afrikaans was a bastard lingo, and after this again, an Oslo daily called Afrikaans a weird mixture of English, Dutch and Swahili. Just as Scandinavians do, Dutchmen and Afrikaners can converse, each in his language. The American language has the Oxford Dictionary plus its own — Afrikaans has the Dutch Woordeboek, plus. English is flooding many languages nowadays — but with English in the country, Afrikaans can survive only if fanatically purist, which is its weakness — 13 [pageend15]while the very strength of English is in being the most bastard of tongues, absorbing anything anywhere. Press people always quote : «You can fool part of the reading public the whole time, the whole public part of the time, but not the whole public all the time». This sentence is a double lie — first, because it is used to numb those who are beginning to suspect that they are being fooled all the time, and secondly, it is a lie in itself, because it denies the only true sentence : «You can fool the whole of the reading public all the time», and in case of need, you can if you quote : «You can fool part of the reading public the whole time, the whole public part of the time, but not the whole public all the time », because this flatters each individual into believing that he is among those few who cannot be fooled — all the time. I had swallowed the western version of the Iron Curtain — that Russia was so scared of our free democratic press revealing the honest truth, that she had curtained herself off, to keep the cat in the bag. I began to wonder if it might not be the other way round, Russian protection against shameless dialectics., once a free democratic press had been admitted. I aired this to a friend, and he replied : « So you’re a Communist ». Once launched, a lie cannot be stopped. A Tribe practised marriage between brother and sister. Marriage was Aqatuq. The reporter used Aqatuq as meaning Incest. The Tribe became Christian, brother and sister marriages were abolished — 500 years later, a daily asked a Tribe priest if he believed in Aqatuq. « Aye, do believe Holy Marriage ». The newspaper wrote that this pious Christian had advocated Aqatuq. «INCEST MUST STOP ! » The Tribe erased Aqatuq from their Phoque Dictionary — after all, the word was theirs, so everyone had a right to decide what it meant. The Tribe adopted the English word Marriage. In Oslo recently, asked about his views on Marriage, a Tribe student endorsed Marriage. The paper wrote that he practised Aqatuq. 14 [pageend16]Should an Englishman eat an indigestible cake in Budapest, Hungarian for Cake will enter the Oxford Dictionary as Tummyache. When the Allies commenced massive bombing of German cities, the BBC said : «Now, the Germans will find out what Blitzkrieg means ! ». On the other hand, English alone seems to distinguish the Industry of the industrious, from the Industries of the industrial. I don’t know why this was never used to prove that Industries are conceivable in capitalist democracies only, because communist dictatorships are capable merely of Zeal. It seems that this earth consists of men and women who use flattering terms if they do something — which they ignore or slaughter through obnoxious terms if others do exactly the same. And I don’t mean English speakers are worse ; but Norway’s population is like Brooklyn’s, our demagogy doesn’t spread, we are easily piped down, and cannot shirk the corrective of opposite dialectics. A tongue shared by 400 million and possibly the leading second language, will thousandfold inflate the danger and responsibility. But being born to a world language sometimes does not change one into a broader personality. You cannot convince a Manhattan subway nickel changer that he is parochial, for he is in New York, big city alright, Yes Sir. The gravest danger seems to lie in that, while Mr. Everyman may be critical in wartime, if enemy occupied, or if you live across that wall of shame, he will switch off in peacetime, as far as his own compatriots, or protagonists abroad are concerned and after an initial injection of onesidedness from that source, he is immune to all other sources, including objective ones. During World War I, some British Office of Psychological Warfare received a useless picture of a mess of cauldrons after an explosion in a Shangai restaurant kitchen. But there were rumours that the Boches boiled fat from uniformed Allied carcases. As photography cannot lie, this picture was 15 [pageend17]distributed everywhere, the caption stating that this was the factory where Allied mothers’ sons were reduced to Hun soap. Psychological Warfare Esq. caught the tube home, played with his Allied kids and chatted with Madge about cricket, separately, and versus, gas war. A decent person could do this picture stuff because there was a war on, and he could not know that German immigrants were going to be beaten senseless in Australia in 1932. Nazi propaganda tried to copy these much-admired accomplishments but failed, because the point is in showing the unknown in terms of the wellknown among the recipients. To show the spectacular beauty, after all, of an air raid, you might sigh : « Ack-Ack, the fireworks of war » — but somehow, « Fireworks is peacetime Flak » is not poetry. A Nazi booster in Oslo, urged us that the Theatre was the Panzer der Kultur — Tank of Culture — which of course evacuated our theatres altogether. A friend of mine nutshelled this perverse approach in an ad. For a new, enticing scent : « Bedingunglose Übergebung» with the slogan : « Perfume is a Gas Blitz on your Sexualfrontsektor », ever so much more forcefully alluring than the feeble mufti « Total Surrender ». We did not distinguish Germans from Nazis then •— we do now, and it is long since we retracted as obsolete : « Swedes are Germans in a human shape », although there is, for once, a dead exact translation into British : «We don’t like the American way of life ». Words can do a lot, and these things die hard. But what can they do against nuclear havoc ? Point 4 of the P.E.N. Charter ends : «... since freedom implies voluntary restraint, members pledge themselves to oppose such evils of a free press as mendacious publications, deliberate falsehood and distortion of facts for political and personal ends. » This always struck me as feeble, because you cannot expel a signatory unless you can prove deliberate falsehood. Of course, journalism is not writing, but investigating, then writing — or 16 [pageend18]omitting to. But simply by working flippantly fast, without investigating properly, you can print anything and crawl out from under the Charter, saying you believed it was so. Considering that seven thousand members of P.E.N. have signed the Charter — don’t tell me all psychological warfare is carried out by non-members. As for the rest, the press is the chief sinner, because these mass-distributors work too fast on too many themes. Why are not journalists including Noosmen, members ? P.E.N. is open to all writers... It is up to P.E.N. to do something drastic, to be unlabelled Vague Plastic Tower or «Devon Cream, Devon Poetry & Meself ». So I thought, why not something in this vein as a Congress Theme ? They nodded : The Writer and Semantics. Literature as Concept, Meaning and Expression. Well, I never. However, this is a beginning. P.E.N. must say « Semantics », though I thought that one had been thrashed out at the time of the Tower of Babel, which was not plastic. I am only hoping that after our Congress, weeks will elapse before I read that 3 % of 12 million Bantus learn English because 400,000 Coloureds are English speaking. The conclusion may be correct, but not because the proof of the eating is in the pudding. 17 [pageend19]MARGARET MASTERMAN THE SEMANTIC BASIS OF HUMAN COMMUNICATION The purpose of this study is to examine the foundations of a new hard science, the raw material of which is at present proceeding out of my mouth. This fact, -— that the primary data for any study of language are fleeting and auditory, not visual and permanent, •— constitutes the first difficulty in establishing the study of language as a scientific field. To confront this difficulty, the special science of phonetics has, as you know, been founded and developed. This study, the object of which is to identify and examine the actual sounds made by any language speakers, has achieved some remarkable initial results, though it is now running into theoretic difficulties. Strictly speaking, moreover, all examination of language and of languages, without exception, should be founded upon the data furnished by the science of phonetics ; and we shall see later what new light has been thrown on the study of the foundations of human communication by the fact that one man who was investigating in this field is a Professor of Phonetics who takes phonetic data seriously. Traditionally, however, the human race has, up to now, largely by-passed the challenge presented to it by phonetics 18 [pageend20]by substituting, for the study of the primary phonetic data of language, the study of differing languages, — or, speaking more exactly, of texts, — presented visually in some of the world’s many language scripts. This substitution, however, of script for sound destroys at once the generality of the subject. For the first thing to realise, in approaching the general study of scripted language, is how very many of these scripts there are, and from what diverse scripting-principles they have been built up. Thus, at the beginning of the English-language-teaching illustrated primer, English Through Pictures, there is a short preface written in 40-odd different languages. These require, between them, nearly 20-odd different scripts. Moreover, these scripts embody, between them, four vitally differing scripting principles. Thus, there is the Chinese script, which is often incorrectly described as an ideography, which has a different visual sign for each Chinese «word». Then there are the Japanese and Korean scripts, which are syllabaries, — one sign for each syllable ; then there are the Hebrew and Tamil scripts, usually described as consonantial, in them, the syllabary principle has begun to be phonetically systematised, in that they distinguish the consonants within the syllable. And finally, there is the much larger group of alphabetic scripts, Greek, Cyrillic and Roman, in some scriptings of which the different letters of the script represent fairly well the fundamental sounds of the language being scripted, and in other scriptings of which, — as, for instance, in the Romanletter scripting of English, •— they don’t. Thus, in beginning any comparative studies of scripted languages, and starting with the scripts, the student always has to contend with, and 19 [pageend21]allow for, the differently-distorting media of the various scripting principles, which make the different languages which they variously portray look even more unlike one another than they really are. Nevertheless, it has got to be faced that the scripted text, rather than the phonetic transcription, is still now the accepted point of start, even for those who are attempting a scientific study of the nature of languages. Here are examples of the ideographic, syllabic, consonantal and alphabetic scripting principles. The sentence which is being scripted in the various languages, when translated into English, reads as follows: ENGLISH THROUGH PICTURES The book will teach you the first steps of English. It gives you about 500 important words in sentences; with the meaning shown through pictures.

ALPHABETIC 22 RUSSIAN [pageend24]Accepting now the current script-based situation as it is, if we ask ourselves what scientific procedure is suggested by the comparative study of the pieces of script just shown, the obvious first answer is : «The study of their patterning». Not only can we discern individual recurrent signs in the pattern of any fairly long piece of script; we can also discern even with the naked eye, recurrences of combinations of such signs. And if we code up the signs of a text into binary code, which there are accepted principles for doing, and then examine the resulting sequence using a digital computer, we find that we can discover, and define in terms of sign-concomitance, and of sign recurrence, many initially non-discernible very interesting features of the text, and of its style. Moreover, there is hope that, by pushing this method further, we shall be able, in the course of time, to discover many more. And of course, there is nothing to stop us comparing the results reached from such study of scripted texts with results reached from a phonetic transcription of the same text, provided the language which is being studied is one which is still spoken ; thus putting the findings of the machine-aided science of phonetics at the service of this second machine-aided science of scientific, or descriptive, linguistics. And it goes without saying that all the findings of descriptive linguistics, being as they are exact findings, findings objectively arrived at from the examination of agreed material, have got to be taken, like the findings of phonetics, extremely seriously. Nevertheless, these findings are still not what I want to talk about; and for two reasons. The first reason is that any study of patterning in any scientific field, will always serve to throw into primary relief the complexities of the field rather than its homogeneities ; to show how unlike any one piece of the raw material of the field is to any other ; and how very little emerges as being really in common between one pattern and another once the procedure for examining pattern is made really exact. So it is in language. 23 [pageend25]Once the procedure for examining the patterning of any text is made really strict, — as it has to be if a digital computer is to be used as the tool for doing the examination, — not only do we find that the patterning of any text in any natural language differs fundamentally from the patterning of any text in any other. We also discover that natural language patterning changes drastically from place to place, — thus defining dialects, — and with the passage of time, — thus defining diachronic variation. Finally we find that even within one dialect, recorded at one time, there occur different types of text, — that is, texts which have considerably different patternings, as defined by the procedure ; and, to cap all, that even within one type of text different patternings are characteristic of the work of different authors. Now, if we are going to have a new scientific field, — a field, as contrasted with a quantity of initially-similar-looking material which can be so prepared as to be examinable by a single scientific procedure, — you have got to find not only what is complicated in your material, but also what is simple : not only what diversifies, but also what stays the same. In other words, if you are going to create and establish a new scientific field you have not only got to describe and classify your data ; you have also got to interpret it, in the light of some picture of it which is simpler than itself. And immediately we try to interpret, as well as to compare, descriptive linguistic findings of texts, it becomes clear that we have got to find some new and deeper principle of interpretation of them, — that is, if we are to establish that there is a general scientific field of language at all,—-which, actually, we all intuitively feel there is. To find this new principle of interpretation we have to place the texts back in their settings ; which means that we have to reconsider them more generally as communications, or messages, and not just as meaningless patterns. And this is just what, — science apart, — we have always known that they were. People speak and write to communicate with one 24 [pageend26]another ; not just to create, by the written record of the sets of recurrences of the sounds which they utter, beautiful and variegated two-dimensional mosaics. Spoken language is a human social institution for communicating, not just a very unmusical and erratically rhythmic tune. Our first step, then, having decided to widen the basis for data finding for our field, is to reexamine language as a social institution. As soon as we do this, we find that indeed, alongside phonetics and linguistics, there have grown up some very interesting and suggestive studies of the sociology and the psycho-biology of language. Unfortunately, however, these do not give us our principle of interpretation ; both because most of the social studies of language are still at the natural history, anecdotal stage ; and also because the procedures for investigation which are used in them, — especially by comparison with the beautiful and exact procedures used in machine-aided phonetics and in machine-aided linguistics, — are very vague indeed. So we ask ourselves : «Is there not any exact and, if possible, mechanisable procedure, with the aid of which we could examine communication itself, in such a way that, having once found out and cracked open the principles of its essential nature, we could then use these principles to interpret the linguistic-cum-phonetic data, and so create, from the study of language material, the new hard scientific field of which we are in search ?» There is yet one more exact scientific procedure with which we are not now concerned but on which we must now comment ; and that is, the set of procedures used in communication-theory. These have produced a new scientific discipline; and their raw material is the sets of signals, or codes, which human beings use to convey communication. But it is always assumed, in communication-theory, that before we can use these codes, we already know what human communication is. The procedures are most elegant; the results, in such applications as the simplification of telephone systems, are 25 [pageend27]often startling. Moreover, communication-theory, unlike linguistics, is a simplifying procedure, not a diversifying one ; but it simplifies too much ; for it examines communicating sets of signals on the assumption that any communication, conveyed by means of any such set, is, for scientific purposes, the same as any other ; whereas we all know very well that the vital fact about human communications is that they are not all the same as one another; they differ. So communication-theory, lastly, is not what we are looking for. What shall we do then, and how shall we proceed, to find out what human communication really is ? For centuries, a traditional answer has been given to this question from the province of logic, which, in the West, dates from Aristotle : A human communication essentially consists of a subject and a predicate, these two together forming a sentence. Any sentence can be connected up with other sentences by using connectors such as « and », « or », « if », « then », « all » or « some ». However, take a look at this machine-derived output, generated on an I.B.M. 7090 computer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology : THREE SELECTIONS FROM LOGICALLY CORRECT SETS OF SENTENCES MECHANICALLY GENERATED AT I.B.M. (a) (223) * AFTER HE IS COVERED, IT NEVER ADMIRES HIS STEAM. (224) * A SHORT SMOKESTACK IS OILED, AND IT ISN’T BRIGHT. (225) * IN WHAT WAY ISN’T A RUG OLD, AND WHY IS HE WIRY AND COOL. 26 [pageend28](226) * SHE MAKES SIX BOILERS AND HIS TRAGIC AND NEW LEG. (227) * WHAT IS HE COOLED FOR. Q (228) * BESIDE NO TRUCKS DOES HE OPERATE THE LEGS BEHIND THE FOUR BLACK WHEELS AND COTTON AND THREE FLOORS. (229) * IT NO LONGER RUNS IT, NOR DOES SHE PUT IT UNDER FOUR SMOOTH FLOORS. (230) * NEVER IS MACPHERSON APPRECIATIVE OF IT. (231) * HE DOESN’T MAKE A THIN HOUSE, NOR IS IT UPHOLSTERED. (232) * ISN’T SHE POLISHED UNDER MISS MACPHERSON AND PLANTS. Q (233) * WHEN ISN’T IT CLOSED. Q (b) (091) *IS HE BLUE, PROUD AND COLD, IS SHE HEATED, ISN’T HE UPHOLSTERED, OR DOES SHE SEEK HER CHAIR AND WILLITS.

Q (101) * IT IS SELDOM PAINTED, AND HE ISN’T PAINTED EITHER. (c) (173) * HE DOES HEAR THE WOOD AND THE FUNNY NEWSPAPERS BESIDE THE WATER. (174) * IS SHE OILED, AND IS HE COVERED. Q (175) * HOW IS SHE WIDE AND SHINY ? WHY ISN’T HE CLOTHED, AND HOW DOESN’T HE SEE THE RAT. Q (176) * THEN ISN’T SHE HEATED. Q (177) * WHEN ISN’T SHE FULL OF IT. Q (178) * ONLY UNDER THE RUG ABOVE SIX DRIVING WHEELS IS HER SANDDOME AWARE OF THE COLD SHOES. (179) * SHE IS NEVER GENTLE AND OLD, NOR IS STEAM FOND OF SIX LONG PENCILS. (180) * IT KEEPS IT, AND IT DOES HEAR THE PLANTS BELOW THE TWO TRAINS AND FIVE ROOFS. (181)* NOT EVEN IN FRONT OF MISS SMALL AND THE STEAM IS HE HEATED. (182)* HE DOES KEEP TWO BRIGHT ENGINES, AND HE IS TAME. (183) * IT DOES MAKE IT. In spite of the fact that, on the logical definition of human communication which I gave just now, all of these sentences, in this output, are logically faultless, I think we would all agree they have a screw loose somewhere. In fact, as you can guess, this set of sentences was produced by allowing the 28 [pageend30]machine to choose between sets of words of the correct syntactic sort by using a randomiser. In one sense, the machine production of them by M.I.T. marks a scientific milestone in fundamental language research, in that it provides a scientifically objective definition of nonsense. For just as any sequence of numbers produced by an accredited randomiser counts by definition as a random sequence, even if that sequence should in fact consist of the number-sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, so any sentence produced by the M.I.T. semantic-randomising procedure counts by definition as nonsense, or non-communication, even if the sentence so generated should turn out to be SHE IS NOT CLOTHED : HE DOES NOT NOTICE : HE IS OILED. Our problem, then, in trying to discover the semantic basis of human communication turns out be that of reprogramming the machine which produced this output so as to improve it, and, as we say, «make the machine write sense». We have got to impose upon the possibilities of combination of these words such semantic restrictions, •— semantic restrictions, remember, not grammatical ones — that everybody shall spontaneously say, «How well-connected, and how sensibly- expressed, this new machine-output is ! » Now, without going in general into the matter of the extreme difficulty, for a human being, of distinguishing sense from nonsense when you have only got isolated sentences to judge from (for almost any isolated sentence can be made, by ingenious interpretation, into some sort of sense) I will now exemplify, a simple procedure which was used to analyse mechanically one sentence of this output, in order to make the machine give a judgement of what, in the sentence, had semantically gone wrong. The sentence to be analysed was No. 226 in the M.I.T. output, which runs: 29 [pageend31]SHE MAKES SIX BOILERS AND HIS TRAGIC AND NEW LEG. This sentence, like the majority of the sentences in this output, is not plain gibberish ; but, on the other hand, it is also not plain sense. Two contexts can be imagined to justify it. One : she is a female toymaker, and he is a broken animated toy, with whom she has fallen in love. The boilers which she makes are the wooden boilers of toy engines ; so is his leg, which she has just made to replace the older leg which he had lost. But there is something wrong with the new leg ; perhaps it is made of wood when it should have been made of metal, and so the magic or mechanical force of life which animates him does not work on it. This fact makes it a «tragic and new » leg. However, even this context does not fully explain this sentence : for even if this whole surround were the right one, the sentence should properly say, « SHE MAKES BOILERS AND SHE MADE HIS TRAGIC AND NEW LEG. The other context in which this sentence could make sense causes the reader squarely to swallow the initial implausibility that she is now the female managing director of a boiler factory, but suggests that she is now holding down this job merely because she is replacing her lover, who has been recently incapacitated by a boiler-room accident. This accident cut off his leg. She is now using the plant of the factory, therefore, to make him a new leg, which is presumably in shape like a very thin boiler, or, alternatively, one of the metal legs used in boiler-rooms for boiler support purposes. This leg is tragic, because it has had to be made as a result of an accident. It is new, evidently ; all too novel, judging from its general appearance. But even this context, like the last, does not really explain the sentence we have given ; for even if all this story of her devotion, resourcefulness and fidelity were true, the sentence should still run : «SHE MAKES BOILERS, AND SHE IS ALSO NOW MAKING HIS TRAGIC AND NEW LEG.» 30 [pageend32]Nevertheless, I have said enough to show the extreme difficulty of devising a mechanizable procedure for sensefinding in a single human communication. Provided always that the sentence in question is not grammatically and syntactically, as well as semantically, gibberish, somebody will always be able to make up some context which will make sense of it. And yet we all of us know quite well that it is not a really sensible sentence ; something has gone wrong. That I am able to exhibit a mechanizable procedure for semantically assessing this sentence, as well as for semantically assessing at least some other sentences of the M.I.T. output, is not due primarily to my own work, not to that of any other member of my group, but to an insight which was had by a Professor of Phonetics, Professor Pietar Gubérina, of the Institute of Phonetics, Zagreb, Yugoslavia. At the beginning of this essay I stressed the distortions and limitations imposed upon fundamental scientific language research by the current habit of starting it only from conventionally scripted text. Professor Gubérina has escaped from this limitation because his present primary occupation, — he is eminent in three fields, — is that of teaching the deaf to hear and to speak. In the course of doing this he was provoked to ask himself the question, «In a communication, what is it really vital for the deaf man to get hold of ? » In order to help himself answer this question, he drew on some much earlier work which he had done when working for his doctorate under Charles Bally, the linguist, in Paris. In his thesis Gubérina, extending and developing Bally’s theory of stylistics, had maintained that the basic semantic unit of human communication was not the sentence, but the paired set of two semantically matching sentences which human conversation, even at its simplest, always requires. This matched pair of sentences has constituents ; basic subjects-of-discourse, and aspects of them, (usually predicative aspects of them), which semantically interact in the squared pattern given below : 31 [pageend33]THE BASIC SEMANTIC SQUARE First subject of discourse Second subject of discourse First aspect of subject Second aspect of subject Ordinary script, says Gubérina, obscures the existence of this form ; but its existence can be divined as soon as you work from heard speech, from the question-and-answer lilt of the overall intonational form, which, in one way or another, can be detected in every language. This lilting pattern covers the assertion of, at most, two semantically cognate subjects of conversation ; and of, at most, two semantically cognate remarks which are made about them, or aspects which are asserted of them. Moreover, the semantic cognateness of the two subjects-of-discourse is so tight that the first remark, semantically speaking, could have been made about the second, and the second remark could have been made about the first ; semantically speaking, the sentence would still make sense. Take an example. «Was it Mary who milked the cows 32 [pageend34]this morning ? » « No, it was John. » In this exchange, the twice referred-to subject of conversation, — the piece of information which the deaf man must, at all costs, catch, •— is that it is the milking of a cow which is being talked about. In the first half of the «square», this milking activity is ascribed to one human being, Mary ; in the second half of the square it is reascribed to a second human being, John. Both Mary and John are semantically cognate entities, being both human beings ; and both are concerned with a single human activity, namely, the milking of a cow. Once the deaf man, already primed to pick up such a «square », can get hold of the general subject being talked about and the kind of thing that is being said, he can reconstruct, says Guberina, quite a lot of the details of the conversation for himself; partly because he knows, semantically speaking, what kind of thing to expect, and partly because he knows what happens when people milk cows. Of course, it is not always as easy as that : in the sentence, « Mary milks the cows, but John deals with the goats, » the semantic squared form is still quite easy to discern ; but in many cases, particularly in scientific prose, it is distorted, elaborated, inverted, truncated in endless ways, and sometimes half of it is left out altogether. Nevertheless, although at first, most people are extremely unwilling to admit that spoken human communication could have this single, simple, squared- up semantic basis, after they have got used to the idea they usually have to confess that they are being haunted by finding Guberina semantic squares everywhere. As a Polish logician at a recent Colloquium said, «Yes, I am converted. Like Moliere’s Bourgeois Gentilhomme, who all his life had been talking prose without knowing it, I lay awake last night realising that all my life I have been making semantic squares without knowing it. » Take, for instance, the paragraph which I have just written, which was composed without the least intention of exhibiting squares. «In some sentences, the semantic square form is quite easy to discern ; in others, it is 33 [pageend35]liable to be distorted in various ways. » SQUARE I. «It can get expanded, inverted and truncated, in some cases, half of it can get left out altogether. » SQUARE 2. «Nevertheless, although at first people are unprepared to admit that the semantic basis of human communication is this simple semantic square ; when they have considered the matter for a little, they usually begin seeing semantic squares everywhere.» SQUARE 3. And so on ; and so on. (That last sentence of mine, incidentally, is a degenerate semantic square.) Now, this sort of fundamental speculation is all very well ; but, unless some determinateness and accuracy is injected into it, it is not the sort of thing which you can put into a machine. It is one thing to run phonetically riot, intonating squares ; it is quite another thing to make a digital computer pick them up from texts. (That last sentence, by the way, was quite a nice semantic square.) And I think that Gubérina’s phonetically-based vision of human communication as a series of interlocking semantic squares might have remained indefinitely without scientific application, but for the possibility which has opened up of combining it with other, more detailed work which is currently being done, and in which digital computers are used for semantic analysis. This second line of work is aimed at producing semantic results in two fields ; firstly that of programming computers to do interlingual mechanical translation ; secondly that of devising mechanical methods to extract wanted scientific information from large libraries. In the first field, my own group leads ; in the second, by far the most massive effort at present is that being put out at Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio. For each of these two enterprises, a mathematical model of a semantic system is required which enables different uses of the same word to be separated and classified by reference to the general subject-matter to which the uses refer. Thus, if the set of uses of the English word « plant» be taken as an example, «plant» meaning «vegetable», might be classified under Gardening, « plant » meaning, « to insert into the 34 [pageend36]ground », under Agriculture, « plant » meaning « engineering plant », under Engineering, and « plant » meaning « trick » (as in the sentence, «It was all a plant») under Deceit, or Subterfuge. If this method of classifying word-uses is applied to a whole language the result is a very large and variegated semantic subject-dictionary, which looks, — in so far as it looks like anything, — like a distorted and developed form of Roget’s famous Thesaurus. We have one of these, at Cambridge, punched on punched cards ; Western Reserve have another, of a slightly different kind. Such a dictionary is laborious indeed to make ; but it has the great advantage over ordinary dictionaries, that in it the notions of « semantic overlap» and of «semantic cognateness» can be exactly, though crudely, defined. Consider the two-word phrase, «flowering plant». The word «flower » has, a use which could be classified under Gardening; so has the word « plant». In the phrase « flowering plant», therefore, once the constituent words are coded up into the system constituted by a semantic dictionary, the Gardening reference will occur twice ; all other references, used to classify uses of « flower » and of « plant» which do not occur in this phrase, will, — we hope — occur only once. It is a simple matter, therefore, to program a machine to reject all the uses of words in a sentence which do not occur twice ; and it is simple also, having done this, to define the semantic overlap of any two words as that subset of subject-references which their two sets of uses have in common. In such a system, also, « semantic cognateness » can be defined as numerical nearness of any two subject-references in the list of subject-references. For instance, in the example already taken, Gardening and Agriculture will be found nearer together, in any semantic dictionary, or thesaurus, than, for instance, Engineering and Deceit. We can therefore say that Gardening and Agriculture are semantically more cognate to one another than Engineering and Deceit, and set up a scale whereby semantic cognateness can be measured. 35 [pageend37]Armed now with a determinate, if crude, hypothesis as to the basic nature of human communication, and with a determinate, if crude, semantic system for applying it, let us return to our original none-too-sensible sentence, M.I.T. output No. 226, SHE MAKES SIX BOILERS AND HIS TRAGIC AND NEW LEG. The series of diagrams which I am about to present, as a conclusion to this study, represent the outputs, at successive main stages, of a fully mechanized syntactic-cum-semantic analysis of this sentence. The first two of these stages, which are syntactic only, have been fully programmed, and the program debugged, on the Cambridge computer E.D.S.A.C. The other four stages, which are semantic, were worked through by hand, using 5 by 3 cards ; but we shall soon be starting on the project of programming these stages also on the machine.

S LEG ......................................... g ] J J 36 [pageend38]In this diagram, a mechanized syntactic analysis is made of the sentence, and the result of this analysis is shown in simplified form. The sentence itself is shown in the second column from the left; it is assumed here that the two hyphen- «-S » at the ends of MAKE-S and BOILER-S, the first of which, in English, is a singular present tense verb ending, and the second a plural noun ending, have already been correctly interpreted and sorted out by the machine. In the left-hand column you have the set of grammatical markers which the machine finally picks out as being right for the words of this sentence; LEG, for instance, here has the grammatical marker «S», for Substantive, in spite of the fact that, in other circumstances, you can «leg it away », and so it can be a verb. Similarly, MAKE, SIX, and NEW are here correctly labelled respectively as Operative and Adjuncts ; even though, in other circumstances, they can all be abstract nouns. On the right, you have the actual syntactic analysis ; this shows two things explicitly, and one more thing which this diagram does not indicate. The syntactic groupings into which the words of this sentence fall are here shown by brackets, which, going from left to right, are of progressively increasing size ; and the chief, or head word of each syntactic group, which is here called its Governor and marked G, the function of the whole group, within that bracket, being defined by reference to the finally selected grammatical category of the word marked G. For instance, in the extreme left-hand bracket-group, which groups together the three words TRAGIC AND NEW, the word marked G. is AND ; its function is marked C, «Conjunction», and so the whole bracketgroup is called a Conjunctive Group. However, the third thing which the program very ingeniously does and which the diagram does not indicate is to divide the bracket-groups which it finds into two classes. These are firstly endocentric syntactic groups, — that is, word-groups the total function of which is the same as that of one of its members ; and exocentric syntactic groups, such as prepositional phrases used adverbially, or 37 [pageend39]subject-predicate groups made up of substantives, adjuncts and operatives, where the total function of the group is different from that of any of its constituents. This information is used later in the program. For the benefit of linguists, the technical description of the program is that it mathematicises a touched-up version of the Immediate Constituent model of Syntax, which is familiar from the linguistic literature, by representing the set of possible functions of the simple substituents (or « single » words) of any language as points on a finite self-dual product lattice. These points are so arranged that the functions of endocentric syntactic groups, in the language, come out as lattice meets of the points of the constituent functions ; and the functions of exocentric groups as meet-points which fall within the principal ideal of the positive central of the lattice. This central represents the subject-predicate function ; and if a meet-point falls within its principal ideal, the polar-point of the lattice is substituted for the original meet, and a new meet found, which represents the new function of the exocentric group.

This is done, in this case, by the machine picking up the first AND in the sentence as a «squarer» (which it does easily) and determining, in the end, that the second AND of the sentence, is not such a squarer, (which it does with great difficulty). Since there is an exocentric substantive-operative group just before the squarer, as defined by the system, and none after, the machine repeats the words of the first group after the squarer, to make the square, thus producing the sentence, SHE MAKE-S SIX BOILER-S AND SHE MAKES HIS TRAGIC AND NEW LEG. The machine then reanalyses the sentence, marks the Governors, and numbers the syntactic bracket-groups in five ranks, as is shown by the Roman numerals along the top of the diagram. EXAMPLES OF STAGE I DICTIONARY MAKE........................................................................ C CAUSE / NEW........................................................................ F FLOW: TRAGIC....................................................................E FEEL: SHE ..........................................................................H MAN: SIX ...........................................................................D COUNT: The machine then matches the words of the sentence with the first semantic dictionary, five sample entries from which are shown here. This dictionary is an extremely simple dictionary, each entry in which consists of two and only two parts. The right-hand part consists of a very general classifier ; «CAUSE», «FLOW» (of time), «FEEL», (Something felt), «MAN», (human being). The upper-case letters on the left stand for some special subject-reference ; this reference is substituted for the letters at the match with the No. 2 dictionary. The peculiarity of this dictionary consists in the fact that, simple as it is, the entries in it have their own 39 [pageend41]internal syntax. This is shown by the two punctuation-signs which occur after the classifiers. These signs distinguish two parts of speech only ; the slash indicates an operative, or verb, and the colon a descriptor, (roughly, an adjective or noun). It follows, from this fact that each entry represents a syntactic group, of which the right-hand part, in each entry, is the Governor, and the left-hand part, — specified here only by the upper-case letters, — the dependent. SEMANTIC ANALYSIS SEMANTIC ANALYSIS BEFORE SQUARING AFTER SQUARING H MAN: Hi Man: C CAUSE / Hi Cause / K THING: Ki Thing: (Squarer) AND: (Squared) And: K THING: H2 Man: C2 Cause / K2 Thing: This shows the semantic analysis of the sentence after the first-stage dictionary-entries have been substituted for the words ; for comparison, the semantic analysis is shown both before and after squaring, though in fact, the first dictionary match occurs after making the square. The analysis has been simplified, for diagram-making purposes, by compiling it of the Governors only of Bracket-ranks II-V. The rank of the bracket of which the word, in the original sentence, was the Governor can be shown by the number of lines drawn under the Governor of its dictionary-entry. Thus CAUSE/would have four lines under it, because it was the dictionary-entry which matched with MAKE-S, which was the Governor of a bracket-group of Rank IV. 40 [pageend42]The machine also adds contrasting subscripts to the uppercase letters which represent the special subject references, thus adding semantic contrast to the sentence. Notice now, how, though building on linguistic foundations, we are already beginning to interpret the linguistic data in accordance with a hypothesis which was inspired by phonetics. The sentence is no longer flat text ; it has contours. Moreover, the contours are semantically tinted in contrasting colours which mirror (crudely) the corresponding features which the contours refer to in the extra-linguistic world. This first semantic analysis, made after squaring, represents the machine’s first attempt at determining the sentence’s semantic message. «A man causes a thing», we might interpret it as saying, « and another man, (or the same man) causes the same thing (or another thing).» This analytic procedure has been criticised by linguists as unscientific, because it begins with an intuitive first step, namely that of making the semantic dictionary entry. But so does any analysis from script begin with an intuitive first step ; for every language was scripted by human intuition. Scripted language is reliable material only because scripting can be repeatably taught. If this new scripting principle, exemplified here, can also be repeatably taught, it is no more and no less intuitive than any other. And why should we not re-script language for our own purposes, especially when we consider how many diverse kinds of language-scripts there already are in the world, and how many different analytic principles they embody ? The machine now proceeds to fill out the analysis of the squared sentence. It does this by transferring the governors of the dictionary-entries of the original dependents of the sentence to the governors of the original sentence. In other words, it makes the contours of its analysis yet steeper, and tints them more strongly.

Thus, MAKE-S is here used very concretely, for a man actually constructing something ; this fact is now shown in its stage- one dictionary-entry, which will enable stage-two match to be successfully made. The matching complexities of MAKE-S have been deleted ; but two stage-one entries for LEG are here given, to indicate the existence of the problem. One of these entries has the semantic governor THING, and one has the semantic governor PART. When we come to the stage two match, the stage two dictionary gives no less than three entries for LEG, not counting the verbal use, which the 42 [pageend44]machine is supposed to have thrown out at the syntactic stage. The next diagram shows the machine choosing between the three stage-two dictionary-entries for LEG.

The upper-case letters are replaced by the interesting part —- that is, the semantically overlapping part, •— of the stage-two dictionary entries ; the subscripts are replaced by the non-intersecting part, in order to give the sentence semantic variegation. And here we at last see what is semantically wrong with this sentence, put in a form which a computer can assess. For half the constituent words of the square intersect completely, — in fact, they repeat; and the other half do not intersect at all. And this is unacceptablé ; both intuitively, and also to the machine. For if a semantic square has a repeating subject and predicate, but a nonrepeating complement, the two variants of the complement must semantically be very like one another indeed. THEY MAKE BOILER-S, AND THEY ALSO MAKE SPARE 43 [pageend45]PART-S. If, on the other hand, the two complements are semantically unlike one another, then the subject and verb must also vary. HE MAKE-S BOILERS, AND SHE MAKE-S WOODEN LEGS. And thus, as soon as a semantic square can be located in a piece of discourse, and exact criteria established in terms of intersection for assessing semantic likeness and unlikeness, its limits of semantic tolerance, as it were, can also be assessed. The last diagram summarises the intersecting unbalance which makes the sentence from the M.I.T. output an unacceptable square.

List 50 : constructing (no subscript) It is clear that the semantic analysis which I have given is only a crude analogue of what adequate mechanised semantic analysis will have to be. It is clear also, however, that it is a prototype. Such analysis can be developed further in any number of ways. 44 [pageend46]Looking at this new semantic research more generally ,if we ask ourselves what is happening in this new scientific field of fundamental semantic research, the only possible answer seems to me to be that computer-using children are pushing on where humanistic wise men fear to tread. Academic semantics, as Ullmann says, is in an ambiguous position ; for its practitioners hesitate before using the precise classifying methods of linguistics to explore what they assume to be «the loosely organised and virtually unlimited world of meanings». But it sometimes happens, in science, that situations arise in which wise men, who see the complexities of the problem, are outpaced by fools, who do not. In this matter, of finding foundations for semantics, I myself am schizoid as between wisdom and folly ; for I started my academic life as a French specialist, admiring Ferdinand Brunot; and I now write programs, and devise crude semantic dictionaries and systems to go on machines. I am therefore in a good position to say that while linguists consider and reconsider whether they dare speak of «meaning», mechanical translation researchers are combining meanings to form semantic squares. While linguists classify with more and more refinement, in- formation-retrievers, using the crudest possible systems, are making fundamental predictions. As a result, our whole picture of language is gradually changing but not because of the main trend of work being done by linguists and a new hard science is being founded, not, as it should be, from an academic discipline, as it often has been, but from a confluence of minor technologies. 45 [pageend47]ALF SOMMERFELT SEMANTICS The term Semantics is used in different disciplines to designate different kinds of studies. The word itself is an adaptation of French sömantique which in 1883 was proposed by the French linguist Michel Bréal as a term for the study of meaning and which is based on the feminine of the Greek adjective semantikos « significant ». In philosophy Semantics is a part of the general theory of signs and their application (Semiotics). It designs the theory of the relations between the signs and what they refer to, their « denotata », as distinct from Pragmatics, the theory of the relations between the signs and those who produce or receive and understand them, and from Syntactics, the theory of the formal relations between signs, elaborated especially by Charles Morris and R. Carnap. Different from these studies are those which go under the name General Semantics, and which were initiated by Alfred Korzybski, an American of Polish origin. He maintained that man’s symbolic behaviour is subject to laws and believed that this symbolic behaviour consists of reflections of acquired linguistic habits which have modified neural pathways in the speaker. He proposed a method of training the nervous system to respond « sanely » to perception and especially to symbolic stimuli. By this he understood an accurate correspondence between the «map » (that is the linguistic picture which the individual has in his brain) and the «territory » (the actual world). It was to be the task of the new science to construct accurate «maps» in order to obtain healthy individuals. Korzybski’s initiative resulted in a movement, centered round the International Society for General Semantics, which goes 46 [pageend48]in for a study of how to obtain an accurate, precise language and for an exploration of the relations which exist between language and personality and language and society. The term Semantics, however, was first used in linguistics. This discipline has in recent years made great strides and its importance also to science and technology is being realized more and more, not only by communication engineers and constructors of translation machines and similar devices. Its status has risen so that it is represented now even in a technical university such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As a special discipline of linguistics Semantics is relatively young compared to the other branches of the science. I shall try to give a brief summary of how the problems of « meaning », from the linguistic point of view, are discussed today. As linguistics itself Semantics was to begin with mainly an historical discipline dealing with the change of meaning, how, for example, the meaning of words extended or contracted. The causes of change were usually thought to be psychological until A. Meillet showed how they are of a social nature, language itself being a social phenomenon corresponding to Emile Durkheim’s definition of le fait social. When, for example, a word passes from a small group into general use it shows a tendency to extend its meaning and vice- versa when it goes the other way (e.g. arrive was originally a sailor’s term, meaning «to come to the beach (Lat. ripa) », where as deer which originally meant « animal» got its present sense in the language of hunters). About 40 years ago some linguists, most of them inspired by the posthumously published lectures of the Swiss Ferdinand de Saussure, began to turn their interests towards language as structure. The importance of the system of language had been clearly understood before by some linguists, especially in France, but mostly in relation to its history. Now the representatives of different linguistic trends such as the «phonologists», lead by the Russians Prince Trubetzkoi and Professor Roman Jakobson, the « glossematists », with the Dane Louis Hjelmslev, and the 47 [pageend49]American structuralists, with L. Bloomfield and his followers, and different other linguists in many countries insisted upon the necessity of studying language structure regardless of its history. To modern linguists language is a system of signs and a discipline of semiotics. It consists of units which have two aspects, one sensible and one intelligible, the signans and the signatum of F. de Saussure. Every sign has sound and meaning. Let us examine very briefly the present views on the nature of these units. A linguistic analysis begins with the utterance which must be broken down into smaller and smaller meaningful units until one reaches the point of the smallest of these meaningful units. The minimum utterance is the phrase. A phrase contains words — there exists no definition of this term which is applicable to all languages ; the best is perhaps Bloomfield’s : a word is a minimum free form, that is a form which may be spoken alone (as different from the bound forms). A word may often be broken down into still smaller meaningful units, called by some, especially American linguists morphemes. A morpheme falls into two main elements, a stem and an inflexional element (in writers the r is the inflexional element, writer the stem which again consists of a suffix (er) and a root or nucleus (writ-)). A minimum formal unit may cumulate meanings ; thus in Latin amo the o indicates not only the first person, but also the singular of a present indicative. Finally, by proceeding with the analysis, one arrives at the smallest of them, the phoneme or speechsound. The phoneme does not have any « meaning » as the higher units, but serves only to differentiate the higher units. Phonemes are determined by substitution of higher units. English has the phonemes P and b because bit has a meaning which is different from that of pit; in the same language i differs from u as fill is opposed to full, etc. (the analysis must, of course, proceed from the spoken language). The popular idea of the word is that it constitutes a formal 48 [pageend50]unit which corresponds to a concept (e.g. tree and the concept « tree », expressed in Norwegian by tre, in French by arbre, in German by baum, etc), or a relation (cf. the prepositions in certain languages or the English auxiliary do). In modern linguistics the sign is usually understood as a «name», an « expression » (a form) united to a « sense », a « reference » (also called a «thought» or a «content»), the two being related to a « thing meant », a « referent » or « denotatum ». There was, through the influence of behaviourism, a tendency to do away with the «sense» or «reference», and connect, for example, the word tree directly with the thing, but at present few agree with that point of view. A comparison of different languages may show how historically identical words may have « senses » (« contents ») differently delimitated. Norwegian tre, historically identical with English tree, covers part of the sense of English wood (that of the material) whereas ved, historically identical with English wood, signifies « firewood ». The other part of the sense of English wood is in Norwegian rendered by Norwegian skog (« wood, forest») which is cognate with English shaw. The « content» of a lexical element is by most linguists envisaged as a concept, though usually not as an independent concept, but as one dependent upon the context. Hjelmslev writes : «Any entity, and thus also, any sign, is defined relatively, not absolutely, and only by its place in the context». Recently, however, the structuralist L. Antal, in his book Questions of Meaning, maintains, in support of Charles Morris, that meaning consists of the rules by which we regulate the use of signs and their mode of application to the denotata. The meaning is not part of the sign, but its condition. It follows that all meanings are abstract since they are rules. The difference between abstract and concrete lies in the denotatum. There may be a parallelism between the concept and the objects belonging to it on the one hand and the meaning and the denotatum on the other (e.g. the concept «table » and the objects belonging to it, real tables, are usually denoted by the 49 [pageend51]same sign). A sign such as the English auxiliary do, for example, has no parallel with a concept and it is possible to denote a «table » otherwise than by the sign table. It follows, Antal contends, that there is no such thing as contextual meaning or polysemy if «meaning» is defined as it ought to be. Meaning is identical in different contexts, but the denotata may differ, falling outside the sphere of language. The metaphor, for example represents irregularity not of meaning but of denotatum. It is not correct, to take another example, to say that the preposition after in 1 woke up after 10 o’ clock has a temporal meaning and that in I woke up after the tunnel the meaning is localizing. The meaning is the same in both cases. If the meaning is different we are dealing not with one word but with two. To be a linguistic sign, therefore, a sequence of phonemes must obey rules in relation to other signs and to denotata, but only the first condition is obligatory (cf. what was said about do above). These ideas require further elaboration from the theoretical as well as from the practical point of view. The problem of the relations between meaning on the one hand and concept and thought on the other, needs exploration and the theory must be applied to actual, concrete language. It is evident that these ideas are of prime importance to lexicography, especially to monolingual dictionaries. 50 [pageend52]SEMANTICS : A NEW APPROACH An interview with Dr. Kenneth BURKE. FOREWORD : To a great many people in the know, «semantics» is easily defined as «the science of meanings as contrasted with phonetics, the science of sounds; the historical and psychological study and the classification of changes in the signification of words or forms, viewed as normal and vital factors in linguistic developments.» (Sic dixit the Merriam-Webster). As for the Encyclopaedia Britannica, it defines semantics as being «the study of the connection between the linguistic feature and the mental process in the act of speaking. » It must be quite obvious, but when we first heard about semantics, our knowledge was somewhat at the level of these definitions. Which is not very much... Beyond the coldness of the words, lay a great mystery of thoughts and ideas which we did not even suspect. Then ARENA assigned us an article on semantics and its approach to literature. We had the wonderful opportunity to meet one of the most outstanding American semanticists, Kenneth Burke, and, in his company, we explored a new, fascinating, challenging and fantastic world. The following is the result of long hours of discussions and concoctions with Dr. Burke and compilations from the material he gave us as being the best expression of his thoughts. At the end of this preamble, we would like to express our gratitude to Dr. Burke, thanks to whose patience and advice we could bring this subject to an end; and to our friend Algirdas Landsbergis, from the staff of ARENA, for the helpful suggestions he offered for achieving this task. DIDIER DELAUNOY. 51 [pageend53]A NEW APPROACH For a brief moment, let us consider again the definition given by Merriam-Webster. Semantics is «that science dealing with the relations between symbols (« signs ») and what they refer to and with human behavior in reaction to symbols, including unconscious attitudes, influences of social institutions, and epistemological and linguistic assumptions, and having as an objective, the systematization of the language of science and the unification of knowledge. » Most people would accept the common axiom which says that « words are the signs of things. » «We need an entirely new educational system to change our society’s conformism,» said Dr. Kenneth Burke, «and to do so, why not take the normal corollary of the axiom and say that „ things are the signs of words ? „ ». As a matter of fact, we might think it wiser as we might be primarily interested in the significance of things, words being only names, titles, abbreviations assigned to things by man. Starting with this new approach, definitions and meanings take on a new slant, a very wide one, from what is man to what is meaning in literature, criticism and life in general. WHAT IS MAN ? In considering this question, Dr. Burke is not interested in discovering the origin of the word «man». He is interested in the thing that calls itself man, and it is this thing, man, which he defines at great length : « Man is the symbol-using animal... », which he broadens into «symbolusing,’ symbol-making and symbol-misusing animal. » Describing man as the « symbol-using animal», Dr. Burke narrates the story of that bird caught in a classroom with all the blinds up and the windows open. Yet, the bird 52 [pageend54]was desperately trying to escape by batting against the ceiling instead of dipping down and flying out of one of the open windows. If man and bird could speak the same language, it would have been easy for a man to explain to the bird what to do. Then the learned «invention» would have quickly spread throughout all birddom, thus saving incalculable birdhours. If the bird had the ability to write down his thoughts, he would have realized what he had done, be able to do it again by intention, not by accident, and he could write his methods down, so that other birds could use them. On the other hand, since birds are not symbol or word users, they cannot be made to hate millions of others, simply by hearsay, or the use of written words, as is the case with man. SYMBOL-USING ANIMAL « Yes, obviously, man is the symbol-using animal,» says Dr. Burke. «But can we bring ourselves to realize just what that formula implies, just how overwhelmingly much of what we mean by «reality» has been built up for us through nothing but our symbol-systems ? Take away our books, and how little do we know about history, biography, even something so « down to earth» as the relative position of seas and continents ! What is our « reality» for today (beyond the paper-thin line of our own particular lives), but all this clutter of symbols about the past combined with whatever things we know mainly through maps, magazines, newspapers, and the like about the present... ? » But, in opposition to the «symbol-using» capacity of man, Dr. Burke describes man as being the «symbolmisusing animal». To make his point, he is particularly interested in the physical reaction that the body can have to absolutely wholesome food, when one has been conditioned to think of that food as unwholesome. The unwholesome quality has been assigned to that food by a particular culture. And he cites the example of an anthro53 [pageend55]pologist who, when he thinks he is eating blubber, takes sick. Later, he discovers that it was not blubbler but dumplings that he was eating. And if he had known that, he would not have become ill. Symbol-misusing can be harmful to man, not only physically, as shown here, but also in many other ways which will be discussed later. Another of man’s natural processes in using symbols, is creating substitution. For instance, if you do not understand a temperature in centigrades, you might understand it in Fahrenheit. If you don’t understand a thing in Spanish, you may be likely to understand it in English... Dr. Burke feels that Freud’s processes of « condensation and displacement» with regard to dream symbolism are nothing more than substitution. SUBSTITUTION AND ABBREVIATION Another form of substitution is abbreviation. For example, instead of saying «chairs and tables», we say « furniture» ; instead of « father and mother», we may say «parents», etc... «In any case, Freud (like Frazer), gives us ample grounds for trying never to forget that, once emotional involvement is added to symbolism’s resources of substitution (which included the invitations to both condensation and displacement) the conditions are set for the symbolusing animal, with its ailments both physically and symbolically engendered, to tinker with such varying kinds of substitution as we encounter in men’s modes of penance, expiation, compensation, paying of fines in lieu of bodily punishment, and the cult of scapegoat. » The second part of his definition of man is «inventor of the negative ». We can make a negative statement and say that something that we expected did not happen. But, at the same time, something positive did happen. There is the other negative «Thou Shalt Not» which is the basis of all men’s morality and law. When man uses words, he 54 [pageend56]should realize not only what these words mean, but also what they do not mean or what they do not imply. Dr. Burke goes on to say that the great positive power given to man by sciences and the new technology have in themselves brought along a great deal of negativity. In other words, we must develop safeguards (negatives) to erase the threat of the use of the positive power. The third part of his definition is : « separated from his natural conditions by instruments of his own making.» Man has acquired a second nature: he lives in air- conditioned buildings, with elevators. If deprived of the use of these commodities, he feels it, even though they are not natural, Man has divided himself into various classes, some with properties, some working, etc... And this leads Dr. Burke to the next part of his definition of man «goaded by the spirit of hierarchy«. Or, as he says, «moved by a sense of order». Which, of course, is self- explanatory. The last part of his definition is that man is « rotten with perfection». Again, Dr. Burke turns to Freud and takes Freud’s «destiny compulsion or repetition compulsion » and shows that even this neurotic behavior is nothing more than striving for perfection. Going a step further, Dr. Burke feels that man’s very use of language is the sign of his perfectionism. Man’s use of words of language and definitions are necessary to communicate perfectly to another man exactly what he wants or means. Man’s use of the negative coupled with his perfectionist ideals leads him to finding or pointing out the «perfect enemy», which can be described in our modern history by the rise of Nazism, in which the perfect enemy was the nonAryan. This perfect enemy, Dr. Burke feels, is inherent « in the Drama ». Again, the negative is at work. « Thus, the principle of drama is implicit in the idea of action, and the principle of victimage is implicit in the nature of drama... ». 55 [pageend57]DRAMA : LIFE AND LITERATURE As it happens so often, Kenneth Burke could not fail but to take side in the constant fight over «life» and «literature» as a subject of criticism, thus approaching «dramatism», a major concern for our readers. As he stresses it, in poetics, drama, or even music, one is bound to expect some classical form. But how should we understand that expectation ? Hume’s remarks on expectation (in «Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding ») with regard to the «uniformities» in nature, brings Dr. Burke to such principles of form which he calls the scene- act and agent-act ratios, « principles applicable both to poetic structures in particular and to schemes of orientation in general». The step from Drama to Dramatism can be completed by reviewing the step from Drama to Logology. This is what we are going to see now. The Life-Literature alignment, the traditional formula «imitation of Nature», needs, according to Dr. Burke, a third term, that of critical «method» which applies as well to criticism. This third term actually is optional, depending on the kind of approach to criticism wanted. If a critic aims at making maximum sales to the public, there is no reason why he should not confine himself to the two-term alignment, « literature » and « life ». « One can legitimately object only when such strictures are set forth as an imperative to be imposed upon all critics. One becomes expert in any field to the extent that one works up a method for operating in that field. » When a critic defines and defends his methods or questions the methods of other critics, such criticism of criticism moves into the realm of methodology. But a further distinction should also be made, a «transcendental» to « dramatism » and «logology » which, from the study of literary texts, would lead to a theory of language, and then to a philosophy of human relations. A critic, impregnated with the theory of classical form in art, is bound to expect a theory of form in literature, 56 [pageend58]e.i., an arousing and fulfilling of desires : one scene of a drama leads the audience to anticipate another scene and to be gratified by the sequence. Fulfilling of desires ? Certainly, but also fulfilling expectations, «because one or the other of those terms will bring out one or another aspect of that problem. » Of course what we expect may not happen or may do so at an unexpected moment or in a different way than the one expected. Yet, whether expected or not, the act is enlightened by the fact that we were expecting something to happen. The audience’s interest is embodied by mere principles of appeal. To that extent that the drama provokes our interest and engages our attention, it necessarily confronts tests of communications : «we are automatically or inevitably involved in the laws of (these accidents) appeal. » To sum up, « regardless of what a work was designated to do, and regardless of how that design (or paradoxical lack of design) came into being, if ever the work is presented to an audience, it must be treated as though designed to hold the attention of an audience. » Such goal-oriented action, Dr. Burke calls «teleological». ART : A DESCRIPTION Thus, describing art becomes easier, or, as Dr. Burke puts it, « any art is a species of symbolic action, each art is necessarily ’ de-termined ’ by the particular nature of the terms through which it acts. » At this point, we might wonder whether the act of artistic production can be reduced to sheer motion. And, in that case, is the audience participation reducible to a similar extent ? Or is it that, since the artist selects the situation in which he will let random motions take their course, the audience will automatically re-act by adopting the very grounds given by the author ? The appreciation of a play is an appreciation of an essence for its own sake, 57 [pageend59]says Dr. Burke. And, quoting Santayana, he adds : «nothing could be more thoroughly in the realm of ’spirit’,» in which «spirit» must be understood as «symbolic action ». A TERMINOLOGY OF DRAMA Thus we come to a terminology of drama which can be summarized as follows : A. — «anti-teleological» form dispenses which can be summarized as follows : A. - «anti-teleological» form dispenses whit what can be named «syllogistic» progression, or works constructed in such way that they lead towards a culmination or climax. B. - in that over-all concept, exist fragments or « minor or incidental» forms, often so sharply demarcated that they can be appreciated one by one. C. - the play or literary piece might have a high degree of «conventional » form (or «categorical expectancy»), « once you get over the tendency to think of new conventions purely in terms of their ’break’ with past convention. » Some modern work called « experimental» can bring some sort of expectation that can make us receptive to novelty. And, at this point, Dr. Burke brings a new principle, that of «negative» expectation, or negative response to positive expectation. For instance, in a new work, one might experience none of the «teleological» anticipation found in plays more classically built, where the announcement of an antecedent brings up a «logically » related consequence. The negative expectation that creates a kind of surprise, an «ellipsis or leap» that somehow « fits » the situation. D. - and, of course, most important of all, is the most compelling of all expectations, that of some sort of unity in the procedure used throughout the work. Kant said that the human mind cannot avoid thinking in terms of substance, so a work must to that extent possess a measure of substance that would fall under the heading of repetitive form. 58 [pageend60]SEMANTICS AND LITERATURE What is, in that case the impact of semantics on literature ? We put this question to Dr. Burke, and this is what he answered : « Primarily, I think that ’semantics’ is a movement in criticism. It treats, from one point of view, problems that ’literature’ treats from a quite different point of view. The answer to the question involves to a large extent the meaning you ascribe to the word ’semantics’. If the term is conceived broadly enough, it includes such studies of meaning as one finds in Marxism and Freudianism. If one narrows the meaning to, say, the linguistic theories of Korzybski, it can be said to have had almost no effect at all...». Can there be an influence of the technological revolution on literature ? Perhaps to some extent, but technology requires an almost fantastic amount of «traffic regulation, » not only locally but «globally». The simple dialectics of the case would seem to suggest that one will find in literature the elements designed to «line us up » and the elements that are a « cure » for such intolerable pressures. Both «conditioning» and «freedom»... A -school, calling itself the « School of New Criticism » has optioned old ideas for its own benefit. What can be its future in the United States. « Who knows ?,» answers Dr. Burke, « I can only say what I hope will come next. I hope that critics will retain the cult of close explication de texte. I hope that they will develop this kind of study in two quite different ways : A. - a more systematic concern with the definition of literary genres, as in Aristotle’s « Poetics » ; B. - a more systematic effort to discuss the relation that literature bears to life and method in general. » At this point, we asked Dr. Burke whether he thought that the linguistic school of criticism would gain in importance in the coming decade. « Since I take that the technological revolution is forcing upon us a ,, global ” 59 [pageend61]point of view (and that such a point of view will be a long time in developing), I assume that all men must seek to meet on the basis of motivational elements that they posses in common,» he answered us. Pursuing his explanation, Dr. Burke said again : « I take it that these motivational elements are defined primarily by our nature as the „ symbol-using, symbol-making, and symbol-misusing animal. ” We may quarrel about the doctrines to which we individually suscribe, but we might at least unite in our meditations on the sheer form of our beliefs and utterances. (This is what I mean by an attitude of „ smiling hypochondria ”, a cult of comedy in the hopes of forestalling worldwide tragedy.) Since I do not see evidence that any one country (and language) can triumph (as with the „pax Romana” of earlier times), I assume that at best, a long period of critical uncertainty lies before us. (I say, ,, at best, ” for I incline to fear that natural human impatience, with its cult of «heroism, » will triumph and the mighty arsenal of weapons will blow up.) Insofar as a period of cultural intermingling does lie ahead, we would seem to need a point of view (Weltanschauung) that attains its corresponding critical method in the study of the elements that characterize all points of view. I view the ,, linguistic ” thus. » It has been said literary language will inevitably approach the character of a scientific formula. « This is not a question about the hypothetical future,» answered Dr. Burke. «Much ’Literature’ for the mass media is already being produced by a formula. I once knew a pulp writer who boasted that he had only one story, which he sold again and again. The minor changes were so slight that he did not even have to revise it. He simply sat down, wrote away, and mailed his copy. He showed me one of his first drafts (which is to say, his only draft). You would think it had been copied by a professional typist. Science could do no more (though he did it on a quart of whiskey). So, all told, I would speculate along the lines of my answer to 60 [pageend62]the question about technological revolution and its influence on literature. Vive la dialectique ! The more pat the formula, the more likely we are to get „ planned waywardness, ” as has been happening already (since the days of Dada, or perhaps more accurately, Rimbaud). « However, I will say this : I think that, no matter how haphazardly a work may have been produced (even if it had been produced, say, by simply tossing alphabets on the ground at random), insofar as it exemplifies a kind of appeal, the critic’s job is to formulate the laws of such appeal. The same could be formulated about contemporary « aleatory» music. Here is music that seeks by a formula to avoid a formula. To it I try to apply my theories of formal appeal, as developed in Counter-Statement. Also, at one time, I have written a related essay on an essay by Edgar Allen Poe (an essay in which he attempted to show how his poem, ,, The Raven ”, had been written by formula). Critics usually slight this essay, which they treat as a questionable piece of showmanship. I have tried to show why, even if we assume that every word in it is a lie, Poe was working in the right direction, so far as critical analysis is concerned. But, since he was writing in the „ historicist ” nineteenth century, he stated his principles of logical priority in terms of temporal priority. I have also discussed a related point, with regard to Paul Valéry, in an article titled «Towards a Post-Kantian Verbal Music» (Kenyon Review, Autumn 1958, particularly pp. 543-546).» As Dr. Burke emphasized, there is a last explanation that should be given about the « scientific formula ». One of his favorite books is Aristotle’s Rhetoric. «There, in 330 B.C., you’ll find a list of ’topics’ that ingeniously formulate the resources of persuasion utilized by Greék oratory. Much contemporary «semantics», I incline to think, is done by writers who, never having deigned to read that astoundingly schematic book, have discovered little fragments of it all over again. » * * * 61 [pageend63]A note on Kenneth Burke : his last published book was the « Rhetoric of Religion, Studies in Logology», printed by Beacon Press. He is now preparing a new opus entitled « A Symbolic of Motives» which is his Poetics. Dr. Burke is a teacher at the Department of Literature, Bennington College, Bennington, Vermont. Some of his numerous essays include a «Linguistic Approach To Problems of Education », a « Definition of Man », « Catharsis - Second View», «What Are The Signs Of What ?» or «A Theory of ’Entitlement’ » which have been the basis for the present article. * * ♦ Alfred Korzybski spent his life constructing a new logic, better adapted to the realities of the modern world, of an anti-Aristotelian thinking method. Among his thoughts was a possible definition of man. But what is man, exactly ? One cannot study human facts, but one can discuss ad infinitum on words, on fictions, on unverified theories. What is man ? Is he an animal ? Or else an animal plus a soul ? Or else «a god who fell and still remembers heavens ? » But what is an animal ? And what is a soul ? An example, the functional method proves immediately that man is not an animal. He bears the specific functions of an animal, the same way he does bear the specific functions of plants, in other words, the re-organization of mineral chemical structures. But he has a wide range of specific functions properly his own, like that of organizing time : thus the function named by Korzybski «time-binding », from where will originate the modern concept of non-genetic heredity. Korzybski then originated his theories on what is called general semantics. What definition could be given of « general semantics » ? The general semanticist who has assimilated the method, knows, by direct experience, what it is all about, cannot seem to give a brief definition of what is. Why ? It’s a long story. 62 [pageend64]In our modern times, science and European values dominate the world. They come from a theory elaborated more than 25 centuries ago in Athens and slowly brought to perfection by European thinkers and philosophers: Aristotle, Euclid, Newton, Lavoisier, St. Thomas Aquinas Kant, Marx, etc... In the 1800’s, geometry came to the limits of the system. Lobatchevski and Riemann then created the non-Euclidian Geometry... One should understand «non», not as a negative form, but as a generalisation. It means that the generalized systems include Euclidism as a particular case, that of our daily and primitive experience. But the very structures of our universe as they are revealed by our new means of observation on the microcosm and the macrocosm, obey other laws that the ones of our daily knowledgde. Thus, the necessity of a revised geometry, generalized, to understand them. Korzybski defined it best by saying that « a map is not the territory», or else, the Aristotelian philosophy is not man, the same way as the Euclidian geometry is not precisely what happens. Thus, general semantics, first called human engineering, has become the science of man, practical, oriented toward realizations. Then, it was called «time-binding», which brings the concept of binding forces of rational mechanic, then extend the concept to a wider range of sciences « qui se saluent mais ne se parlent pas» (Gabriel Veraldi). Thus, general semantics can be best defined, in the present knowledge that we have, as «a non-Aristotelian science, theorical and applied, of significations in their ensemble, of methods and evaluative processes. » (Gabriel Veraldi, Revue Planetes) 63 [pageend65]J.-CLAUDE PIGUET VERS UNE SEMANTIQUE PHILOSOPHIQUE Objet de la sémantique. La sémantique étudie la signification des énoncés. Les énoncés sont des « phrases », tenues par un homme, portant généralement sur un objet, quel que soit ce dernier, et douées dune signification. Il existe des énoncés qui n’ont aucune signification et assemblent des vocables ou des mots arbitrai- rement; de tels énoncés, dits absurdes (nonsense), n’inté- ressent au premier abord personne. Toutefois la délimitation du non-sense ne peut avoir lieu que si sont définis préalable- ment les énoncés signifiants. Or c’est á cette définition que s’attache la sémantique. Pour définir et étudier rationnellement les énoncés significants et pour tracer la limite entre la signification et le nonsense, il est nécessaire d’inscrire dans de nouveaux énoncés ce qui fait la signification des énoncés étudiés. Un énoncé sémantique apparait done toujours comme un « méta- énoncé », e’est-a-dire comme un énoncé portant sur un énoncé antérieur dont on veut justement étudier le type de signification. Mais en meme temps 1’existence de tels méta-énoncés (sémantique) présuppose nécessairement ľexistence ďénoncés antérieurs (simplement signifiants), si bien que le point de départ de toute sémantique consiste initialement en ľexistence effective, contingente et empirique ďénoncés estimés a priori signifiants. Par exemple un énoncé grammatical suppose toujours une langue sur laquelle il porte. Ľobjet de la sémantique se laisse découvrir en fait selon deux dimensions culturelles, celles de la Synchronie et de la diachronie, c’est-á-dire dans la dimension systématique ou 64 [pageend66]historique. Dans la dimension synchronique (systématique), il se trouve que, aujourd’hui, de certains énoncés sont univer- sellement considérés comme signifiants, qu’ils soient par ail- leurs vrais ou faux ; par exemple la loi de la chute des corps chez Aristote, qui est fausse, mais qui signifie quelque chose. Et dans la dimension diachronique (historique), il se trouve que de certains énoncés ont été signifiants a leur maniere, qu’ils aient cessé ou non de ľétre, selon un certain état historique de la langue et de la pensée, et aussi (ce que la sémantique scientifique oublie parfois) selon un certain « Weltbild » définissant les caractěres généraux de ce qu’on appelle le « réel ». Par exemple la phrase : « Le soleil est nouveau chaque jour » est une phrase dont la signification est fonction de la vision du monde de Heraclite, de la maniere archaľque dont un énoncé a pu alors se rapporter á la réalité, et des relations grecques entre la pensée et la réalité. Nous pou- vons alors, en définissant par son objet la sémantique comme discipline, parier de sémantique synchronique (systématique), quand son objet est la signification comme phénoméne indé- pendant du facteur temps, et de sémantique diachronique (historique) quand son objet s’inscrit dans le cours du temps et se trouve étudié comme tel. Toutefois ľ on pent définir la sémantique non plus selon son objet, mais selon la maniere quelle a d’aborder son objet le plus général qui est le phénoméne de signification, et selon l’aspect plus particulier de ce phénoméne que, au nom de principes méthodiques, eile retient au premier chef. C’est ainsi que, en fait, la sémantique actuelle se trouve fon- dée sur ľun ou l’autre (parfois l’un et l’autre) des deux aspects fondamentaux quelle retient du phénoméne de signification, á savoir l’aspect logique (retenant les structures de. « pensée » du phénoméne) ou (et) l’aspect linguistiqae (retenant les structures de langue accompagnant pratiquement tous les phénoměnes de signification). Un énoncé, quand il est signifiant, est en effet á la fois une structure de pensée et une structure de langue. Ajoutons ici qu’il est aussi une structure de réalité, indiquant et posant une « position du réel », 65 [pageend67]ce á quoi la sémantique (surtout historique) ne s’est encore pas assez attache. On pent figurer selon un tableau á deux entrees ces quatre aspects principaux de la sémantique comme discipline : OBJET LU dans la diachronie (perspective historique) dans la synchronie (perspective systématique) Structures privilégiées par méthode de pensée (logiques) (1) (2) de langue (linguistiques (3) (4) Notons aussitôt que ces quatre aspects ne sont pas incon- ciliables. Les possibilités (2) et (4) s’unissent en particulier dans la théorie de ľinformation (Cf. en Suisse, par exemple, Doz. Mangold, Bále). La sémantique (2), c’est-á-dire synchronique et fondée sur les structures de pensée davantage que de langue, est aujour- ďhui le fait de ľécole anglo-saxonne (Cf. en Suisse Prof. Grize, Neuchatel). Quant á la sémantique (4), synchronique aussi, mais fondée ďabord sur les structures de langue, la Suisse frangaise est ľhéritiére des travaux de de Saussure, suivis de ceux de Bailly (Geneve). La sémantique (1), qui serait logique et historique, n’est guěre représentée : ľhistoire de la logique, depuis Prantl, reste á réécrire. Cest en revanche dans le domaine de la sémantique (3), c’est-á-dire dans le cadre de la linguistique historique, que les travaux contem- porains sont le plus féconds. Ľécole allemande, inspirée par la phénoménologie a, en effet, renouvelé le probléme de la compréhension des énoncés signifiants, de ľAntiquité en particulier, grace á des linguistes de ľécole de von Humbold, parmi lesquels il faut citer Johannes Lohmann (Fribourg 66 [pageend68]en Br). A Lausanne (pour citer ces exemples), Prof. Keller s’attache á la Parole biblique; Prof. Régamey á la pensée hindoue. A Bále, Prof. Ott s’attache au symbole biblique, et Prof. Ricceur, de Paris, aux structures indirectes du mythe. Limites de la sémantique scientifique. Quel que soit le domaine dans lequel la sémantique « lit » la signification (dans le temps et selon la diachronie, ou indépendamment de Involution et dans la synchronie), quel que soit par ailleurs l’aspect du phénoměne qui est retenu comme principal (aspect de pensée dans la sémantique logique, ou aspect linguistique), le phénoměne de signification, qui présente une unité comme phénoměne et comme phéno- méne proprement humain, est altéré dans la mesure ou les énoncés sémantiques portant sur lui (comme méta-énoncés) prennent une tournure scientifique qui determine ľobjet sur lequel ils portent et le forcent á étre un « objet » au sens de la science, quand bien méme les énoncés signifiants originels ont pu étre constitués indépendamment de toute référence au monde de la science. Ainsi, lorsqu’elle se force a étre une science au sens moderne de ce terme, la sémantique déter- mine son objet comme « objet de science » et manque par lá nécessairement les structures propres ďobjets constitués par des voies autres que scientifiques. Supposons que ľobjet signi- fiant soit une oeuvre ďart, constituée manifestement selon les « lois » qui ne coincident pas avec les lois génératrices des phénomenes scientifiques ; une sémantique de type scientifique passera á côté de tels phénomenes, car, étant du type scientifique eile détermine son objet comme un objet scientifique — ce que justement une oeuvre ďart n’est pas. C’est pourquoi, eu égard aux phénomenes de signification dont la genese n’est pas scientifique, il est urgent de pro- mouvoir une sémantique non-scientifique, c’est-á-dire une sémantique philosophique, destinée á rendre compte de la maniere dont signifient des énoncés (artistiques, par exem- ple : poétiques ou musicaux). Une telle sémantique apparait 67 [pageend69]alors comme un cas particulier ďune sémantique philosophi- que generate, ou, si ľon veut ďune phénoménologie de la signification. Objet de la sémantique philosophique. L’examen empirique et impartial du phénoméne de signification pris dans sa généralité permet de marquer provisoi- rement quelques points. 1. Lorsqu’un méta-énoncé sémantique porte scientifique- ment sur un objet, cet objet est déterminé par la structure du méta-énoncé, si blen que ľénoncé original se trouve devenir signifiant selon le méta-énoncé qui porte sur lui, et non plus selon ľénoncé qu’il est. Pratiquement, la sématique scienti- fique presuppose toujours qu’énoncés et méta-énoncés relěvent ďune seule et merne maniere de signifier d’un meme type de signifiance, qui est la maniere commune aux énoncés de type scientifique. Appelons cette méme maniére la maniere LS (sigle emprunté á un travail antérieur) et posons la regle ; un énoncé de structure encore inconnue est déterminé comme appartenant aux structures LS sitôt qu’un méta-énoncé de structure LS porte sur lui. Par exemple un motif musical spontané est transformé (souvent indúment) en un motif concerté sitôt que ľanalyse musicale a fait voir quelle était sa structure sous-jacente. En réalité pourtant, ce n’est pas for- cément le motif qui découle de sa structure, mais ľinverse. 2. En fait il se peut que ľénoncé étudié soit ou ne soit pas en réalité de structure LS. S’il est de structure LS, le méta-énoncé de structure LS porte á juste titre sur lui. S’il ne ľest pas, le méta-énoncé le détermine comme LS, si bien que ľénoncé LL (1) un énoncé qui n’est manifestement pas de (1) Ces sigles sont empruntés ä Pius Servien ; je les ai repris dans mon ouvrage De ľesthétique a la métaphysique (Den Haag, 1959). LS est ľabréviation de «langage des sciences»; LL est ľabréviation de «langage lyrique». LM designe le langage de la critique littéraire ou musicale, de ľesthétique comme discipline, et peut-ětre de la métaphysique. 68 [pageend70]structure scientifique, par exemple une phrase empruntée á un poéme, ou une phrase musicale. Posons la regie: un énoncé LL posséde une maniere de signifier que tout méta- énoncé de structure LS déforme en la transformant en structure LS (2). C’est ainsi qu’un motif musical répond a une structure sémantique spécifique qui n’est pas forcément celie que lui attribuerait du dehors une analyse musicale posté- rieure. 3. Sur de tels énoncés LL, la sémantique est restée jusqu’á ce jour á peu pres muette, quoique des essais apparaissent (Austin, Strawson, Oxford ; Servien, Souriau, Paris; Piguet, Lausanne). Ľexpérience montre alors que de tels énoncés sont toujours énoncés (signifiants) et jamais des méta-énoncés (chargés de rendre compte extrinsěquement de la signification « contenue » dans les énoncés LL). Ainsi une phrase musicale, ou un vers poétique, signifient, mais ils ne peu- vent pas étre appliques á un autre énoncé pour rendre compte dune signification externe á eux-mémes. On n’explique pas une phrase musicale par une autre phrase musicale, mais par des énoncés empruntés au langage articulé. Désignons alors par le sigle LM les énoncés sémantiques chargés (par hypothěse) de . rendre compte du phénoméne de signification type de significance particulier, portant sur la signification de type LL. Un énoncé constituerait done un méta-énoncé d’un contenue dans un énoncé LL. Le probléme des énoncés LM. Un énoncé LM est un méta-énoncé sémantique portant sur un énoncé de type LL, c’est-ä-dire sur un énoncé irréductible, (2) C’est pour cette raison que ľécole orthodoxe du Cercle de Vienna (Carnap) a refuse á de tels énoncés LL (poétique ou mu- sieaux) le droit d’etre signifiants, parce que leur type de signi- fiance n’est manifestement pas celui des énoncés scientifiques. Une méthode expérimentale rigoureuse se doit pourtant de con- sidérer les énoncés LL comme signifiants, puisqu’ils sont géné- ralement compris et constituent en réalité un fail d’expérience. 69 [pageend71]dans sa signification effective, aux structures ordinaires du langage scientifique (aux structures de typle LS). Les énoncés LL, sur lesquels doivent porter les méta-énoncés sémantiques LM, ont été en fait, jusqua présent, compris, mais non expliqués. Chacun comprend une phrase de Mozart, mais nul n’est capable de rendre compte de cette signification ressentie dans un langage articulé. Le probléme sémantique des énoncés LM consiste done á chercher comment il est possible de faire porter sur des énoncés LL des méta-énoncés chargés de livrer á la conscience le contenu signifié par ľénoncé LL. Etanť donné cette phrase musicale, que je comprends, quel type de phrases puis-je légitimement formuler á son propos ? Ľexamen de ce probléme montre que trois aspects fonda- mentaux du phénoměne de signification LL doivent étre rete- nus. Ces trois aspects sont l’aspect logique, l’aspect linguisti- que, et l’aspect de « réalité ». De ces trois aspects la sémantique scientifique connait les deux premiers, mais guěre le dernier. 1. Selon l’aspect logique, le phénoměne de signification LL apparait comme doué de structures propres, lesquelles ne sont pas analytiques. Une structure analytique est en effet toujours une structure qui s’applique a un objet, et qui pré- suppose ainsi une structure LS. Il est par ailleurs de fait que la méthode analytique est féconde essentiellement dans le domaine des sciences. Appelons dialectique la structure propre á un phénoměne de signification LL, et ajoutons que ces structures dialectiques ont presque toujours été comprises (c’est-á-dire immédiatement présentes á la conscience qui en épouse le cours comme on « suit » au concert la phrase musicale), mais presque jamais expliquées (c’est-á-dire : presque jamais des énoncés typiques ont pu traduire extrinsěque- ment le sens contenu dans la phrase musicale ainsi comprise). Le probléme logique de la sémantique des énoncés LL consiste alors á chercher les conditions logiques qui permettent de rendre compte, par des énoncés LM, du contenu signifiant. Ce probléme consiste á écrire une logique de la dialectique 70 [pageend72]qui ne se confonde pas avec la dialectique de son objet, mais en rende compte extrinsěquement. Ce probléme peut étt“ abordé soit systématiquement (par une logique transcendan- tale) soit historiquement (par une histoire des structures logi- ques) (1). Il est important de noter á cet égard que toutes les « logiques dialectiques » tendent á confondre le mouvement de la pensée qui étudie une réalité dialectique et le mouvement dialectique de cette réalité, comme si penser un tout dialectique revenait au méme que penser dialectiquement un tout. 2. Selon l’aspect linguistique du phénoměne, le probléme de la sémantique des énoncés LL consiste á fixer les structures linguistiques des énoncés LL, face auxquelles de nouvelles structures (LM) doivent étre inaugurées. Or on constate en fait que les énoncés LL ne possědent pas la structure fon- damentale propre á touš les énoncés LS (scientifiques), structure qu’á révélée de Saussure (á la suite de la logique stoi- cienne) et qui est celie du rapport du signifiant au signifié. Dans les énoncés littéraires ou musicaux, en effet, il n’y a pas ďun côté des objets signifiants, et de ľautre des réalités signi- fiées. Le langage LL ignore la distinction du signifiant au signifié, et tous les énoncés LL unissent indissolublement le signifiant et le signifié; on peut dire qu’ils sont auto-signi- fiants, ou auto-signifiés, ce qui revient au meme. Si par ailleurs il est entendu que dans un énoncé LS (scientifique) les énoncés signifiants déterminent le statut des objets ainsi signifiés, il apparait qu’un méta-énoncé LM portant sur un énoncé LL doit au contraire se laisser determiner par la structure LL de ľénoncé étudié, de maniere á traduire adé- quatement cette structure dans une forme LM. Dans le langage LM, le rapport de signifiant á signifié doit étre par conséquent inversé, par rapport á ce qu’il est dans le langage (1) Cf. pour la logique transcendantale mon ouvrage De ľesthétique a la métaphysique, et pour l’histoire des structures logiques : Conscience et langage (ä paraltre). 71 [pageend73]LS. Dans le langage LS, en effet, le signifiant determine le signifié, tandis que dans le langage LM, c’est le signifié (ľob- jet lu comme structure LL) qui doit déterminer la maniere (LM) qu’on peut avoir de le signifier. Un langage LM doit done refléter les structures LL des énoncés étudiés, au lieu de déterminer ces structures par application de méta-énoncés ordinaires. 3. Enfin il y a un troisiéme aspect du phénoméne de signification LL qui ne saurait etre négligé : son aspect de réalité. Un énoncé LL constitue en effet une réalité, alors que tous les énoncés LS visent la réalité posée comme un au-dela. Alors que, par exemple, tous les énoncés de physique atomique visent une réalité qui est transcendante par rapport á ces énoncés, toute la réalité d’une Symphonie est contenue dans la formulation merne (LL) de cette Symphonie. Un méta- énoncé LM se doit done de viser la réalité LL d’une maniere radicalement autre que celie qui a cours dans le monde des significations LS. Ces trois aspects fondamentaux peuvent á leur tour étre développés dans le sens de la diachronie; cela entrainerait cependant trop loin que d’esquisser ici cette nouvelle voie. En conclusion, la sémantique philosophique se trouve de- vant deux táches principales. 1. Tout d’abord eile doit survoler la totalité du phénoméne de signification, au lieu de sen tenir au seul domaine limité des significations de type scientifique (LS). Cela signi- fie essentiellement deux choses : a) il n’est pas nécessaire que toute sémantique, pour étre valable, soit de type scientifique. La phénoménologie du langage, par exemple, n’est pas scientifique dans sa nature, mais apporte néanmoins des résultats qui ont leur importance. C’est dans cet esprit que les écoles d’analyse du langage et de logique positiviste peuvent et doivent étre fécondées par la phénoménologie. b) Il n’est pas nécessairement dit que toute réalité — et j’entends ici essentiellement les réalités qu’on appelle « humai- 72 [pageend74]nes » — ne livrent leur essence secrete qu’aux seules métho- des dites « scientifiques ». Il existe par exemple une série de réalités extraordinairement simples, et dont la signification est aisément comprise par tout le monde, sur lesquelles la science reste muette : une sensation, par exemple, ou une douleur. Affirmer par consequent que la sémantique doit s'attacher á la totalite du phénoméne de signification, c’est laisser entendre que les méthodes positives des sciences exactes comportent des limites, et que, pour prétendre expliquer, elles ne font pas nécessairement mieux comprendre. 2. La seconde táche de la sémantique philosophique con- siste pratiquement á s’attacher de preference aux énoncés qui paraissent irréductibles aux structures de la pensée scientifique objectivante. L’abondance des essais contemporains visant á expliciter le type de signification propre aux phrases de la musique est typique á cet égard, car ces derniers échappent manifestement á une enquéte de type scientifique. C’est du reste dans cet esprit que la phénoménologie a cherché d’em- blée á se poser comme une enquéte ne relevant pas des pro- cédés habituels de la science exacte. Cette táche se laisse diviser en trois raches partielles. a) La premiere táche de la sémantique philosophique consiste á établir le type de réalité, ou, si I’on veut, lei mode d’existence propre aux réalités LL. C’est dans cette mesure par exemple que ľesthétique (francaise, surtout) s’est atta- chée á poser Yirréductibilité du type de réalité esthétique au type ordinaire de « réalité » scientifique. Une Symphonie, par exemple, existe, mais eile n’existe pas selon le meme mode d’existence et ne procěde pas du meme type de réalité qu’un composé chimique ou qu’une galaxie. De maniere plus générale, on peut dire que la raison dialectique, dans le marxisme, ou surtout dans I’usage qu’en fait Sartre, a réussi partiellement á poser les fondements ontologiques de réalités (LL) irréductibles á ce que la raison analytique entend par « réalité ». 73 [pageend75]b) A la táche ontologique de la sémantique philosophique s’ajoute une táche logique, qui consiste en ľélaboration dune méthode. Car ni la raison dialectique (chez Sartre), ni ľesthétique írangaise, ni méme enfin (quoi qu’on en ait dit) la phénoménologie, ne possédent encore une méthode spécifique pour aborder de maniere concertée et progressive les réalités humaines de type LL. Toutes les méthodes proposées (réduc- tion phénoménologique, etc.) ne sont encore que des méthodes empiriques, done des pis-allers. Ľélaboration dune méthode non-scientifique pour aborder les types de signification LL définit ainsi la táche épisté- mologique de la sémantique philosophique. c) Enfin s’ajoute á cela une derniére táche, qui est lin- guistique. Dans la mesure ou notre langue ordinaire est fagonnée de maniere analytique et marquée de maniére exclusive par Limitation ďun modele livré par les seules sciences exactes, eile ne permet pas — et cela a priori — de servir ďinstrument ou méme de permettre la «traduction» des réalités de type LL. C’est pourquoi la táche épistémologique de la sémantique philosophique relevée sous lettre b) ci-dessus s’accompagne nécessairement dune táche linguistique, visant á ľélaboration ďun langage LM adéquat. En un mot, on voit que la sémantique philosophique est en train aujourďhui de chercher á se constituer en discipline indépendante,’'dans la mesure ou, ayant reconnu ľexistence effective de réalités de type LL (irréductibles aux catégories LS), eile eher ehe une méthode propre et vise á constituer un langage adéquat. C’est á ces conditions, me semble-t-il, que se laisse ouvrir une voie vers la compréhension renouvelée des choses de ľesprit. 74 [pageend76]GUILLERMO DE TORRE LITERATURE AND FREEDOM Art lives through coercion, it dies of freedom—so wrote André Gide years ago. This is an idea which, at first sight openly contradicts all the assumptions on which are based the most valid art and literature of our times. Taken by themselves these words of Gide’s might sound like the refutation of one who, after leaving behind the gratuitousness of youth died affirming his unshakeable faith in the new generations "which maintain intact their moral and intellectual integrity, rising against all attempts that endeavour to subjugate thought, to enslave the soul...”. To understand them, it is necessary to place them in their historical contexts: they were written in reply to an enquiry, prior to the first World War, on a possible classicism. The aim at that time was not subtantially other than the nostalgia for a new classic art, a neoclassicism: a somewhat equivocal ambition—like all attempts which place the prefix ”neo" before any devitalized term—since it implied a somewhat anachronistic retrogression and, paradoxically, an eagerness to guide and channel the course of an incalculable river: the future. Furthermore, the same author, in the moment of his greatest and ephemeral leaning towards Marxism, and since he never lost his serenity or his nerve of discrimination, had confessed: "If I could not write I would commit suicide”. To write, that is, beyond the simple vocational need; to write in the most absolute liberty, exempt from all outside compulsion and all internal restraint. The fact is that literature and liberty are—and always will be, in spite of semantic gymnastics, of ideological sleight of hand and paradoxical conceptual deviations—synonymous, 75 [pageend77]complementary terms. More than that: indissoluble. In the same way as it has now been accepted (after many bitter experiences) that there cannot be liberty against liberty, we could also assert that there is no literature against literature. But, we shall be asked, what about anti-literature ? (a companion to the so-called anti-theatre, anti-novel, anti-art, which nowadays offer themselves so temptingly to newcomers, who want to start from scratch, wanting to set out from zero). That, too, is literature, and not always of the best. There is room, it is true, not only for negations, but for limitatations, conditionings, but only as long as they are exercised from within, by the spontaneous and strictly voluntary initiative of the author. These are conventions which have always existed and will always exist. Precepts, rhetorical and aesthetic standards—even when, in the modern manner, they may appear to be the contrary—established not with a coercive aim, but with the desire to breathe quality and permanence into the work. Should we, therefore, abominate free expression? No, provided it goes beyond the marinettian "paroliberi”, that simple lack of connexion or grammatical nakedness, strident in the dawn of vanguards; and provided it is moved by a purpose which is not ingenuously spectacular—as in certain ephemeral experimentations of ’’lettrisme”— but as an intention which is radically liberating, and consequently constructive. A writer—thus, without any need for adjectives—is not, in the last resort, someone who delivers himself of words. It is someone who governs words, instead of being governed by them. The reverse of literary freedom is not coercion, and much less regression. It has an unchangeable name: discipline. But—I must insist—voluntary and conscious discipline, not imposed or imitative. On the temporal plane, viewing it with perpective historicity, liberty admits numerous permutations. But these will never be able to leave the preconceived orbit: romanticism, classicism; innovation, continuity... whose chain of alternatives will always go to the well known mythical ends (Diony- 76 [pageend78]sos, Apollo) achieving, in consequence, disembodied abstraction. In a different manner, in the intellectual experience of every day, and even of every century, the pair of alternatives becomes much more complex and variegated. So much so, that it escapes this cataloguing. And it so happens that those intermediate points, the unforeseen quarter in the compass, are generally the most attractive and fertile. At least whilst the concept (rather, reality : highly personal and inalienable) of liberty does not find in its turntable the sand, the obstacle of an unforeseen shadow: the concept (this one really so, since it is abstract and unseizable) of necessity. To understand this one not as fate, but as a prerequisite of liberty (beyond its purely literary application) is to yield voluntarily, thus facilitating the most harmful equivocations and denaturalizations. Let us remember once again the Dostoiev- skian parable of the Grand Inquisitor in ’’The Brothers Karamazov”, whose empirical version is in the ’’Schigalevisme” of "The Devils”. The Great Inquisitor of the XVI century boasts in front of Christ—reappearing before the multitudes, during a procession in Seville—of having suppressed liberty in order to make mankind happier, offering it instead of the uncertainty and the spiritual suffering which it implies, an earthly and authoritarian world organization. Thus the Sevillian Grand Inquisitor—whose reincarnation in the XX century might assume more than one name—substitutes the heavenly bread for the earthly bread offered to mankind. Which is equivalent to changing liberty for the yoke. As a complement, the revolutionary Schigalev, in "The Devils” proposes a radical egalitarianism from below. That is, the equality of all men in slavery. The imposition of the law of need facing the principle of liberty. But for Dostoievsky the imposition of the law of necessity would be equivalent to the reign of the Anti-Christ, whilst he saw the spirit of liberty as something that cannot be renounced, whenever it implies a parallel responsibility, and cannot be exchanged for some superficial or erroneous eudemonism. 77 [pageend79]In a similar manner, when one speaks, at the literary, intellectual level, of the need for an order, for a discipline, we should demand that these factors do not bring behind them, concealed, any conformism or étatisme, understanding them correctly as a need for rigorous thinking and clear expression, in whose ambit will be found quality and novelty, perfection and surprise, the present and the eternal. But this aim—always coveted but seldom achieved—does not exclude, on the contrary it requires, the existence of a swing between the extremes. Neither does it deny the succession of phases within the same spirit, at the beginning and at the end of which liberty should not be lacking, both a means and an end in itself at the same time. To try and see more clearly some aspects of the problem literature-liberty, it would be necessary to split it into various other aspects. First of all, liberty, the liberty of literature as such, as an objective. Then the liberty of the author, the intellectual, the artist, as subject and producer of the work. And finally, the elective and receptive liberty of the consuming public, as a converging vortex of the first two. But, is it possible to isolate the first two freedoms or are they fundamentally indissoluble? The freedom of literature in itself has not always been associated with the liberty of its creator. Few would dare assert to-day, like Nietzsche, that "slavery is necessary to culture; it is the vulture which devours the liver of Prometheus, the artisan of culture”. But it is undeniable that the splendour of the Greco-Latin literatures prior to Christianity existed without detriment in a state of human slavery. In the golden century, the condition of dependence in which the writer lived in relation to the nobleman, to the Church or the sovereign (let us bring to mind only the memory of Lope de Vega whose centenary is now being celebrated), did not prevent him from moving at will, writing as he liked, without any other limitation than the taste or the capacity for understanding of his public. A public which, on the other hand, except in the theatre, does not manifest itself in a compact and visible form until the 18th century. 78 [pageend80]We must reach—skipping a few stages—our own century to find the instance not only of the a posteriori repressive interference which always existed in a greater or lesser degree, but with a priori dirigiste intervention; to witness the scene of several States which, acting, on the author, tried to steer literature, and art in general, with explicitly anti-literary aims. But also, once these threats have been extinguished—at leasf those practised in a systematic form—we have witnessed the more complex case of other countries which, whilst remaining (obviously not outwardly, through understandable reticence, but certainly deep down) faithful to discredited ideologies, instead of persecuting, as formerly, aesthetically non-conformist theories, have come forward to favour their expansion, bringing them under the official flag. This deception—very subtle as to its ultimate intentions, and for this reason not noticed by many—generally selects as its field of action not the literary field, but the plastic one. And within the latter, nothing open to suspicion as far as explicit intentions are concerned. That is, the contrary of the expressive, the non- figurative plastic... And let me add that by pointing out such a deception I do not in any way want to decry such art in itself; I merely want to show one of of the risks arising from its essential ambiguity. Something very different has happened when art does not handle shadows; when it carries, wrapped up inside, a thought destined to transcend and influence. Then, inevitably, the work, specially if it is written work, if it begins to show a spirit of dissidence or disobedience towards the criterion imposed by the majority—or by the minority, but ascribing to itself unanimity— will only achieve public expression with some difficulty. Its author will either have to give up, or will have to resort to subtle speciousness, evasion or allusions. It is generally said, ironically, that by this he gains subtlety, that there is nothing more direct than what is said between the lines. But, is it not the case that in the reality of daily life these masquerades degrade both author and reader ? ”No free man”, Ignazio Silone has written, ’’can impose silence on his 79 [pageend81]adversary without hurting himself.” And in a more authoritative manner, as an expression not of scepticism of relativity, but of conviction and absolutes, Paul Valéry, ”1 despise whoever tries to persuade me. Apologetics is impurity. To want all men to think alike is an offense against man.” And what about the liberty of election—and of selection— of the anonymous or myriad faced consumer, of the reading public? At first sight the question might seem to be arbitrary or ingenuous, since no one has the power to oppose this liberty. But, since that elective faculty can only be exercised through what exists and can be read at a given moment, it is in such cases that the coercion or deviation of the reader can take place, openly or insidiously. In principle, there is nothing to stop him going to the shelves of a public library or a bookshop and, according to his tastes or needs, choose the book which he likes best or needs most. But, will he be sure to find it? Or rather, will he find only those, different or contrary in character to those he is looking for? A slight investigation of the index of certain libraries will show up certain disconcerting features: a superabundance of a certain kind of books and authors, during a given period of years, with their total absence during other periods. Apparently it is not necessary, even for the most uninstructed, to have new facts which will allow the reconstruction of the history of society, of the whole country indeed, during that period. Iny such cases the reader does not choose. Kind (or use nany other ironical adjective you can think of) hands, criteria, will select for him a priori, and even separate the grain from the chaff. There is, naturally, that other reader, whom we may call dissident or noncomformist, abundantly represented among young people. He, driven by an external movement of legitimate, hostile reaction will charge head first into the search or capture of the hidden or forbidden book, giving it a representative value which, in most cases, will not correspond, and may even be in inverse proportion to its cultural value or its purely literary or ideological quality. How many forces try to suppress the liberty of election at its root, as can be seen at 80 [pageend82]any place or time when such a policy has been or is being applied ! The case of the freedom of choice relating to books or art, on the part of the non-directed or politically incoerced public assumes widely different aspects. I refer more specifically to the average man of the present societies, viewed as a reader. Cultural dirigisme changes its aim and tactics at this point. It is not exercised under specific ideological creeds, nor exactly as a function of the law of supply and demand, but by means of a distortion of the latter carried out by commercial enterprises. After a widely read essay of Dwight Macdonald’s, with many subsequent participations, including, if I may mention it, one of mine in my last book, the phenomenon has been abundantly studied, and consequently a brief reference here will suffice. Is there a mass culture, or to be more precise, does this creation of the majority deserve the name of culture? Is it truly literature, what? is offered by that type of production, expressly made for the masses, can it ever become literature? Macdonald has denied it. Brogan, and van der Haag, among others, are more tolerant. For the moment what cannot be denied is that the products of such literature are rather sub-products and sub-literature. It is very significant that the least hostile critic, or the one most favourably disposed, such as Edgar Morin (in his recent book ’’L’esprit du Temps”, ”La culture des. masses”) should deal at length with the cinema, the radio, television, and even the ubiquitous magazines, but should disregard altogether the purely literary phenomenon. Finally, here is another aspect of the matter which is quite different from those coercions against which the author defends himself, as this particular one originates in him, and full responsibility for any limitation it may produce should be imputed to him. I refer to the case of those writers who aiming not to narrow the field of action, but certainly to sharpen and refine to the maximum what they express, rarefy their aims and style. The asepsis, purism, the exclusi81 [pageend83]veness of other times are not to be compared with the latest vacuums created. So much so that for the moment these writers give the impression that they are not only turning their backs upon the majority or common reader, but upon all possible readers. It is no longer the "ivory tower” of the end of the century— by no means remote or inaccessible, since even Mallarmé finds each day more experienced climbers. The object of such writers, exclusivists a ľoutrance, is more enigmatic; it goes beyond a radical indifference to all allusive condescension and the pursuit of arduous, elusive meander- ings. A certain poet (whose name I really forgot to note at the time, and is unimportant, since the statement gains even greater importance taking it as a common, symbolic voice) has said of another kindred spirit: "The author writes so closely that he leaves nothing open to the reader. His is a complete creation, finished, which does not demand at any time the collaboration of others. The reader is a simple detail which can be dispensed with.” Agreed—we might reply, but in that case why does the author fall into the irrefutable contradiction of publishing his work, and why does his commentator try to attract our attention as presumed or wished for readers? We can only conclude that these are aberrations on the part of the writer, faced with the enslavement of the products of "mass communication”; not merely the quintessence but the desubstantiated products of supreme solipsism. Neither of the two extremes is, truly, valid literature, and both them conspire against the freedom of selection of the reader. The first, that of the majority, because of its mas- sifying power; the second, because of its disruptive power. Translated by Richard G odd ord 82 [pageend84]E. PINILLA DE LAS HERAS SOCIAL ORGANIZATION, POWER AND ALIENATION I 1. Words are like money: their value is in inverse proportion to their abundance. This happens to some terms frequently used because they fit happily into the structure of any phrase. They are those words repeated so often that they become, let us say, mere phonemes. They are bandied about like those coppers which are thrown from balconies in Castil- lian villages during christenings. And when someone wants to pick them up from the public square, investing them anew with the value of the rational meaning which they originally had, he finds that their dialectical life is almost extinguished: the old word-values converted into phonemes of convenience are like pelota throws aimed at a non-existent player: no one returns them, validly, for the purpose of the interhuman game. When playing with terms like freedom and organization, the writer starts on his brief career at a disadvantage. In a society like the Spanish one, the conventionalization of language, associated in some people with prudence and in others with loathing has served to shut the windows of many souls. The intellectual laziness connected with a certain kind of conventionalization of language, converts the latter from a bridge into a moat: some systems of words are then like the chains which were used in medieval sea towns to close their ports at night. Thus, the writer without any raw material other than the tired tool of language, now finds himself a little like a pirate ship hopelessly marauding before the outlet of an inland port. What is to be done ? Certainly, refrain from being misled by the all too easy solution of 83 [pageend85]loading the worn out words with additional romantic gunpowder. More simply: put them into a new order of relationship. 2. I will start with a personal confession. The subject Freedom and Organization unwinds the thread of my memories. It suggests to me the experience of the operator of a tape recorder who presses a button, silences the present, and with a muted sound from the machine, a hundred metres of thought are retraced so that the past will again be heard as the present. My father was a freethinker. Like so many men of country origin he had an agricultural image of the human being. There are seeds which are irremediably bad, and there are others which may produce surprising and exuberant results. Provided, of course, that they are cultivated. The method of cultivation of my father was hard and rudimentary. Following the synthetic tendency so spontaneous in the Spanish mind, he had simplified the vital reality which separates the educator from the pupil, he made the latter, that is me, read aloud pedagogical texts hardly suitable for the unrewarding young mind. It was during the time of the Republic. I can remember several winters. Whilst rhe northern wind of Soria blew outside, I had to read aloud, under the lamp, whole pages of Rousseau’s "Emile”. My father would correct my punctuation, and he would become irritable whenever I spoke any sentence without the proper rhythm and meaning. He believed, with a faith which Prof. Whorf would have approved of, that the oral accuracy of language was a key link between Thought and Reality. Many pages were completely unintelligible for me, and the "profession of faith of the Savoyard vicar” cost me some tears. I still have that old text (a Spanish version published by Lux). And yet: freedom and organization was one of the great themes of Jean Jacques Rousseau. Or to be more exact, the problem of how man can be free whilst living in a society which is necessarily organised. It is not the principal theme of Emile, but of other books (particularly the Contract), 84 [pageend86]but you will find there also, in its first few pages, the clash between human condition and social institutions. Man is naturally good (and "naturally” free) as long as he is not enmeshed in the net of social relations. The subjective experience which Rousseau obtained from social relations (in the bourgeois society of his native city, as in the aristocratic bourgeois transition society of Paris, and under the decadent ancien regime) was elaborated anew by him, in a theoretical form, with a radicalness which permits us to-day to recognise many of the problems of Jean Jacques as our own. In modern language we would say that social relations were, for Rousseau, one of the main alienatory factors of the human being. This is the initial theme of social anthropologists and psychologists with a sociological outlook, who study nowadays the new alienations of man in societies with a great economic development (Eric Fromm among others). The theme has been received through the concept of alienation in Marx (a concept completely different from Rousseau’s), but once it is separated from the problems of economic appropriation and of the political institutionalization of such economic appropriations, the non-marxist anthropologists and social psychologists have re-formulated it at the psychological and individual level which was Rousseau’s. Jean Jacques knew, however, that social relations are necessary to transform the human animal into a citizen; he knew that man, both the man who has remained "good”, and the debased man, is in part the product of the current habits of his society. Consequently, he set himself the problem of a rational society, or if one wants to use less terrible words, that of the correction and innovation of social habits. In the subsequent development of the social sciences, this- problem appears to us split into the following: a) the social determination of the character of the individual, (a question for the social psychologists and socioanthropologists); b) the social conditioning of the morality obtaining in a community (one of the favourite themes of Durkheim, Max Weber and the sociologists of knowledge) ; c) the social conditioning 85 [pageend87]of the processes of social innovation, a process necessary in any society historically alive, (a theme tackled by historians: Toynbee; economists: Schumpeter; anthropologists: H.G. Barnett, and the innumerable sociologists who are concerned with cultural change). The "citizen” concept has in Rousseau an anthropological implication which goes beyond its legal-political limits: «Nous ne commencons proprement á devenir hommes qu’apres avoir été citoyens. » To establish the inner rationality which should govern this transformation of the human animal into the citizen, and of the citizen into the free man (with a new freedom, civil freedom, different from ’’natural” freedom), is an old question which Rousseau solved setting himself up as the forerunner of all modern revolutionaries and social reformers: political power may "civilize”—or, rather, humanize—the individuals debased by social relations. This thau- maturgical aspect attributed to political power in connection with the moral condemnation of society, and the belief in a positive spontaneity latent in the human being will be1 found in the origin of the most noble (and useless) utopias. Until recently, it has been, historically, an idea-force, a simplification which has prevented a lot of sincere revolutionaries visualizing the real texture of the relations which connect the alienated human being with the citizen, with the political power and with the whole of society. And yet, the initial proposition—to establish the rationality which should govern the process of transformation of the human animal into the citizen, and of the citizen into the free man—continues to defy us, in spite of its colossal synthetic ambition, as one of the far goals which will one day be postulated by a total social science, if that kind of scientific knowledge is possible. Finally, the ethical problem. A double-faced problem, soluble for Rousseau in the political sphere and in the personal sphere of each individual. The concept of freedom as the fitness of our behaviour following upon the acknowledgment of a general standard, and the imputation of the character of a normative subject to the political community, come un86 [pageend88]doubtedly from that other thinker (Plato) who also wanted to be legislator and moralist, and who had more influence than any one else on Rousseau. If we ponder again upon this concept of freedom as the actualization of the will, consequential to the recognition of a general standard which realizes the most necessary good, it will seem to us we are hearing one of the great themes of Kant. And truly, through Kant (his most attentive reader), Rousseau will influence the whole Germanic tradition which identifies human freedom with the rational selfconscience. It is the way of inwardness, perfectly logical if we view it as being derived from a thought which was, in essence, religious : “O homme ! Réserve ton existence au dedans de toi, et tu ne seras plus misérable !” If, on the other hand we consider the concept according to which the freedom of the individual consists in obeying the legislator, because freedom consists in obeying Reason (and the legislator is the foremost rational being), it would seem we are listening to the great hegelian and posthegelian symphony, even in its post-marxist-stalinist form. It has been said so many times that Rousseau postulates, in a nutshell, the modern authoritarian state, that it seems otiose to repeat what is already an axiom. II 1. A contemporary of Jean Jacques with whom he shares, in principle, some a priori assumptions on the social order and the natural order common to men born in the first decades of the XVIII century, also concerned himself, during the middle of that century, with the problem or organization. He was a man who, curiously enough, had started his written work with a "Treatise of Moral Sentiments”, so that he has something in common with the Genevese. With the concept of the Division of Labour, Adam Smith guides us into a very different harbour. He admits, like Rousseau, that in social relations connected with the division of labour man loses part of his freedom (or to be more exact, independence), but at 87 [pageend89]the same time he points out that each man becomes necessary to the other men connected with him by the economic process, becomes productive, can notably increase that same productivity and contribute, quite unwittingly, to the functioning of a satisfactory natural social order, for the progress of the majority of society. It is not simply a case of a clah between the perspective of the moralist-legislator and that of the economist, as there is a field (the political) where Rousseau and Adam Smith appear almost as contemporaries to preach two theories fundamentally opposed. Jean-Jacques condemns, (at least in part of his work), private property; his mistrust of social relations leads him to postulate the direct surrender of the individual to the community, without any mediation, without obstacles to his participation in the whole constituted by the urban republic; he even attributes to the will of the (political) community the power to compel the private wills of individuals in religious matters; he reduces to a minimum the possible number of objects which may stand between the individual and the general will embodied in the community ; in brief: the minimum spatial extension of the republic; with the fusion of the representative, executive and legislative power. Private property encircles the individual with a safety belt. The division of labour, or more briefly, specialization, is carried even into public matters and Government: the division of powers, and the abstention of the Government in a sphere ruled by "an invisible hand” (it is useless, Adam Smith will tell us, "for the Sovereign to try to understand the trade of each person”). Territorial space must be as ample as possible, because there is a positive correlation between the extent of the market and specialization in the division of labour. Society is very complex in its network of social relations, and through the process of specialization tends to become more complex every day. Consequently, no synthetic science but analytical science. No metaphysical legality, but rather an investigation of the relational legality which links the simultaneous trans88 [pageend90]formations of two or more phenomena. Modern society is like a huge fan of professional roles which are offered to the individuals who live in it. Each individual is housed in a role, in which he works. As he works and increases his productivity, he also produces for himself a margirf of freedom. The freedom of the individual is, in brief, one of the marginal products of labour. The problem of social organization emerges, thus, ab initio, purged of any metophysical implications. In the Anglo-Saxon tradition it is continuously present as a technical problem. The father of modern Anglo-Saxon economists, Alfred Marshall, explains at the end of the 19th century that the factors of production are not only three (land, labour and capital), but four; the fourth one being organization. To-day, in the second half of the 20th century organization has become O & M: the raw material of so many courses at the London Polytechnic and the popular or "Redbrick” Universities: Organization and Methods. Although I am deliberately simplifying, I do not think that it is inaccurate to make this distinction between two concepts of freedom, and consequently, of social organization. On the one hand, the identification of Freedom-obedience with Reason legally objectified leads in private life, to postulate as the maximum value the rational selfconscience of the human being, and the behaviour of its will according to a certain kind of general Good; in the public sphere, it may lead to a political theory of absolute submission of the individual to the (indivisible) Power of the community. (I say it may, and not that it necessarily will, because one of the strange derivations of the Rousseau-Kant line of thought has been that of the Germanic jurists of neo-kantian influence and democratic- liberal attitude. Keisen, for instance, defines political liberty as nothing less than the "self-determination of the individual through his participation in the creation of the social order”. A beautiful phrase which ignores the sociological reality of which the individual is an element.) 89 [pageend91]On the other hand, the operative concept of freedom as a faculty linked to each individual, and created by him (a concept to which the concept of general will is completely foreign, since there are no more wills than the individual ones), is transformed into freedom for the perfectioning of work, freedom to improve the praxis. The material transformation of the world through work is one of the forms of expression of this freedom. Its final results are: the technical control, every day more powerful, of the physical universe, and of the organization of society itself. 2. We have seen that Rousseau started with a theory (rather literary and sentimental) on human alienation and he ended with a theory of power. The effect of freedom as the operative faculty in the transformation of the praxis can also be studied in terms of power. Naturally this development has only been possible side by side with that of scientific theory, at all levels of knowledge, and with the prodigious increase in the practical possibilities of applied science. The horizon of practical possibilities accessible to every individual has been increased beyond what any utopian of the 18th century could dream. In a certain sense this is power. But we are not merely in the presence of individual power. In some of the social sciences (in economics to be exact) the threshold has been passed beyond which analytical knowledge can produce not only models that reconstruct the working of social reality in the past, but also active models which operate on the workings of reality in the present and the immediate future. A table of relations between industries is not only a beautiful example of economic history and a testimony of mathematical refinement, but it can be at the same time a useful instrument for the economist to use (allied, naturally, with the executive power) on the structure of the present. This threshold, where the product of analytical knowledge is shown to be valid for the transformation of reality was crossed some time ago by the physical and natural sciences. It has not been crossed by the majority of the social sciences, except for economics. This, also, is power. 90 [pageend92]Some years ago Profesor M. G. Kendall (London University), enlisted the help of the National Physical Laboratory to build an electric simulator which would relate a series of economic variables, relevant to the international balance of payments of the United Kingdom. The apparatus was built, the system was excited, and its working was observed through the register of an oscilloscope. At a given moment the whole system was unbalanced by a violent oscillation. A colleague of Prof. Kendall exclaimed: "This is why we have a balance of payments crisis every two years”. (Maurice G. Kendall, "New Prospects in Economic Analysis”, University of London, I960, p. 21-22). The example shows us that when the simplification of social reality made by the scientist, in the shape of a selection of variables, is accurate, the methodical abstraction which prima facie impoverishes reality does not truly represent an obstacle to ascertaining the functional plan of reality itself. (This is something which should be remembered by some Spanish methodologists who postulate the substitution of abstracto-analytical knowledge by a vital and ineffable knowledge, assumed to be total). A machine can work with the relations obtained from the quantifications of variables selected ad hoc (although the scientists may have ignored all other kinds of processes) and show us something about the real interrelation between those variables, obtaining a model of the working of reality itself. The emphasis which can to-day be heard in the words of some social scientists is not, therefore, illogical: "... even advances in philosophy may depend on technological progress... We should give up the habit of thinking that this instrument merely enables us to do better and more rapidly what we are already used to doing. Its great potential resides in the fact that it enables us to build and control new types of social organization. If we observe that we cannot control the kind of economy we have at present, then, in self defence, we will set up the type of economy which we can 91 [pageend93]control. (Maurice G. Kendall. "New Prospects in Economic Analysis”, University of London, I960, p. 21-22). The thing is clear: in the macroeconomic field, and consequently in the macrosocial field, we shall obtain more security and more freedom by increasing our power. If we have problems which curtail our freedom it is because we do not have enough power yet. The improvement of the praxis through the increase of our power constitutes the way to the negation of determinism (and the negation of determinism is the expansion of freedom). The reader can apply this assertion to the field of private life, relating his marginal, personal increase in freedom to the increase in power which technology places at the disposal of the individual. I hope that readers in such an academic country as ours will not think too frivolous an example which might well be embodied in the brief expression : towards freedom through the motor car. The political aspect—towards freedom through power— thus has a parallel in the non-political, factual aspect of daily life. 3. And yet, things are not quite so simple as that. If the confusion between freedom and power has already been denounced ad nauseam as typical of all non-democratic regimes, and consequently leading to the debasement of the human being, it seems that through very different historico-socio- logical mediations we are also reaching the limits of this confusion in the field of daily life. In highly developed industrial societies the network of social relations derived from the increase in technical devices appears to us once again as a network of objects with their own, material power. The creation of man becomes the determination of man. Thousands of pages have been written in the last few decades criticising the structure of societies with large industrial and urban concentrations, from the frivolous prose of Denis de Rougemont when he talks to us of the tyranny of the telephone, to the sombre analysis of the alienation of the human 92 [pageend94]being in the capitalist society, made by Eric Fromm and his colleagues with similar views. And so we hear once again, in a new key, the old liberal song: protect us from power (or at least, protect us from some kinds of power). Protect us from the tyranny of suburban life, protect us from the big corporation and its invisible power, protect us from unemployment and the recurrence of economic depressions, protect us from the hypocritical morality of the levitical small town (be it Avila or Levittown), protect us from the conformism dictated by a single commandment : Love That System (Title of a chapter of the book by W. H. Whyte, “The Organization Man.»). In one word, after the intoxication of technical power, after knowing that we have more power than any of the men of the 18th century, we have started to doubt whether we really have more freedom. Ill 1. I think I should now pick up some of the loose threads I have been dropping in the last few pages, to relate them to the problems nearest to my own countrymen. Far be it from me to pretend that I have any dogmatic solution. All I will do is to show how the most abstract generalities can be related to a concrete reality. It is not possible to establish a priori some axiological preference for one of the two ways previously outlined: that of freedom by way of the inwardness of man, or that of freedom by way of the increase in technological power over reality. A priori, we should regard them as two equally necessary ways. The history of Spanish society, from the days of the Indolent Austrians has been deficient in both. A great deal has been said about social and human problems connected with technical backwardness or to be more exact, connected with the slow progress of social propagation of innovation. No less painful in the experience of interhuman relations is the problem of the social consequences of a poor moral inwardness. After the failure of the social acceptance 93 [pageend95]of the Erasmic attitude (a historical example which is almost an axiom) we hardly have, until the Generation of 98 and Ortega, moralists capable of enriching our human condition by means of the continuous assimilation of our vital experience. The case of Miguel de Molinos is hardly an exception, given his psychological condition, and his few followers in the peninsula. As for the Generation of 98, an excellent generation of moralists and assimilators it seems to me unnecessary to emphasize that they emerge in a very late period of our social history, when other and very grave technical problems were already demanding urgent attention. Their teachings, if they were to be presented at the socially opportune moment, should have been contemporary with those of the great French moralists. 2. No one can doubt that the tendency towards the annihilation of our problems (the technical ones at least) will continue to progress, by means of the accumulation of power. Not only scientists, as privileged beings, but certain social institutions, and the social groups connected with them, will continue to accumulate power. That this increase in power will mean, pari passu, an increase in liberty and in human quality, no one would dare to suggest. The bridges that will lead directly from macrosociology to ethics are not well defined yet. In a society where vast zones of the population are still deprived of power of any kind, there is still a lot of subjective appeal in the old saying: given the slow process or impossibility of transforming materially the world, let us put into operation a system of protection. From this point of view it is a case of defending the human being against a series of alienating powers. The ideal quite common in Spain seems to consist in the creation of a perfectly paternal entrepreneurial class. Industries which reduce their profit in order to distribute it among the workers, enterprises with housing estates, first aid posts, creches, collective film shows and charity shows. Without denying the 94 [pageend96]real and temporal value of all this, as a solution in toto it seems to me a solution typical of an economically and intellectually poor society. If social progress goes pari passu with that of the division and specialization of labour, the prime functions of the industrial enterprise should be three—to produce, capitalize and innovate—and they should not be confused with functions of another nature. It is not the specific function of the firm or industry to "protect” throughout his life the worker and his family against the anonymous tensions within the whole social system. From the anthropological point of view, the panorama of a human being who goes into an industry at fifteen, to remain in it till he is sixty, marries a works colleague, houses his children in a company dwelling, eats in the works canteen, and goes on holiday by the company bus to a beach which has been hired for the occasion for the benefit of the works personnel, is not a very seductive human perspective. Personal security, or defense against alienating powers has then been bought too dearly. It will be said that I have quoted an extreme example. The same could be argued about other kinds of paternalism such as housing estates for the workers; schools for the workers’ children; homes for "workers’ orphans”; and even special trains for the workers. A whole sector of society is thus perpetuated in a marginal status. The problem of freedom and organization is then placed at an ethically and socially inferior level. It appears as the problem of the (so-called) protection of some groups against their own intellectual and social inferiority. That kind of protection, given by those who have power, to those who lack it, can be crystallized into two possible results. If a legal democratic order is in existence and is effective, it leads to a situation of “all equal but separate”. In the absence of such a legal order, to a' situation of complete alienation. In the first case, the problem of social groups relatively impoverished by the very dynamic of economic development merely has in the paternalistic solutions, temporary solutions. Or in other words, all paternalistic solutions are temporary and emergency ones. What in fact 95 [pageend97]is really important is to comply in the social reality with the ideals already implicit in theory in the legal framework. The problem of marginal social groups is found as that of collective achievement, outside, as well as in the factory, of a social order where there shall be citizen-workers, citizenentrepreneurs, citizen-teachers. A social organization where one man gains his living at a machine, another at a blackboard, another with books, and in which human beings do not repel each other or refuse to live together. The situation symbolized by the expression "equal but separated” would then be substituted by a new situation of total citizenship, to which Rousseau’s dictum "we start to be men when we have been citizens” is highly relevant. Global society would in such a hypothesis stop being alien to itself, and man would then be faced only with the alienations of other origins. The alienations derived from the technical structure of urban and industrial life, in which technical objects appear to arise to dominate the human being itself. That is to say, social and political institutions in the global social order would not then be fundamentally alienating. Only certain kinds of social relations would be so. The idiocy of this or that press or TV station, or the impotence of ten thousand motorists caged in their cars on the roads leading to the capital on a Sunday afternoon. A dogmatic marxist will deny this, dichotomy, between let us say, macroalienations (economico-political) and microalienations (frivolous); but all social situations are very complex and admit, I believe, more than one analysis and more than one solution. The possibility that the global social order might be relatively satisfactory, so that a majority of human beings affected by it found that their belonging to that community granted them factual resources and spiritual stability to fight against the microalienations of another order, appears to me to be a possibility which should not be undervalued. If we think of the sterile suffering derived from the alienations added up (the alienations originated in the whole of a macrostructure plus those arising from relations between dehumanized individuals) we shall see that it would be no 96 [pageend98]small matter to be able to abtain from the practical and moral resources resulting from the insertion of man in a just community, the counterweight to the network of powers which have escaped from human control. To bring this equilibrium to life would imply also to achieve such a level of historical development that the problems would, fortunately, appear once again, as technical ones. Very different is the case of a social situation symbolized by the expression "unequal and separated”. This is the situation in which the alienations are added up. All the multiplicity of small alienating powers is reinforced by the great economic-social alienation. And all the rain of technical objects carrying small amounts of power are unable to humanize the individual. I think it is difficult for an intellectually honest thinker to deny that in this case the theme Organization and Freedom is more accurately stated as the theme Alienation and Power. Translated hy Richard Goddard 97 [pageend99]ANNA HATHERLY THE LABYRINTH « Quelle difference y a-t-il entre un boiteux et un esprit boiteux ? C’est que le boiteux voit que vous allez droit, alors que ľ esprit boiteux dit que c’est vous qui boite. » At a given moment in my life, when I was reading practically every day Pascal’s "Thoughts”, this one, transcribed above, appeared to me as the most anguishing, as one which revealed most deeply the difficulties of communication between one being and another, their internal discord and the absurdity and fragility of individual truth as the cause and effect of an irreconcilable disparity. Because so few of use are ready to admit our own limitations, an exchange of ideas, feelings, or views is oft-times impossible or, when possible, wholly unprofitable. We tend to regard our opinions as unshakable concepts, and cling to them as we would cling to a rock, identifying our opinions and concepts, and eventually ourselves, with it, thus becoming as immovable as it appears to be, and sometimes even transforming its shadow, into a dark hue of contempt or indifference for everyone else’s opinions and concepts. When an argument commences people often present themselves firmly sitting on the solid rock of their own convictions, and this rock may even take the form of an anchor which after being in place for so long, has acquired roots and body just as an ancient tree would, but unlike a real living thing is condemned to stop growing in depth, width or height. Another aspect to consider, and which I call the process of violating the "mystery of the self” is a lubricous taste which so many indulge in unveiling themselves and others in a 98 [pageend100]promiscuity of souls which resembles the crushing of flowers in bud or of unripe fruit, or of the slashing of the trunk of a tree just to watch the viscous sap ooze drop by drop. In this way they believe that they have uncovered something or some secret, in this way they believe that they have dismembered the Shinx and laid bare its invisible entrails. But what is more serious still is to proceed from this machination to the certitude of knowledge itself, to proceed from the frail certitude of personal deduction to the certitude of total truth. Whoever may cast a doubt over this conviction, which they carry like a loaded quiver ready to send forth a shower of poisoned darts, is immediately struck blind, deaf and crippled, in fact halt and lame in spirit. To demonstrate by all the means in our power the reason for our opposing arguments is a lost battle. It is they who are right. And the worst is that they are right; just as much as their opponents are. Why? For the simple reason that if truth can be attained by understanding and by reasoning, whoever has understanding can then be in possession of the truth, but his own truth, or the degree of truth he is able to attain, and subsequently be right on all occasions. In this way, the truth, as also "being right” becomes a personal question, a matter of opinion. How many times have we been in a situation, where it was impossible for us to make others see a truth which was perfectly visible, though only to us! Had I insisted on imposing my truth, the one whom I had tried to convince could speak of me as I have just spoken of him. Is there, then, only a personal truth? The moment the one I try to communicate with refuses to accept my truth, that truth ceases to be valid. Nevertheless it continues to be so for me and in this way I remain clinging to the rock, the anchor. One can say that this is a question of egotism for so it is, but who does not find this vital egotism confirmed at every step? Who does not discover it in himself, at times under the disguise of the most fertile altruism? On the other hand, 99 [pageend101]what would become of me and my truth if I had to change my opinion at every step? Where would I find truth? Let us imagine we are at a party and four people decide to play cards; four players are necessary for the game but one of them does not wish to take part. Therefore three of them cannot play. The fourth person then sacrifices himself and plays. Three people have their way and the fourth gives in. Where is the egotism? In the selfishness of the one person who by refusing to play is ready to sacrifice three others or in three consenting to the sacrifice of the one? If one person refusing to accede to the wish of the others in selfish, what are then three people consenting to the sacrifice of one? Which is worse ? One egotist or three ? Who is right ? Let us imagine another common situation: the lover and the loved one in a case where love is not shared by both. The one who loves persists in imposing the truth of his feelings in spite of the loved one having confessed his inability to respond. If he who loves insists on the other submitting to his wishes, he is selfish because he sacrifices the other to his will, which is also his truth, but the other who insists on the breach knowing the pain he is causing to the one who implores him, is selfish because he too is sacrificing the other to this will. One may say that love has a depth which no game of chance ever attains, nevertheless these two situations are comparable: love and a game are acts of partnership, and it is only by mutual agreement that they can be fulfilled; even if this agreement should originate or result in opposition, it is still that which is the deciding factor. So it is egotism which prevails, and each one ends up claiming to be right. Is egotism therefore a question of personal interest? Let us now examine a case in which personal interest is raised to a high degree: patriotism. What does this represent to so many people? It is being proud of one’s country, its history, its heroes, its riches, its beauties. I am proud of belonging to a country of great traditions and great men? Why? Because, 100 [pageend102]this is the background of my own greatness. I am the son of a great country, therefore I am greater than you. I am a writer, an artist, a soldier? I would like my country to produce the greatest writers, artists, soldiers: in their shadow I shall excel. Am right ? Yes, I am. If I give value to what I have, I increase my own value. Am I egoist? Yes, I am. If someone tells me I am wrong he is right. But if I tell him he is wrong. I am right. If I do convince him them my truth prevails, if I do not convince him his truth prevails. Then there exists no error but only personal feelings and opinions differing on the same subjects. But if it were thus, if there could be no certitude and if everything would only be a matter of convention, this would also apply to doubt. And so we would be led to doubt everything just as much as to believe in everything and just as much to believe in nothing as to doubt nothing. But soon someone would come along and say that we were wrong again. He would say to us: error exists and punishment is the result of it. But which error? Ours or his? And here a given pattern of justice would start to function. That which would fit into this pattern would be right and the remainder would be wrong. If we changed the pattern, the same would hold good in another way. A new form of truth given out (always a personal truth!) is another measuring system set in motion. Whoever can make is own yardstick will measure others by it. And who does not attempt to do this? Everyone tries, and that is why each one to some degree, succeds to be right. Even if this "each one” represents a whole group, it is the same, because the pressure: exercised is equally strong between one individual and another as between one group and another. On the other hand, one individual cannot on his own oppose a group. Or can he? Always the same: halt and lame. I am halt and see that you walk straight. You are halt and you see that I do not limp. I am halt and see that you do limp. You are lame and you see that I limp. I am right, you are right, we are 101 [pageend103]right. You see me walk straight, but if you want to see me lame, I am lame. I see you walk straight, but if I want to see you lame, you are lame. I may see that you are right but I shall not give in. If I have my reasons for so acting I shall still be right. And the same will happen with you. Someon? saying "You are wrong” or "I am right” is just as right as wrong. Is it not true that there is nothing more anguishing than a labyrinth? Extracted and tranlated from the Book “NINE INCURSIONS’’, essays on the theme of communication. T.S. ELIOT A NOTE ON TRANSLATION I can judge the merit of George Seferis, so to speak, from his translations of my own choruses into Greek which seem to be magnificent, and I am delighted that he should translate the whole of my play, ’’Murder in the Cathedral”. Of course, it is easier to read translations of my own work. I can follow them easily in modern Greek because I have studied Ancient Greek as a lad in America and at Oxford, and because I have been very pleased with such works as I have seen in his translations. His choral work is magnificent and I have always longed to see it—at least the choruses— put in modern Greek by a modern Greek poet of distinction, and I couldn’t ask for anyone better or more distinguished 102 [pageend104]than Seferis. I don’t know his poetry yet, only very slightly. I can, of course, read his translations of my poetry because I know the poetry so well. Of course, all my knowledge of modern Greek was gained in a commercial way. I gained it some years ago when I was working in the City of London because I wanted to be able to read company reports and the reports of the Greek Banks, and that is why I know what I do know of modern Greek. But I feel an affinity with him and I should say there must be some resemblance between the poetry... but, of course, in a way it is more difficult for an author to see his resemblances, the resemblance of his work to that of poetry writing in other languages, than it is for a third person. I have often been told that I have much in common with the genially Italian poet, Montali, and I read some of his poetry with great pleasure. But as for the resemblance ... but I think that is for an outsider to notice. I should think that as to whether Seferis was a great poet—I said somewhere long ago that a greatness is something you can’t obtain, for a contemporary that is something which is conferred or at least shown by time and a man’s reputation. What you can say about a contemporary poet is that his poetry is genuine, that it is authentic. I am convinced from reading my own choruses in his translations that his poetry is authentic, that it is a genuine poetry. Now I don’t think that a translation of poetry into every language can really convey the spirit of the poetry. It is so wedded to, it is so much in the language in which it is written that I have never seen for instance any translations of the poetry in foreign languages that I do know, for instance Goethe or Dante, or the French poets I know particularly well, which really conveyed the spirit of the original. It is so much the spirit! of the language in which it is written. In an interview with M- Phocas 103 [pageend105]ZELTITA AVOTINA DAS EXPERIMENT DES ÜBERSETZENS Das Übersetzen, das Übertragen, das Nachdichten — fürwahr ein heikles Thema, das uns Schriftsteller mit Fragen konfrontiert, vor denen es kein Entrinnen gibt, weil sie für uns im Exil ganz schlicht zu Lebensfragen geworden sind. Die Kenner der Materie werden verstehen, daß es in einer so kurzen Ausführung unmöglich ist, auch nur annähernd den gesamten Komplex, der durch das Problem des Übersetzens aufgeworfen wird, zu berühren, geschweige denn — ausführlich zu behandeln. Niemand schreibt Bücher, ohne überzeugt zu sein, daß er irgendwann früher oder später seine Leserschaft finden wird, für die zu schreiben sich lohnt. Auch der Exilschriftsteller nicht. Es wäre nun töricht und entspräche keinesfalls den Tatsachen, wollte man das Schwierige und Problematische, das einem Kunstwerk auf dem Wege von einem Volk zum andern, also von einer Sprache in die andere begegnet, nur als eine interne Angelegenheit der Exilliteratur betrachten. Genau die gleichen Schwierigkeiten hatten ja seinerzeit auch die großen literarischen Welterfolge zu überwinden ! Nur daß die Autoren einer weltweit bekannten Sprache viele Leser anderer Völker direkt ansprechen können und außerdem ungleich schneller einem Übersetzer und Verleger finden als die Schriftsteller kleinerer Nationen, deren wenig verbreitete Sprache an sich schon eine Begrenzung der Möglichkeiten darstellt. Das Besondere, das Tragische an der Situation des Exilschriftstellers spannt sich im weitesten Bogen von der völligen Isolation im fremden Sprachraum bis zum Versuch eines Einbruches in 104 [pageend106]eben diesen, anfangs gewiß als feindlich empfundenen, fremden Sprachraum. Gewiß gibt es Autoren, denen die Sprache der Wahlheimat vertraut genug wäre, um die eigenen Werke fehlerfrei und flüssig zu übersetzen. Allein diese wenigen, die sich eine ihnen fremde Sprache bis ins Detail erobert haben, sie also weder als fremd noch als störend empfinden, umgehen die Schwierigkeiten des Übersetzens, indem sie ihre Werke nun direkt in der anderen Sprache verfassen. Dieser tatsächlich bestehende Fall der Doppelsprachigkeit im Schaffen eines Schriftstellers ist zur Zeit noch selten anzutreffen, könnte aber schon in der kommenden Generation zum akuten und ernsten Problem für die diversen nationalen Exilgruppen werden, freilich zu Ungunsten der Nationalliteratur kleinerer Völker. Vorläufig ist der Exilschriftsteller in der Regel auf die Hilfe eines Übersetzers angewiesen, wenn er aus seiner sprachlich bedingten Anonymität ausbrechen möchte. Sofern es sich nicht um einen kongenialen Übersetzer handelt, der in der Lage ist, Nuancen der Sprache im Urtext wahrzunehmen und diese dann sehr durchdacht und zum wirksamen Leben erweckt in der fremden Sprache wiederzugeben, ist und bleibt das Übersetzen ein Experiment, waghalsig und mit höchst ungewissem Ausgang ! Leider gibt es nur sehr wenige gute Übersetzer, die mit Verantwortung und Gefühl für das Wort und für den Stil das Spiegelbild eines Werkes in einer anderen Sprache nachzeichnen können, und zwar so, daß es zum ungetrübten Genuß für den Leser des anderen Volkes wird. Nur auf dieses Spiegelbild, wahrlich einzig und allein darauf kommt es an, wie die Welt das Werk und dessen Autor sieht und beurteilt. Daß es allzu oft nur ein Zerrbild ist, was wir den Lesern unseres Gastlandes vorlegen, liegt an dem mangelnden Können dieses oder jenes Übersetzers, der sich etwas zugemutet hat, wofür wohl sein guter Wille, aber keineswegs seine Fähigkeiten ausgereicht haben. Nicht jeder, der einer fremden Sprache kundig ist, ist zugleich auch ein guter Übersetzer ! Die per105 [pageend107]fekt angewandten Regeln der Rechtschreibung besagen noch gar nichts über den literarischen Wert der Übersetzung. Nicht jeder Philologe ist auch gleichzeitig ein guter Literat. Und umgekehrt ! Dabei spielt die Prominenz des Übersetzers nicht die geringste Rolle. Leser der westdeutschen Wochenzeitung «Die Zeit» werden sich gewiß noch an die Übersetzungen anläßlich des Jevtuschenko- Besuches erinnern. Vier Prominente hatten zum Beispiel das Jevtuschenko-Gedicht «Babij Jar» übersetzt, beziehungsweise nachgedichtet. Das Resultat war für einen Leser, der keine Silbe russisch versteht, zumindest verwirrend. Diese vier Variationen zeigten ganz klar, mit welchen Hürden der Übersetzer einer ihm nicht ganz geläufigen Sprache zu rechnen hat. An noch eine Binsenwahrheit im Zusammenhang mit dem Übersetzen sei hier erinnert : nicht jeder Übersetzer ist in der Lage, jeden Autor zu übersetzen. Wer sich aber stark genug fühlt, das Wagnis einer Übersetzung einzugehen, sollte stets daran denken, daß es in 'jedem Falle eine Sache der Repräsentation ist. Im höchsten Maße verhängnisvoll ist die oft gehörte, dennoch überaus irrige Ansicht — «lieber eine schlechte als gar keine Übersetzung » ! Nein, denn durch eine fehlerhafte Übersetzung — sei es nun eine Anthologie oder das Werk eines Autors — kann ein Prestigeschaden entstehen, unter dessen Auswirkungen die gesamte betreffende Exilgruppe zu leiden hat. Vielleicht sollten die Verantwortlichen der nationalen Exilgruppen bei der Kostenfrage und Vorbereitung besonders einer als Präsent gedachten Ausgabe vorher darüber nachdenken, wie wichtig der gute Eindruck eines Buches ist, das wir unseren Freunden einer anderen Volkszugehörigkeit überreichen wollen. Was also wäre zu tun, um solche « faux pas» weitgehend zu verhindern ? Zunächst sollte man mit größter Behutsamkeit an die Auswahl der Themen gehen. Alles betont Patriotische, im spezifischen Volksgut Basierende kann für 106 [pageend108]den Übersetzer, der mit der anderen Sprache nur wenig Erfahrung gehabt hat, zur unüberwindbaren Hürde werden. Was zum Beispiel ein Ungar, Lette oder Spanier mit seinem Herzblut geschrieben hat, kann im englichen Leser einfach keinerlei Resonanz finden, wenn die Übersetzung nicht der englischen Mentalität angepasst gelungen ist. Man muß schon sehr, sehr viel Sprachgefühl aufweisen, will man das einem Volk Ureigene, vielleicht sogar Sakrale, in die gänzlich differente Vorstellungswelt eines anderen Volkes übertragen. Um zu verhindern, dass das Experiment des Übersetzens zum gedankenlosen Gebrauch der Sprache wird, also mit Gewähr fehlschlagen muß, wäre es vielleicht angebracht, in der jetzigen Situation des Exilschriftstellers nach neuen Wegen und anderen Formen für diese Art Arbeit zu suchen. Vielleicht sollte man, um die Unzulänglichkeiten eines Einzelnen auszuschalten, es doch einmal bei den Übersetzungen mit einer Art «Team-work» versuchen ? Es ist lediglich ein Vorschlag, der noch seiner praktischen Erprobung bedarf, aber — warum sollte man den Versuch nicht riskieren ? Wenn mehrere Übersetzer — jeder stark in seiner Sparte ! — sich in der Arbeit aufeinander eingespielt haben, etwa nach dem Prinzip «vier Augen sehen mehr als zwei», dann müßte das Resultat eigentlich den Anspruch auf Vollkommenheit erheben können. Selbst die menschliche Unzulänglichkeit des Teams einberechnet, müßte das Endergebnis der Arbeit eines kongenialen Übersetzers gleichgestellt werden können. 107 [pageend109]Brigadier R.J.C. BROADHURST THE TRANSLATOR’S TASK I am very conscious of the fact that the translator’s art is interpretative rather than creative. The imaginative effort, the wordly experience, the insight into character, the organizing ability of the original composer are not his, nor, I suppose, are his agonies and ecstasies. The translator’s art is, in a sense, rather like that of the musical accompanist, by its nature self-effacing and so concealing the considerable effort of training behind it. For the good translator must be accurate and faithful to the original. He must have a wide vocabulary in his own language as well as a tolerable command of its syntax and style. He must have a complete mastery of the tongue to be translated, and if it is a learned and scholarly work that he is translating he must be erudite and well able to recognise and understand literary, religious and other allusions and the use of appropriate concordances and similar works of reference. He must have integrity, taste and intuition and be possessed of infinite patience to search for the true meaning and significance of every word, every nuance of the original, and then to find les mots justes, the exactly appropriate sentiments, to express them in English. I can well understand why Cicero and Quintillian recommended the practice of translation as essential to the formation of a good writer and an accomplished orator. And certainly the need for the translator has now, since the survival of our world depends in great measure upon free intellectual and artistic communication, become very great. In the past, a few intellectuals learnt something of 108 [pageend110]Russian thought processes, by reading Constance Garnett’s translations of Tchekov and Turgeniev, the Maudes’ Tolstoy and the Muirs’ Kafka. Far more is needed to-day. And here let me distinguish between what I think are the three main types of translation. (Of course I am talking of book translations, not short informative notices used by advertisers or for travellers. « Messieurs les passagers sont pries de verifier lews bagages avant de quitter ľaérogare » —such statements are simple, unemotional and factual with no delicate or involved associations and are easily rendered with exactness into German, French, English, Italian, Spanish and so on.) 1. Translations of contemporary novels and poetry. 2. Translations of modern scientific, technical and practical matters. 3. Translations of the literature of Greece and Rome and the ancient world of Arabia, Persia, China and such lands. In each the procedures of translation are very different. For the first, generally speaking, the translation can be very free. The reader wants the story, sheer entertainment, and is careless of the niceties of the original language and literature. The translator can paraphrase, omit passages he finds obscure, and generally treat the original with great licence so long as he entertains the new reader. Lolita, and the Decameron are read in English versions by undergraduates and older self-constituted guardians of public morals for reasons other than intellectual and academic. Translators have rarely wasted their, time in seeking a faithful rendering of the original, and most modern translations are of this kind. The second category, the translation of scientific and technical matter is very different. Here absolute precision is the sine qua non. Here the translator must not only be in complete command of the languages. He must also have full knowledge of the technique and terminology of the science he is writing about. 109 [pageend111]Such a translator need not concern himself with style. The matter wholly transcends the manner—the extreme opposite, for example of a Horatian lyric where the manner transcends the matter. This is not to say that a scientist will not derive pleasure from such a work, but it is of a different genre from the delight of reading Keats or Shelley. He enjoys and profits from concise and lucid exposition and that is all he wants. He does not demand that any literary elegancies of the original should be conveyed to him. Indeed, he will be grateful if the translator cuts them out. He is not a connoisseur of literature, although he will bless the translator if he improves on the appalling jargon so prevalent in much scientific writing to-day. Here is a rare case where the translator may legitimately ignore the dictum of Dr. Johnson when he said : “A translator is to be like his author: it is not his business to excel him.” Dr. Johnson had never read a modern technical treatise. The third category, the translation of classical and oriental literature is the field of scholarly translation. Here the reader wishes to have conveyed to him all the precision of the scientific translation together with the aesthetic properties of a work of literature. He wants to know exactly what Aristotle and his peers have said, with all their inflexions of meaning and within the context of their ancient, unfamiliar, but highly specialized civilizations. Such translations are accompanied by a complicated critical apparatus, with copious notes and commentaries. The translators must be steeped in the thought, culture and literature of the race and period they are dealing with. And their work is done according to strict canons of classical and oriental scholarship, canons established over years since the Elizabethan era in the universities of the West. It is in that field that, alas, falling far short of the best standards, I have laboured. What are these canons or principles of scholarly translation? They have not been formally tabulated but they are tolerably well understood. 110 [pageend112]1. The rendering of the exact sense and meaning of the original is paramount. 2. The translation should be as literal as possible, abiding, so far as syntax, accidence, and grammar will allow, to the words and arrangement of the original. For the reader wishes to be as close as possible to the words of, say, Ibn Jubayr, the Arab traveller, rather than what R.J.C. Broadhurst thinks he ought to have written. "My chief boast”, said William Cowper of his translation of Homer, "is that I have adhered closely to the original.” Pope did not, and in consequence merited the comment: “It is a pretty poem, Mr. Pope, but you must not call it Homer.” 3. So far as possible, the spirit and style of the original should be captured. The reader must be allowed to feel the peculiar flavqur of the work. 4. At the same time, the reader must feel, as he reads, the freshness of the original composition. It must not read like a translation. It should read as easily and pleasurably as the original. Without introducing archaims: peradventures, quothas, forsooths and so on, a translation should certainly have no modernisms, and should read, by reason of a certain direct and austere simplicity, and if possible a certain stateliness, as a contemporary of the original classic. Fowler quotes Esmond and Treasure Island as admirable examples of works that, while eschewing archaims, yet, by reason of a certain direct simplicity and avoidance of all modern associations, achieve a feeling of period. In Black Arrow. Stevenson turned to the use of reach-me-down archaisms with vicious results. "Sirrah, no more words”, said Dick, "Bend me your back.” 5. A translation must on no account add to or omit from the original. These principles are, of course, guiding lines rather than rules, for anything connected with literature is an art rather than a science, and all the practitioners do not agree. Ill [pageend113]I have mentioned Dr. Johnson’s admonition to translators not to attempt to excel the original author. There is, however, one supreme example in great literature where the translation is an improvement on the original, and that is the King James I Authorized Version of the Bible. A distinguished foreign critic once said that "the English Bible in the Standard Version is a finer and nobler literature than the scriptures in their original tongues.” Am I wrong in believing that the Bible means more to us than to foreigners? Is it not most likely that the spiritual pre-eminence of the Bible in the hearts of the English speaking race has been assured by the particular majesty of the Authorised Version ? In French, reputedly the most expressive of languages, the versions, compared with the noble simplicity of the English, are merely dapper. "Thy rod and thy staff” become « ton baton ». "Behold next, Behemoth”—« voici ľhippopotame ». "I am black but comely”—« Je suis brunette mais blonde ». The grave and penetrating music, the unstudied grace of the King James version have an ecstasy which is no small part of that version’s influence and source of power. It falls upon the ears with what seems the ordained voice of moral and religious inspiration— "Jewels five words long That on the stretched forefinger of all time Sparkle for ever...” "Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavily laden and I will give you rest” "I was a stranger, and ye took me in; Naked and ye clothed me; I was sick and ye visited me; I was in prison and ye came unto me.” “From lightning and tempest, from plague and pestilence and famine, from battle and murder and from sudden death, good Lord deliver us...” “To-day thou shalt be with me in Paradise.” “Lighten our darkness we beseech thee, o Lord, and by Thy 112 [pageend114]great mercy defend us from all perils and dangers of this night.” The wonder of this language goes straight to the heart. The translators took the Old and New Testaments, "the lively Oracles of God”, and enshrined them in the noblest language men could ever find to fit them. The result was the all-surpassing masterpiece of English literature, a book “which”, Macaulay said, “if everything else in our language should perish, would alone suffice to show the whole extent of it’s beauty and power.” It is, for us, the Book of Books. That is the measure of our indebtedness to those Tudor translators. Before I leave the Bible, might I suggest that, in future, you take note that the translators did not substitute the philosophical or abstract language for the Hebrew use of concrete words in a figurative sense. The Hebrews had no philosophical vocabulary. Also note the preservation of the Hebrew principle of parallelism, of strengthening a statement by repetition, by supplement, or by antithesis, e.g. "Wash me throughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.” "A wise son maketh a glad father, but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.” Another great work where the translator improved on the original is Edward Fitzgerald’s famous rendering of the rubaiyat (quatrains) of Omar Khayyam, the twelfth century Persian poet, astronomer, and mathematician. Omar is celebrated in the East for his standard work on Algebra. Eastern people and orientalists are astonished at the West’s devotion to what they consider to be a very inferior poet. But it is Fitzgerald’s exquisite beauty of phrase and grace of melody which captivates the Western reader, although, of course, his inspiration and his matter came from Omar. He made selections and combinations from the original stanzas. In other words, Fitzgerald’s Omar Khayyam is really an original poem, and as such one of the masterpieces of English poetry. 113 [pageend115]THOMAS KABDEBO TRANSLATING TO PROVE THAT CLASSICS ARE CLASSICS « É un jatto ehe va osservato : dopo un cerlo silenzio, ci si propone di scrivere non una poesia ma delle poesie. » (Pavese) What is lost in the process of translating is relatively unimportant, what is retained from the beauty of the original: counts. To believe in Goethe’s dictum is folly, blindness — to doubt it: is lack of faith. At its highest, a translation comes into being as a work of original literature : (or so they say) a man experiences something — in this case a foreign text — which he has yet to find words for if he is to have any peace. «Words, was it their colours ?... Or was it that, beging as weak of sight as he was shy of mind, he drew less pleasure from the reflection of the glowing sensible world through the prism of a language manycoloured and richly storied than from the contemplation of an inner world of individual emotions mirrored perfectly in a lucid supple periodic prose.» Yes, even Joyce is translatable, even Finnegan’s Wake — provided one finds words emotionally, intellectually equivalent and built into a flexible syntax which is however, poetic. And syntax is poetic when grammatically equivalent constituents in connected speech are juxtaposed by coordination or parataxis, or are otherwise prominently accumulated. Paraphrasing notable translators, we must agree : there is no completely exact translation. There are only approxi114 [pageend116]mations, and the degree of similarity possible between original and translation depends on the degree of similarity between the systems of form and meaning in the two languages involved. The more serious the deviations from one language to the other, the less of the original can be salvaged in the process of transfer. Still, the language problem is only half of the problem. Jean Paris tells of a certain Pierre Ménard, a hero in one of J.L. Borges’ short stories. He is the ideal translator. Not only is he mad enough to devote his whole life to a single book, Don Quijote, but this work he painfully tries to rewrite in Spanish, with the very same words, sentences and order as in Cervantes. In the same way, the same writer relates the drama of a geographer obsessed by an ever increasing need for precision, who draws larger and larger maps until finally they become as great as the country itself and cover it entirely. The way out is to reconceive, recreate — if there is a way out at all. Consider the famous example : Über allen Gipfeln ist Ruh, in allen Wipfeln spürest du kaum einen Hauch. Die Vögelein schweigen im Walde Warte nur : balde ruhest du auch. Lermontov’s version : Gornye versiny Spjat vo ťme nochnoj ; Tixie doliny Polny svezej mgloj ; Ne pylit doroga, Ne drozat listy Podozhdi nemnovo Otdoxneschch i ty. 115 [pageend117]Now render Lermontov’s version into English and see how far it is from the original and yet it stands in its own right as a delicate Russian poem. For a Russian ear it may sound better than the German original. You, gentle reader may not believe it, but Midsummer Night’s dream is more poetic in Hungarian than it is in English. This is of course not to say that the translator János Arany was a greater poet than Shakespeare but an honest Hungarian ear is tuned to nineteenth century poetry much more than to Elizabethan verse. But this ought to be true, vice-versa. Consider an exact English translation of Inferno V, 28-31. Io venni in luogo d’ogni luce muto ehe mugghia come fa mar per tempesta, se da contrari venti ě combattuto. I came into a place of all light dumb That bellows like a storm in the sea-deep When the thwart winds that strike it roar and hum. Do you experience how much better it sounds in English? When casting aside snobism, you ■— English reader — must admit, that even if you spoke Italian the English Dante would come more natural to you. Only it will be outdated in fifty years, whereas the original... The original is timeless, and even if you crucify yourself your translation wil be dated. Translations therefore, are to be introduced to a particular contemporary society, introduced and reintroduced again and again. It was exactly ten years ago that Arthur Koestler tried to introduce József Attila, a Hungarian classic by all standards. Cunning is needed to launch a poet in a foreign country. Behold the recipe: 1. declare: «Attila József is posthumously regarded as the greatest poet the nation has produced. » 2. Translate a few poems to prove it. 3. Relate a memorable episode, it may be legendary, in his life. 116 [pageend118]Translation in itself is not enogh, the ground has to be prepared for the seed. A banko robban, fillér a szilánkja... The five pound note is a bomb Pennies are shrapnells... The whole poem, if well translated, may be an explosion ; splinters may penetrate into the thick English consciousness, but only now, after the war, the beat generation, saloon socialism. Consider : Hogyha nem kell senkinek, tán az ördög veszi meg... Perhaps if no one else will the buyer will be the devil. What will be bought ? The poet’s life, of course. Whose life ? The life of the whole young generation. Does it matter when ? In Hungary, any time after the first world war. In England, only now, after the bomb, when illusions of everlasting security have been shattered. So the ground is prepared for a new classic. 117 [pageend119]FRANZ KENEDI DIE KLAGEN EINES ÜBERSETZERS Es ist schwer, ein literarischer Übersetzer zu sein — besonders in Israel. Ist der Roman gut, dann ist es noch nicht so schlimm. Die Leute sprechen uns auf der Strasse an und sagen : — Der Schriftsteller ist zwar hervorragend, Sie aber, Sie haben alles verdorben und verdreht, den wahren Geist des Werkes verfälscht, mit einem Wort, Sie sind kein Übersetzer sondern höchstens ein Versetzer. Das ist schon ein Messerstich ins Herz, aber man kann das noch ertragen. Die Lage ist viel ärger, wenn das Original tatsächlich nicht auf der Höhe ist. Dann sind wir an allen unmöglichen Greueltaten des Schriftstellers schuld und für das Elend der Leser verantwortlich. Man kommt und sagt uns ins Gesicht: — Mein Herr, im fünften Kapitel Ihres Romanes frisst X. Salami mit Butter. Das ist nicht nur unverschämt sondern auch verboten. Sie vergessen, dass wir hier im Heiligen Land leben, wo die religiösen Parteien eine bedeutende Rolle spielen. Warum diese Gotteslästerung ? So lädt man uns die Verantwortung für das « verlorene Paradies » eines Unbekannten auf. Die Nachbarin sitzt neben mir im Bus und flüstert mir zimperlich ins Ohr : — Ich bin Ihre Verehrerin, aber dieser fürchterliche erotische Teil des Verhandlungsprotokolls sollte nicht in allen Einzelheiten zitiert sein. Meine Töchter sind noch sehr jung, ich passe auf, Sie aber, Sie richten ihre Moral zugrunde ! 118 [pageend120]Ich stottere : —Was kann ich dafür, dass das New Yorker Schwurgericht nicht in geschlossener Kammer verhandelt hat ? Übrigens hat der Täter sein Verbrechen mit seinem Leben bezahlt, und das ist die Lehre, die wichtig ist. Vergebens, ich kann die Dame nicht überzeugen. Da kommt der tüchtige Geschäftsmann und sagt: —- Bitte, Sie (es ist immer nur ich !) sprechen seitenlang über ein Vermögen, Aktien, Devisen, die in den Geldschränken vornehmer Banken versteckt sind. Ein Mensch wie ich ist an- solchen Dingen stark interessiert. Ich las Ihren ganzen Roman, nur um zu erfahren, was mit dem Geld geschehen ist. Sie haben mich jedoch enttäuscht und sind mir die Aufklärung schuldig geblieben. Sagen Sie mir im Vertrauen, was mit dem Gelde geschah. Wer hat es bekommen ? Ich bin völlig verwirrt: — Mein Herr, ich versichere es Ihnen, dass ich selbst das Geld nicht erhalten habe. Vielleicht wurde es auf ein Sperrkonto übertragen. Des Ästhet versperrt mir auf der Strasse den Weg : — Hör zu —- sagt er — da ist etwas nicht in Ordnung. In der Mitte verschwindet die Hauptfigur. Sowas gibt es nicht. Von Sophokles bis Ibsen gilt das ungeschriebene Gesetz, dass der Held nicht spurlos verschwinden darf. Sonst wäre alles zu einfach. Ich bin auf Shakespeare und Thomas Mann erzogen worden, solche naive Lösungen muss ich zurückweisen. Mein Freund, nächstens sieh dem Schriftsteller auf die Finger. Ich musste ihm versprechen, den Schriftsteller das nächste Mal auf die Gesetze der Romanschreibung aufmerksam zu machen, denn die Sputniks dürfen zwar die Ordnung der Sterne stören, aber die Regeln der Schreibkunst sind untastbar und ewig. 119 [pageend121]Ich stehe im sogenannten literarischen Espresso an der Bar und trinke meinen wohlverdienten Kaffee. Eine sehr sympathische Dame, die einmal als Journalistin tätig war, spricht mich an : —- Entschuldigen Sie, aber der Roman geht in der zweiten Hälfte auffallend bergab. Ihre Frage nach dem Namen des Autors rettet mich. Ich habe ihr auch seine Adresse gegeben. Aus allen diesen Unannehmlichkeiten könnte man folgern, dass unsere Arbeit für uns nur Qual bedeutet. Nein. Es gibt doch Momente, die uns für alles entschädigen. Ein guter Freund erzählte mir, dass er, als er in Bné Brak eine kleine Strasse entlang ging, einen Passanten seinem Bekannten auf der anderen Strassenseite zurufen hörte : —■ Wissen Sie, was geschah ? Haben Sie es schon gelesen ? —- Nein. — Man hat den alten Grossmann mit Gewalt ins Irrenhaus eingeliefert ! In jenen Wochen lief der Roman von Scholem Asch, Grossmann & Grossmann, in täglichen Fortsetzungen in der Zeitung. In diesem herrlichen Buch kommt die zitierte Szene vor. Das sind Momente, wenn der Übersetzer Wärme in seinem geplagten Herzen fühlt. Er hat doch nicht umsonst gearbeitet. 120 [pageend122]OWEN BARFIELD THE RIDDLE OF THE SPHINX When the man said THAT IS SUBLIME, he appeared to he making a remark about the waterfall... Actually he was not making a remark aho'ut the waterfall, but a remark about his own feelings. These words appeared in an English Literature textbook for schools, published about a quarter of century ago, and when the late C.S. Lewis delivered his Riddell Lectures on The Abolition of Man, his text was that schoolbook and his theme the argument, that to treat all values as subjective entails in the end abolishing all values. The view that poetry and literature in general, whatever they purport to refer to, are in fact referring solely to the author’s feelings first began to gain general acceptance in English literary circles with the publication of LA. Richard’s Principles of Literary Criticism in 1925. I am not at the moment concerned to argue against this doctrine, but simply to point out that its emergence coincided roughly with an attempt being made elsewhere to exclude what is called «metaphysics» from the realm of scientific theory. The arguments for and against both positions are not dissimilar. Thus, if Richards’ opponents have since pointed out that unfortunately the « emotive >> power of a poetic statement depends precisely on our interpreting it as an objective reference to something other than emotion itself, we have also heard Karl Popper objecting, in his Logic of Scientific Discovery, that scientific laws cannot be reducet to elementary statements of experience and 121 [pageend123]that positivists, in their anxiety to annihilate metaphysics, unfortunately annihilate natural science itself along with it. Owing to the predominantly figurative nature of the language of poetry, by way of metaphor and symbol, «the truest poets are the most feigning.» Richards’s problem was to satisfy himself and his readers that poetry is valuable, even within the framework of a behaviourist philosophy, in spite of the fact that most of the statements it contains are manifestly untrue. But this could not be done without raising, and not only for poetry, the whole issue of the multiple significance of figurative language. A metaphor, for instance, considered semantically, is not one statement but at least two. It is a « vehicle» (the literal meaning - usually untrue) containing a «tenor» (the metaphorical meaning). What, if anything, does the tenor affirm ? What is it about ? Is it in any sense veridical ? Such are the questions which have exercised a good many minds over the last fifty years. But so also has a very similar question in the domain of science. With the collapse of the imaginal «models», on which classical physics largely relied, and the apparent disappearance of any ultimate atomic particle there has arisen, as a live issue, the question : what are physical theories (as distinct from singular predictions) about, or what, if anything, may be said to affirm ? For the sub- microscopic realm to which they must increasingly be applied is no more accessible to the senses and the understanding based on them than is the tenor, as distinct from the vehicle, of a linguistic metaphor. To enquire however into the nature of figurative language is to enquire into the nature of language itself ; that is to say, into the primary instrument of expression, information and communication. For the pons asinorum of etymology is the discovery that the meaning of virtually every word we use can be traced back to a time when it had a metaphorical or at all events a figurative significance. The precise relation between vehicle and tenor in the case of such 122 [pageend124]a word as, pneuma at the time when it meant both « wind » and «spirit» may be, and frequently is, disputed ; but the fact that it was a vehicle with a tenor remains beyond question. Words themselves in fact are symbols — a term on which attention, both historical and epistemological, has long been focussed with about equal intensity from the three directions of literature, philosophy and science. The answer to the question about the origin and growth of meaning which was given during the period when classical physics reigned undisputed is very similar to the way in which classical physics answered its own question about the nature and constitution of the material universe. Language was assumed to have commenced with a number of « literal » words, each having a single objective reference, whose meanings were later developed and extended subjectively by combination and metaphorical application, until they produced the infinitely delicate and varied cosmos presented by almost any modern civilised literary language. Similarly the physical cosmos was assumed to be founded and built up from a number of identifiable atoms, electrons, elementary particles — no matter what, but stable entities of one kind or another. Moreover all objectivity was deemed to depend on the existence of these stable entities. For classical physics had already succeeded in transferring from the objective to the subjective domain all else of which the external world appears to consist — its beauty, ugliness, colours, shapes, sounds, even its very solidity. My purpose is to suggest that the recent outcry about a divergence between two cultures is largely misconceived, and that the various educational reforms proposed as remedies will remain inadequate as long as they continue to be based on the very assumptions that have brought about the real disease. The culture of the West is not two parallel lines but a single twisted skein. The physicist’s conclusion that qualities are subjective was not a scientific happening only. It led to the treatment of values (ex123 [pageend125]pressed, because the symbolical nature of language compels it, in terms of qualities) as correspondingly subjective. Behaviourism, begotten by nineteenth century science on twentieth century philosophy, impinged effectively, as we have seen, on literary criticism and, through that, on the education of the young in literature and the humanities. Among the intelligentsia the progressive elimination of values from literature has already progressed a good deal further in the manner foretold. It has, for instance, become the rule that nothing whatever may be condemned, and that the « values » of a Marquis de Sade or of a Genet are entitled to as respectful a hearing as those of a Socrates or a St. Francis of Assisi. Possibly this is an exaggeration, but a Londoner, with his monotonous week-end diet, may be pardoned for forgetting that there are places in Europe where literary critics are still permitted to denounce inhumanity simply because it is unhuman. The author of the Abolition of Man did not base his argument on Christianity or even on Theism. What he detected as fatal was, not the disappearance of God, but the disappearance of «the doctrine of objective values». It is a doctrine that has been given many different names — in the West it once took, among others, the form of a « natural law» presumed to be innate in man and nature alike. If it was lex naturae, the law of nature, it was at the same time jus gentium, the law of nations, because also of human nature itself. This same natural law was to have formed the basis of the positive international law which Grotius was already hoping, and we have still failed, to establish. Instead, the whole doctrine of objective values, and with it the concept of a stable and objective humanity, was analysed away during the period now closing, in favour of that other doctrine of objective stable entities, particulate in nature and literal in language. But these were conceived to be objective precisely because they were conceived to be non-human. What we have since been witnessing is the analysing away of the stable entities themselves ; the researches of 124 [pageend126]Cassirer and others into the origin and growth of language destroying the prevalent notion that there was once a literal language with exclusively objective (nonhuman) reference, as surely as the cloud-chambers of microphysics destroy the prevalent notion of stable material particles. The disappearance of the presumed solid ground, whereon rested both the cosmology of the nineteenth century and the doctrine of subjective values to which it gave rise in the twentieth, is also not a scientific happening only. It at once compels and makes easier the reexamination of some other assumptions that have long prevailed in the realms of literature and science alike. To give one example : while physics has concluded that all that is qualitative in nature is subjective (that is, mental), other sciences such as geology and biology, accepting that conclusion, have nevertheless remained content to continue postulating on a pre-historic earth the evolution of forms of animal and plant life identifiable only by the very qualities with which no mind as yet existed to endow them. We should now be able to see that, if the physicist is right in treating quality as «merely» human, it must follow that historical research from within into the origin and growth of language is at least not less relevant to any valid theory of natural evolution, including the origin and descent of homo sapiens, than the exclusively external approaches of contemporary biology and geology. After all, either qualities are purely subjective manifestations or they are not. Yes or no. If yes, evolution must, for that reason, have been from the beginning as much a mental as a material process. But if no, then the grounds on which we were led to abandon the original doctrine were in all sincerity mistaken. Because it was involved with a non-Cartesian outlook on space and with the notion of man as a microcosm, the original doctrine of objective qualities and values has generally been criticised since the scientific revolution as « anthropocentric ». It was anthro125 [pageend127]pocentric. But, in case we should have discarded its truth along with its errors, we may pause to reflect also on what it was not. It was not prosopocentric, as our own cosmos of values has now become. Whatever anthropos meant to the medieval artist, writer or natural scientist and to his Greek predecessors, it did not signify a jaunty, or a terrified, little personality bounded by birth and death and presumed to re- emerge from nonentity at about sevent-o’clock every morning. What then did it mean ? What was, or rather what is, the meaning of anthropos ? Asked originally by the Sphinx, this question was answered in the Mysteries not in the indicative but in the imperative mood : gnöthi seauton — know thyself! To cease altogether from hearing the question and from endeavouring to answer it with moral choices, with artistic creation and with the disinterested pursuit of truth is virtually to cease from being a man. It is, more particularly, to drop the question out of which all art, literature, philosophy and science were born. Yet there are those who are resolving to drop it. The least obvious but most conclusive evidence of human entropy is the fact that more and more representatives of both «cultures» are found intentionally closing their ears to that very question. In science, it was the disinterested pursuit of truth that led, in the first place, to the abolition of objective quality in nature. Today, I have suggested, the same pursuit can only lead humanity back to the perennial question. Yet how many there are who would rather abandon the pursuit than follow its lead ! Science, according to the positivists among its votaries, « no longer wants to understand but only to describe ». And literature ? The flight from meaning in poetry followed on the elimination of quality from nature. Not immediately, it is true. The best of the Romantics resisted and, instead of closing their ears, strove to answer the perennial question both with their poetry and with their 126 [pageend128]thinking about poetry. The Parnassian revolt, when it came, was at the same time an actual effect of the scientific revolution and its analogue in the history of art. For the French Symbolists turned and fled what the Romantics had resisted and attacked — a world without quality. Their aim (in which they partly succeeded) was self-preservation ; and who shall judge them for pursuing it ? They deprived poetry of all cognitive significance, though not yet of all objective reference, since a Neo-Platonic sense of man as microcosm still hovered, as its vague tenor, behind much of their imagery. The English and American Imagists, who followed them, sedulously disinfected the poetic image of the last lingering vestiges of any such universal and objective meaning as the term «symbolism» connotes. They aimed at purifying the linguistic vehicle from any tenor whatsoever, so as to make it convey precisely, and only, some immediate personal experience of the author at some particular moment. The poetic image became identified with the proposopocentric image ; and poetry, and literature in general, entered inevitably on their present course of degeneration into the insipidities of private anecdote. By the logic of their own development the disinterested pursuit of scientific truth and the disinterested pursuit of art «for art’s sake» have combined to bring us face to face with the choice before which we stand ; and the true frontier is not drawn between literature and art on the one side and science on the other, but between this choice and that. It is rubbish to class as concerned with «the humanities » men of letters who merely vie with one another in finding new ways of delightedly presenting anthropos as meaningless ; and to exclude from that class a scientist who maintains that «all thinking men are interested in the problem of understanding the world —- including ourselves, and our knowledge as part of the world ». What matters tody is, not the two cultures, but the trahison des clercs that would destroy them both. 127 [pageend129]There is a gulf, and a rapidly widening one, but it yawns between responsible men of letters and men of science on the one hand and, on the other, the fribbles in both camps who are happy to cock a snook at the Sphinx and get the biggest kick they can from producing either slicker and slicker gimmicks or sicker and sicker and sicker poems, stories and pictures. It is stretched, not between culture and culture, but between culture of any sort and anarchy, culture and chaos, between gnöthi seauton and the abolition of man. RUDOLF KRÄMER - BADONI SICHT UND SPRACHE Wenn wir die bildende Kunst als radikale Intentionalität betrachten, wird es ganz klar, daß von jeher nicht der Gegenstand, sondern die kontradiktorische, im Zerbrechen aufgefangene Spannung der Formen und Farben für das Künstlerische im Werk konstitutiv war. Von jeher — ob nun Madonnen oder der Themsenebel oder geometrische Gegenstände zum Vorwand dienten. Dieser Vorwand selbst wurde immer problematischer. Und da es sich um eine Augenkunst handelt, haben selbstredend zugleich optische Probleme das Problem des Gegenstandes begleitet. Ja es läßt sich darin die ganze Entwicklung der Malerei seit der Renaissance zeigen. Es ging den Künstlern nicht darum, den Gegenstand, sondern das Sehen des Gegenstandes so genau wie mög- 128 [pageend130]lieh wiederzugeben. Man ruhte nicht eher, als bis man die optische Täuschung, Perspektive genannt, in den Griff bekam. Optische Studien also, ein Gebiet der Physik — wenn ich nicht irre — machten ihren Einfluß geltend. Dabei blieb es nicht. Die zweite Revolution betraf die Farbe, aber wiederum nicht die Farbe selbst, sondern das Sehen der Farbe. Die Lokalfarbe löst sich bei genauerem Hinsehen in eine vielfältige Abstufung auf, die zum Teil vom Reflex der umgebenden Farbe stammt. Die Freilichtmalerei, der sog. Impressionismus, hatte es mit nichts anderem als einem optischen Problem zu tun. Weiter. Bald darauf wurde die Bewegung zum optischen Problem. Wenn Boccioni ein fahrendes Auto malte, dann interessierte ihn die schnelle Bewegung, aber nicht als das Wesen des Autos, sondern als optisches Problem. So fing der Expressionismus an. Wirbelnde Räder, fahrige Striche, zwischenblitzendes Licht. Dabei kam der Gegenstand immer mehr abhanden. Kandinsky suchte Gefühle wiederzugeben — kein Wunder : wenn man die schnelle Bewegung optisch erfassen kann, will man auch das stolze Hochstreben als optischen Gegenstand nehmen. Aber nun wurde es dem Künstler allmählich sonnenklar, daß die Linien und Farben primär keine Madonnen, sondern Bewegung und Stimmung wiedergeben. Der nächste Schritt war das bewußte Aufgeben des Gegenstandes — das weitere ist bekannt: Spannung, Verspannung, Farbabenteuer ohne jeden gegenständlichen Vorwand : Die optische Zurüstung der radikalen Intentionalität. Und das ist eine genügende Dosis an Humanum. Für Haftmanns Protest gegen bürgerliche Ideale ist da kein Platz, denn die Malerei hatte niemals etwas mit bürgerlichen Idealen zu schaffen. Wenn sie Madonnen in Auftrag bekam, machte sie Färb- und Formspiele. Als sie keine Aufträge mehr bekam, machte sie dasselbe ohne gegeständlichen Vorwand. Umgekehrt fallen Benses «Werte », die Innovations- bzw. Originalitätswerte, ebenso unter 129 [pageend131]den Tisch. Diese Werte enthalten zu wenig an Humanum, sie enthalten im Grunde genommen überhaupt nichts. Wenn es das wäre, könnte man an der Kunst achtlos vorübergehen. Nein, die radikale Intentionalität, die kontradiktorische und im letztmöglichen Augenblick gelöste Verspannung ist die symbolische Aufnahme der korrumpierten pragmatischen Intentionalität des menschlichen Daseins. Was in unseren Zusammenhang am Beispiel der bildenden Kunst wichtig ist, das ist der Einfluß der Wissenschaft. Er ist sichtbar zu machen, aber wie weit reicht er ? Genau so weit wie die Wissenschaft optische Probleme verhandelt. Keinen Schritt weiter. Die Malerei ist eine optische Kunst. Die Erfindung des Schießpulvers hat auf die Malerei keinen Einfluß gehabt. Die Atomphysik hat auf die neueste Malerei keinen Einfluß gehabt. Wer solche Reden hält, macht Flausen. Aber die Entdeckung der Perspektive war bindend. Wer danach noch ein Paradiesgärtlein hätte malen wollen mit einem Tisch, der hinten breiter als vorn war, der wäre unter dem Gelächter der Zeitgenossen zusammengebrochen. Aber : damit wurde das existierende Paradiesgärtlein nicht wertlos. Das heißt also : der Künstler kann sich den wissenschaftlich vorgegebenen Prinzipien nicht widersetzen, aber konstitutiv für den künstlerischen Wert eines Werkes sind die wissenschaftlichen Sätze, und zwar die für ihn eigens in Frage kommenden Sätze, nicht. Lassen Sie uns diese beiden Beobachtungen festhalten : weder die Gegenstände noch die einschlägigen wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnisse sind innerhalb einer Kunstgattung für den ästhetischen Wert relevant, obwohl der jeweilige schöpferische Zeitgenosse sich nicht über dieses Vorfeld hinwegsetzen kann. Die Epoche hält jeweils an einem bestimmten Punkt bezüglich der Stoffe und des wissenschaftlichen Zubehörs. Aber für den ästhetischen Wert bleibt einzig und allein die radikale Intentionalität relevant, das Humanum, die Kraft der symbolischen Antwort auf Schicksal. 130 [pageend132]Das ist nicht alles. Nun müssen wir uns umdrehen und scheinbar gegen uns selbst fechten. Denn nun habe ich über ein großes Mißverständnis zu berichten. Als die Dichter nämlich sahen, was für Riesenschritte die Malerei machte, wurden sie unruhig und sagten sich : wir auch ! Fort mit dem Gegenstand, der Gegenstand ist sowieso unwichtig, was die Farbe kann, kann der Laut auch. Und sie versuchten, magische Musik zu machen. Und sie jubelten : oiai laela oia ssisialu... Aber kein Mensch jubelte mit. Dada kam und ging, als wär’s nicht gewesen. Der extreme Expressionismus konnte sich nur kurz halten. Und heute fangen sie wieder an zu lallen. Auch das wird vorübergehen. Eins ist ganz deutlich : Die konsequente Entgegen- ständlichung der bildenden Kunst hat in der Literatur keine Parallele. Warum nicht ? Das Material der bildenden Kunst ist stofflich. Als solches hat es gar keine Beziehung zu Geistigem. Es bietet sich zur reinen Formverarbeitung geradezu an. Das Material der Dichtung aber ist das Wort. Und das Wort ist menschliches Material. Es stammt aus dem Geist, und es schafft Geist. Wer das Wort als bloßen Laut, als musikalischen Ton benutzen will, bleibt unter dem Horizont der Sprache. Das Paradox, aber nur ein scheinbares Paradox, besteht darin, daß die Dichtung, die ganz besonders auf die reine Struktur der radikalen Intentionalität ausgeht, überhaupt nicht auf die leidenschaftliche gegenständliche, nämlich geistige Veranlassung verzichten kann. Oder umgekehrt : Der Dichter muß stets von einem leidenschaftlichen Anlaß ausgehen, will er zum Kunstwerk gelangen, aber das Künstlerische des Werkes bestimmt sich an dem, was über den Anlaß hinausreicht. Dante war von einer leidenschaftlichen politischen Wut getrieben, er bot Himmel und Hölle auf, er verankerte sein Werk formal in einem magisch durchtgeführten Zahlen-Kosmos — aber das alles ist uns heute unwichtig. Es war selbst den Zeitgenossen nicht das eigentlich Wichtige. Vor allem hat die Commedia keine, und schon gar nicht die gewünschten 131 [pageend133]politischen Folgen gehabt. Die Anlässe sind alle verschwunden. Die Welt, die das Werk bestritten hat, ist dahin, die Welt, die es gerufen hat, ist nie gekommen, aber das Werk steht, unbestreitbar, unvergänglich. Was geschieht also in der Sprache des Dichters ? Wenn die Sprache Geist ist, dann leistet sie also doch Erkenntnis, und Dantes Leistung müßte auf ihren Erkenntniswert hin geprüft werden dürfen ? Der Mensch hat in der Sprache nicht nur ein Instrument der Erkenntnis, sondern auch eine Waffe, um standzuhalten, Stellung zu nehmen, dem Geschick Entscheidung entgegenzusetzen. Auch dies leistet ihm die Sprache, aber nicht die Sprache, die auf Wahrheit zielt ; mit einem Wort, nicht die Sprache des Denkens, sondern die Sprache des schauenden Dichtens. In der Dichtung rafft der Mensch allen Geist der Sprake zusammen und stellt ihn als Seele vor sich hin. Dichtung beginnt in der Seele, bemächtigt sich des Geistes und kehrt in die Seele zurück. Im genau gezielten Traum der Dichtung hält die Seele dem entstellenden Geschick stand. Wie steht nun die Dichtung in Beziehung zur Wissenschaft ? Was sind die wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnisse, die unmittelbar zur Dichtung Beziehung haben ? Geistige, seelische Erkenntnisse zunächst. Der psychologische Roman und die psychologische Wissenschaft standen in genauer Wechelselbeziehung. Die Wissenschaft vom Unterbewußten, vom assoziativen, unterschwelligen Vorsichhin- denken und Träumen brachte den Assoziationsbrei in die Dichtung. Joyce, das wird gewöhnlich vergessen, hat diesen Brei im Ulysses sehr maßvoll angerührt. Sobald einer versucht, nichts als Assoziationen zu geben, geht er, weil ja der Mensch nicht nur aus Assoziationen besteht, an der Natur des Menschen vorbei, es sei denn, es gelänge eine mythische Überhöhung wie in den Romanen Samuel Becketts. Was man heute nicht mehr glaubhaft machen kann, sind stundenlange logische Träume. Jedes Kind weiß heute, wie der Traummechanismus aussieht. Die Lehre von der 132 [pageend134]freien Angst, von den Archetypen usw. — alles Erkenntnisse, die den Dichter unmittelbar angehen. In der ersten Begeisterung wird das alles leicht übertrieben, so wie die Romantiker ein Riesenaufhebens vom Magnetismus machten, dem sie Symbolwert zusprachen. Später merkt man dann, daß der Mensch nicht nur Archetypen, sondern auch Neotypen in seiner Seele hat, und daß er nicht nur Angst, sondern auch Mut besitzt. Aber wie schon bei der bildenden Kunst gesagt : Homer wird nicht ästhetisch wertlos, auch wenn heute jeder Dichter ausgelacht würde, der ein Hexameter-Epos dichten wollte. Das zeitgenössische Vorfeld kann nicht übersprungen werden, aber es ist nicht konstitutiv für den künstlerischen Wert eines Werkes. Aber das veranlassende Vorfeld der Dichtung ist ausgedehnter als bei der bildenden Kunst. Und das kommt daher, daß die Sprache bzw. der Geist weitere Bezirke besetzt hält als die Farbe. Die Sprache ist ja nicht nur Instrument des Standhaltens-im-Geschick, also nicht nur dichterisches Instrument, sie ist das Instrument aller geistigen Bezirke schlechthin, sie ist politisches, gesellschaftliches, wissenschaftliches, philosophisches Instrument. Und während alle anderen Künste strikte an das Material gebunden sind und teils zur reinen intentionalen Struktur gezwungen sind wie die Musik — teils allmählich entdeckt haben, daß sie sich legitimerweise der reinen Intentionalität zuwenden können —, ist die Dichtung an dasjenige Material gebunden, das den Geist schlechthin, das Menschliche in seiner Ganzheit beherrscht : die Sprache. Die Themen der Dichtung stammen aus allen denkbaren geistigen Bezirken. Dichtungen ohne Themen sind nicht denkbar, auch wenn schon Novalis « Erzählungen ohne Zusammenhang, jedoch mit Assoziation, wie Träume, Gedichte bloß wohlklingend und voll schöner Worte, aber auch ohne allen Sinn und Zusammenhang» ersehnte — er hat keine gemacht; und auch wenn Flaubert am liebsten « ein Buch über nichts» geschrieben hätte — er war je länger je weiter davon entfernt. Was an diesem Unbehagen richtig war, ist die Tat133 [pageend135]Sache, daß die Themen zwar unerläßlich, aber auch unerheblich sind. Flaubert kam der Sache am nächsten, als er sagte, die Bücher mit dem schmälsten Inhalt seien die ästhetisch besten. Vor allem ist es so, daß die Themen der Dichtung keinen Erkenntniswert in sich selbst haben — auch wenn Martin Heidegger aus Hölderlin und Rilke philosophische Exzerpte gewinnt. Ich bitte Sie: «Wo aber Gefahr ist, wächst das Rettende auch.» Da kann man nur sagen : gelegentlich, meistens nicht. Die Themen der Dichtung sind das Vorfeld, sind Veranlassung, regen die Leidenschaft des Dichters auf ; was herauskommt, ist das straff gespannte, radikal intendierte Symbol menschlicher Intentionalität. Sonst nichts ! Aber das ist genug. 134 [pageend136]A. J. GREIMAS DRAMATIS PERSONAE Essai de description sémantique des actants. Ľétude qui est publiée ici constitue un des chapi- tres de INTRODUCTION A LA SEMANTIQUE STRUCTURALE, en preparation. Hauteur dy propose d’expliciter et de systematises les méthodes utilisées dans les domaines trés divers des sciences humaines pour la description des « contenus». Celle-ci doit étre menée de fagon dijférente selon qu’il dagit d’analyser des sequences du discours que sont les textes ou des ensembles classificatoires plus ou moins bien organises (ideologies, mythologies, univers poétiques, etc.). Le present article se situe d ľintérieur de l’analyse syn- tagmatique des textes clos et essaye de mettre en evidence ľexistence ďun modele general, commun ä un grand nombre de textes, selon lequel se distribuent, toujours de la méme maniere, les rôles des personnages du « récit». Analyse predicative et analyse qualificative. Lorsqu’un mythologue, un Georges Dumézil par exemple, se propose de décrire une population divine en analysant un á un tous ses représentants, la procédure qu’il utilise emprunte deux voies méthodologiquement différentes : a) en choisissant un dieu quelconque, disons D, il constitue, ä ľaide de tous les textes sacrés, mythologiques, folkloriques, etc., un corpus de propositions dans lesquelles D entre comme actant. La réduction fonctionnelle lui permet ensuite de consti- 135 [pageend137]tuer un inventaire réduit des fonctions qui caractérisent ľac- tivité du dieu D. La totalitě des prédicats connus, dans la mesure ou eile est « representative », constitue le champ ď ac- tivité du dieu D. b) en constituant un corpus parallele qui ne comporte plus les fonctions du dieu D, mais la totalitě de ses qualifications telies qu’on les rencontre soit sous forme de surnoms, ďépithě- tes stéréotypées, d’attributs divins, soit dans les considérations de carectěre théologique qui débouchent souvent sur des com- paraisons entre différents personnages divins, il établit la physionomie morale de dieu. Il en résulte deux sortes de définitions du méme dieu : dans le premier cas, il s’agit du résultat de l’analyse predicative qui part du principe qu’un dieu se reconnait par ce qu’il fait, dans le second cas, l’analyse est qualificative, eile situe le dieu donné et le définit a ľintérieur ďune psychologie et dune ethique collectives. La question qui se pose est celie de la valeur relative des deux méthodes : il s’agit de savoir aussi si elles sont complé- mentaires ou exclusives. Ainsi, par exemple, Roland Barthes, en choisissant, pour sa description de ľunivers racinien (1), l’analyse prédicative, affirme, non sans quelque paradoxe, que la tragédie racinienne n’est pas une tragédie psychologique. — Si, par contre, en les considérant comme complémentaires, nous reconnaissons la légitimité des deux procédures, encore devrons-nousi essayer de les situer chacune á un niveau lin- guistique qui est le sien et de les définir structurellement de maniere différente. Commengons d’abord par l’analyse prédicative. Les actants en linguistique. On voit que cette fagon de définir les dieux ou les hommes par leurs actions rappelle d’assez pres la conception des « fonc- (1) SUR RACINE, éd. du Seuil. 136 [pageend138]tions » dans la syntaxe traditionnelle ou celles-ci sont consi- dérés comme des rôles joués par les mots : le sujet y est considéré comme «quelqu’un qui fait faction», le complement ďobjet comme « quelqu’un qui subit faction », etc. La proposition, dans une telle conception n’est en somme qu’un spectacle que se donne ľ homo loquens. Le spectacle a cepen- dant ceci de particulier qu’il est permanent: le contenu des actions change tout le temps, les acteurs varient, la proposition-spectacle reste toujours la méme, car sa permanence est garantie par la distribution unique des rôles. Par rapport aux acteurs qui participent accidentellement aux propositions, les actants constituent done des classes d’acteurs commutables. Cette maniere de voir suggěre déjá la possibilité de reduction — que nous n’avons pas encore proposée •— des acteurs-occurences en classes d’actants. La difficulté qu’il faut résoudre auparavant est de savoir combien il y a de classes d’actants et comment définir ces classes les unes par rapport aux autres. Il faut dire que la syntaxe traditionnelle pose généralement a priori un certain nombre d’actants (quelle appelle « fonctions ») sans se préoc- cuper de leur definition. Les syntacticiens modernes cepen- dant qui essayent de maintenir ce qu’il y a de valable dans la tradition, tout en excluant le verbe qui constitue le noyau de ľénoncé et les fonctions « secondaires » telies que épithěte, apposition ou complément du nom, limitent f inventaire á trois actants : Grammaire traditionnelle Martinet Tesniére Sujet Agent 1er actant Compl. d’objet Patient 2eme actant Compl. ďattribution Bénéficiaire 3eme actant Nous avons déja essayé, on s’en souvient, de définir les actants comme une structure paradigmatique projetée sur la dimension syntagmatique de la proposition. La question n’en est pas résolue pour autant: en effet, de quel paradigmes, 137 [pageend139]de quelles articulations sémiques élémentaires cette structure est-elle constituée ? Quant aux deux premiers actants, agent vs patient leur opposition parait pertinente : sur ľaxe de la transitivité, on peut aisément concevoir deux actants, le premier étant á l’origine, le second á ľaboutissement du procěs. La formulation sémantique peut différer ďun linguiste á l’autre, la relation elle-méme parait cependant suffisamment analysée et mise en évidence. II n’en est pas de méme du 3éme actant, le bénéficiaire, dont le statut parait incertain, car on ne voit pas comment on pourrait ľintégrer dans la structure élémentaire: agent vs patient. Ľexistence du bénéficiaire semble présupposer celie d’un bienfaiteur quelconque. Dans les propositions du type : Pierre écrit une lettre ä Marie ce bienfaiteur parait étre « Pierre ». On peut, a partir de tels énoncés, entrevoir la possibilité de constituer toute une classe de commutation pour remplacer écire par des verbes ayant comme caractéristique sémique la communication ou, ce qui revient au méme, Yéchange. En «rajeunissant» un peu la terminologie, on peut dire que le bénéficiaire n’est qu’un terme de la structure sémique élémentaire : destinateur vs destinataire. Si tel est le cas, le sujet traditionnel de la proposition possěde une double «fonction», est ľaboutissement d’une double articulation sémique : agent vs patient destinateur vs destinataire. Quelles conclusions pouvons-nous tirer d’ores et déjá de ces quelques constatations ? Celle-ci d’abord : la grammaire d’une langue possěde une structure paradigmatique ď actants qui se définissent: 138 [pageend140]1) d’une part, par leurs articulations internes. Les actants, définis comme roles et s’opposant les uns aux autres, possědent une autonomie sémantique relative, ne suf- fisent á eux-mémes et ne dependent pas de leur situation dans telle ou telle proposition particuliěre. Ex. Marie recoil une lettre de Pierre. Malgré les apparences de la construction syntaxique, c’est « Pierre » qui est destinateur et « Marie », destinataire. 2) ď autre part, les actants se définissent par des classes de « proces » auxquels ils sont liés : Pierre bat Paul Pierre écrit une lettre a Marie. Dans le premier cas, «Pierre» est agent, dans le second, il est destinateur. Ce qui les distingue, c’est les fonctions de « battre » et d’« écrire » auxquelles ils participent. Les deux types de fonctions qui permettent, dans un cas, de postuler comme actant un agent et, dans l’autre, un destinateur sont en réalité des classes de fonctions définissant les classes d’actants. On peut done dire, en appliquant ä ľ étude du récit le résultat de ces réflexions, que le nombre de classes de fonctions dégagées par ľ analyse ďun récit déterminera le nombre ď actants du méme récit et que ď autre part la nature sémantique de ces fonctions rendra compte de la physionomie sémantique des actants. Les actants du récit. Munis de ces indications, revenons á ľ analyse du récit. Propp (2) aprěs avoir défini le récit-conte populaire comme un étalement, sur la ligne de succession, de ses 31 fonctions, (2) MORPHOLOGY OF THE RUSSIAN FOLKTALE, Indiana University Press (trad, du russe). 139 [pageend141]se pose ensuite la question des actants, des dramatis personae comme il les appelle. La définition des actants qu’il propose est fonctionnelle : en effet, les actants se définissent ďaprěs lui par les « spheres ď action » auquelles ils participent, ces spheres étant constituées par les faisceaux de fonctions dont ľinventaire est déjá constitué. Il s’aper^oit en effet que les memes types de personnages participent ď une variante á ľautre, d’un conte á ľautre, aux méme groupes de fonctions. Cela revient á dire que, en prenant une seule fonction identi- fiée comme telle pour ľensemble des contes-occurences, nous aprecevrons que les personnages (nous préférons les appeler acteurs) peuvent varier d’un conte á ľautre, mais que, par contre, le méme personnage se retrouvera nécessairement dans un certain nombre de fonctions. Cet ensemble de fonctions commun á un seul acteur lui permet děs lors de définir, ďune part, un actant comme une classe ďacteurs et, ďautre part, comme participant á une classe de fonctions. On peut distinguer ici une double démarche méthodologi- que : 1) II s’agit, ďune part, de la procédure de reduction des acteurs-occurances en actants-lexěmes. sémantiques. 2) II s’agit, ďautre part, de la premiere phase de la structuration : les actants postulés pour chaque fonction particu- liére sont reconnus comme des actants-types ayant pour «sphere ďaction » une classe de fonctions. Cette double procédure lui permet ďétablir un inventaire définitif des actants qui sont : 1) the villain 2) the donor (provider) 3) the helper 4) the sought-for person (and her father) 5) the dispatcher 6) the hero 7) the false hero. 140 [pageend142]Cet inventaire ľautorise á donner une deuxiěme definition du conte populaire russe comme étant un récit d 7 personri ages. Laissons-la pour ľinstant l’analyse de Propp. A ľendroit méme oü Propp abandonne, en quelque sorte, son analyse, nous retrouvons un autre inventaire assez sem- blable, Yinventaire des fonctions dramatiques, postulé a priori par Etienne Souriau dans son ouvrage Les 200.000 situations dramatiques. La reflexion de Souriau, quoique apriorique, n’est pas trěs éloignée de l’analyse de Propp, eile le prolonge méme dans une certaine mesure. La question de savoir si Souriau a connu l’ouvrage de Propp (ce qui est peu probable) n’est pas pertinente. L’intérét certain de la pensée de Souriau consiste dans le fait d’avoir montrée que l’analyse actantielle s’appli- quait tout aussi bien á un autre type de récits — aux oeuvres théátrales — et que les résultats d’une telle analyse pouvaient étre comparables aux premiers. On y trouve, quoique expri- mées dans d’autres termes, les memes distinctions — que nous essayons de formaliser et de généraliser — entre I’histoire événementielle (qui n’est pour lui qu’une suite de «sujets dramatiques ») et le niveau de la description sémantique (ou se retrouvent les «situations», décomposables en proces et actants). On y trouve finalement un inventaire définitif et limitatif des actants (auxquels il donne le nom de «fonctions»). Le malheur a voulu qu’apres avoir hésité quelque temps entre 6 et 7 fonctions dramatiques, il se soit décidé finalement pour le nombre 6 (nombre contesté d’ailleurs par Guy Michaud (3) qui voudrait rétablir la 7eme fonction : celie du traitre) : nous aurions ainsi obtenu deux définitions paralleles de deux «genres» de récit différents — conte populaire et piece de theatre — qui, chacun séparément, se seraient prétendus étre des récits á 7 personnages ! On ne se méfiera jamais assez des définitions formalistes. (3) LES TECHNIQUES DE Ľ OEUVRE. 141 [pageend143]Ľinventaire de Souriau se présente de la fagon suivante (p. 117) : Lion — La Force thématique orientée Soleil — Le Représentant du Bien souhaité, de la Valeur orientante Terre — L’Obtenteur virtuel de ce bien (celui pour lequel travaille le Lion) Mars — L’Opposant Balance — L’Arbitre attributeur du Bien Lune — La Rescousse, Redoublement d’une des forces précédentes. Ne nous laissons pas intimider ni par l’aspect énergétique, ni surtout par l’aspect astrologique de la terminologie de Souriau: eile ne réussit pas ä voiler une pensée solide et cohérente. Modéles actantiels. En réfléchissant sur le statut des actants dans le systéme lin- guistique, nous avons tenú á préciser que la définition des actants est nécessairement double : ils se définissent, il est vrai, essentiellement par leur champs ďactivité (faisceaux de fonctions), mais leur définition n’est complete que s’ils peu- vent étre interprétés paradigmatiquement comme manifestations des structures sémiques élémentaires. C’est cette analyse paradigmatique de leur signification qui fait défaut tout aussi bien á ľanalyse de Propp qu’ä celie de Souriau qui s’arrétent á la presentation de ľinventaire des actants. — On peut se demander toutefois si, en s’appuyant sur les enseignements tirés de ľanalyse sémantique des actants linguistiques, on ne peut entrevoir la possibilité de structuration homogene des deux inventaires dont nous disposons. Si 142 [pageend144]tel était le cas, son résultat pourratt étre propose comme un moděle structural par lequel devrait normalement s’achever la description sémantique des actants. Essayons done de voir si une telle analyse sémique est possible. La premiere observation superficielle permet de retrouver ľidentité du couple fondamental des. actants qui s’articule, dans les deux inventaires, selon la formule : S' désire O. Ce qui frappe ici c’est, plus que le statut comparable des actants Sujet et Objet, ľidentité de ce que Souriau appelle (en ľattribuant, il est vrai, au Sujet) «la Force thématique orientée », c’est-á-dire, ľidentité de la relation principále qu’est le désir humain. De ce point de vue, les deux genres de récit, le conte populaire comme le spectacle dramatique, paraissent comporter, grace a ce dénominateur commun qu’est le désir, une assiette plus générale : ce sont au fond des récits-quétes. Ce n’est qua partir de cet axe que les deux premiers actants s’articulent comme le Sujet et ľ Objet du désir : Sujet — hero — la force thématique orientée Objet — sought for person — le Représentant du Bien souhaité, la Valeur orien- tante. On peut dire sans crainte de se tromper que ces deux actants reliés par le désir constituent le minimum structurel sur lequel repose tout récit de quéte. Nous avons dégagé ensuite, au niveau de la syntaxe, un deuxiěme couple d’opposition, celui de Destinateur vs Destinataire. Mais lorsque ľon s’interroge á savoir si ce genre de structure se retrouve dans les deux inventaires dont nous disposons, les choses se compliquent du fait que, comme nous l’avons déjá vu pour la syntaxe, les actants sont souvent cumulatifs, que deux ou plusieurs actants peuvent se réunir en un com- 143 [pageend145]plexe sémique, une sorte de super-actant, et ceci soit lors des différentes phases du proces, soit pour toute une classe de récits. Prenons, par exemple, un récit qui serait une banale histoire d’amour finissant par le mariage. On voit que dans le cadre ďune telle histoire, le sujet est ä la fois le destinataire, tandis que ľobjet est en méme temps le destinateur de ľamour : Sujet Destinataire Objet Destinateur Les quatre actants sont bien lá, symétriques et inversés, mais cumulés deux par deux. Au contraire, dans un récit du type de la Quéte de Saint Graal, les quatre actants fonctionnent séparément: Sujet Héros ---- cn ------- Objet Saint Graal Destinateur Dieu Destinataire Humanitě Dans l’analyse de Souriau, ľopposition Destinateur vs Destinataire est franchement marquée comme ľopposition Ľ arbitre, attributeur du bien vs l’Obtenteur virtuel de c e bien Dans l’analyse de Propp, par contre, le destinateur semble étre articulé en deux personnages dont le premier est en par- tie confondu avec l’Objet souhaité : (the sought-for person and) her father, tandis que le second apparait sous forme de dispatcher ( = mandateur). En effet, c’est tantôt le foi, tantôt le pere ■—• confondus ou non — qui chargent le héros ďune mission. Sans étre trěs versé dans la psychanalyse, on peut prétendre que ľéconomie générale des actants de Propp ne sera pas 144 [pageend146]bouleversée, si Von réunit le pere de la personae désirée au mandateur, en les considérant, quand ils se présentent sépa- rément, comme deux «acteurs», deux variables ďun meme actant. Quant au destinataire, il semble bien que dans le conte populaire russe son champ ďactivité fusionne complětement avec celui du sujet-héros. Une question théorique qui peut se poser á ce propos, et que nous retrouverons plus tard, est de savoir si de telies fusions peuvent étre considérées comme des critěres pertinents pour les divisions d’un genre en sous-genres. On voit que ces quatre actants, ou plutôt ces deux couples d’actants constituent un modele simple et general d la fois, centre tout entier sur I'Objet qui est d la fois objet de désir et objet de communication. Il est beaucoup plus difficile de s’assurer de la forme paradigmatique des autres actants, ne serait-ce que parce que Ie modele grammatical nous fait défaut. Il est incontestable pourtant que dans les deux inventaires en question, on recon- nait facilement deux champs ďactivité et par lá méme deux sortes de fonctions assez nettement tranchées : 1) les unes consistent á apporter Yaide en agissant dans ,le sens du désir, ou en facilitant la communication ; 2) les autres, au contraire, á créer des obstacles, en s’op- posant soit á la realisation du désir, soit á la communication de ľobjet. Ces faisceaux de fonctions donnent naissance á deux actants qu’on pourrait peut-étre désigner sous les noms de Adjuvant vs Opposant. Cette distinction correspond assez bien á la formulation de Souriau auquel nous empruntons le terme ď opposant; nous préférons le terme á’adjuvant, proposé par Guy Michaud, á la « rescousse » de Souriau. Quant á la formulation de Propp, nous y retrouvons ľopposant en la personne du «villain » (= le traitre), tandis que ľ adjuvant y est représenté par deux personnages, le « helper » et Ie « donor » ( — « provider »). Cette élasticité de l’analyse peut á premiere vue paraitre trou- 145 [pageend147]blante. N’oublions cependant pas deux choses : ďabord, le fait de postuler des actants aux faisceaux de fonctions n’est que la premiere phase de la structuration ; l’absence de la seconde phase qui consiste dans la determination de 1’articu- lation sémantique des actants ainsi dégagés est justement le pricipal reproche que ľ on peut adresser aussi bien á Propp qua Souriau. Deuxiěmement, toute généralisation procěde par niveaux : Propp n’avait á sa disposition que ľinventaire d’un seul genre ; nous, au contraire, nous cherchons á constituer le modele commun ä plusieurs genres. A quoi correspond, dans le monde dont nous voulons expliciter la structure actantielle, cette opposition entre I’adju- vant et ľopposant ? Tout se passe comme si, á côté des prin- cipaux intéressés, apparaissaient maintenant, dans le spectacle du monde valorisé, des actants representant, de fagon schéma- tisée, les forces bienfaisantes et malfaisantes du monde, des incarnations de Fange gardien et du diable du dráme chrétien du Moyen Age. Ce qui frappe aprěs coup dans la terminologie, c’est la forme participiale, et non plus substantivale, que nous avons adoptée pour désigner ces deux derniers actants. En jouant un peu sur les mots, on pourrait dire qu’il s’agit lá de participants circonstanciels et non de vrais actants du récit. On se rappelera que les participes sont en fait des adjectifs qui, comme on sait, sont des déterminants des substantifs dans la méme mesure que les adverbes sont des déterminants de ver- bes. Lorsque, dans la procédure de réduction, nous ramenons les verbes á leur forme substantivale, les adverbes qui les suivent se transforment, bien súr, en adjectifs. Ainsi il travaille bien > un bon travail > il a enfin gagné > la victoire finale, etc. > Il existe en frangais, dans la classe fermée des adverbes, un trěs petit nombre d’adverbes dits de qualité. Ceux-ci constituent principalement deux couples : volontiers vs néanmoins bien vs mal 146 [pageend148]Le premier couple designe la participation au proces de la volonté (c’est-á-dire d’un autre moi-meme) soit sans soit avec la prévision de la resistance. Le second couple comporte un jugement extérieur (avec référence au locuteur lors du processus de la communication) porte sur Ie procěs. La projection de ce dedoublement du sujet en butte á ľobstacle personnifié jugé comme bon dans le premier cas, comme mauvais dans le second, s’incarne en quelque sorte dans nos participes substan- tivés. Cette interpretation vaut ce quelle vaut. Elle essaie d’expli- quer l’apparition dans le modele, á côté de véritables actants, des participants qui ne sont en somme que des circonstanciels de la fonction du désir. En résumant, nous pouvons presenter maintenant, sous sa forme définitive, le modele operational constitué de quatre actants et de deux participants et qui s’articule de la fafon suivante : Destinateur Communication Destinataire Objet désir Adjuvant <---------- > Opposant Sujet N.B. Il est entendu que le faux héros de Propp n’est que la manifestation antiphrastique de l’Opposant qui se pré- sente comme Adjuvant dans le récit. 147 [pageend149]La signification du modele actantiel. Nous voila done en possession d’une structure actantielle ďune certaine généralité. Il est temps maintenant de s’inter- roger sur la signification et sur la portée de cette structure. Celle-ci cependant ne peut nous apparaitre que si nous arrivons á replacer le modele a ľintérieur de la démarche analytique globale. Pour ce faire, force nous est done d’analyser cette démarche analytique elle-meme. Méthodologiquement, la démarche qui nous a conduit de ľinventaire des fonctions á celui des actants est parallele a la procédure utilisée dans l’analyse distributionnelle : les con- textes identiques des fonctions nous ont permis de considérer les acteurs comme des. variables et de les réduire aux actants ; la distribution des acteurs identiques tout le long de ľinventaire des fonctions nous ont permis de considérer certaines fonctions comme complémentaires. Mais lá s’arréte le parallélisme, car, au lieu de postuler aux variantes complémentaires, qui se trouvent ainsi réunies en un faisceau de fonctions, un invariant fonctionnel, nous avons fait un saut, en leur postulant, á ľexemple de Propp, un invariant actantiel. C’est ce passage de fonction á actant qui reste á expliquer. Il faut cependant reconnaltre que, méme en évitant cette déviation, merne en maintenant l’analyse au niveau des fonctions qui nous aurait permis ďétablir un inventaire de fonc- tions-invariants, nous aurions du, faute de criteres formels, nous arréter lá. C’est ainsi que Knud Togeby, par exemple, en décrivant la Structure immanente de la langue fran^aise, arréte presque toujours son analyse au moment ou ľinventaire se trouve, selon lui, suffisamment réduit, en proposant par- fois, il est vrai, diverses interpretations, sémantiques possibles. L’analyse distributionnelle, malgré sa valeur incontestable, en s’interdisant de sortir des limites que lui impose son formalisme, est incapable de poursuivre l’analyse en vue de la transformation des. inventaires en systěmes. 148 [pageend150]Ceci nous a oblige non seulement á reprendre l’analyse la ou Propp ľavait abandonnée, mais méme á traiter son inventaire des actants avec une certaine liberté : en effet, la liste des dramatis personae est, de son propre point de vue, totalement arbitraire et aucun critěre formel ne ľautorise a désigner tel actant comme « héros» ou tel autre comme «traitre ». II en est ďailleurs conscient lui-méme puisque, au moment de la définitition, il revient en arriěre pour dire que le conte pou- laire russe n’est qu’un récit á 7 personnages (c’est-á-dire, á 7 personnages dont on ne peut rien dire). Notre démarche structurante a done consisté á rendre compte de ces personnages, á chercher, au moyen des articulations sémiques, reliant les actants, un minimum ďordre, un principe ď organisation de ce monde tout prét á se mettre en action á ľintérieur d’un récit quelconque. Nous avons commencé par coupler d’abord les actants. Mais cette binarisation n’était possible qu’en postulant chaque fois un axe commun, un plan de comparabilité, si ľon peut dire, de chaque paire ďactants. Ainsi, pour réunir sujet et objet, il a fallu postuler Faxe du désir sur lequel leur rencontre devenait possible ; ľopposition entre destinateur et destinataire ne s’explique qu’en vue ďune communication éventuelle ou effective; ľadjuvant et ľop- posant postulent ľexistence des contradictions implicites. Tout cela ne résout cependant pas encore le probléme que nous avons laissé en suspens et qui est celui de ľ interpretation du passage, au cours de l’analyse, de la description fonc- tionnelle á celie des actants. Il s’agit en effet de savoir ce qui arrive lorsque, pour les besoins de l’analyse, un inventaire de fonctions est transposé en un inventaire d’actants et quand, par la suite, on se propose á transformer ce dernier en une structure actantielle. Le conte populaire russe, tel qu’il apparaít á la suite de la reduction de Propp, est constitué, on le sait, ďune succession de 31 fonctions (depart, fuite, combat, retour, etc.). Toutes ces fonctions possědent un dénominateur commun, elles peu- vent étre considérées comme constituant une seule classe de 149 [pageend151]fonction avec, pour toute connotation, le lexěme commun : comportement. Toutes, en effet, elles désignent des proces realises. Pour la construction du modele actantiel nous nous sommes servi, au contraire, d’un certain nombre d’axes qui expriment non des proces réalisés, mais bien plutôt des intentions de proces. Un investissement sémantique supplé- mentaire des fonctions du récit fait apparaitre ľexistence d’une sorte de parallélisme entre les axes du moděle actantiel et les faisceaux de fonctions du récit. Ainsi, au désir sur le plan actantiel correspond la quéte sur le plan fonctionnel, á la possibilité de communication que postule ľexistence du destinateur et du destinataire correspond la communication réelle, l’attribution du bien désiré lors du récit; les contradictions implicites se transforment en luttes et épreuves indispensables a tout récit. En se souvenant de Freud qui définit le reve comme la réalisation du désir, on peut dire que la structure actantielle apparalt comme la structure du projet humain, tandis que la structure jonctionnelle révělera la structure de sa réalisation. Autrement dit, la structuration du récit au niveau des actants fait apparaitre la distribution des roles avant le lever du rideau ; tout actant est avant tout une possibilité d’action. On voit done que la catégorie mise en cause, que ľarticulation sémique qui distingue les modeles actantiels des moděles fonc- tionnels réside dans I’opposition du virtuel et de ľactualisé. La structure actantielle et les systémes de valeurs. La comparaison de deux analyses, celie de Propp et celie de Souriau, et de deux genres de récit — conte et drame — nous a contraint á situer la structure actantielle á un certain niveau sémantique qui leur soit commun. Ainsi, au lieu de considérer le rapport entre le sujet et ľobjet dans toute sa généralité comme une relation de transitivité a laquelle correspondrait, dans le récit, la fonction tout aussi générale de comportement, nous avons dů reconnaítre le comportement de quéte comme 150 [pageend152]caractérisant le rapport essentiel entre le sujet et ľ objet lors de la réalisation, dans le récit, de cette « virtualité de quéte » qu’est le désir au niveau de la structure actantielle. On voit done que le choix du niveau ďinvestissement sémantique limite la portée du modele construit et constitue un des éléments de la définition du « genre ». Telle quelle est cependant, la structure actantielle que nous venons de décrire parait posséder une certaine vertu explicative et permet, dans les limites qui restent a préciser, de rendre compte Sun certain mode de fonctionnement de tout systéme de valeurs. On pourrait prétendre que ľhomme ou la société, pour « vivre » ses valeurs, e’est-a-dire pour se les réaliser sur le plan symbolique qui est celui du langage, dispose de certains schémas itératifs qui leur permettent á la fois d’« huma- niser » et de « dramatiser » les valeurs en se les donnant en spectacle. Ainsi, en simplifiant beaucoup, on pourrait dire que pour un savant philosophe des siécles classiques faxe du désir étant précisé, par investissement sémantique, comme désir de con- naitre, les actants du drame de la connaissance se distribuaient a peu prěs de la maniěre suivante : Sujet: Philosophe Objet: Monde Destinateur: Dieu Destinataire: Humanitě Opposant: Matiěre Adjuvant: Esprit. De méme, ľidéologie marxisté, au niveau du militant, peut étre distribuée, grace á faxe du désir qui serait la libération de l’homme, de la fagon suivante : Sujet: Homme Objet: Société sans classes Destinateur: Histoire Destinataire: Humanitě Opposant: Classe bourgeoise Adjuvant: Classe ouvriěre. 151 [pageend153]Le but de ces exemples n’est pas de proposer la réduction ä des schemas aussi simplistes, des premisses épistémologiques de la science classique ou de ľidéologie marxisté. Ils montrent cependant la facilité avec laquelle les systěmes de valeurs peu- vent épouser les schémas actantiels et devenir ainsi aptes á la consommation quotidienne. On peut se demander s’il est encore nécessaire de parier á ce propos de la psychanalyse, tellement le moděle actantiel parait, bien malgré nous, s’inspirer d’elle. Ainsi, pour ne mentionner que ľaxe du désir qui est le point de depart de notre structuration, on voit qu’il ressemble étrangement á la libido freudienne établissant la relation d’objet, de cet objet qui est diffus á ľorigine et dont ľinvestissement sémantique détermine en fin de compte tout ľ univers symbolique du sujet. Quant á la distribution des autres rôles, eile a subi une série de transformations et d’interpénétrations successives, tantôt s’articulant selon le moděle spatial en couches super- posées de la personnalité (le fa, le moi, le sur-moi, etc.), tantôt empruntant le moděle de la structure familiale (ainsi Roland Barthes, s’inspirant de Freud, confoit I’univers racinien á ľimage de la horde primitive comme constitué par le pěre, les femmes, les frěres et les fils, ibid., p. 21). — C’est aux psychologues qu’il appartient de juger dans quelle mesure une réflexion plus poussée sur les structures actantielles formelles peut contribuer á ľélaboration de cette métapsychologie qui a été, on le sait, une des grandes ambitions de Freud. Ľ anthropomorphisms des actants. Un investissement sémantique déterminé de Faxe du désir — que ľon pourrait peut étre, en se conformant á la tradition, appeler tout aussi bien thématique — est done nécessaire pour que la structure actantielle se mette á «vivre» a ľintérieur d'une sémiologie donnée. II n’est cependant pas süffisant pour rendre entiěrement compte de la nature des modéles actantiels « concrets» : le phénoměne de la personnalisation des actants doit encore étre envisagé á part. 152 [pageend154]Nous avons déjá fait remarquer que le passage de fonction á actant devait étre interprété comme le retour de l’actuel au virtuel. Nous n’avons peut-étre pas suffisamment souligné le fait que ce passage impliquait également une sorte de neutralisation du dynamisme des fonctions : une possibilité d’action est en effet d’ordre statique. Cette transformation du verbe en substantif — car c’est de cela qu’il s’agit — nous permet de comprendre comment un actant peut devenir le lieu géomé- trique de fixation, le catalyseur autour duquel se réuniront les propriétés sémiques lors de son incarnation dans une sémio- logie pour apparaitre finalement comme un lexeme ■— concept. En effet, ľ actant en tant que substantif, c’est-á-dire en tant que position á ľintérieur d’une morphologic statique nous permet ďintégrer dans une description globale l’analyse qualificative dont nous avons parlé au debut de ce chapitre. Cependant, il ne faut pas oublier que le modele actantiel est d’abord le résultat d’une analyse syntaxique et non mor- phologique. L’actant n’est pas seulement une possibilité de concept, mais aussi une possibilité de proces. C’est de son statut syntaxique que lui vient son caractěre de force d’inertie qui ľoppose á la fonction, définie comme un comportement. Expliquons-nous. L’interprétation qu’on vient de proposer ne vise pas á introduire dans la description structurale les notions brumeuses de force ou A’inertie en leur accordant une valeur explicative, mais á décrire sémantiquement la relation signifiante qui existe entre actant et fonction, eile essaie de rendre compte de la signification que comporte cette relation. C’est de ce point de vue seulement que nous pouvons dire que tout comportement postule une « force » qui lui est en droit antérieure. Un actant participe done á la fois de la morphologic —: en tant que substantif —- et de la syntaxe — en tant que nom d’agent. Et ceci explique, il nous semble, ce double phénoměne qui se produit lors de la manifestation des actants : 1) un actant se transforme en substantif, e’est-a-dire en concept 153 [pageend155]2) un actant est saisi comme acteur, c’est-a-dire a) ou bien comme une « force» capable d’agir b) ou bien comme un étre animé. Cette interpretation un peu insistante a pour but de rendre compte du procédé de personnification qui n’est pas, selon nous, un simple procédé stylistique, mais un donné constant du fonctionnement du symbolisme linguistique. Děs lors on comprend mieux la pensée d’Etienne Souriau (qui nous a parue á premiére vue quelque peu fantaisiste) qui ľ a amené á donner aux actants les noms de planětes et de signes de Zodiac. Le symbolisme astrologique exprime bien, a sa fagon, cette constellation de « forces » qu’est la structure actantielle, capable d’exercer des «influences» et d’agir sur les «destinées humaines». C’est un systéme conventionnel, soit, et projeté en dehors du monde humain. Mais á partir ďun tel systéme, un horoscope bien fait, en intériorisant ces forces, c’est-a-dire en les manifestant au niveau d’un individu concret, transforme le moděle actantiel en récit. Toutes proportions gardées, c’est le probléme que s’est posé Propp en se demandant si, en partant de la structure du conte, on ne pouvait pas composer autant de nouveaux contes populaires qu’on voulait. Une conclusion d’ordre pratique pourrait étre tirée de la constatation que la structure actantielle, de par sa nature linguistique méme, porte en eile une sorte de tendance á la per- sonnification : on pourrait en effet concevoir un ordre de re- cherches visant ľexploration systématique et la description sémantique des niveaux de personnification des actants. Elles consisteraient á déterminer pour chaque niveau donné le nombre et la nature des unités de signification minimales au semes. On pourrait ainsi établir une hiérarchie d’acteurs manifestant les actants á différents niveaux d’investissement sémique : 154 [pageend156]1) Ľacteur reste un lexeme-concept, cependant comme une force agissante Ex. ľ Opinion publique la Liberté, la Gloire, ľHistoire, le Prolétariat 2) Ľacteur est un lexéme-objet, representant ľactant par une relation métonymique ou métaphorique Ex. une ville á conquérir le Feu de Prométhée le Saint Graal 3) Ľacteur qui est un lexeme se transforme en allégorie par ľadjonction du šéme « étre animé » I Ex. Baghe, divinité indienne qui signifié Part (qui échoue á chacun) Dangler, Bonne Nouvelle dans la poésie de Charles ď Orléans 4) Ľacteur est une figure (animale, humaine, divine, etc.), par ľadjonction des semes adéquats. Le probléme de la classification des acteurs n’est ici, on le voit bien, qu’esquissé, sans la moindre prétention á ľexhaus- tivité ou á la cohérence. Si nous le signalons cependant, ce n’est que pour ajouter un nouveau critére pouvant aider á spécifier les modéles actantiels et les types de récits. A ľinvestissement thématique de la structure actantielle, ä la distribution des actants en acteurs, s’ajoute en plus le degré de personnificar tion de ceux-ci : autant de critéres sémantiques permettant, dans une certaine mesure, á envisager une typologie des modéles actantiels et, par lá méme, des récits eux-mémes. On aurait tort de croire cependant qu’une description sémantique des niveaux de personnification des actants épuise- rait le probléme de ľ originalitě des acteurs. A supposer méme que ľanalyse qualificative, menée de conserve, enrichisse, par de nouvelles déterminations psychologiques et morales, les 155 [pageend157]acteurs-concepts, il resterait encore une large part d’incertitude. Il ne suffit pas, en effet, de constater que tel récit utilise tel type de personnification, encore faut-il savoir pourquoi tel genre de récit se situe sur tel niveau, pourquoi, á ľintérieur d’un niveau donné, tel acteur (animal, étre humain ou force agissante) est choisi de préférence ä tel autre. — Le probléme de la motivation déborde largement les cadres de l’analyse syntagmatique, quelle soit actantielle ou méme fonctionnelle, et c’est le principal reproche que Claude Lévi-Strauss formule á juste titre á ľégard de l’analyse de Propp qui considěre le récit — et, dans ce cas particulier, le conte populaire russe — comme un systéme clos se süffisant á lui-méme. Seule l’analyse paradigmatique, c’est-á-dire, la description des sémiologies par- ticuliéres, l’exploration entreprise par Claude Lévi-Strauss le montre bien, peut rendre compte de la motivation des actants et des fonctions et du méme coup expliciter la signification globale de l’ceuvre syntagmatique, individuelle ou collective, quelle quelle soit. 156 [pageend158]PETER VIERECK POET «Toute forme créée, méme par ľ komme, est immortelle. Car la forme est independante de la matiěre, et ce ne sont pas les molecules qui constituent la forme. » (Baudelaire, MON COEUR MIS A NU) 1 The night he died, earth’s images all came To gloat in liberation round his tomb. Now vengeful colors, stones, and faces dare To argue with his metaphor; And stars his fancy painted on the skies Drop down like swords to pierce his too wide eyes. 2 Words that begged favor at his court in vain — Lush adverbs, senile rhymes in tattered gowns — Send notes to certain exiled nouns And mutter openly against his reign. While rouged cliches hang out red lights again, Hoarse refugees report from far-flung towns That exclamation-marks are running wild And prowling half-truths carried off a child. 157 [pageend159]3 But he lives on in Form, and Form shall shatter This tuneless mutiny of Matter. His bones are dead; his voice is horribly strong. Those famed vibrations of life’s dancing dust, Whose trice-named pangs are « birth » and « death » and «lust,» Are but the spilt iambics of his song. Scansion of flesh in endless ebb and flow, The drums of duty and renown’s great gong — Mere grace-notes of that living thousand-year Tyrannic metronome whose every gear Is some shy craftsman buried long ago. What terror crowns the sweetness of all song ? 4 What hardness leaps at us from each soft tune And hammers us to shapes we never planned ? This was a different dying from our own. Call every wizard in the land — Bell, book, and test tube; let the dark be rife With every exorcism we command, In vain. This death is stronger than our life. 5 In vain we drive our stakes through such a haunter Or woo with spiced applaudings such a heart. His news of April do but mock our Winter Like maps of heaven breathed on window-frost By cruel clowns in codes whose key is lost. Yet some sereneness in our rage has guessed That we are being blessed and blessed and blessed When least we know it and when coldest art Seems hostile, useless, or apart. 158 [pageend160]6 Not worms, not worms in such a skull But rhythms, rhythms writhe and sting and crawl. He sings the seasons round from bud to snow. And all things are because he willed them so. SEMANTICS : THE VOICE OF AUTHORITY Question: Marx and Engels define language as «the direct reality of thought», as «... actual consciousness in practice». «Ideas», Marx says, «do not exist divorced from language. »To what extent, in your opinion, should linguistics occupy itself with the content of language, semantics and historical semasiology and stylistics, or should the subject of linguistics be form only ? Answer: Semantics (semasiology) is one of the important sections of linguistics. The content of words and expressions is of serious importance in the study of language. Therefore semantics (semasiology) must be assured a fitting place in linguistics. However, in developing problems of semantics and in utilising its data, its significance must in no way be overestimated, and still more — its use must not be abused. I have in mind certain philologists, who, excessively indulging in semantics, disregard language as «the direct reality of thought» inseparably connected with thinking, who divorce thinking from language and maintain that language 159 [pageend161]is outliving its age and that it is possible to get along without language. Listen to what N. Y. Marr says : « Language exists only inasmuch as it expresses itself in sounds ; the action of thinking occurs also without revealing itself... Language (vocal language) has now already begun to yield its functions to the latest inventions which are unreservedly conquering space, while thinking is going forward from its past accumulations and new acquisitions and is to oust and wholly replace language. The future language — is thinking, which is developing in technique free of natural matter. No language, even vocal language, which is none the less connected with the standards of nature, will succeed in standing up against it. » (See «Selected Works», by N. Y. Marr.) " If we interpret this « labour-magic » gibberish into simple human language, the conclusion may be drawn that : a) N. Y. Marr divorces thinking from language ; b) N. Y. Marr considers that intercourse between people can be achieved without language, with the help of thinking in itself, of thinking free from the « natural matter » of language, free from «the standars of nature » ; c) in divorcing thinking from language and «having freed » it from the « natural matter » of language, N. Y. Marr lands in the swamp of Idealism. It is said that thoughts arise in the mind of man prior to their being expressed in speech, that they arise without language material, without the language shell, in, so to say, a naked form. But this is absolutely wrong. Whatever the thoughts that may arise in the mind of man, they can arise and exist only on the basis of the language material, on the basis of language terminology and phrases. Bare thoughts, free from the language material, free from «the natural matter» of language —- do not exist. 160 [pageend162]«Language is the direct reality of thought» (Marx). The reality or thought manifests itself in language. Only idealists can speak of thinking as not connected with the « natural matter » ot language, ot thinking without language. In brief : an over-estimation of semantics and excessive use of the latter led N. Y. Marr to Idealism. Consequently, if semantics (semasiology) is safeguarded from exaggerations and abuses similar to those indulged in by N. Y. Marr and some of his « disciples », it can greatly benefit linguistics. Question: You quite justly say that the bourgeoisie and the proletariat have ideas, concepts, customs and moral principles that are diametrically opposed. The class character of these phenomena certainly affected the semantic aspect of language (and, at times, its form too — the vocabulary — as is correctly pointed out in your article). In analysing concrete language material and, first of all, the semantic aspect of language, can we speak of the class essence of the concepts they express, particularly in those cases when the matter concerns the language expression of not only the thought of man but also of his attitude towards reality, where his class affinity manifests itself especially clearly ? Answer: In brief, you want to know whether classes influence language, whether they contribute their specific words and expressions to language, whether there are cases when people attach a different meaning, depending on the class they belong to, to one and the same words and expressions ? Yes, classes do influence language, contribute their own specific words and expressions to language and at times understand one and the same words and expressions differently. That is unquestionably so. From this, however, it does not follow that specific words and expressions, and equally so a difference in 161 [pageend163]semantics, can be of serious importance to the development of a single language common to the whole people, that they are capable of debilitating its significance or of changing its character. Firstly, such specific words and expressions, as well as cases of difference in semantics, are so few in language that they hardly make up 1 per cent of the entire language material. Consequently, all the remaining preponderant mass of words and expressions, as well as their semantics, are common to all classes of society. Secondly, specific words and expressions having a class shade are used in speech not according to the rules of some sort of « class » grammar, which does not exist in reality, but according to rules of the grammar of the existing common language of the whole people. Hence the presence of specific words and expressions and the fact of difference in the semantics of language do not refute, but, on the contrary, confirm the presence and need for a single language common to all the people. Question: In your article you quite correctly qualify Marr as a vulgariser of Marxism. Does this mean that linguists, including us, the young generation, should discard the whole of the linguistic heritage of Marr, who none the less produced a number of valuable linguistic research works (comrades Chikobava, Sanzheyev and others wrote about them in the discussion) ? Can we, in approaching Marr critically, take from him none the less what is useful and valuable ? Answer: Of course, the works of N. Y. Marr do not consists solely of errors. N. Y. Marr made the most crass mistakes when he introduced into linguistics elements of Marxism in a distorted form, when he tried to create an independent theory of language. But N. Y. Marr has certain good works, written with talent, wherein, forgetting his theoretical claims, he conscientiously and, admittedly, 162 [pageend164]capably studies individual languages. In such works not a little that is valuable and instructive is to be found. It stands to reason that what is valuable and instructive should be taken from N. Y. Marr and made use of. Question : Many linguists consider formalism as one of the main reasons for the stagnation in Soviet linguistics. We would very much like to know your opinion on what formalism in linguistics consists of and how it should be overcome ? Answer: N. Y. Marr and his «disciples» accuse of « formalism » all philologists who do not accept the « new doctrine » of N. Y. Marr. This, of course, is light-minded and foolish. N. Y. Marr held grammar to be an empty « formality », and the people who consider the grammatical system as the foundation of language as formalists. This is altogether foolish. I think that « formalism» was invented by the authors of « new doctrine » to make it easier for them to struggle against their opponents in linguistics. The reason for the stagnation in Soviet linguistics is not the «formalism» invented by N. Y. Marr and his «disciples», but the Arakcheyev regime and the gaps in linguistics theory. The Arakcheyev regime was set up by the « disciples» of N. Y. Marr. It was N. Y. Marr and his closest colleagues who got linguistics into a theoretical muddle. To get rid of the stagnation, both the one and the other must be eliminated. The removal of these sores will cure Soviet linguistics, lead it out on to a broad highway and enable Soviet linguistics to occupy the first place in world linguistics. J. V. STALIN 163 [pageend165]NOTES AND REVIEWS BOOKMARKS The old joke about Britain and the United States having everything in common except the language is just as topical today as it was when it was first coined. In Sir Winston Churchill’s war memoirs there is the passage describing the bitter argument when the British proposed to «table » an urgent paper. To the Americans this meant putting it off. The stone we put in England into the foundation, the Yanks put it into the corner. But words are comparatively easy ; it’s the phrases, the turns of speech that trip you up. « Just the same » is used in the States for « nevertheless. » A politician in Washington can « protest a resolution » — when in London he would oppose it. Truly, the leader-writer of the Manchester Guardian, commenting on all this, was perfectly right when he spoke of the «paradisiacal day when... Britain and America will understand each other perfectly because they will have agreed that they do not speak the same language... » * * * Etymology and semantics are so often linked together that one is apt to forget how different things they mean. Yet they have their common meeting ground. Take Mephistopheles, the Evil One in Faust. The word developed from Megist-Ophiel (see the Greek ophis, snake) and originally meant snake-charmer. Gradually this Megis- 164 [pageend166]Ophiel became the patron of all magicians and in the Middle Ages was promoted to one of the great princes of Hell. In a medieval German book called Fausts Höllenzwang Megistophiel became, through a printing error, Mephist- ophiel — from which Mephistopheles was only a logical syllable away. Perhaps my favourite « change of meaning» example is the classic idiot. In ancient Greek it simply meant a man who refused public office, who wasn’t interested in politics but kept to himself. It took quite a bit of time until it aquired its present pejorative meaning — though who would call a man minding his own business an idiot these days, I cannot imagine. They call them worse things, though — especially in totalitarian countries where silence can be high treason. Recently I have been arguing with some knowledgable friends about the origin of sub rosa, the expression for «in secrecy» that has an international currency. Why should « under the rose » stand for a confidential communication or discussion ? A Teutonic expert claimed that the ancient Germans had surrounded their meeting places with roses (Rosenhage) and whatever went on within these hedges, was not supposed to become known outside them. According to a classicist, the Romans considered the rose, hiding its innermost being by its petals, the symbol of taciturnity —■ so in their dining halls they fastened roses above the tables to warn the guests to refrain from rash chatter. A historian quoted the book of Hormayer about the Austrian Empire, describing how the members of the so-called Nadasdy conspiracy plotted under the gate in the Nadasdy palace which was decorated with the coat-of-arms of this ancient and powerful Hungarian family — and in this the rose figured prominently. The most likely explanation was given by a Benedictine father who pointed out that Pope Adrian VI (1522-23) had carved roses placed upon the confession boxes. 165 [pageend167]Living language, like everything else in life, is subject to constant changes, upheavals and renewals — as ideas, customs and conceptions change. Old idioms gradually fade away, sometimes disappear completely, only old books and manuscripts show the fact that once they expressed some thought, marked action or condition. In the eternal modification and selective mutation of language old forms are discarded and new ones created to replace them ; sometimes a reformer’s zeal improves or ennobles a word ; more often, an expression or turn of phrase crops up suddenly, its origin frequently unknown. It is then polished and made tolerable and finally acceptable within the evolution of the living language. The words of unknow origin are more often than not provided by argot, a special language, excluded from polite company ; slang which Mencken has defined as language that has taken off its coat and turned up its shirtsleeves in order to go to work. There are many champions of this apparently inexhaustible wellspring of renewal and enrichment among philologists ; while others, more academic, consider it unconditionally reprehensible, to be persecuted and suppressed in the interests of the purity and sonority of spoken and written language. Yet in spite of the often embittered and extreme arguments, slang words usually managed to insinuate themselves into usage and dictionary, into literature, the polite style of conversation, enriching them with often strikingly apt synonyms ; within a short time they become so closely-knit and organic parts of speech that those who use them have no idea of their lowly and unsavoury origins. The richest and most characteristic of all national slangs was always the French though in our own times America has taken over the lead. Argot has played a considerable part in French linguistic history and provides a classic example of linguistic evolution. French argot is the «mysterious and secret tongue» invented by the traders and peddlars of the fifteenth 166 [pageend168]century ; soon it was monopolized by the Guild of Beggars for its own protection ; later it became the slang of thieves and penetrated the drawing rooms of the world of fashion. At first it invaded everyday speech timidly, risking only a few forays ; here it served to strengthen the authority of the parvenu —■ there again it appeared as a crude and aggressive revolutionary. Still later it conquered the glittering society of the Second Empire, enslaved the novelists, crowded the pages of popular pamphlets, made the street songs and stage language at first quite incomprehensible, then spread gradually throughout all classes ; even the Academy began to discuss and finally accept some of its expressions. «And now», wrote Victor du Bled in his La Société Prangaise du XVle siede au XXe siede « one could say of argot what Talleyrand said of Thiers : «he is not going to arrive because he is already here !» This language is creative and brings rebirth and as languages just as nations need variety, new experiences, it fulfils a second need. Argot has become a species which has subspecies and serial occurrences. The army of slang besieges from every side the aged fortresses of the classic tongue ; in every year, every month one of the besiegers enters the arena and as soon as it is admitted, becomes a fighter for its class — like Socialists who insure themselves doubly and become capitalists or landowners...» The sect of the argot-speakers had its seat near Fontenoy le Comte ; later they were settled in Languedoc because the governor of this province, the Duc Anne de Montmorency granted certain privileges for the beggars who took holy communion and prayed for him on Maundy Thursday of every year. In the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries argot penetrated under different names the speech of polite society. The main elements of argot were formed by allegory and metaphor. Gongorism (named after Gongora, the Spanish poet, originator of affected elegance), euphism, caricism all served to strengthen argot. In the XVI century Guillaume de Salluste, Seigneur du Bartas, 167 [pageend169]the French poet and author of La Semaine, called the wind «the stage-coach of Aelus», the sun «the prince of candles». There are even more extreme examples in the speech of the Precieuses. At first argot was concentrated in Paris but later spread all over France and today is rapidly disseminated through newspapers, films, radio and television. The French have always conducted violent arguments around slang and innovation. Jean Richepin was a great champion of argot. He said : « In the eternal disintegration and reconstruction of the living organism of language argot has a most important part. It changes far quicker than ordinary speech ; it is like quicksilver, speeding, running, circulating, changing, taking shape, being destroyed, reborn, forming waves and currents, then fading and disappearing completely. The momentary word which is used today becomes quite different by to-morrow. From time to time a few expressions are hidden in a song that lives for a day, in a chorus that becomes popular, in some sentence of a ’genuine’ writer or in a poem with a striking rhythm...» Marcel Schwob and Guieyese compared slang words in an interesting study with a lively miniature nation that emigrates constantly to establish new colonies. Moreau, on the other hand, called argot «the language of corruption. » Argot feeds on the most different food and in the most varied ways. It finds nourishment in metaphor, allegory, neologism, synonyms, artificial distortions and foreign languages. «It is quite possible,» remarked Brunetiěre, «that the dictionary of argot conteins words of every possible origin, Sanskrit, Persian, Hebrew, Arabic, Copt, Egyptian — but it is impossible to establish the original meaning and form. » All languages, old and new, dead and living, have used slang. Latin and Greek were greatly enriched by it. And it has its own name in every country. English and American slang is germania or jerigonza in 168 [pageend170]Spain, gergo in Italy, bargoensch or dieventaal in Holland, calao in Portugal, rothwelsch in Germany, not lai in Annam, hiant-chang in China, to mention only a few random examples. Admirers and supporters of slang have been always- numerous. Plato called it the linguistic master of the people ; Montaigne declared, somewhat over-enthusiastical- ly, that he would rather have his son learn a language in a drinking shop than in the «chattering schools» ; this was the language he loved, simple and naive, curt and concise, far from hypocrisy, neither scholastic nor ceremonious but rather military as Suetonius called the language of Caesar. Victor Hugo played considerable part in the popularisation of argot; he said that it was equally suitable as the language of poetry though he seldom used it himself. For Charles Nodier it was « a language created with wit which came into being through the demands of necessity for a class of people who couldn’t do without it.» In one of his essays he stated that it would be unjust to try and wipe out under the pretext of neologism so many living, characteristic and essential expressions. «No one has the right to define autocratically the limits of language and set the point beyond which it is impossible to add to the riches of speech. » Renan thought that argot was by no means as arbitrary in its creations as it seemed at first glance. «Argot is peasant speech -— it has a good smell,» Paul Bourget wrote. Professor Armand Weill said in a speech : «I like to compare the impact of argot upon language to the intrusion of a gang of children into a gathering of savants. The most timid ones stay outside, but one of them risks slipping in. He is received with laughter, given place ; he settles down, feels well and tomorrow he becomes the academician. Let us learn to know argot without hating it, let us polish its words, free it from obscenities — let us not forget that the street-flowers of today might become the most beautiful ornaments of our homes tomorrow... » 169 [pageend171]All this seems a little like accepting the obvious, giving up a hopeless fight, jumping on the bandwagon. Yet slang is its own worst enemy and commits suicide if it is .not fit to survive. Dialect has a much tougher time to survive than slang, though. When a test was given to fifty schoolchildren in Lancashire, aged ten and eleven, they were only able to identify the meaning of thirteen words out of thirty on the average ; the highest mark was twenty-four. The best- known words were « slutch » (mud) followed by « flitting » (moving house), «full pelt» (in great haste) and « mirps » (marbles). One child thought that « skew-wiff » (lopsided) was the name of a new brand of cigarette. Whatever this test proves, it certainly does not hold out much hope for the future of dialect words. Some years ago the American magazine This Week asked its readers to provide a new name for capitalism. There were no less than 5,654 different suggestions, sent in by over twelve thousand people. They ranged from ’Advancism’ to ’Usacracy’ ; from ’Altruism’ to ’Unitism’, from ’Christocracy’ to ’Moral Progression’. ’Americanism’ and ’Individualism’ were suggested most often.

We are happy to announce that we are publishing nine issues in 1964 instead of six as in previous years. We have therefore increased our annual subscription to £ 1.10.0 — or $ 5.00 and once again we ask those who have been receiving our first eighteen issues to let us have this sum by cheque or money order. These should be sent (drawn on a London bank, please !) to the special Arena account c/o Barclay’s Bank, 74 High Street Kensington, London W. 8. England. Some of our friends have asked us about life subscriptions and we have decided to be optimistic enough to set these at £ 20.- or $ 60.00.- We hope there will be a good many of them. Our next issue, to be edited by José Luis Cano, Pablo Marti Zaro and J. M. Castellet, will be devoted to modern Spanish and Catalan writing, consisting largely of works by writers living within Spain. This is due at the end of May. In July the ’personal choice' of our Chairman, Ivan Jelinek, is scheduled. In August Arena is printing the full text of the International P.E.N. Conference, «Translation and Translators», held in Rome in 1961 in order to preserve this valuable record in full. In September K. G. Werner will present his special humour issue ; in November we hope to give you a Yugoslav exile anthology edited by Dragoljub R. Acimovic and in December another special number devoted to the work of exiles in film, TV and radio, to be edited by Algirdas Landsbergis. We hope to transform Arena into a monthly in 1965 and perhaps present it in a different format. Editorial plans are still in the balance but already we have hopes for special issues devoted to contemporary Belgian, Polish, Swedish, Filipino and Yugoslav writing. Kindly inform us of any change of address or any failure of the copies of Arena reaching you regularly. These notices should be addressed to Mr. L. H. Hervey at 19 Buckland Crescent, London N.W.3. and not to the editorial office. 174 [pageend176]COMMENT I find Arena, though it contains few outstanding contributions, very interesting and I am glad to read it. As for its appearance, I would prefer it to be thinner but somewhat larger. Mr. Javor’s cover was brilliant. Ferenc Kenedi, Tel Aviv. Arena is the one genuine cosmpolitan magazine we have. Published by the PEN Centre for Writers in Exile it draws on a wide number of contributors and prints a proportion of their work in the original language. The poetry is not distinguished but the essays and short stories are of a high standard and with an average of 150 pages there is an abundance of material. John Daniel, The Guardian, London & Manchester. A few weeks ago Prof. John Kosa, sociologist in the Health Affairs area, called and asked me to write an article for the British magazine Arena. Dr. Kosa is editor of a special issue on 'The Immigrant Scholar in America.’ He explained that he wanted the article that I write to be informal in nature, similar to the items appearing in this column, 'Town and Gown’. After interviewing a dozen or so faculty here who were born abroad and getting their impressions of America — and especially Chapel Hill — I wrote the piece and Prof. Kosa sent it to London. Prof. Kosa is now departed from Chapel Hill and is a specialist for the Harvard University Family Health Care Program in Boston. The other day he wrote to say that the 'Foreign Immigrant’ effort will be in two issues of Arena, April and May. Of the effort in the style of this column about transplanted Europeans, Asiatics, Latins and Indians in Chapel Hill, the British publisher noted«The article makes us understand the complexity and democracy of the American academic mechanism which never fails to amaze and confuse the English observer.» Unless someone can furnish explanation to the contrary, that appraisal will be considered a compliment. Pete Ivey in the Chapel Hill Weekly. Arena is close to our hearts for it is the voice of exiled writers' and I am happy to contribute to its message. Professor George Strem, California. At each of our meetings, we speak of Arena and we pass around the copy you send us to our members.
