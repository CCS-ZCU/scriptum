SOKOLSKÝ VĚSTNÍK Bulletin of Gymnastic Association Sokol San Francisco 8^7 Worth San Mateo Drive San Mateo, Ca 9^01 Sokol Mall : Mj-3^7-2033 Ročník - Volume XX JANUARY - FEBRUARY, 1986 Číslo - Issue #1 URGENTI 1 ! January 20, 1986 Dear Sisters and Brothers of Sokol: May I wish each of you a hearty HAPPY NEW YEAR!!! This gives us the opportunity to make a fresh start for new beginnings. Whether we were born in Czechoslovakia, or in America, we have chosen to be a member of Sokol because of its philosophy and teachings. Participation from the heart is the key to the continuing success of any organization. Our current membership roster for our San Francisco unit numbers 170. Why then, do only the same 15 members attend our monthly meetings as well as carry the responsibility as an officer, committee member, or worker at each function?!? We now ask you the obvious question: "why are you a member of Sokol*1" if you abstain from any participation except as a 'guest' at our functions?!? Each day we should be thankful for living in free America and remember our heritage by showing thanks in living as a true Sokol. By abstaining, you are denying yourselves as well as other members the pleasure of your camaraderie! This is a plea to each of you to search your hearts and voice your opinions at our meetings if you care enough not to see our San Francisco unit close! We realize that many of you are employed fulltime and reside in areas as far south as San Jose, or north to Santa Rosa, or east, to Orinda, but when the spirit is willing, no distance will deter a true Sokol! Our next monthly meeting will be held on Monday, February 10th at 7:30 p.m. at our Sokol Hall in San Mateo. Gym classes are held every Friday evening for children and adults, no matter the age or size! We are currently learning the calesthenic drill for the Slet to be held in Zurich, Switzerland in early July! Whether or not you plan on participating in this year's Slet, the exercise will do you.good for body, mind, and spirit! We welcome your letters and hope to see you at gym on Fridays and at our next month's meeting. The choice of survival is up to you. . . . the situation is truly crucial so we implore you, don't "blow it"!!!!
