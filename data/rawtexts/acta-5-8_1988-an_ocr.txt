[pageend2]Václav Havel CARDS ON THE TABLE For Czechoslovakia, 1988 was not just a year of several notable round anniversaries. lt was also a year of great political importance for aur country - as we have come to expect of years en- ding in an eight. Admittedly there has been no dramatic turn of events, either for the better or the worse, but something did happen, nevertheless: the cards were put on the table, so to speak. At long last, people started to assert openly that they no longer intend to put up apathetically with the imposed status quo and that they have the capacity to do something more for freedom than just sympathising tacitly with Charter 77 when listening to foreign broadcasts at home, swapping samizdat literature secretly with their workmates, or occasionally applauding some less inhibited theatrical production within the darkness of the auditorium. This was proved by the many thou- sands of citizens who had the courage to take part in independent demonstrations. But there are other signs as well: everywhere people are talking far more openly than before, even within highly official structures. More and more "licensed" ar- tists, academics and journalists are beginning to call a spade a spade regardless of possible conse- quences. It looks as if the barrier which has been laboriously constructed between society and those citizens ready to speak their minds is beginning to crumble and fall away. People would seem to have had their fill of the governmenťs inability to solve the problems which it has heaped upon itself, and they are growing tired of their own cautiousness. But the regime has put its cards on the table too. Not only has it restructured itself in such a way that absolutely nothing is now left to chance - whereby it has destroyed any remaining illusion that society might have - it has even gone so far as to demonstrate quite unambiguously - either through the use of water-cannon, further arrests, bans of every kind, or hopelessly half-hearted re- forms - that what really lies behind all its talk of "restructuring" and "democratisation" is the pres- ervation of the existing totalitarian structures at all costs. "There will be no dialogue", declared Mr Štěpán breezily from the platform on Wenceslas Square and he went on to show what he meant in eloquent fashion the following day when he took persona} charge of the (happily erratic) water- cannon. There is only one possible interpretation of his words: abandon all hopes you may have of any real shift or change of direction. The cards are on the table. How the game will proceed from bere on is anyone's guess. While it is true that the water-cannon are not particularly functional, it is equally true that civic awareness will not suddenly start to function trouble-free after twenty years of neglect. So the game is not going to be an easy one - for any of the players. 1 [pageend3]What is most important is that the "game" has started at all: or more precisely, that it has entered a new phase - one in which it is impossible to pretend that there is nothing to play for. And as happens at such moments of truth, something has surfaced, as it always does when a totalitarian system of a Communist type gets itself into a crisis ( or alternatively, when it tries to reform itself). Its corner-stone and formal self-jus- tification: the notorious dogma of the leading role of the Communist Party - a dogma that is incom- patible with the democratic functioning of any constitution - has been called into question. In other words, the idea of PLURALISM has emerged, the idea that no ideology, doctrine or political farce should apriori and for all time (i.e. through constitutional legislation) dominate all others, but that everyone has an equal right to seek political power. There is nothing new about this, of course. As a result of the political ferment that we are wit- nessing almost everywhere in the Soviet bloc, the idea of pluralism is emerging all around us. The way the Communist leadership reacts to it varies from country to country. Gorbachov speaks of "socialist pluralism" by which he most likely means a plurality of views both within the Com- munist Party as the leading farce, and outside it. When Rakowski talks about political pluralism, he probably has in mind giving opposition forces a few seats in the government and parliament as a safety-valve for social discontent and a way of diverting attention away from his worst night- mare: trade-union pluralism. So far, it is the Hun- garian Party leader Imre Poszgay who has gone furthest in this direction, particularly in his unam- 2 biguous declaration that there would be no place at all in the new Hungarian constitution for a cla use stipulating the leading role of the Party. In Czechoslovakia, this idea was proclaimed openly in October in the manifesto of the recent- ly-created MOVEMENT FOR CIVIL LIBERTIES (HOS), sig- nificantly entitled DEMOCRACY FOR ALL. It is no coin- cidence that it happened this year in particular: if the time has come for putting cards on the table, then this card - the last, but in its way the most important of all - had to be played too. The value of the DEMOCRACY FOR ALL manifes- to does not reside in the originality of its thinking. Most of what it says has Jong been taken more or less for granted by all sensible people here (which does not mean to say that certain details of the manifesto might not prove controversial). lts value lies in the fact that it sets out all these different self- evident truths IN A SINGLE oocuMENT, and does so PUBLICLY, AS A BASIS FOR POLITICAL ACTIV- ITY, and not as someone's private viewpoint. What HOS will develop into only time will tel1. Maybe it will quickly become an integral fea- ture of our country's life, albeit one not particular- ly beloved of the regime ( rather like Charter 77). Perhaps it will remain for the time being merely the seed of something that will bear fruit in the dim and distant future. It is equally possible that the entire "matter" will be stamped on hard ( al- though criminal investigation has so far been in- itiated solely into "the matter", and no one has yet been charged or arrested in connection with it ). But whatever happens, one thing is already clear: the logic behind the constitutional enshrining of the leading role of one particular party has been openly called into question and these misgivings [pageend4]have been voiced and disseminated along with other fundamental concerns. This is of enormous significance. What has been done in this way can no longer be undone. This public declaration of the emperor's nakedness will go on sounding in the ears of all onlookers for so long as he remains without clothes, orat least until such a time as fear will have stopped up the last receptive ears (which is by now a most unlikely alternative ). Of course, many other hopeful things hap- pened in 1988 a part from that manifesto. But even if nothing else had happened it would have been a great deal. Whatever turn the game takes now, one thing is certain: it will be impossible to ignore this new card. Besides there is no telling whether this particular card could ever have been played without the others. The fact that 1988 saw an end to the taboo about the leading role of the Party ( among other things) as well as a call for the rehabilitation of politics may well be important in the Jong term. However, there is an issue that seems to me even more important for us in the here and now. I refer to a "leading role" of rather a different kind, namely, what is to gain the upper hand in the immediate future: the awakening spirit of free- dam, common sense and civic awareness, or the water-cannon? It could well be the water-cannon, of course. But its domination will certainly not last for ever. Soaking people to the skin and scaring them is one thing, eliminating civil discontent is another. Water-cannon are more likely to intensify the lat- ter, rather than eliminate it. Above all, there is no way now they will avert the logical consequences of the present political and economic events. Sowe should enter the new year without any illusions; but also with the assurance that the prison warder who talked to me in my cell on 28th October was not wrong when he said: You've got truth on your side!

The Editors 3 [pageend5]CZECHOSLOVAKIA 1988 CZECHOSLOVAKIA IN THE EUROPEAN CONTEXT, 1918-1988 ANNOUNCEMENTOFTHE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM CZECHOSLOVAKIA '88 By a strange coincidence, a number of fateful events in the recent history of the Czechs and Slovaks occurred in years ending in an eight. Con- sequently, this year we shall be commemorating several key anniversaries at the same time. And because of our country's specific geo-political cir- cumstances - amongst other reasons - the events in question had repercussions well beyond the national borders and indeed had a major impact on the history of the entire European continent. On each occasion, the course of European history was fundamentally changed, for better or worse. They were events that usually gave rise to a his- torical dilemma, and generally left some perma- nent mark on the continenťs history. On more than one occasion, an event that seemed to be of purely Czechoslovak importance either presaged various wider European developments or threw light on certain European aspirations or disasters. The creation of an independent Czecho- slovak state in 1918 and the collapse of the Austro- H ungarian monarchy totally transformed the Eu- ropean political map and were the key to sub- sequent developments in Europe and a prelude to 4 the coming dangers. The Munich diktat of 1938 and the policy of appeasement of violence that it came to symbolise were the main factors that encouraged and paved the way for Hitler's expan- sion and World War II. The coup d'Etat of Fe- . bruary 1948 was conceivably the final and crucial step towards the lasting division of Europe and the continued escalation ofthe Cold War. The Prague Spring of 1968 was the culmination of a period, dating back to the late fifties, during which at- tempts were made in various countries of the bloc to reform the Soviet-style system. The Soviet in- tervention brought that era to a tragic end. At the same time it was a test of how far the Brezhnev regime could go in consolidating Soviet super- power hegemony. And now, in 1988, there is a sense jn which Czechoslovakia is once again a historical testing ground. The contrast between political inertia and the need for change, high- lighted by the current developments in the USSR, is most obvious bere in Czechoslovakia. It could well be that it wm fall to our country to test the seriousness, depth and credibility of the new policies being pursued by the Soviet bloc. We have come to realise that our country's interna} situation, in terms of human dignity, de- mocracy, social barmany and tolerance, is inti- mately bound up with the overall European con- text and has always been in some way indicative of the prospects of peace on the continent. There were some Czechoslovak politicians in the past who showed an awareness of these linkages and [pageend6]of their own special responsibility. Hence a num- ber of major initiatives motivated by the ideal of a friendly and peaceful European community of sovereign democratic states originated in our country. And it is still a valid ideal in the eyes of Charter 77 and other independently-minded groups and individuals in Czechoslovakia. There are many of us who believe that it is actually more topical now than ever before and we are doing what we can to promote it, though our scope for action is limited. Incidentally, this helps explain Charter 77's constant insistence that human rights, a democratic order and mutual tolerance are the only rational basis for genuine and lasting peace. Clearly these are wide-ranging and complex issues, with many intellectual, spiritual and cultu- ral ramifications, which demand analysis and con- ceptual debate. In view of of this, we have decided to mark this year's anniversaries with an informal, independent symposium on the topic: Czecho- slovakia in the European context 1918-1988.

Charter 77 Document No 56/88 Prague, 16th November 1988 MINDLESS HARASSMENT OF "CZECHOSLOVAKIA 88" SYMPOSIUM Early last summer, a group of independent histo- rians together with other people with an interest in modem history decided to organise a sympo- sium around the four main watersheds in Czecho- slovakia's history (1918, 1938, 1948 and 1968), with particular reference to the violation and defence of human and civil rights. They were mo- tivated by the belief that every cultured nation has both the right and the duty to reflect freely on its past and assess its present situation, as well as to draw conclusions therefrom for its further devel- opment. The responsibility for preparing this spe- cialised gathering was assumed by representatives of independent initiatives who set up a steering committee and issued a document on 6th Septem- ber last announcing their intention to hold a sym- posium entitled "Czechoslovakia 88" and sub- titled "Czechoslovakia in the European context", from 11th to 13th November 1988. Invitations to the symposium were extended to experts from home and abroad, as well as to a number of offi- cial institutions. The steering committee saw no need to ask the Czechoslovak authorities for permission to hold the symposium since it was intended as a meeting of invited persons, not a public gather- ing. None the less, members of the steering com- mittee approached the Prague City Council and the Presidium of the Czechoslovak government in person to inform the representatives of those bodies of the symposium's objectives. On both occasions, the steering committee members re- ceived á positive response, and were even assured at the offices of the City Council that such initia- tives were useful and worthy of support. Nothing was said in the course of those meetings to suggest that there was any likelihood that the symposium would be banned. Severa} members of the steer- ing committee merely received warnings from of- ficers of the State Security Police that the sympo- sium was allegedly "contrary to the interests of the working people". As late as 9th November, it appeared that the symposium would go ahead without interference. Most of the foreign partici- 7 [pageend9]pants received entry visas, although some of them were cautioned. Only a handful of the foreign guests were refused visas. However, on the morning of 10th November, the Czechoslovak State Security Police launched a massive operation against confirmed and poten- tial participants in the symposium. From the early hours of that day, historians, Charter 77 signa- tories and members of other citizens' initiatives were taken away for questioning. About forty of them were detained, and the majority of them subjected to lengthy interrogations. More than twenty potential participants (including 75-year- old Dr Jiří Hájek) were held in remand cells, particularly at Ruzyně Prison. The majority were held in cells for over 48 hours. They even included citizens who had not intended to take part the symposium, and had not been involved in its prep- aration. lt was not until 10th November that the local council for the Prague 1 district issued an unlawful and absurd order banning the event, and of the organisers was formany notified of it in prison. On Friday 11th November, when the three- day symposium was due to open, the rendezvous points on Republic Square and in its vicinity were cordoned off by uniformed police, and other potential participants were arrested and taken away for questioning. The foreign participants assembled on 11 th November at 8:30 a.m. in the Hotel Paříž. They included the executive director of the Interna- tional Helsinki Federation, Gerald Nagler and the former Dutch Foreign Minister Max van der Stoel, together with representatives of national Helsinki committees, historians, journalists and 8 other distinguished personalities. At this point, the chairman of the symposium's steering com- mittee, Václav Havel, made an unexpected ap- pearance and announced to the foreign guests that the symposium participants were being ar- rested and that he too might be arrested at any moment. Without further ado he formany opened the "Czechoslovakia 88" symposium. Then, be- fore the gaze of everyone present, he was imme- diately led away by State Security officers and driven off to interrogation and prison. The foreign participants then wrote a sharp protest to the General Secretary of the Czechoslovak Commun- ist Party, Miloš Jakeš, and made representations to the State Security. They subsequently laid flowers on the grave of Professor Jan Patočka, one of the founders of Charter 77. In spite of large-scale police repression, the discussions continued in private apartments and in the cens at Ruzyně Prison. A parallel event along the same lines had been arranged in Vienna on 13th and 14th N ovember for those foreign participants who were unable to attend the Prague symposium. The Vienna participants were apprised of the thirty and more papers written for the Prague symposium. The participants in the Prague and Vienna symposia agreed that the Cze- choslovakia 88 symposium should remain open until such a time as Václav Havel would be able to bring it to a regular close in Prague. Papers already submitted to the symposium would be published in conected form, while an further con- tributions would be presented as "intended for the 'Czechoslovakia 88' standing symposium". The sabotage of the symposium and the wide- s pread police harassment of independently- [pageend10]minded Czechoslovak citizens received unusually wide coverage in the foreign media. The Czecho- slovak government has received protests about the intimidation from several other European governments, and the matter has also been raised at the Vienna follow-up meeting of the Helsinki Conference, where it was described as an act that grossly violated the principles both of the Con- ference and of the follow-up talks. The overall outcome of the harassment, therefore, is as fol- lows: 1. Far greater publicity for the symposium than it would have received had it taken place; 2. an enormous disgrace for the Czechoslovak auth- orities, who have demonstrated to representatives of civilised countries that they are among the most conservative in Europe (particularly in compari- son with Hungary, the Soviet Union and Poland, where several meetings of a similar kind have been held undisturbed in the recent period); 3. far from being ruined, the symposium was the more effective for what happened, and it will stay in existence - many experts and other interested parties who have learnt about it having expressed their desire to submit their own papers. As representatives of independent initiatives we adamantly protest against this police inter- ference and pase the question: who stood to gain from this preposterous police action, and ordered it - apparently at the last moment? We demand that the appropriate authorities - and chiefly gov- ernmental bodies- should condemn and thor- oughly investigate the operation. Such an investi- gation must take into account the enormous cost involved in this senseless and unlawful action and it should lead to sanctions, including occupational ones, against those responsible. At the same time, we would caution Czechoslovakia's political leaders that the longer they postpone a dialogue with the representatives of independent citizens' initiatives, the more the restlessness in our society will grow. For the fact is that increasing numbers of people are beginning to regard the work of the citizens' initiatives as a reflection of their own thinking and true aspirations. This was also the clear lesson of the recent demonstrations. What is required is an objective and tolerant attitude to these initiatives. The opening of a dialogue must not be postponed any longer. Otherwise it might be too late and the manifestations of general dis- content will become uncontrollable. On many previous occasions, Charter 77 and other citizens' initiatives have addressed their law- ful demands, critical letters and analyses to the Czechoslovak political authorities. Apart from . rare exceptions, they have never received any re- sponse from official bodies. We once more re- quest the opening of a rational dialogue between the authorities and aur representatives and a halt to absurd and unlawful repression.

Before he was arrested, when meeting us, Václav Havel de- clared the seminar opened. We consider the con- tinuation of this seminar about the significance of the anniversaries of 1918, 1938, 1948 and 1968 for Czechoslovakia and the whole of Europe be en- tirely legitimate. The disruption of the meeting is a blatant violation of the Helsinki Final Act. We therefore are filing our protest with the govern- ment of the ČSSR and informing all the CSCE delegations at the Vienna Review Conference. Prague, 11th November 1918 DECLARATION adopted by the participants of the Vienna meeting We, the participants of the Vienna meeting or- ganised in parallel with the Prague symposium "Czechoslovakia '88" 10 EXPRESS our support to those who in Czecho- slovakia attempt to carry aut a free and open discussion of their country's past and present; PROTEST against the violent police action against a peaceful historical seminar which was to be held in the Czechoslovak capital and in connec- tion with which dozens of Czech and Slovak cit- izens were arrested, some of them still being held in jail; AccusE the Czechoslovak authorities of fla- grant violations of the Helsinki Final Act and other international agreements duly signed by the Prague government; STATE that at a time when in some other Soviet bloc countries human and civil rights are enlarged, in Czechoslovakia, on the contrary, repression and police terror reign, resembling some of the worst periods of blind persecution; REQUEST that the Czechoslovak authorities immediately release all those who wanted to at- tend the Prague symposium and were arrested, as well as the other political prisoners, and apologise publicly for the unheard-of police action in Prague; ASK the Austrian representatives at the Con- ference for Security and Cooperation in Europe to submit on aur behalf this protest to the Czecho- slovak delegation to the Vienna Follow-up Con- ference. Vienna, 13th November 1988 [pageend12]Jacques Rupnik INTELLECTUALS AND THE POWER IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA This paper was sent to the symposium organisers in Prague and delivered in abridged form at the meeting in Vienna on 13th November 1988 "Le monde ne sera sauvé, s 'il peut l'etre, que par des insoumis. Sans eux c'en serait fait de notre civilisa- tion, do notre culture, de ce que nous aimions et qui donnait a notre existence sur cette terre une justifi- cation secrete. lls sont, ces insoumis, »le sel de la terre« et les responsables de Dieu. " André Gide, Joumal, 1939 "ft didn 't require great character at all our refusal, disagreement and resistance we had a shred of nec- essary courage but fundamentally it was a matter of taste." Zbigniew Herbert Perhaps nowhere else in post-war East-Central Europe has the dilemma of the intellectuals - tom between power and society - been more sharply focused than in Czechoslovakia. In 1948, the fair majority of the Czech (and to some extent the Slovak) intellectuals supported the Communist take-over; they identified with the new party-state and its ideology, which in turn rewarded them with the illusion of power and the realities of privilege. In 1988, the situation is quite the opposite: in the face of a relentless "normalisation" process, the intellectuals defy political authority and assume the role of the "conscience of nation". The missing link between these two contrasting situations is, of course, 1968: the triumph and the demise of the Czech intellectual; "enlightening" the ruler (the Party) in the Spring, expressing the resistance of a society in the long Winter which has not yet ended. The odyssey of the Czech intellectuals thus appears as a perfect illustration of the European intellectual's love affair with Marxism and Com- munism. It is the story of the "God that failed", and the protagonists insist that it can only be properly understood in its historical context: the gradual erosion of messianic ideals by the praxis of social engineering, the story of change within intellectual and political generations (A. J. Liehm). There is indeed a story to be told, but the 1968 version is too neat to be true; as always, it depends on who is telling the story. The last two decades brought a climate to introspection and critical re- examination of the role of the intellec- tuals. By revealing that there are different "stories", it challenged the hitherto prevailing li- near interpretation of post-war Czech intellectual history and restored pluralism and differentiation within the intelligentsia. I. The "Betrayal of the Clerks" Czcchoslovakia was the country where the Communists obtained the largest popular backing in Europe after the war: nearly 40 per cent in the relatively free elections of 1946.1 They also en- 11 [pageend13]joyed the broadest intellectual support. On the eve of the February 1948 take- over, the Commun- ists published a brochure entitled My Attitude To- wards the Communists Party (Můj vztah ke KSČ). The list of well-known writers and artists who gave their support reads like a Who's Who of Czecho- slovak intellectual elite of the time.2 In the pre- face, the Minister of Information ( and senior So- viet intelligence officer), Václav Kopecký, ex- plained this support by arguing that the Commun- ist Party had taken over the role of the bourgeoisie as the only force capable of uniting the interest of a class with that of the whole nation. Whether or not the impressive list of intellec- tuals who lent their names to the Party's campaign actually believed such rationalisations, it could be argued that the Czechoslovak Communists' suc- cess seemed to follow a Gramscian model: win- ning a "cultural hegemony" in society even before they actually held the complete monopoly on pol- itical power. The triumph and staying power of Czech Stalinism ( and conversely, the weakness of resistance to it) can be accounted for not just by the terror that came after 1948, but above all by the fact that the Communists conquered more than state power- they took over the system of values, the symbolic structure of the meaning that individuals and society give to their actions. The emergence of the "organic intellectual", confus- ing truth with political expediency, was not, in Czechoslovakia, the result of terror but of "con- viction". "The pressure of the state machine is nothing compared with the pressure of a convinc- ing argument," wrote Czeslaw Milosz. In The Cap- tive Mind, he gave us memorable portraits of Pol- ish intellectual seduced by the "new faith" that came in from the East: former Catholic nationa- 12 lists (Andrzejewski) and survivors of the death camps; pre-war fellow travellers and post-war converts, sometimes returning from exile (Gal- czynski, Slonimski). A mixture of fascination and a feeling of impotence, opportunism and the need to belong to an irresistible and irreversible farce of History. "Why did I become a Communist?" asks the main character in Milan Kundera's novel The Joke, and explains that it was the excitement of belonging to a movement which was at the "steer- ing wheel of history". 'J\.t the time we could really decide the fate of the people" - they were not just "dizzy with power" but intoxicated at the prospect of mastering history as well.3 Marx, after all, de- clared that the task of the intellectuals was no longer to interpret the world but to change it. Thus understanding "utopia in power" refers to the ancient divide between vita activa and vita con- templativa. But there is also, Milosz suggested, an ele- ment of deceit, what he called "the art of the ketman", of outward conformism transposed from the Islamic to the Communist world. To the point when it became unclear who was deceiving whom: to what extend was "the power" aware ( and how much did it mind) being deceived by the writer? Or might not the conformist writer in the end be deceiving only himself? In his short story Edward and God, Kundera makes a similar point that the ultimate intention of the Communists is to defeat "truth" rather then simply to vanquish politically: "If I obstinately told a man the truth to his face, it would mean that I am taking him seriously. And to take something so unimportant seriously means to become less than serious oneself. I, you see, must lie, if I don't [pageend14]want to take madmen seriously and become one of them myself." Beyond the paradoxes of fascination and de- ceit, a deeper explanation for the appeal of com- munism at the end of the war was the collapse of the old world and its values. Jan Patočka observed that Masarykian liberal rationalism was not enough in the age of Hitler and Stalin. There was widespread contempt in Centra} Europe for libe- ral values and politics, which accounts at least in part for the weak resistance to Communism. As John Dos Passos put it: to be liberal or a social democrat at the end of the war was like drinking small beer. A few specifically Czech traits may, however, facilitate comparisons. To trace the origins of the inte/lectuel engagé in Czechoslovakia, one has to recall that, since the decimation of the Czech nobility in the 17th century, it was the intellectuals (writers, scholars, etc.) who took over as the elite of the nation. In the 19th century, before a bour- geoisie had developed, the intellectuals took a leading part in the "national revival", with its emphasis on language and history. Culture be- came a substitute for politics. Whereas in Paland and Hungary, intellectual and political elites were aristocratic, the Czech intellectuals were of ple- beian origin. This also accounts for the differences in style of intellectual and political discourse: in contrast to the spirit of defiance and inde- pendence of the elites in the two neighbouring countries, the Czech intellectuals were "realists", proud of their close identification with the people. The power of the written word was somewhat overvalued while political power was often des- pised or underestimated. The Dichter and Denker were naturally held in high esteem. The newly created state in 1918 was a "Republic of the Pro- fessors". Masaryk was the President- philosopher and Beneš, his successor, was an academic, too. (Even in the 1960's, an opinion poll showed that university professors were still considered to top the social status scale. This, I presume, would no longer be the case today.) Every week, President Masaryk would attend a literary salon held by the Čapek brothers. Could one imagine a contempor- ary statesman doing the same? Culture in Bohemia was, however, always more "progressive" than politics.4 When, in the 19th century, Czech political representation was still conservative, the intellectuals were liberal. When liberal politicians took over, the intellec- tuals were democrats. After the First World War, as Czechoslovak political leadership became democratic, the intellectuals were moved to the radical Left. This, of course, is an over-simplification, but it can be said that the inter-war relationship be- tween Czech intellectuals and politics resembled ( and was much influenced by) the French pattern. To be an intellectual was almost synonymous with being on the left. lndeed, the Czechoslovak and French Communist Parties were, after the advent of Nazism in Germany, the two largest CP's in democratic Europe. And it is because they oper- ated in a democratic environment that they were able to attract a substantial section of this intellec- tuals and at the same time build an extremely resilient Stalinist protection shield to insulate themselves from the contagion of democratic en- vironment. Gottwald was the Czech Maurice Tho- rez and even the split between Communists and surrealists had its Czech equivalents: Vítězslav Nezval was the Czech Aragon while Karel Teige, 13 [pageend15]the theoretician of the artistic avant-guarde, sided with Breton. Such controversies within the intel- lectual left were considered a normal part of intel- lectual life.5 It was only after the war that they became deadly serious. Harassed by the regime, Teige died prematurely of a hart attack in 1950. Záviš Kalandra, a talented Marxist philosopher and historian, was sentenced to death in the very first of the show trials of the Stalinists era. In Paris, André Breton wrote an open letter to the poet Paul Eluard (who knew Kalandra well), to in- tercede on behalf of the Czech writer. Eluard replied with a memorable excuse: "I am too busy defending the innocent who claim their innocence to deal with guilty people who admit their guilt." If Communists had seized power in France after the war, it is a fair guess that their reign of terror would have been as murderous as it has been in Czechoslovakia. In 1945, Czechoslovak intellec- tuals did not have the impression of severing their traditional ties with the West in endorsing the "new faith" from the East. After all, leading intel- lectuals in Paris were undergoing a similar conver- sion (without, of course, having to suffer the con- sequences ). Liberals, like Karel Čapek, the country's leading writer of the inter- war generation, did try to argue against the radical drift of the intelligent- sia, but with limited success. In 1924, he published a piece entitled: Why am I not a Communist? It argued against Communism's "pessimism and dis- mal hatred pumped artificially" into the working class. There is no proletarian culture, he declared. "Whatever cultural values we have left reside in the middle class, or so-called intellectual class. The proletariat can claim its share of this tradition and work within it, but if Communism just rushes 14 on ahead and rejects everything it calls bourgeois culture, then goodbye, nothing will be left." The liberal generation of the First Republic (Masaryk, Šalda, Čapek etc.) disappeared on the eve of or during the war. But it was Munich, the betrayal by the West, which played a decisive part in the shift eastwards ( and to the left) of the new post-war generation. The collapse of Masaryk's Republic meant also the collapse of the values associated with it. The Communist Party seemed best equipped to capture the aspirations to radical change, as Pavel Kohout recalled in a 1964 article: "For my generation the arrival of Russian tanks was a real miracle ... The perspective of a so- cialist revolution seemed to be the only starting point... Our enemies wanted to restore capitalism. Most of all, I liked being the poet of the revol- ution. It was an era of great faith that around the corner was the time when the best ideals of hu- manity would be realised. I am not ashamed of that faith, whatever I called it, Stalin or anything else. The poet - unlike the judges - has the right to believe." But Kohout, the believer, also wrote poetry celebrating the judges passing death sentences on those reluctant to march cheerfully towards the radiant future. His Dia,y of a Counter-Revolution- ary is an honest account but not an explanation of what happened. For that, one has to go back to what is known as František Halas' Testament (ac- tually written by his friend Jindřich Chalupecký), the first work to analyse the mechanisms of the cultural Gleichschaltung. This short essay (which deserves to be rediscovered) remains the first serious attempt by a leading Czech intellectual to account for what Julien Benda called the "be- trayal of the clerks". Going back to Plato and [pageend16]Marx (but without neglecting the more mundane mechanisms of control and manipulation) he traced the origins of the intellectuals' support for "utopia in power". Professor Václav Černý (with Jan Patočka possibly the most important, yet a marginal intel- lectual figure of the post-war period), gives an even less generous interpretation. In his Memoirs (1984), he paints a devastating picture of the Communist generation "class of 1948": zealots and opportunists, careerists quick to lead the purge and grab the vacant job while the going was good. This, he concludes, was a spineless and, on the whole, intellectually mediocre generation (the abundant quotations he gives make painful if often amusing reading). True, there is bitterness, often unfairness in his uncompromising account; but only a scholar of his stature and of his gener- ation (born in 1905, like Sartre, whose existential- ism was his philosophical inspiration, and Aron, with whom he shared the privilege of being for four decades the lonely spectateur engagé proved- right-in-the-end) could write so freely about the demise of Czech intellectuals. II. 1958-1968: Reason and Conscience The XXth Congress brought the period of "gardening in a cemetery" (Šalda) to an end and opened the period of soul-searching. Between 1956 and 1968, Czech and Slovak intellectuals denounced the crimes of the Stalinist era in the name of the socialist values and ideals. After 1968, it was the otherway round: they renounced social- ist ideas in the name of the crimes committed after '48 and again after '68. (This dialectic of "crimes and ideals" is by no means unique to the Stalinist period. French intellectuals initially denounced slavery in the name of Enlightenment. Many of their 20th-century successors denounced Western values in the name of the crimes or injustices attributed to colonialism.) The intellectual foundations of Czech "revi- sionism" (1956-1968) were remarkably similar to those of Paland and Hungary; a critique of Stalin- ism in the name of the "Young Marx" and the "Old Engels", an increasingly elastic concept of social- ist ideology. Above all it marked the assertion of the primacy of ethics over politics, of the Kantian categorical imperative over the Marxian laws of history and the principie that the end justifies the means. The best illustration of both aspects can be found in the writings of Karel Kosík, The Dia- lectic of the Concrete (1963), and his 1968 essay on "Reason and Conscience". Kosík's influence was, in this respect, comparable to that of Kolakowski in Paland and Lukács in Hungary. Czech revisionism had its hour of glory in 1968, though it had already experienced an abor- tive launch in 1956. At the Writers' Congress in April 1956, the poets Jaroslav Seifert and Franti- šek Hrubín spoke in terms remarkably similar to those of Po Prostu in Warsaw or of the Petófi Circle in Budapest. "Let us hope," said Seifert, "that we can now be the conscience of the nation. Beca use, believe me, I think that we have failed in that task. During all these years we have neither been the conscience of the nation, nor even our own con- science." The main difference with the situation in Pa- land and Hungary, however, was the isolation of the intellectuals from society. The Hungarian Revolution could easily be used by the apparatus to put the lid tightly back on. This accounts for 15 [pageend17]another feature of Czech "revisionism": Because it was politically frustrated it was sublimated into cultural life which contributed to give it, in the 1960's, an exceptional richness and intensity. And because political de- stalinisation was delayed, it eventually came with a vengeance. The Writers' Congress of June 1967 was the culmination of the intellectuals' conflict with the political leadership which foreshadowed the Prague Spring. It was primarily the work of the 1948 generation re- covering from its Stalinist hangover - compensat- ing ( sometimes overcompensating) for its past failures. A "revolution within the revolution", 1968 marked the apotheosis of political influence of the intellectuals acting as a bridge between the Party and the people, "enlightening" the ruler while expressing the democratic aspirations of society. No less importantly, they were trying to redefine their own role as intellectuals, which had been compromised by the experience of the 1950's. Hence the demonstratively heretical tone and substance of much of the 1968 soul-searching. The tanks of August crushed the hopes of "socialism with a human face" and the intellec- tuals' attempt to salvage the ideals of their youth by correcting the abuses of Stalinism. Yet, para- doxically, many experienced the defeat as a libe- ration, a reconciliation with their nation. In his Diary of a Counter-Revolutionary, Pavel Kohout wrote: "For the first time, after twenty years, I have the sensation of belonging to the nation." Milan Kundera wrote that the tragic days of Au- gust were "the most beautiful week in our lives". The novelist and former Charter 77 spokesperson Eva Kantůrková recently described it as the "ex- pulsion from paradise", the prime virtue of which 16 was that "the one time critical loyalist finally found themselves in the same position as the rest of the nation". Defeat was given as evidence of the grandeur of the Czechoslovak experiment. In a famous ar- ticle published at the end of 1968, Kundera argued that "the significance of the Czechoslovak autumn is perhaps greater than that of the Czechoslovak Spring". In a similar vein, Eduard Goldstiicker, the Chairman of the Writers' Union, wrote an article entitled "The Power of the Weak". One way of understanding this eulogizing of weakness and the virtues of defeat at a time ( end of 1968) when the roll-back of reformism was already under way (with the participation of the Dubček leadership ), is to see that for the Com- munist intellectuals, August 1968 was a tragic yet purifying, liberating experience. It proved in con- trario that their intentions had been honourable since an invasion was needed to crash them. In the words of one samizdat author (Sládeček-Pithart) "it relieved the Communist intellectuals of the feeling of responsibility" for the regime's past mis- deeds. Nor were they to share the responsibility for the return to the ice age of neo-Stalinism. Under "normalisation" they shared ( at last!) the fate of their nation. This, of course, sheds a different light on the role of the Communist intellectuals in 1968: Was it for them, above all, an attempt to settle old scores with "the power" and their own past? Škvo- recký's novel Mirákl provides devastating (and very funny) portraits along these lines. Was the purpose of 1968 merely to correct 1948? As Slá- deček put it: "Was improved socialism to belong to all, or were all, once again, to belong to social- ism ?" These are merely some of the questions [pageend18]raised in samizdat literature over the last decade and they are obviously loaded ones. Their purpose is not "objectivity" or fairness to the individuals involved, but a challenge to the interpretation of post-war Czechoslovak intellectual history as given by the Communist intellectuals themselves: from the innocence of youthful revolutionary idealism to the original sin ofStalinist terror, from the "purification" of 1968 to the purgatory of "normalisation". The Communist intellectuals had a tendency to use the collective "we", claim- ing always to speak for all intellectuals, often for the Party, sometimes for the nation. In fact they were mostly speaking for themselves, the ( admit- tedly important) Communist generation, the class of 1948. This collective "we" has been challenged since 1968. When Karel Kosík published his fa- mous essay "Our Present Crisis", another philos- opher, Ivan Sviták, replied with a piece: "Your Present Crisis". Kundera's meditations on the "Czech Fate" were answered in February 1969 by Václav Havel. For Havel the return of free speech and basic civil rights can hardly be presented as an earth-shattering novelty, as a return to the centre of world history, since for most people outside the Communist milieu this was merely the return to "normalcy", to something that had already existed in Czechoslovakia and that was still enjoyed in most civilised countries. In the end, the reform- minded Communist intellectuals presented as their greatest achievement what the rest of the society saw as the undoing of the nonsense to which they had contributed some twenty years earlier. In a 1986 interview Havel described his rela- tionship with the "revisionist" intellectuals in 1968 as follows: "They represented something like a cultural establishment. For us younger non- communists there were many things in their en- deavour that were close to us; they were naturally a preferable alternative to the sclerotic bureau- cracy of Novotný and its prominent dogmatists; nevertheless they too had, from our point of view, their »limits« (today, of course, they have mostly overcome them ). We found in their activity a num- ber of problematic elements: from illusionism, paying tribute to old ideological schemes, a con- stant obsession with tactics, a lack of thorough- ness and even infantilism to unabashed identi- fication with their »establishment« status which they considered as a matter of fact: The idea that someone else could speak on certain issues was for them inconceivable. They had a tendency to extend their persona} experience to all. They al- ways spoke of themselves as a generation rather than its communist component." The "normalisation", by giving control over official cultural life to a handful of discredited third rate hacks, also swept aside the reform- communist "establishment". The independent countér-culture of the 1970'created a new "equality" of access to publishing. It also modified the hitherto prevailing terms of the debate. Two themes are worth mentioning for the purpose of our analysis. 1. For the non-Commun- ist intellectuals, 1968 was the first occasion to have their voice heard. For them 1968 was more than a belated effort from above to correct the "defor- mations" of socialism; it was above all a key mo- ment in the revival of civil society and of truly free intellectual life (a point made in 1988 interviews with the author by V. Havel, J. Gruša, V. Bělohradský, and J. Němec). 2. The "cultural Biafra". 17 [pageend19]The tragedy of Czech culture did not start in 1968, but in 1948. The origins of independent cultural life and samizdat have to be traced to the Stalinist period. It suffices to read Jiří Kolář's diary, now published under the title Eyewitness ("Today, the greatest perversion, eccentricity, absurdity, is to tel1 the truth and see the face of the world as it is", 1. 1. 1949), the writings of V. Effenberger and the surrealists, or Jindřich Chalupecký's On the mar- gi,ns of art (1988) to understand that parallel cul- ture developed ( admittedly on a small scale) the very day communist intellectuals seized power over the realm of culture. Jan Vladislav, one of the founder of literary samizdat some forty years ago, puts as it follows: "In reality, the history of Czech - and in cer- tain cases of Slovak- spiritual resistance goes back to the Communist take-over of February 1948. At that period, a considerable number of intellectuals, university teachers, students and ar- tists were excluded from public activity as a result of harsh administrative measures. Many of them, including two score of the country's writers were even arrested and jailed in the fifties, while a still greater number were deprived of any opportunity of working in their chosen disciplines. Numerous authors were expelled from the official Writers' Union and lost all chance of being published. Czechoslovak intellectuals virtually split into two camps at that time: on the one band, there were those who accepted the cultural policies of the new regime - either from conviction or out of op- portunism, and on the other, there were those who, in one way or another, realised the danger then facing the spiritual identity of every individ- ua} and of the national society as a whole, and sought to confront it by going on working accord- 18 ing to the dictates of their own conscience, though deprived of any prospect of public expression." (Kolář, Hrabal, Patočka, Černý, etc.) III. 1968-1988: Intellectuals and anti-politics After 1968, the intellectuals who had been so active during the Prague Spring also became the prime target of the repression that followed. For Czech intellectuals ( the situation was markedly differentin Slovakia ), the post-'68 period could be described as a shift from power to society, from politics to "anti-politics". By breaking with politi- cal power, the intellectual rediscovered his/or her role as a moral counter-power. In a recent essay Jan Vladislav put it as follows: "Even if they do not strive directly for power in the community, in a sense they have it regard- less. lt is power of a particular kind, however. In general it operates outside the established power structures, which is probably one of the main rea- sons why the powerful consider this kind of power so dangerous even though its resources consist exclusively of words and ideas." This new role of the intellectual entailed two aspects: 1. the politics of counter-culture; 2. the ethics of spiritual resistance. 1. Over the last twenty years the Czech intel- lectuals have resumed their traditional role in- herited from the 19th century. In the face of a massive onslaught on society by a totalitarian power, the sphere of culture became the ultimate rampart against "normalisation"/sovietisation. On the one band, the underground of parallel culture was, for the intellectual, an emancipation from political and ideological constraints of the [pageend20]past; from censorship and self-censorship. On the other band, it restored the role of culture as a sub- stitute for politics. Hence another danger: Should independent culture "serve" society the same way it served the Party and its ideology in the past? In "totalitarian conditions", says Havel, this can be a double-edged weapon: it gives to any intellectual activity a dimension it does not have in open societies - an "added radioactivity" - otherwise people would not be put in jail for their writings. But it also has its trappings any writer should be aware of: those of a literature with a "message". 2. Ethical anti-politics. The emergence of the Charter 77 human rights movement has created a new situation for the Czech intellectuals: after the emancipation from power came the defiance of power. Václav Černý saw in the Charter "a milestone in the culture development of the nation, a moment in the history of Czech spirit, restoring the moral backbone, reviving the feeling for law, justice, human <lignity, and the will for truth. It was a warning and a reminder to power- holders, all of them everywhere ... ". lt was undoubtedly Jan Patočka, the philos- opher, who became thespiritus movens in the shift from politics to the ethics of resistance. In his famous piece of January 1977 entitled What Char- ter 77 /s and What ft /s Not, he stated: "No society, no matter how good its technological foundations, can function without a moral foundation, without conviction that has nothing to do with opportun- ism, circumstances and expected advantage. Mor- ality, however, does not just exist to allow society to function, but simply to allow human beings to be human. Man does not define morality accord- ing to the caprice of his needs, wishes, tendencies and cravings; it is morality that defines man ... (it) is aimed exclusively at cleansing and reinforcing the awareness that a higher authority does exist. .. " The regime's hysterical campaign against the Charter merely reinforced this notion that the challenge was primarily a moral rather than a pol- itical one. This accounted for the strength and the appeal of the intellectuals' ethics of resistance, but also for some of its limitations. As Petr Pithart observed, in the face of a power obsessed merely with self-preservation, the intellectual obtains al- most automatically a monopoly on "truth". The danger would be to confine the intellectual to a virtuous ghetto existence. The Catholic philosopher Václav Benda was the first to suggest the extension of ethical resist- ance to the creation of parallel structures; from the assertion of the responsibility of each individ- ua} for the fate of society as a whole to the creation of a "parallel Polis". The thinking was rather simi- lar to Michnik's "new evolutionism", but the self- organisation of civil society did not materialise in Czechoslovakia ( except in the cultural sphere ). The passivity of an atomised society, the absence of independent institutions such as the Polish church, the intellectuals' preoccupation with a threatened European cultural identity (rather than with the mobilising powers of nationalism) all mark important differences between the Czechs and Polish intellectuals' attempts to estab- lish ties with society in the late 1970' and early 1980's. The Czech intellectual <lid not manage to reach out to society as did his Polish counterpart. By the same token he avoided also having to "compete" for moral authority with the Church or with Solidarity. In Prague, he preserved his "mon- opoly" on moral indignation. 19 [pageend21]This led him sometimes to rationalise his so- cially marginal yet spiritually centra} role. In the tacit "social contract" between Communist power and a consumer-oriented society, the intellectual is the only one for whom the terms of the contract remain fundamentally unacceptable (Liehm, 1973). One can find in Havel's writings a critique of the nature of power (influenced by Patočka and Bělohradský: "the impersonal rule of the mega- machines which escape human control") and a parallel critique of a society succumbing, taking part in the "totalitarian lie". Respected, even admired by society for his courage to "Jive in truth" (which it does not have ), feared by the powers-that-be for relentlessly ex- posing their illegitimacy, the Czech intellectual's cultural and ethical subtitutes for politics place him in a difficult yet in many ways gratifying posi- tion: he alone holds the symbolic power of the written word and on moral defiance. Virtuous, yet isolated, he sometimes wishes to be relieved from the burden of the nation's conscience and be "just a writer". Havel's play Largo Desolato is a moving depiction of the intel- lectual over-burdened with demands by society, tired of his role as the "professional supplier of hope". Yet he cannot escape that role because it is, after all, his destiny as an intellectual. Since the death of Jan Patočka following nearly a whole day's police interrogation, Václav Havel has become the pivota} figure of the Czech intellec- 20 tuals' spiritual resistance, and is best qualified to speak about "the tragedy of fate stemming from responsibility; about the futility of all human en- deavours to break out of the role that responsi- bility has imposed; about responsibility as des- tiny". NOTES 1 1\vo main pre-war political parties, the Czech Agrarian Party and the Slovak People's Party, were banned. 2 An important distinction should be made between the literary elite and the academic community. The former, for a variety of reasons (ranging from a "bourgeois back- ground" guilt complex to a dubious wartime record) gave their support to the Party. The scholarly community (in- cluding the students) was more reserved and therefore sub- jected to a drastic purge after 1948. Among the great scholars it suffices to mention the contrast between Profes- sors Václav černý and Jan Patočka, who resisted, and Pro- fessors Bohuslav Havránek and Jan Mukařovský, who gave in. 3 Kundera's most interesting exploration of the subject is to be found in his novel Life is elsewhere. 4 See V. Kořán, Promarněná příležitost, in Svědectví (1ěmoignage ), 1983, No. 70-71. 5 For instance: André Gide's Retour d 'USSR was immedi- ately translated into Czech (by Bohumil Mathesius who later translated Cholokhov!) provoking a sharp rebuff (Anti-Gide) by S. K Neumann (formerly an anarchist poet who had never been in the USSR!). [pageend22]Václav Havel A NEGLECTED GENERATION This is the full text of Havel's address to the Literary Section of the Conference "Czechoslo- vakia 1918-1988: Seven Decades from lnde- pendence", held by the University of Toronto, October 28-30, 1918 Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity to send you all my warmest greetings. Like many of my fellow citizens, I'm delighted that Czechoslovakia has not been forgotten in the world, and that even in far-off Toronto, you are commemorating some of its important anniversaries. And I'm especially glad that you're not merely commemorating it with a celebration, or on the contrary, with a memorial service of some kind, but with actual work, that is, by holding a meeting of experts ca- pable of making a qualified assessment of what the events recalled by these anniversaries actually mean. It is no mere coincidence, but rather a proof of kindred feeling, that we here in Czecho- slovakia intend to mark these anniversaries in a similar way, that is, with a symposium. I firmly believe that some of you, at least, will attend, and will be able to report to us on the proceedings in Toronto. I would like to contribute to the discussions of your literary section with some brief, and there- fore only general, remarks. Iťs a well known fact that for many years, Czechoslovak literature has been artificially divided, not only into literature officially publish- ed at home and samizdat literature, but also into domestic literature and exile literature. My remarks concem the drastic splitting of Czechoslovak litera ture within the country, which took place twenty years ago. Twenty years is not a negligible period of time. One indication of this is that the dividing line no longer lies between those who were banned from publishing their work after 1968 and 1969 and those who, in what- ever way, managed to avoid that fate. In other words, it is no longer the case that we have Ludvík Vaculík on the one hand and Ivan Skála on the other - to name a symbolic representative of each of the two camps. For one thing, literature has never been, and certainly is not today, an activity indulged in only by people over fifty. In the past twenty years, several literary generations have in- evitably grown up. They are generations of auth- ors too young to have been involved in any way in the events of 1968 and as a result, they were not automatically either favoured or rejected by the state. These younger authors - unlike we older ones - began their writing careers in the divided situation of today, and because theywere unburd- ened by past reputations, thay had essentially more space to manoeuvre than we did. That is, they could make up their minds where they be- longed at the very outset. And this, in fact, is what they did, and in so doing, divided themselves accordingly too. Same of them immediately and quite con- sciously lowered their own standards and expec- ta tions simply to make themselves acceptable to 21 [pageend23]the powers that be. Such writers are, I think, the least interesting. A second group is more interesting: those who used their advantage of their unsullied repu- tations not to establish an easy career for them- selves, but for something else within the field of permitted or tolerated literature: they tried to go as far as they could, even at the risk of getting burned, and in this way, they managed to extend the limits of the possible. Occasionally they were banned, occasionally they were allowed to pub- lish. Sometimes the state supported them, at other times it rejected them, but they were never entire- ly banished from cultural life and placed on the index of official enemies of the state that so many of their older colleagues had found themselves on. Their work is important and, as a matter of fact, it isn't all that different from what many older and today banned authors were doing ten or twenty years before. But this is not the group I want to mention today; they are well known and enjoy the - greater or lesser - favour of both the public and even of the more circumspect representatives of power. The group I really want to draw your atten- tion to is the third, which, in many ways is not only the most important, but also the most often over- looked or ignored. I'm referring to those writers who have quite consciously and freely decided to operate in this area of independent culture and samizdat, rather than take part in the struggles on the battlefield of official literature. At the very beginning of their literary careers, they have joined forces with those who are already "branded", since publishing in samizdat usually 22 leads to one being immediately included on the black list. Why did they do it? Simply because their opinions, the nature of their talents, their atti- tudes, interests and work, and of course their moral consistency, all very naturally led them to the decision. They were not driven out of the official sphere, they simply refused to enter it in the first place. Their notions of what should be written about, and how it should be said, simply did not fit into the official framework. These young authors - and there are more than just a few of them - are, if I may put it this way, out- casts by choice. The world of samizdat is not a pro- visional solution for them, nor a substitute for something more genuine, but an entirely natural space in which they can authentically realize themselves. These writers are often forgotten, and if they are not, then they tend to be gratuitously lumped together as eternal beginners, as outsiders among outsiders. And this happens despite the fact that they may well represent our best hope for the future of literature, a hope that is the focus of all our hopes, because in a few years, they may be the only ones in whom a genuinely free spirit survives. Of course as far as officialdom is concerned, these people do not exist. If we leave aside the occasional interest of the police, they don't even enjoy the abusive attention that we do. Moreover, they are seldom taken very seriously even on the other, freer end of our intellectual and spiritual continuum: for the past twenty years, our inde- pendent literature bere at home has for most people - including most exiles and foreigners in general- been represented by the same set of [pageend24]names (Vaculík, Klíma, Pecka, Havel and so on), that is, names of those who already managed to build themselves a reputation when the printing presses were still available to them. It sounds paradoxical, but it sometimes seems that only those who have, at one time, published here in Czechoslovakia, are considered worthy of the no- toriety of being unpublished authors today; as though the degree of respect one gains through samizdat were determined by the degree to which a person was, once upon a time, not dependent on it. It may even seem that the only person who may become a symbol of resistence to censorship are those whose work was once passed by the censor. Meanwhile the rest, who thanks to their age and their uncompromising na ture have never publish- ed anything officially at all, remain slightly suspect as writers. I can well imagine what some of my eminent colleagues will object to in my conclusions: "But where are their works?" they will say. '~ter all, they do not write as well as we do." Such an objection, however, is not really an objection at all, but rather a confirmation of what I have been saying, since it is based on the doubtful assump- tion that only we, the older and formerly published writers, are competent to decide what is good. But the fact is that we cannot decide this. Literature has its own life. It is essentially pluralistic; no one has the exclusive key to literature's ultimate evalu- ation, much less to any centralized control of it. Some will like one thing, others something else, and no one can compel anyone else to like some- thing he does not, nor can anyone turn his likes and dislikes into an instrument of power. I said this once to my publishing colleagues in the Union of Writers when they objected to the officially published magazine Tvář, and I say it again today - albeit in a very different situation - to my un- published friends at home, when t~ey pay little or no attention to their own never-published young- er colleagues. And if my imaginary critic were to object that he is restricting no one, I would object in turn that although his attitude hinders no one directly - since he doesn't have the tools at his disposal anyway - indirectly ( and more involun- tarily than consciously) it sometimes is a hind- rance. When we, who are independent but well- known authors, behave as though those younger, unpublished writers did not exist, it has an inevit- able consequence, one that, from a certain point of view, serves the interests of those in power. It means that exile publishing houses and magazines do not get to know about them, not to mention foreign publishing houses; the critics don't know about them, and they are not even taken seriously by those who might provide them with some tech- nical or other assistance. At the same time, these "unknown, unpublished writers" are often un- known (lS well because once, in the early stages of their writing careers, some of us who were better known served as models to them on their way to independence. Does this not mean that we bear a special responsibility to them? We can't very well claim that the place of the true poet today is not in the bookshops but in the pillory - and at the same time consider a younger colleague who took us at our word and submitted to the pillory as slightly suspect because he was never in the bookshops! Perhaps the younger writers I am talking about will not care for my support and in any case, 23 [pageend25]they will make their way without my help. But I'm not saying all this merely for their benefit. I am saying it for all of us, for literature as a whole, and that means for myself as well. For none of what we create will continue to be good if it silently accepts the possibility that it may squeeze someone else's creation - however indirectly and undeliberately - out of contention.

And that, certainly, is not how we want to end up. Thank you for your attention. (Translated from the Czech by Paul Wilson) bacillus reads a paper about how it affected his early poetry, and a National Theatre actor reads an extract as illustration ... Flabbergasted, you draw breath to ask a question and the 'flu virus knocks you sideways. Our protagonist protests vigorously against this hijacking ofhis party, when he is gripped by a coronary which leads him away for some bed rest. And that, dear reader, is exactly how we, the admirers, friends and family of the Czechoslovak Republic celebrated its seventieth birthday. Ever since, I have been looking for the most apt way to convey our amazement at the sheer brazenness of its notorious and long standing adversaries who, when it was bom, regarded it as no more than a temporary affliction, and then went on to use it as a battlefield in their fight for power, before finally, over the past forty years treating it as their feudal fief. Now all of a sudden bere they are, edging their way in among the democrats, elbow- ing aside those who have always held the First Republic in esteem: those who felt the same way about it last year, just as they did twenty or even fifty years ago. Wherever did these cheeky tykes [pageend26]ever hear about Masaryk and Štefánik, seeing that the school history-books they imposed make no mention of either of them? N ow they strut around like the heirs and executors of republican democ- racy a la Masaryk. To err is human. Fools can too. The trouble is that when fools realise their mistakes it means further - unforseeable - disaster. For they haven't the sense or strength of character to mend their ways. Even quite clever people can make mistakes - as I did, for instance, when - fool that I am - I encouraged you to come with me to the governmenťs celebration of lndependence Day. But I had in mind ten thousand of you. I didn 't pull it off. Only two of us turned up. Well, at least the next day our own "Young Czechs" were true to their word. They've stopped relying on us any more and are beginning to assemble their thou- sands one by one. When someone starts to acknowledge a past which up until then they have been trying to erase, one may rightly expect some sort of explanation - failing an apology. After all, there are still people around who went to prison for speaking of Masa- ryk or Beneš, or showing loyalty to their legacy. The explanation - which is not forthcoming - is quite simple: good old Perestroika again - but in its Czech version, i.e. repaint the facade and leave the structure intact. To organise a celebration of National Independence Day on the 27th and then, on the 28th - the actual anniversary - to have the streets cleared by truncheon-wielding cops: such actions are two faces of the same government policy and encapsulate their thinking. The truth is that they had no intention of recognising some- thing that cannot be suppressed. No, they wanted to take it over. Having commandeered the wor- kers' cause, the cause of the philosophers and the cause of the social utopians and poets, they now want to appropriate the nation's cause, after hav- ing done their best to ignore it up to now. First they degraded May Day. Then they defiled harmless Mothers' Day. Christmas was eviscerated. This year iťs the turn of our national lndependence Day to receive the treatment: ifyou're good you'll get - but only on 27th October; on the 28th we'll get black-and-blue pudding- and they'll use aur own flesh for it. So long as they held to the view that national states should not exist, they did all they could to consign them to oblivion. Now that they have come to realise that national states will go on existing regardless, they are desperately trying to find a pedigree for the cme they have been dragging around for years. And I have to tel1 you that such behaviour doesn't appeal to me, not even as an erstwhile member of the Communist Party. I maintain that for communists Masaryk should continue to be an agent of imperialism, Beneš a traitor to the na- tion, and pre-war Czechoslovakia a tool of capi- talist pl0ts against the Soviet Union. But this lot are ready to betray the Slovak Soviet Republic of 1919 for a mess of pottage, and stab the Decem- ber 1920 General Strike in the back, as well as abandon their youthful dreams of dissolving na- tions and creating a people of motley race. In my book they are opportunists and I'm glad I'm not one of them. I was late for the government demonstration on 27th October. I arrived back in Prague at mid- day but when I heard who they had arrested and whose places had been searched, I first had to do 25 [pageend27]a spot of tidying up at home. I got to Wenceslas Square when the spotlights were switched off and the loudspeakers had fallen silent. Defeated with- out a battle, I made my way down the square, with heavy heart and limbs. I turned off Příkopy into Rytířská Street and there stood Jaroslav Putík looking at a window-display of winter coats. "Nothing happened, then?" says he. "The others didn't turn up," says I. There followed a filthy November. Fog, smog and bad tidings. The "Czechoslovakia 88" sympo- sium broken up. Dubček in Bologna. Interroga- tions. In Rudé právo, the Slovak minister of cul- ture, Válek, talked about the trauma created by the occupation of 1968 and even seemed in a way to be vindicating Charter 77 and samizdat. The cheeky blighter! Let him mind his own (twenty- year-old) business. When I read an article in the paper about how the Soviet Procurator General had exonerated the members of the "workers' opposition" executed fifty years ago, I felt like taking a protest note round to their embassy. But where were the words to express all my disgust, repugnance and total mistrust? Imagine a fellow coming to see you one Mon- day morning and insisting that iťs Wednesday. You argue with him. Bad luck, he's one of them and has you arrested. Not to worry, he turns out to be one of the reforming variety, and he has you released on the Friday - with the rehabilitating assurance: "You're right, iťs Monday". (November 1988) ARTICLES Milan Jungmann SKETCHES FOR PORTRAITS OF THE DEFIANT (Notes on contemporary Czech literature) For almost twenty years now, Czech litera ture has been suffering the painful effects of the regime's interference in its natural evolution since 1968, some twenty years after the first such intrusion which followed the February 1948 take-over. As 26 a result, literary output has split into three main currents: books published by the official publish- ing houses; typescript "inédit" editions (known as samizdat); and finally, books published by emigré publishing-houses abroad. It is obvious to anyone with even a passing acquaintance with cultural history that such a situation has an extremely dele- terious effect on the external factors vítal to the healthy development of literature - contact with readers, independent criticism, scope for creating literary circles, public debate, and so on. But above all, it impairs those delicate, almost intan- [pageend28]gible, intrinsic factors which are so bard to gauge, not to mention the complex infrastructure of in- tellectual relationships that evolves gradually and unpredictably over the course of time, incorpora- ting the mutual influence of all possible view- points, trends, traditions, programmes, person- alities, and the like. However, Czech culture's state of spiritual decline not only affects official literature: the sort that serves to a greater or lesser degree the regime's propaganda purposes, and is subject to both state and private ( self) censorship - whereby individuality is lost, leaving a grey, uninteresting residue. For even though samizdat literature or books published by emigré publishing houses are not directly limited by such external or interna! censorship, they too are marked by the national tragedy, whether they like it or not. Their authors inevitably react to the situation of a divided so- ciety made up of a large ghetto of privileged, ap- parently unrestricted citizens and a small ghetto of persecuted and silenced intellectuals. The fact that the literature in question in- cludes very few works whose subject-matter does not reflect the status quo is also evidence of that influnce. Only rarely does a book appear which manages to escape from the tyranny of the present and get to the heart of human problems, in order to pose those existential questions that are not necessarily bound up with the current state of society. There is a positive side to this, however. Samizdat literature as a whole constitutes an ap- peal to those human values which can be de- scribed as morality or ethics. It is an appeal for people to resist the temptations of materialistic consumerism and reject moral ambivalence in fa- vour of personal responsibility for the present and the future. It is a call for them to act according to their consciences. In the following review of fiction produced over the past twenty years within each of the three above-mentioned categories, I have deliberately disregarded authors living abroad or those whose work has become known ( to the interested reader, at least) through translations. I refer not only to Milan Kundera, Josef Škvorecký or Arnošt Lustig but also to such writers as Václav Havel or the Nobel prize-winner Jaroslav Seifert. My chief concern is with books written in Czech whose artistic merit is intrinsically relevant to the development of Czech literature. This means books which have played a significant role in maintaining the continuity of Czech literature over the period. * * * In the course of so-called "normalisation", some two hundred Czech writers and journalists were silenced, including a whole number of out- standing literary personalities. This led to an arti- ficially induced decline of standards in official publishing and the adoption of "soft" criteria. As a result even below-average writers started to be published, and literary mediocrity came to the fore. There were only two figures of any outstand- ing artistic merit left in the Czech Writers' Union: Ladislav Fuks and Vladimír Páral. During the first two years of "normalisation", both of them man- aged to publish novels which were still consistent with their artistic tenets and their persona! philos- ophies. Thereafter, however, they were obliged to find ways of satisfying socialist realism's demand 27 [pageend29]for an optimistic portrayal of reality. It had a pro- found and immediate effect. Their artistic stand- ard slumped and their creative output entered a phase of permanent crisis. It now looks as if Fuks has come to realise in the last few years that talent can only produce quality if artists have the free- dom to follow their inclinations and do not have to betray their own views. LADISLAV FUKS (born 1923) first acquired a major literary reputation in 1963 with his novel Mr. Theodore Mundstock which was translated into several world languages (appearing in West Ger- many, USA, France, England, and elsewhere ). Apart from the originality of the author's style, the book's success derived largely from his extremely individua} portrayal of someone threatened by anti-semitic Nazí tyranny. One can somehow sense the spirit of Franz Kafka abroad in Fuks' work. lndeed, the tragic predicament of twentieth century Europeans beset by evil, violence and dehumanised machinery, is also reflected in all his other books. The setting for Myši Natálie Moos- habrové (Natalie Mooshabrová's Mice ), publish- ed in 1970, is, as in most ofFuks' books, historically and geographically vague and its atmosphere weirdly bizarre. It is a mixture of horror, black- comedy and fairy-tale. The apparent primitive- ness of expression ( the repetiti on of phrases, char- acteristics, situations, etc.) as well as the naivety of descriptions and the narrator's ingenuousness are in fact refined artistic devices whose purpose is only revealed at the end of the novel. The phan- tasms surrounding the unfortunate Mrs. Moosha- brová - the mother of ungrateful children - have come into being because power in the land has been usurped by a man who has cunningly man- 28 aged to silence public opinion. Moreover, by man- ipula ting information, he has also enforced a superficial order, though human relations are rigid, distorted and formalised as a result. During the seventies, the author published a number of books in which he tried to satisfy the demand for works with positive story lines. Not until his ambitious 722-page novel Vévodkyně a kuchařka (The Duchess and the housekeeper) - published in 1983 - did the Fuks of old re- emerge. It is set in Vienna before World War I and as in his earliest works its complex and episodic structure lends it an intriguingly dream-like quality which leaves the reader in suspense about the denouement - will it be the end of an age, or even the end of human civilisation? The curious, masterfully-depicted details of Austrian imperial society are no more than a backcloth concealing the novel's true message - that modem humanity has lost the basis of its security. It is a parable about a self-threatening civilisation imperilled by its own creations and by its assertion of certain values to the detriment of others, etc. It is a world in which human beings are surrounded by sub- stitutes, alienated from their proper nature and from everything that ought to constitute their sub- stance. VLADIMÍR PÁRAL (born 1932) published his last authentically persona} novel Milenci a vrazi (Lo- vers and murderers) in 1969. (It was completed on 13th August 1968- i.e. a week before the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia). lt is sub-titled Magazine of Gratification pre-2000 A.D., ( sub-tit- les are always an integral part of Páral's fiction). Like Fuks, Páral also acknowledges a debt to Kaf- ka, not least of all with his motto about leopards [pageend30]invading a cathedral, though chiefly in his belief in the absurdity of history. In terms of style, however, it could not be less Kafkaesque. Having started his career as a technician, he has a first-hand knowl- edge of the run-of-the-mill industrial worker and technician, the narrow- mindedness of the "herd", human mediocrity, etc. As in his earliest books, this provides the starting point for a story told in a very simple and matter-of-fact way. He relates the fate of his characters with ironie detachment and even cynical indifference, describing the banal strivings of people whose horizons do not extend beyond material gain and sensual plea- sure, capable only of sexual fulfilment, not love, who want nothing but an easy life and actually reject anything of spiritual worth. The novel tells the story of a number of factory directors and depicts with sarcasm the rat-race of those in power that eventually destroys all that is human in them. The history of human society is portrayed solely as a never-ending alternation at the summit of power which can never lead to any "progress" or improvement, only constant repetition of the same old striving to seize selfish advantage and gain the power to dominate others. The novel was condemned by official critics as a squib against the Marxist concept of history and it has never been re-edited. Since then, its author has deliberately conformed to the demand for optimistic plots and has published texts which are artistically inferior, although they continue to enjoy considerable suc- cess among the reading public. The most popular of the published authors, however, is BOHUMIL HRABAL (born 1914) who per- formed a public autocritique at the beginning of the seventies, since when he has been permitted to publish at least some of his fiction officially. Unlike Fuks and Páral, Hrabal has not "throttled his song", as Mayakovsky put it. He does not censor his texts, which are written more or less in the form of a "train of consciousness". Instead he submits them to the official censor. The upshot is that his works generally exist in two versions: an uncensored version that circulates in samizdat form and the suitably censored one that appears in his published books. His novel Obsluhoval jsem anglického krále (I waited on the King of Eng- land), completed in 1971, circulates among the reading public both as typescript and in a photo- copied edition published by the Jazz Section shortly before it was banned. In this short novel, narrated by a waiter (the latest in Hrabal's long line of inveterate raconteurs ), the rcader is taken behind the scenes in the world of pre-war hotels and restaurants to learn diverse stories of their rich patrons, before the war, during the Nazi oc- cupation and after 1948, when the hotels were nationalised and their owners (including the nar- rator) found themselves interned in labour camps. In keeping with the author's persona} philosophy, the narrator relates his fate light-heartedly and observes the world with humorous detachment and the grin of one who has "seen it all''. No catastrophe catches him unawares and he is al- ways able to see "the best side" of every situation. Hrabal's vivid prose, which is saturated with popu- lar speech and slang, and not even averse to so- called "naturalism", elevates the story to the level of poetic improvisation. Hrabal's style of "oral fiction" was unaccept- able to the publishers of the fifties. And when his first short-story collections were eventually pub- 29 [pageend31]lished, a number of critics and readers were angered both by his consistent anti-ideological stance and his portrayal of characters on the frin- ges of society - outcasts or poor devils who had got the worst end of the stick, lost souls, gypsies, pub loafers, and the like, all of whom had one thing in common: an ability to Jive spontaneously and the gift of the gab. It came as quite a surprise when, in 1986, so utterly "unideological" an author as Hrabal published his novel Proluky (Va- cant sites) in samizdat, following its rejection by the official publishing houses. Quite a fuss was caused by the fact that its subject-matter took the political risk of dealing openly with the more re- laxed atmosphere of the sixties and the actual day of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. It even took in the subsequent harassment of writers unpopular with the regime. The s tory is told by the author's wife and her seeming naivety enables Hrabal to portray all kinds of events without cen- soring himself in any way. This device, however, cannot conceal from experienced readers that the book is essentially a persona} testimony which provides valuable human, artistic and psychologi- cal insight into the author himself. The novel is the third in a trilogy whose first two parts were en- titled Svatby v domě (Weddings in the House) and Vita nuova. OTA PAVEL (1930-1973) had quite an unusual writing career. His first success was the publica- tion of several collections of sports stories, but his exceptional, highly individua} talent did not truly come to the fore until the two slim volumes of short stories Smrt krásných srnců (The handsome roe-bucks are dead), published in 1971 shortly before his untimely death, andJak jsem potkal ryby 30 (My encounters with fish), published posthu- mously in 1974. The main characters of these stories are members of a Jewish family and chiefly the wonderfully crackpot father (who is a bit of a braggart), the anxious mother, and the son who plays the role of narrator. The tales are set either in the immediate pre-war period or in war-time when the family lives in constant fear of extermi- nation by Nazi decree. The underlying reality in all the stories is Nature, which the narrator re- gards as a power enabling human beings to live spontaneously and as a source of solace for them at moments of danger through its quasi- magical purgative powers. By the time Pavel wrote them, he was already suffering from severe mental ill- ness and these stories and this return to his child- hood and the warmth of the family circle, as well as to the elemental forces of na ture, meant for bim a quest for some sort of life support. However, the childhood experiences are not comforting idylls: the narrator evokes above all those singular scenes and events behind which lurks the threat of finality and death, and this inner tension was cru- cial to his perception of people, the world and human values. Pavel's tragi-comic portrayal of his characters is vaguely reminiscent of Hrabal's style, but Pavel's reminiscences, which are swathed in melancholy, and told with exceptional depth of feeling and human warmth, testify to a unique narrative talent. Among those authors who had to reconcile themselves with the prospect of not being publish- ed after 1968, the most original would seem to be LUDVÍK VACULÍK (born 1926). As well as being a founder of the first Czech samizdat book series Edice etlice (Padlock Boo ks), he has also pro- [pageend32]moted the writing of the topical articles known in Czech as fejetony ("feuilletons"). His novel Mor- čata (The Guinea-pigs) was written in 1970, too late to be published in his home country, although it has since been translated into many world lan- guages. The author's supreme literary achievment to date, however, is his novel Český snář (The Czech dreambook), published in samizdat in 1980 with the sub-title "Life and dreams of the Year 1979". Written in diary form, it deals with the period following the regime's harassment of those who signed Charter 77, the civil rights initiative which gave birth to what was virtually a closed community of people, within which new kinds of human and social relationships came into being as in every ghetto. It was a story not just of constant arguments about tactics, but also persona} rival- ries, sympathies and antipathies. Even love start- ed to assume new characteristics and was obliged to seek new outlets inside the ghetto walls. In the Dreambook, Vaculík assumes an original role as commentator of his friends' and enemies' actions, as well as of events at home and abroad. His ironie and, above all, self-deprecating portraits are frank in the extreme, and their candour even raised the hackles of some of those depicted. At a time of merciless conflict with the regime, the author pro- claims his need "to live from the good things of life", and not just take a negative stance. While acknowledging, in the form of a Rousseau-esque confesssion, his "immaturity" and human inade- quacy, he admits to be still searching for himself, frequently dumbstruck by his own spontaneous actions, deriving from his wilful, rebellious na ture. Social contradictions, police persecution, threats, vilification, and so on, form one of the diary's thematic strands. In addition, however, the jour- nal is also full of private vexations, disappoint- ments in love and his unsuccessful attempts to overcome his private suffering. The book's singu- lar language, based on one very particular North- em Moravian dialect, places serious obstacles in the way of achieving a translation of the work that would do justice to all its outstanding artistic me- rits (the German translation is, in fact, incom- plete). In his novel Vyhnanství (Exile), completed in 1973, writer and journalist MOJMÍR KLÁNSKÝ (1921- 1983) reached the peak of his literary achieve- ment. His previous fiction had been nothing very much out of the ordinary, but bere he managed to bring his talent as a reporter successfully to bear on a topical theme. The story's protagonist is one of the "kulaks" who were expelled from their villages at the time of enforced collectivisation during the nineteen fifties. Sensing his life to be nearing its close, he yearns to be buried in the soil of his forebears and therefore makes efforts to return to his birthplace. By chance, he gets the opportunity to move into a nearby forester's cot- tage due for demolition. He lives bere in total isolation, renounced by his siblings ( now officials in the agricultural co- operative ), and also ostra- cised by his town-dwelling children who do not visit him for fear that contact with their suspect father might damage their careers. Though weak and infirm, the old farmer is incapable of idleness. lt is in his ancestral blood to work. Work is a basic need for him, almost an animal instinct. ln time, his cellar, hay loft and bam are crammed with unheard-of stocks of no use to anyone. The author 31 [pageend33]lets the naked facts speak for themselves and confines himself to factual description, but it is precisely this accent on the practical aspects which lends the story metaphorical significance. Experience of imprisonment in socialist la- bour camps gave KAREL PECKA (born 1928) enough material for several novels. Artistically his most accomplished work, and the one with the most autobiographical elements, is a sort of chronicle of eleven years of being shunted from one camp to another during the nineteen-fifties, entitled Motáky nezvěstnému (Messages from prison to one who disappeared), published in samizdat in 1980. It is no mere portrayal of horror and suffer- ing, however, nor simply an account of how hell becomes a daily fact of life. Instead it is an account of a young man's passage to true manhood and the development of his character under the pressure of those cruel surroundings. He subsequently bears his almost superhuman burden as a test of moral resistance, firm in the belief that his per- sona} resilience and incorruptibility not merely preserve his own honour and character, but are also a way of salvaging that fundamental hu- manity which is crucial to the national existence. It is the modem counterpart of Dostoyevsky's Notes from the House of the Dead - created, how- ever, not out of literary ambition, but from an uncontrollable urge to bear witness to the forms assumed by evil in the modem world, and show how a cause that seems at first to embody the lofty idea of justice can become destructive as soon as fanaticism sets in. Pecka neither seeks to moralise, nor even to condemn his tormentors. Instead he pities them as people bereft of everything that 32 makes human life human. Naked fact and specific detail are the means used by the author to achieve an effect equivalent to tragic catharsis. After her two latest attempts at full-length novels ( Černá hvězda (Black s tar), 197 4 and Pán věže (Lord of the tower), 1979) were received with certain reservations, EVA KANTůRKOVÁ (born 1930) abandoned her endeavours to create complex his- torical and philosophical structures and decided to draw instead on her bitter experience of a year on remand ( on trumped-up charges of anti-state activity) in order to write some fifteen stories, all of them portraits of women in the narrow confines of a world of unfreedom. The stories in the collec- tion Mé přítelkyně v domě smutku (My compan- ions in the bleak house), published in 1984, appear at first sight to be documentary accounts of how different human types react to life in prison. In reality, though, they are sensitive psychological portraits of people from the fringes of society, not only people with adventure in their blood, but also deceitful and niggardly types. The stories of all these different women - naive, cynical, good- hearted and mean alike - are a reflection of the moral state of our society and the problem of its underworld, which the regime deliberately con- ceals. The author achieves a well-balanced nar- rative tone which ranges from warm under- standing for apparently amora} actions to a much cooler treatment of those scheming individuals who readily become stool-pigeons of the prison authorities. The author's own experience remains discreetly in the background of the stories she relates. [pageend34]The philosophical and political crisis of Czech intellectuals of the 1970s is, in essence, the subject of thP- samizdat novel Svedený a opuštěný (Seduced and abandoned) published in 1981 by JAN 1RERJLKA (born 1929). The story's main char- acter is an emotionally unstable individua}, who, after being forced by the authorities to abandon his theological studies, embarks on a happy mar- riage and starts a family. However, he is always finding himself in conflict situations on account of his passivity and eccentricity, but above all be- cause of his inability to conform to prevailing materialist attitudes. He dismisses his own short- comings as divinely ordained. It is only after a sor- did sexual affair to which he more or less deliber- ately consents (regarding it as a diabolic tempta- tion), that he is forced to come to terms with being abandoned not only by people but also by God. He realises that there is nothing or no one on earth capable of releasing human beings from their duty to answer for themselves, to bear their own crosses and find the moral centre within their own consciences. The book's centra} theme is a clue to the author's own quest - one which he has publicly acknowledged in successive articles - for an inte- gral ethical basis for people who have had to renounce all higher authority, whether divine or ideological. The turbulence of post-thirties Czech history has already inspired many novels, whose plots are determined chiefly by the outward events. JARO- SLAV PUTÍK (born 1923) is not alone among Czech writers in seeking to distance himself from that sort of writing. With admirable artistic courage he has managed to avoid it not by abandoning the historical framework, but by adopting a patently ironie stance to past events and satirizing their commonly accepted significance. The hero of his lengthy novel Muž s břitvou (Man with a razor ), completed in 1984, is the comic figure of a bald and lanky barber in a provincial town. By refusing to see himself as comic he has the power to ob- serve the events and people around him with the detachment of the popular philosopher, the ec- centric whose actions are somehow always out of the ordinary. Unconsciously, he frequently sets others an example of courage and is a paragon of the civic virtues which he himself refuses to take seriously. His life story is told by a nephew who obtains his uncle's notebooks after his death. He also questions his uncle's friends in his efforts to fathom the meaning of the barber's curious and often bizarre actions. Each of the hero's deeds, whether superficially courageous or embarrass- ingly comic, is viewed by the stoic France-esque narrator from several possible angles. This <levice enables the writer to portray people in historical events without any trace of pathos. Although they are looked at sceptically and with an indulgent smile, the writer also displays understanding for their foibles as being just another facet of their humanity. Grandeur and pettiness, importance and insignificance, gravity and comicality are indi- visible categories - phenomena which illustrate the mystery of human life. The aforementioned genre in which people are subordinated to history was chosen by IVAN KLÍMA (born 1931) for his voluminous novel Stoj(, stoji šibenička (There stands a gallows ), published in samizdat in 1978 and afterwards translated into 33 [pageend35]German. In it, the author seeks, more through portrayal of external events - and specifically through separate historical chapters intended to show the nation's uninterrupted battle for survival - to trace his generation's journey from their post- war enthusiasm for the socialist programme to their profound disillusionment with its implemen- tation. This first text was virtually rejected by the author who went on to realise his intention in a much more concise form in the novel Soudce z milosti (Judge on trial) completed in 1986 on the same theme and with identical subject- matter. In the new version, judge Adam Kindl's fate is now determined above all by the growing contradic- tions not only in his family and love life but also in his professional career on account of the ideologi- cal and existential pressures of the post-1968 regime. It is an eventful novel with frequent flash- backs to the protagonisťs past life - as a Jewish child in Terezín concentration camp, and his Jater difficulties in the post-war period in coming to terms with complex political developments. By relating the stories of his characters in intimate detail, the author is able to convey the reality of Czech society at a time when the spectre of universa} fear was beginning to stalk the land and deform people's characters, their civic sense and their persona} relationships. Unlike the samizdat or "inédit" texts with which I have just been dealing, Semester života (A term of life) by JANA čERVENKOVÁ (born 1939) was published officially in 1981. However, it had been kept on ice for ten long years because of its disillusioned and sharply critical stance, whereby it stands out from current run-of-the-mill fiction. 34 This story of a young woman leaving university to take up a teaching post in a small provincial town is used as a means of analysing the everyday life of Czech society which has lost all ethical values as well as any meaningful striving for transcend- ental goals. This young intellectual with her "naive" ideals (i.e. notions of living a full spiritual life) comes into conflict with materialistic inter- ests, governed by envy, selfishness and the nar- row- mindedness of her provincial surroundings. As a result, she not only becomes disillusioned but, in accordance with the logic of the s tory, also ends up in a life crisis. What superficially seems to be tranquil mediocrity defends itself tooth and nail against the invasion of another, more de- manding human ethic and wreaks cruel venge- ance for the threat to its comfortable parochial existence. The reader is encouraged, not through the writer's comment but solely through epic de- vices, to consider with what success ( or Jack of it) a "socialist" society has managed to put its pro- claimed ethical ideals into practice, and to realise the terrifying forms which materialistic attitudes have assumed within it. One of the most appealing features of the books of EDA KRISEOVÁ (born 1940) is her evocative and strongly emotive style, and her good eye for detail. For this reason, the author is most at ease when writing shorter fiction, such as short stories or novelettes. Although she deliberately chooses to write love stories, these manage to encapsulate our times and our country, including the political pressures, moral crises, alienation and absence of freedom. The various forms of man/woman rela- tionship provide the common theme for her most [pageend36]recent short-story collection Sedm lásek (Seven loves), finished in 1985. Each of these sensitively constructed fables has a female narrator be- witched by the mystery of the human psyche and distressed at the way it is squandered. Her richly- worded, precise and sensuously graphic descrip- tions enable the author to get present- day people who are marked by the pressures of civilisation and the absence of any sort of order in their lifestyle. The lives of Eda Kriseová's heroines - and this equally applies to the collections Klfčnf kůstka netopýra (Vampyre's collar-bone) of 1979 and Ryby, raky (Fish, cray-fish) of 1985 - are all fatally afflicted by the realisation that they have to hold their ground in a world which is governed by impersonal forces external to them. As a result, they are incapable of leading the sort of life that would allow them to answer the compelling de- mands of their deep sensitivity. Any danger of sentimentality - a feature quite common in fic- tion of this kind - is avoided by the author's pro- found concern to strike a balance between spiri- tual and emotional experience, even in those sto- ries with autobiographical overtones. The fiction of JIŘÍ GRUŠA (born 1939) differs fundamentally from the usual narrative genres. His very first prose works, published in the wake of his poetry collections, raised the hackles of the State's ideological guardians. The publication of his novelette Mimner actually led to his prosecu- tion in Czechoslovakia on grounds of alleged por- nography, though charges were dropped in 1970. His novel Dotaznfk aneb Modlitba za jedno město a přftele (The employment form, or, Prayer for a town and a friend), written in 1975, provoked a similar reaction: the author was held on remand for two months on the charge of writing a text undermining the socialist system. The partisans of ideological rectitude saw in Gruša's interpretation of reality a desecration of socialism's untouchable fundamental tenets. In reality it is a satire on the pseudo-seriousness and pseudo-importance at- tached to the conventional methods and formali- ties used to evaluate people in terms of dogmatic ideas: methods even used to pry into the most intimate areas of their lives. Gruša's fiction has more of the cruel jeremiad to it than the epic. The book splinters into fragmentary episodes and di- gressions which gradually take it over. The periph- ery becomes the foreground, and the digressions usurp the Leitmotiv. Then all of a sudden, we are back with the main story line about a man who, on being given the usual politically-loaded form to fill in when starting a new job, is provoked into evalu- ating his life in terms according to his own per- sona} criteria. Ail the things that appear important to official eyes seem irrelevant to bim, and appar- ently trivia} events are seen to be crucial to his future. This diffamatory treatment of the regime's method of evaluating citizens proved shocking to those who share the ideological prejudices of those in power, but at the same time, the book's untraditional form even proves an obstacle to readers accustomed to conventional narrative prose. Gruša adopted a similar approach in his novel Doktor Kokeš - Mistr Panny (Doctor Kokeš - Master of the Virgin) published in samizdat in 1984. In it, the past and the present form an indissoluble whole, in a sense: things that the pro- 35 [pageend37]recent short-story collection Sedm lásek (Seven }oves), finished in 1985.

The entire structure of the story is interwoven with systematic satire and comedy. Gruša takes the enormous risk of undermining the traditional epic supports and seeking a new style of narration, as well as new, firm values. Same critics consider his striving for new forms to be inspired by the French "roman nouveau". *** Same brief comments by way of conclusion. Present "inedit" output is already being referred to as "ageing literature". This designation is in- tended to draw attention to the fact that for the last two decades the independent literary scene has remained virtually unchanged and no new, younger faces have appeared, apart from rare exceptions ( mainly poets ). One exception in the field of fiction is ZUZANA BRABCOVÁ (bom 1960), who attracted attention with her second novel Daleko od stromu (Far from the tree ), published in samizdat in 1984, which displays a maturity of language and richness of style. The story, which is told in the first person by the novel's heroine, illustrates the underlying inner contradictions of a generation who, as adolescents, found them- selves confronted with barriers created in one way or another by their parents. As a result, they grop- ingly search for something firm to cling on to, having fallen like apples "far from the tree" - in other words, away from home and their parents' attitudes. None the less they realise that a merely negative stance is no way to find a reliable alter- native. Although the generation gap does not cause official literatu;e such serious problems, there are 36 also obvious signs of stagnation among its new authors, who lack both the courage and the oppor- tunity to experiment, let alone take their prede- cessors to task. The great bulk of young writing reflects the stifling atmosphere in society resulting from the long years of political opportunism and mindless propaganda. The most there has been by way of resistance to this situation is the occasional tendency for young writers to abandon all intellec- tual concepts and just record their sensations. The very title of one recent verse collection: Chůdy po předcfch (lnherited stilts) indicates how ludicrous the younger generation finds the bombast of their predecessors. They have no wish to inherit their "stilts". They want to walk with their feet on the ground in a world of real, ideologically unrefined people.

Milan Šimečka TATAR~S "JOTTINGS" To describe a literarywork as "jottings" might lead the uninformed to judge from the title that the text is second-rate. Sensitive readers would realise after only the first few pages of Tatarka's latest work, however, that they were in the presence of [pageend39]top-class literature, the fruit of a deep experience of life and of personal suffering. "Jottings" is ac- tually a poetic understatement, one which, in fact, reflects the author's own literary integrity. Years ago, whenever I visited Tatarka, he would point to an old trunk full of jumbled manu- scripts and say: "There you are, those are my jottings". There was no way he could call that clutter in the trunk "books" or "manuscripts", because at the time he did not believe they could ever become real books. And he was right. Had it not been for the exile publishing houses, they would never have turned into books. That is why he called them "jottings". The word also conveys the deep heartache of a writer who for years has written in solitude and isolation, without any hope that his manuscripts will ever emerge in printed form, properly bound and - most importantly - read. Tatarka used to call everything jottings (pf- sačky), including those texts that were sub- sequently published in Czech under the title Sám proti noci ( Alane against the night ). That book was translated into Czech by Mr and Mrs Binar - and I ought to take this opportunity to say how beau- tifully that Moravian couple rendered Tatarka's Slovak: it was such a magical translation that as I read it I would continually find myself forgetting that I was reading a Czech text and in a mysteri- ous way I would hear Tatarka's actual intonation in Slovak coming through their translation. That, I hope, clears up any doubts about pfsačky. I used to read those "jottings" from the trunk at a time when the author had not yet the desire, or the strength even, to think of them as potential books. lt was the exiled Ján Mlynárik who pre- pared the book for publication, thereby rendering an enormous service to the author and Slovak literature alike. I vividly recall, however, that when I was reading those original manuscripts that time, with their pages covered in revisions and reworkings, I never doubted for an instant that I was in the presence of great literature. In spíte of being isolated by the authorities, Tatarka has already received the highest literary recognition. A jury composed of Czech writers of indisputable calibre chase Tatarka to be the first recipient of the Seifert prize. Tatarka has fre- quently been assailed with warm expressions of friendship at informal gatherings of banned wri- ters. He is held in high esteem by the younger generation of Bratislava intellectuals who express enormous admiration for bim. Time will tell what a profound influence he has had on them as a re- sult of his art and his civic courage. The local lads come and dig his garden and paint his room, and at Yuletide, everybody comes - kids and all - to wish him a Happy Christmas. And there is also the occasional visitor from abroad. lt is conceivable that some members of the literary establishment actually envy bim such unofficial esteem. His Demon of Consent was recently published in France. How often do you find a Slovak writer being translated into a world language? Tatarka deserves to be translated more and more, of course. But we know how things are. Why ever should the mad world be interested in the delicate weavings of his imagination, or in his striking rec- ollections of the beauty and dignity of old village life? Why should it care about his musings on the significance of ceremony, hospitality, sociability, or on the - now extinct - sacramental attitude to- wards domestic animals, let alone his well con- 37 [pageend40]cealed interpretations of Lévi-Strauss. After all isn't he a self-styled "Carpathian shepherd" who has rooted himself in the bygone cultures of Cen- tra} Europe? And since his descriptions of the forms of love between men and women are veiled in mystique and couched in neologisms, they make great demands on the reader and are therefore - unlike soft porn - uncommercial. As a result, Ta- tarka remains chiefly a source of joy for Slovak readers and those Czechs who are not too lazy to read Slovak - and in Tatarka's case there are hap- pily plenty of the latter. What is disgraceful, though, is that Tatarka has been totally ignored by official Slovak literary history and criticism for nearly twenty years. Iťs as if he never existed. It is disgraceful because there are too few exponents of Slovak litera ture whose importance transcends the national framework for Tatarka to be excluded from its achievements. Slovak literature will live to rue this neglect. There is, of course, a sense in which Tatarka himself is to blame for his own disinheritance. Not, however, because he led a demonstration in 1968 or joined the Charter community. There are other Slovak writers who have similar blots on their past. No, the fact is that Tatarka is just too different. Like few other Slovak writers, he is utterly im- mersed in Slovak culture and tradition and has almost a primeval attitude to the world. However, Tatarka has managed to retain his roots while achieving European stature. This he has done by making a virtue of his roots instead of an obstacle. He has never fallen prey to parochialism, or re- mained happily confined within his small nation. His horizons are wider and he has always treated everyone on equal terms. He has regarded his 38 Slovak identity as an asset, within a wider cultural context, not only in literature, but also in terms of the national life. Notwithstanding, I have never detected, in all the years I have known bim, the slightest hint of any kind of defensive nationalism in his character. Even now it is a mystery to me how they could have charged bim with bourgeois in the fifties. Tatarka talks about nationality with the candour of someone at home with the differ- ent world cultures. He will say things like: "You know, that Polish chap, Wojtyla ... ", or "Hey, that Jewish woman has the most beautiful Hasidic eyes ... ", or "Listen, that Czech fellow, Prince Wen- ceslas (referring to Václav Havel) ... " When Tatar- ka speaks about people's nationalities you feel he is relishing the worlďs diversity. Such a sense of belonging is rarely found in present-day Europe and it marks Tatarka out from the crowd. This, I believe, explains the loneliness that troubles him. Moreover, such loneliness is nothing new in his case, but dates back to the beginning of the fifties. Although Tatarka is of archetypally Slovak origin, coming from a traditionally catholic village community on the borders of Slovakia and Paland, his experience as a student in Prague and Paris meant that he was "thrust into the world" - in the old existential sense - far more than any other Slovak writer of his generation. And it is quite likely that his assessment of that experience was also far more radical than anyone else's. His iso- lation as a writer is not solely of political origin. His is a solitariness of a different order: the kind we know from the lives of other distinguished writers. However, in the case of a writer in Slova- kia whose genius lies in his mastery of human relationships, his plight is all the more bitter. [pageend41]Tatarka is exacting company. Heis incapable of small-talk and in every conversation gets straight down to brass tacks. He couldn't care less about new recipes, and he doesn't even have any interest in politics as it is understood in everyday chitchat. Heis the last person you'd find in a wri- ters' club and has never been suited to the role of national writer. And all attempts to impose that role on him have proved disastrous - for Tatarka, at least. They are currently pressing him to agree to a re-edition of Farská republika (Parochial repub- lic ), Tatarka's only prose work in which he re- flected the prevailing taste for "typical heroes in typical settings". Tatarka is rejecting their over- tures and pressing for the publication of works from the peak of his artistic career. But that, as we know, is out of the question for the time being. And maybe bere again it is not so much because of Tatarka's political defiance as because of the singularity of his style and subject-matter. Tatarka has always been an odd-man-out in Slovak lit- erature, which still remains very close to the tradi- tion of realistic narrative. In fact he has spent his whole life telling his own story, and in a fashion that does not give the reader time to draw breath. He tells it with provocative frankness and over- whelming sincerity. Whether speaking or writing, Tatarka's sole concern is for his own ontology and the ontology of his fellow human-beings - as well as for the fascinating phenomenon of male-fe- male polarity, of course. You know the sort of thing: "There was a time when men and women were linked through work. The man would reap while the woman garnered ... At noon they would sit and drink fresh water. Sometimes they would even make love... Nowadays they come home from work to their fiat on a housing estate, and they are strangers to each other ... " etc. etc. Tatar- ka is capable of developing this theme ad infini- tum, in conversation and in his books. One might compare how this theme is treated by Tatarka and by famous American writers like Mailer and U p- dike. We would discover that in Tatarka's writing, women are never treated as a modem partner in sexual lust, but as a sacrament, to use a word of- fensive to feminists - an object of inner search- ings, sexual ceremonial, beauty and solemnity. Tatarka lives the way he does, in his house below Slavín, because he has refrained from join- ing the various literary currents which have come into being in the Slovak literary world over the past fifty years. Tatarka's books contain none of the long and tedious passages typical of that school of Slovak literature held in the highest esteem: so-called "lyricised prose". Nor does he display any of the hastiness and indifference to variety of expression which one generally finds in the works of the younger generation. Tatarka makes no apologies for writing in Slovak. He treats it as a mature modem language and his manuscripts are full of deliberately chosen ex- pressions, which editors remove from his texts as non-Slovak. None the less his is a young, boister- ous and heady language, one that grips the atten- tion. Tatarka lives in isolation because he has never stopped thinking things out and has not been prepared to renounce or modify any of his ideas. And inevitably he himself was to find his intellectual rigour a painful process which could even boomerang on him. This was the case of his 39 [pageend42]religious belief which he abandoned and returned to later in a new form. Once he had identified the Demon of Consent and given it a name, however, he was never to submit to it thereafter. I recall how liberating was my first encounter with that designation over thirty years ago. I was reading Ihe Demon in the tram. I got off, sat down on a bench and proceeded to read the book right to the end. I then walked home with my head in a whirl. lt very much recalled Arbes' old horror tale, Newton 's Brain. For me it hit the nail on the head: how they opened up people's skulls, took out their brains and stuck back someone else's instead. But it was written with such an astounding urgency and was so fantastically saturated with local colour, that it made both enjoyable and touching reading. It convinced me even more that it is daft to hanker after someone else's brain as it must destroy you in the end. Ihe Demon ought to have been translated into other languages back in those days. Unfortu- nately Tatarka was a victim of the worlďs indif- ference towards the literature of small nations. It was a time when the tame writings of the Soviet thaw were being hailed in the world as a literary sensation. Ali that Tatarka earned was local hos- tility. I was twenty six years old at the time and too shy to go and tel1 bim how I, as an avid reader of world literature, had been intensely gripped by a work that was the product of our experience and of Slovak consciousness. I did not tel1 bim it until fifteen years later. The recently published French translation of Ihe Demon just cannot convey the thrill which the book engendered at that particu- lar moment of history. lt might well happen, 40 though, that Ihe Demon will once more play its original role in some totally different country where someone comes up with the idea of swap- ping people's brains. But that is just a footnote to all the fine things that Václav Havel says about it in his introduction. It is unlikely that this disgrace, which is now part of the national memory, will ever be forgot- ten. Faces will continue to redden every time anyone recalls how Tatarka was the victim of cruel indifference for twenty years and how his most recent works have been suppressed. Admittedly such things are commonplace in this part of the world. But the losses of the poor are always that much more tragic than the losses of the rich. I only wish that the whole sorry situation would come to an end, and that someone else, apart from our- selves, would declare in no uncertain terms what Tatarka was, is, and will be in Slovak literature.

Příspěvek k národní identitě A contribution to the notion of Czech national identity/. Samizdat, 385 pp. Prague 1988. The book is dedicated to "my dear friend, Fran~is Brélaze", the President of the Hus Foundation in Switzerland. Our leading protestant historian, A.Molnár admits that modem historiography has an out- standing debt to Hus. But if Czech readers want to learn something about Jan Hus, stimulated perhaps by the news that the Roman Catholic church is considering a possible review of Hus's trial, where can they turn to? Molnár's ten-page essay on Hus's concept of truth in the collection Na rozhrani věků /At the turn of the age/, Prague, 1985, is no more than a "hint". Šmahel's Hranice pravdy /fruth at stake/, Prague, 1969, while a suc- cessful example of "literature of fact", actually covers only the last months of Hus's life. And the reader will have a bard time obtaining a picture of Hus from Bartoš's Čechy v době Husově /Bohemia at the time ofHus/, Prague, 1947, a book cramm- ed with factual detail and events, much of which has only the most tenuous connection with Hus the man. We need to go right back to 1919 (Václav Novotný) or 1915 (Jan Sedlák and Václav Flajš- hans) if we want an extensive monograph. But now at long last, in 1988, we are rewarded with a record of Hus's entire life story and "the distinct phenomenon of Hus" can once more manifest itself, if not to all, then at least to those with access to Eva Kantůrková's samizdat publi- cation Jan Hus. When in her epilogue the author tells us her ambition was to "recount what is per- haps the greatest life-story in Czech history", it is possible that she herself does not do justice to her achievement. A book that contains a graphic out- line of Páleťs and Hus's concepts of the church and a thorough exposition of the subtle differen- ces between transubstantiation and remanence can hardly be described as merely "recounting a story". With its almost 400 pages, Kantůrková's work is no more nor less than a meticulous histori- cal study. A book of this type naturally cries out for an index and explanatory notes, which it unhappily lacks. The presence of a proper index confirming the meticulous and unrelenting work with source material and basic Hussian literature, which it obviously entailed, would help Eva Kantůrková's Jan Hus to become a basic reference text about Hussism for future generations as well. In "recounting" Hus's life-story, Kantůrková deliberately limits herself to those "verified" ele- ments "from that distant past which have been preserved down to our own days". Kantůrková makes fitting use of her skills as a fiction writer to bring out all the drama of the events of the period, while avoiding any temptation to use these same skills to fill the gaps in the extant records. The controversy regarded by the author as the "crux of Hus's dramatic story" started with Wycliffe's forty-five articles which the Dominican Jan Hub- ner assembled as a sort of sum total of heresies. 41 [pageend44]However, while it is true that "the characters with- in it would be defiled, friendships would come to grief, some would betray, others would pay with their lives", what makes Hus's story dramatic, in contrast to the lives of such full-blooded figures as Cossa, the pirate-Pope, Zbyněk Zajíc, the war- rior-archbishop, or the sadistic weakling Wence- slas IV, is the clash of ideas, theological opinions and philosophical persuasions, not to mention loy- alty to these ideas or betrayal of them. In other words, Hus's story has none of the thrill of a his- torical novel that can be read in a single sitting. The fact, for instance, that readers must work their way through a fifteen-page analysis of Hus's ecclesiology and its comparison with Páleťs re- veals that the author was more concemed with seeking the roots of the Hussian dispute than with achieving a smooth story-line. In the course of the book, Eva Kantůrková frequently allows Hus, as well as his contempo- raries and Hussian scholars, to speak for them- selves, while she herself remains well in the back- ground. However her contribution as a writer is not restricted solely to collating scattered ele- ments, setting out the story in thirteen chapters plus an introduction and epilogue and framing it all in a polished language which is stimulatingly modem while being well-suited to the chosen genre, it is also evident in the way she hits the nail on the head with such apposite comments as "me- diocre individuals are unlikely to reach the top at periods of abrupt change, they tend to rule when the times are at a low ebb" or judgements such as: "there is nothing inherently repugnant about people changing their opinions, although there undoubtedly is when it happens not as the result 42 of new experience but out of fear". On those occasions when the authorvoices her own opinion of Hus, she does so not from any particular de- nominational standpoint. She has no reason at all to defend Hus as a loyal Catholic misunderstood by the church establishment or as an authentic protestant and underrated pioneer of the Refor- mation. Rather she underlines the distance in time that separates us from him and makes it im- possible to enlist Hus to the benefit of any particu- lar party in today's world: '"Gothic Hus' is one of the last outstanding representatives of that auspi- cious era in Europe's spiritual past when the world was not yet separated from God, and man was integrated within it as in a womb from which, by death, if he so deserved, he could be bom into heavenly glory. We, who are left to suffer the consequences of that separation, can only long for Hus's integrity. lt is one of the spiritual paradises that modem man has lost." In other words, Kantůrková realises that one must also be careful about drawing any analogy between Hus's experi- ence and that of present-day dissidents, even if such a parallel does emerge between the lines: "The awkward thing about vítal decisions which initially involve only fairly minor risks is that once one has said 'a', one has to go on and say 'b', and it is impossible to know at the outset how far one will have to continue into the alphabet..." Of crucial importance in the book is a com- parison between the destinies of Hus and Páleč. The latter, Hus's erstwhile friend and former radí- cal Wycliffite, went on to accuse Hus of Wycliffism and demand his condemnation. Kantůrková goes to great lengths to explain Páleťs position while also providing a careful exposition of his views. [pageend45]Just as in her eyes Hus is not "the one who did not know fear" ( as Hana Hegerová used to sing), so Páleč for her is no ordinary traitor or vile knave. When she quotes Páleťs anti-Wycliffian invective ( e.g. "His writings are those hidden waters which many have now found so sweet that they are ready to lay down their lives for them, as could be seen at the recent execution. And that is an important sign of heresy, because none of our people would risk their lives for their faith ... ") she warns her readers against hasty moral condemnation. In Pá- leťs eyes, she explains, "if readiness to die for one's belief is heretical, the opposite of heresy is obedience ... Páleťs position did not necessarily express the cowardice of a man fighting to save his life. Opting for the discipline of obedience is a fun- damental decision". Thus Páleč takes the fundamental decision to obey the ecclesiastical institution, while Hus de- cides to owe allegiance to suprainstitutional auth- ority: Hus "eluded the jurisdiction of institutions in favour of sanctity and devotion to Christ". Eva Kantůrková sub-titles her work "a con- tribution to the notion of Czech national identity". Clearly the national identity is not something that was defined once and for all time by Jan Hus, but something that is constructed through the choices we make, the decisions we take, and the way we answer the call of truth. The key to deciphering the concept of "national identity" can be found in a paragraph of the book where Kantůrková once again counterposes Hus and Páleč: "Even though each of them decided in favour of something else, it is evident to the Czechs of today what were the roots of those decisions. Furthermore they can directly relate to those experiences. As a lesson for us bere and now, Páleťs story is just as relevant as that of Jan Hus. Those two men embodied the two choices facing human beings, and the question we should be asking ourselves about Hus is not whether he should have gone willingly to the stake but whether we who are their historical descend- ants wish to emulate - or have it in us to emulate - Páleč or Hus." One can only hope that such a fundamentally important work will attract the attention of histo- rians, and that they will assess it according to their own particular criteria. It is possible that they would indicate those parts of the book where the author remains faithful to certain notions on which doubt has been cast in the recent period (was Hus really Queen Sophia's confessor?). There is one thing, though, that not even the most meticulous Hussian scholar could question, namely, that Eva Kantůrková has written a book for which Czech readers have waited decades. Miloš Rejchrt The International Committee for the Support of Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia has awarded Eva Kantůrková the Jan Palach Prize for 1988. This prize was established in 1979 to commemorate the anniversary of the immolation of the young Czech student in January 1969. 43 [pageend46]THE JOURNAL "S1ŘEDNÍ EVROPX' In keeping with our endeavour to build up com- prehensive and systematically annotated bibli- ographical surveys of Czechoslovak samizdat publications and periodicals, we are publishing a detailed review of the journal Středn( Evropa /Central Europe/ which started life in 1984 and already has ten issues to its credit. The review, which is taken from issue 4 of the seventh annual series of Kritický sbomfk /Critical review/ (Prague 1987), gave rise to a polemic which was printed in the first issue of Kritický sbomfk of 1988. That particular exchange of views was a good illustra- tion of the breadth of opinion within independent circles and provided insight into the actual circum- stances in which the editors of independent peri- odicals in Czechoslovakia work. We therefore thought it useful to publish it also. We conclude this contribution with a review of Středn( Evropa No.10, the most recent issue to date. This further article, which is by the same critic as before and published in the second issue of Kritický sbomfk this year (1988), helps demon- strate that polemic need not prove an obstacle to subsequent co-operation in support of a common cause. The editors SlŘEDNÍ EVROPA /Central Europe/. No. 8 (Prague, July 1987, 166 pp.), No. 9 (Prague, November 1987, 192 pp.). There are journals that come into the world "fully- fledged". For 0thers the process of gestation is 44 long and arduous. An example of the first type is the review O divadle /About the theatre/, whose editors left no one in any doubt that they intended to work to the highest standards of professional- ism current in normal circumstances. Střední Ev- ropa is typical of the second category. The most that one could determine for sure from reading its first issue (Autumn 1984) was that it was the work of a single editor, done off his own bat and at his own risk. It was quite exciting in a way to see if it would survive and manage to forge a place for itself among Prague's samizdat periodicals. Weil, Střednf Evropa has indeed stood the test and has nine issues to its credit over the past three years - a rate of output that many other journals might well envy it. It appears at irregular intervals, each issue numbering about 150 A4 pages. The copies are bound in soft covers. As far as its subject-range is concerned, the very ambiguousness of the title and the sweeping terms of initial declaration of intent have given the editor ample scope to impro- vise. From the first issue, the journal has been gradually sharpening its focus of interest and this process has not yet culminated by any means. Nevertheless, now that the number of its issues is reaching double figures, Střednf Evropa already represents a sufficiently identifiable platform of views for us to attempt a preliminary summary of its main features. Anyone who was expecting a specialised dis- cussion forum about "the Central European phe- nomenon" was probably disappointed. lt was not until its sixth issue that Středn( Evropa started to deal with problems of Central Europe per se. And even since then, discussion of such topics has not formed the main content of each issue, which is [pageend47]made up chiefly of translated articles ( contribu- tions by local authors having been few and far between ). Stfednf Evropa has always tended to give pride of place to the question of our national history, particularly that of the recent past, with special emphasis on aspects traditionally ne- glected or treated in an over-simplified or tenden- tious manner. It is certainly no coincidence that Stfednf Evropa came into being at the time when Charter 77's "Right to History" document was arousing passionate debate - and indeed the jour- nal's views are close to those of that documenťs authors. In fact the abundance of contributions on such "national" themes, which are only indirectly related to the review's subject-matter as indicated by its title, has gradually led the editors to divide up what were initially random blocks of material. Thus in No. 6 there appeared a separate section under the heading REHABILITATION oF JAN HUS? in which Střednf Evropa made an important con- tribution to the discussion already commenced in the catholic samizdatjournals. Issue No. 7 saw the introduction of a special heading THE CZECH ARIS- TOCRACY -and we should recall in this connection that since its third issue, Střednf Evropa has been serialising a translation of the monograph The House of Habsburg- the histo,y of a European dy- nasty by Austrian historian A. Wandruszka ( 13 chapters published to date ). Articles on culture, literature and art con- stitute the journal's third main thematic strand. Most noteworthy of these have been J.Hradec's two-part study in Nos.3 and 4 on the significance of Josef Florian, and the special section of the seventh issue devoted to the hundredth anniver- sary of the birth of Jaroslav Durych. This particu- lar subject area has virtually no connection with the topic of Central Europe. However, what is most disconcerting in Střednf Evropa are those sections of the journal - whose headings vary from issue to issue - which are made up of shorter pieces such as reviews, commentaries, etc. Here one would expect the editor to make every effort to give readers an over-view of everything being written on the subject in various parts of the world. None the less, Central European issues are scarcely retlected in these pages and the contribu- tions seem to be selected rather at random. Ad- mittedly the editor has managed to give the jour- nal a very particular stamp by a tendency to in- clude in this section articles likely to raise hackles (such as L.Jehlička's polemical pieces, and the philosophical "reviews" signed "-rzk-"). As far as its opinions and ideas are con- cerned, Střednf Evropa is not of any one particular "hue". Nevertheless, there is a conspicuous num- ber of articles from catholic circles ( speaking in a cultural, rather than a confessional sense, of course ). It should be pointed out that some of the views expressed echo pre-war right-wing thinking. This is particularly true of a lengthy article ( to be continued) which appeared in Nos. 8 and 9 under the signature '~dreas", in which the author makes a radical critique of everything that might be described as the "Thomas Guarrigue Masaryk phenomenon" ( or syndrome) in Czech history. In its past two issues, the journal has conti- nued the process of intemal structuration with the introduction of two new sections. The first of these, headed by the Hebrew word ZEKHER ( meaning recollection or memory) deals with J ew- ish aspects of the Centra! European issue, the 45 [pageend48]second, entitled oocuMENTS has so far included, inter alia, a lengthy report about the fight of na- ture conservationists in Bratislava to save the his- torie St Andrew Cemetery. Among more recent features are essays devoted to regional artists, such as one about the painter and sculptor V.Va- culka from Uherské Hradiště (1914-1977), in N o.8, and another about the young Moravian sculptor O.Oliva in No.9. lt could well be that this is another area of interest which the joumal is planning to follow more dosely, but in the mean- time, the editor "justifies" the inclusion of both contributions on the grounds that no independent art joumal yet exists. Also worth~of mention is another separate section devoted to CONTEMPORARY POLISH POLmCAL rnouGHT (Kolakowski, Michnik and Brzezinski) in No. 8, the continuation of the discussion about Hus in a specialised historical essay in No. 9 (signed "Speratus"), and the publication, also in No. 9, of the first part of Julius Vrána's Notes for a history of Centra[ Europe. But while in terms of content and composition, Stfedn{ Evropa is sharp- ening its profile from issue to issue, in terms of editing the situation is one of stagnation. Even in the past two issues there have still been an unac- ceptable number not only of spelling mistakes but also of grammatical and stylistic lapses. One gets the impression that the editor has done no more than select and assemble texts and has deliberate- ly avoided "interfering" with them. As a result, a good number of interesting pieces have suffered unnecessarily owing to insufficient editing. -db- Kritický sborník, 1987, Vol.7, No.4, pp.111-113. Editorially shortened. 46 LETIERS I Dear "-db-", I have many objections to your essay about the joumal Středn{ Evropa. Maybe some of them would be more properly addressed to the editors of Kritický sbomfk, but I don't intend to try appor- tioning responsibility. First of all, I fail to understand why your views on the editorial line and evolution of the journal in question were published in the BOOK NEWS section - which up to now, as far as I can tel1, has been devoted to notes about samizdat publica- tions. Secondly, if your article was intended to be objective reporting then I can only say that Kritic- ký sbom{k is biased against Středn{ Evropa. But let us examine what you actually wrote about it. It is clearly outrageous to state that cer- tain themes "are only indirectly related to the review's subject-matter as proclaimed by its title". Do you really believe that Czech history is only "indirectly or by implication" related to Central European issues? What, then, in your view, is more directly related to the Centra} European issue than the history of the countries, nations and states making up this part of the world? If people are to find some way of living together in harmony, they need to know about each others' own history and traditions, clear up their misunderstandings and make every effort to redress mutual injustices. Or do you think she should set about dreaming up grand schemes, which would immediately start to collapse, being built on the sands of mere theory? In my view, the work both of Jaroslav Durych and [pageend49]particularly of Josef Florjan represent extremely important attempts at reviving catholic thought during the latter period of Austrian rule and at the time of the First Republic. Some might regard them as marginal figures. I personally hold to the view that without them things would look very different bere today. You find it "disconcerting" that the editors of Stfednl Evropa fail to provide "an overview of everything written about the topic" around the world, etc. Well, I must say it you who disconcert me. You air certain misgivings about the fact that "it chiefly comprises translated articles" and then over the page the reader is told that Stfednl Evropa does not provide information about EVERYTHING being written about the topic in different parts of the world. What do the journal's poor editors have to do to please you? People from Czechoslovakia attending international conferences and symposia on the topic of Central Europe are few and far between. What can one do, therefore, apart from translating the papers given there or summarising the collected papers when they are subsequently published? "It should be pointed out that some of the views expressed echo pre- war right-wing think- ing." Do you really think so? On the contrary, my dear "-db-", on the contrary! Conditions bere are not yet such as would allow one in all decency to stick such a denunciatory label on a person, nor will they be for a long time to come. If my friend Václav Benda writes that he considers himself to be an anti-communist, then thaťs his business and he is fully aware of the risk he runs. But if I were to say the same thing about bim, even if I thought he would agree, then I would be placing bim at risk of attracting even greater secret police interest. And the same applies to aspersions about those who, for various reasons, do not sign their articles with their full name, whether individuals or groups. If you truly discovered from reading Stfednl Evropa that Notes for a history of Centra/ Europe, published in No. 9, was written by JULIUS Vrána, then you should think about opening a travelling oracle. I took the trouble of asking the editors themselves, something which you could have one as well. The article was signed J.Vrána; you took a liberty in writing "Julius". The same goes for your assertion that "one could determine for sure" that "it was the work of a single editor" - on the basis of the first issue of Stfednl Evropa! But what- ever made you put in your sub-title that it was about issues 8 and 9 of the journal, when in fact you hardly mention them? And as for "the unacceptable number of mis- takes" you mention: you know, I could lend you a recopied Kritický sborník produced outside Prague, and I can assure you that you would be amazed how little of your professionally executed work remained. What is an "acceptable" number of mistakes? After all, even such outstanding style as your own is no guarantee of reliable informa- tion ... II Dear Petruška Šustrová, Petruška Šustrová I must admit I read your letter with growing amazement! From my short piece about Stfednl Evropa you conclude that I am biased. If iťs true, 47 [pageend50]then iťs news to me! The fact is that I have fol- lowed approvingly the progress of that joumal since its very first issue. I am pleased that such a periodical has come into existence, and above all that it is holding its own (in itself no mean achievement ). But my personal feelings are neither bere nor there, are they? The important thing, naturally, is what I actually wrote. However, even after re-reading my article several times I still fail to see how it constitutes misrepresenta- tion of Stfednf Evropa or inaccurate reporting as you claim. My criticisms were precisely two in number, and both of them can be easily substan- tiated. I readily admit that it is rather a tall order to provide - in the space of a few lines - an overall picture of a periodical which already has nine is- sues to its credit. Moreover my article makes no claims to "objectivity": my ambitions fall far short of that. What matters is whether I was basically accurate in what I wrote. lt is possible that I was guilty of certain imprecisions and that I neglected some important features, but anyway I was writing a magazine article, not a bibliographical entry. But you go right ahead and accuse me of matice, and that I find annoying. You know, the whole business of"objectivity" is a very tricky one. Ask yourself whether you, who in such an enviable matter-of-course way demand "objectivity" of me, satisfy that requirement your- self. I think you would find it harder to accuse me of matice if your objections were not largely derived from subjective emotions, i.e. irritation. There is no arguing against irritation. Even so, l'11 try and show that your objections are not quite as apt as you no doubt think. 48 How should I have gone about writing a brief appraisal of Střednf Evropa's evolution, then? Surely you'll agree with me that the following three elements were essential: 1) a description of the joumal's principal subject-matter; 2) an ap- praisal of its political or philosophical line, and 3) an assessment of the standard of its writing. coNCERNING POINT 1): The title Střednf Evropa implies a sPECIFIC POLICY, which was also obvious from the initial statement of intent. The fact that the title is so indefinite or ambiguous naturally gives the editor a fairly free band. Nonetheless, the reader is entitled to ask to what degree the joumal's content lives up to its declared aim. And bere, I believe, it is obvious that only now is the joumal beginning to achieve this goal - albeit slowly, and with certain ups and downs. There is nothing wrong in that, of course, and what I said was intended not as criticism, but comment. Conceming the specific question of Czech history: of course it forms part of the whole issue of Central Europe, along with Czech literature and Czech art. The contrary does not follow how- ever, and not every article on Czech history ( or literature, etc.) is necessarily related to the ques- tion of Central Europe. The same historical or literary subject can be treated in many different ways, and its connection with the Central Euro- pean question will vary accordingly. It can be di- rectly or indirectly connected with it, or BY IMPLICA- TION in some way. Do you still consider this ap- proach to be "outrageous"? Just imagine, for the sake of argument, that the joumal was called Eu- rope and set itself the task of examining the phe- nomenon of "Europeanness". Could one really maintain that any study of Czech history would [pageend51]automatically form part of research into the phe- nomenon of Europe, merely because the territory of Bohemia lies in Europe? That applies as much to Hussism, as it does to Durych or Florian. Of course one could deal with those outstanding figures in a "Central Euro- pean" perspective. However, when Stfednl Evro- pa published Patočka's foreword to The divine rainbow and Hradec's study about Florian, I felt that it had failed to do so. Do you find my criticism of the lack of con- sistency in the sections devoted to reviews, com- mentaries, etc., "outrageous" too? Of course a couple of good reviews have been published, but what is absolutely lacking is information ( even in the form of brief notes) about "Centra! Euro- pean" literature published abroad. Do you really consider it an effrontery for me to have drawn public attention to this shortcoming? Foreign sources are admittedly not readily accessible, but they are not totally inaccessible. My own enquiries have led me to conclude that the editorial team was in a position to overcome this deficiency if they had wanted to do. coNCERNING POINT 2): You completely floored me when you called my reference to "right-wing" tendencies a "denunciatory label". I wasn't ex- pecting that, I must say. The impression I have been getting over the past few years is that the term "right-wing" (if we are to go back to using that traditional designation) is at last ceasing to be a dirty word and being usedat it ought to be in norma} circumstances, i.e. to describe one particu- lar legitimate political standpoint. One can see this happening throughout independent journal- ism: there are journals with left-wing leanings ( e.g. Ze zásuvky a z bloku) and those which take a more or less right-wing line (which - in my view, but not just mine - also include Stfednf Evropa). What at this point is a reviewer to do, in your opinion? Every independent journal attracts the attention of the secret police, by the very fact of being published, and I believe one would have a bard job deciding what annoys the powers that be more: right-wing views or independent left- wing opinion. To be sure, "anti-communism" is another case entirely, but your analogy is extremely far- fetched, to put it mildly. coNCERNING POINT 3): I admit that the second of my criticisms, regarding continued shortcom- ings in the editing of texts, was worded rather strongly, but I assure you that I weighed my words carefully. Surely you can't believe, dear Mrs Šust- rová, that I would have the impudence to voice such a criticism on the basis of an nth transcript of Stfednl Evropa - let alone one produced outside Prague? I make it a principle always to use one of the first "batch" of copies - those that serve as models for subsequent transcripts - for my re- views. I am fully aware of the sort of howlers typists can commit when transcribing texts over and over again, and also that such texts are not copy edited. But surely this fact does not exempt editors from the duty to strive for professional standards, at the very least in the initial output over which they have control. "What is an accept- able number of mistakes?", you ask, rather naive- ly. It is extremely relative i.e. one can only judge it in comparison with other publishing operations. Were Stfednl Evropa Prague's first ever samizdat periodical and had it no rivals in the field, my criticism would naturally have been excessive. 49 [pageend52]I really am not the sort of nit-picker who makes a point of searching for "printing errors" and then flinging them in editors' faces. On the other hand, I see no reason why, in samizdat's present state of development, we should put up with a lower standard in independent periodicals than in the official press. Besides we should also have an eye to the future: if we don't get used to working professionally in samizdat how will we cope when conditions change and we'll be faced with the public at large? Finally, I must appease your curiosity about how I discovered that J.Vrána's first name is Julius. I do assure you that I neither dreamt it up nor was it revealed to me by occult forces. I dis- covered it in some French joumal - I think it was either Esprit or Commentaire (though I can't ex- clude the possibility that they were mistaken ). I didn't think it unreasonable for me to make practical use of this knowledge. lt was partly a sort of test: if he really was Julius he would keep quiet about it; if he was Jaroslav, say, he would issue a disclaimer. Is that sufficient explanation for you? Mind you, I am curious to know why you make so much of it ... Yours faithfully, Daniel Bohdan Kritický sborník, 1988, Vol.S, No.1, pp.98-103. Editorially shortened. *** STŘEDNÍ EVROPA /Central Europe/. No. 10 (Prague, Fe- bruary 1988, 193 pp. A4). The introductory section opens with the sec- ond part of J(ulius) Vrána's Notes for a history of 50 Centra/ Europe. This article, which is presumably to be continued, should be welcomed as the first major contribution by a local author to come to grips with the issues implicit in the joumal's title. The next three contributions continue the discus- sion of the article by '½ndreas": "Czech wande- rings" (the first two parts of which appeared in issues 8 and 9). In terms of length, and above all approach, one of the replies: "Czech dreams", signed "Moravius", goes well beyond the scope of the discussion so far. The following section, under the title of YUGO- sLAv PATI-IS is the first part of a persona} account of Tito's concentration camps by a former political prisoner, and a review of a book by British jour- nalist N orah Beloff Tito 's dubious legacy. In the light of the present situation, this new venture by the editors is a promising start to a demythologi- sation of Yugoslav communism. The section entitled ZEKHER, which started in No.8 and deals with the Jewish phenomenon in Centra} and Eastem Europe is especially well represented in the present issue. It comprises the first part of the diary of a Zionist statesman of Czech origin, Leo Herrmann, recounting his visit to Prague in Autumn 1945 (translated from the German edition of historian Peter Heumos ), an article by Ruth R. Wisse "Polish Jewish lumi- naries", and finally, a speech by Professor Ada Stego about the plans for a catholic monastery at Auschwitz. The RESPONSES section contains a review by exiled Russian historian Mikhail Geller of Solzhe- nitsyn's The Red Wheel (two volumes of which have already been published: August 1914 and November 1916, describing key moments in Rus- [pageend53]sian history on the eve of the Revolution ), and a profile of the Moravian artist Jan Jemelka by K.Novotný. The DOCUMENTS section reproduces the pe- tition by Czechoslovak catholics popularly known as the "Thirty-One Points", which calls for a new and just settlement of relations between Church and State. BIBLIOGRAPHY This issue's APPENDIX comprises the final instalment of Adam Wandruszka's monograph The House of Habsburg ( chaps. 14 and 15), due to be published in the Stfednt Evropa book series. -db- Kritický sbomfk, 1988, Vol.8, No.2, pp.IX. "HISTORICKÉ STUDIE" 1978-1988 One of the earliest samizdat periodicals, Historic- ké studie /Historical studies/ marked its tenth year of publication in January 1988. It is the only jour- nal devoted to independent Czechoslovak histo- riography. Historické studie is published bian- nually and fully deserves the description of a his- torical review offering original studies and articles by authors resident in Czechoslovakia and Czecha slovak historians living abroad. In addition it has regular sections such as discussions, book reviews, source material, translations, bibliographies, etc. From the very first issues it was clear that this was a publishing initiative with long-term ambi- tions. Even so the group of independent historians which was responsible for the journal's publica- tion gave their efforts the ostensible appearance of occasional or commemorative miscellanies. In- deed most of the first ten annual series actually included the word sbomtk (review) in their titles or sub-titles. The title of the journal varied from issue to issue, and there was scarcely no duplication. The title Historické studie. Sbomtk /Historical studies. Review/, which was given to the first issue of January 1978, did not reappear until No. 17 of August 1984. The journal was published anony- mously, without any indication of who edited or published it, although most of the contributors appeared under their actual names. Norwere the issues numbered serially. lt was not until the issue of October 1985 that a typed figure 19 appeared on the title-page, from which it was apparent, even to the uninitiated, that this was the nineteenth issue of Historické studie in the series. However, it is only since issue 22 of January 1988 that Historické studie has acquired a stand- ard design, title and formal arrangement, and the number of the issue is clearly marked on the title page. The editors have emerged from anonymity and they are listed in the journal as Jaroslav Mez- 51 [pageend54]ník, Milan Otáhal and Jan Křen as part of an editorial group. In their introduction to issue 22 the editors acknowledge responsibility for the whole series. There are two other indications of this continuity. Firstly, there is the inclusion of the words "llth annual series" /11. ročník/ in the masthead, and secondly, the fact that a bibliog- raphy was published in No. 22 listing all the pre- vious issues, including those subsequently num- bered, along with an index of the contributions that had appeared in the journal up to and includ- ing the issue of January 1987 (No. 20). This bibli- ography also serves as an inventory of the journal's output. By Autumn 1988 a total of 24 volumes of Historické studie had been published, numbered from 1 to 23 ( the 11 th annual series consisting of Nos. 22 and 23). There was also an unnumbered issue: the volume entitled The history of German- Czech relations which came out in 1980, and was subsequently listed by the publishers between is- sues 4 and 5. Issues 1 to 21 were reproduced as carbon copies; Nos. 22 and 23 were distributed in photocopy (xerox) form. The Historické studie publishing group also has to its credit a book series entitled Knižnice Historických studii /The Library of Historical studies/ in which six titles appeared. Please note that the Documentation Centre has a complete set of Historické studie. Orders for copies of the entire set or of individual issues ( as well as of individua} articles, in exceptional cases) may be placed up to end of March 1989. *** The following bibliographical synopsis is in- tended to provide comprehensive information 52 about the Historické studie series to date, and about its individua} issues. (The preparation of a more detailed bibliography, including an index of authors and subject-matter, remains a task for the future, and the same applies to an analysis of the series to assess its overall contribution to Cze- choslovak historiography, and the quality of the individua} contributions, etc.) The line immediately below the serial num- ber of the publication contains all the information available from the title page of the individua} issue, followed by the number of pages. The peri- odical's format has always been A4 and is there- fore not specified. The initials s.I. ( sine loco) indi- cate that the place of publication is not shown on the title-page. The names of individua} sections of the journal are given as in the original. All information given in square brackets is the work of the editor of this bibliographical syn- opsis; explanatory information about the content of individual contributions is also placed in square brackets.

SAMIZDAT PERIODICAL.5 1977 - 1988 The need has long been felt for systematic infor- mation about the output of samizdat periodicals in Czechoslovakia. These past years have seen a veritable publishing boom with the number of joumal titles growing so fast that most readers in Czechoslovakia itself, let alone those abroad, are losing track of what is being published. 64 This has not been merely a quantitative ex- plosion, however. The formidable total of at least fifty, and possibly sixty, samizdat joumals in exist- ence at the end of 1988 represents a broad palette of published texts and information covering all kinds of subject-matter and genre, and reflecting different views, generation concems, and so on. There are periodicals devoted in a general sense to culture, politics or religion. Others have a more specialised interest in literature, philos- ophy, theology, history, sociology, theatre, music, art or ecology. Some specialise in providing up-to- date information and commentary on political, economic, social and cultural developments in Czechoslovakia and in other parts of the world. But there are also publications conceived more as newsletters or bulletins of particular citizens' in- itiatives, or that deal with one very specific area of interest from many different angles, such as Ma- gazín Společnosti přátel USA /fhe Magazine of the Friends of the USA Association/ or, in quite a dif- ferent sense, the joumal Střední Evropa /Centra} Europe/. But even those joumals covering a similar area of interest, such as literature, display great differences in terms of aesthetic outlook or the targeted age-group. One need only compare Ob- sah or Kritický sborník, on the one hand, with Vokno, Revolver revue or Prostor, on the other. What makes for such enormous variety among the samizdat periodicals is not least the fact that many publishing activities are regional or national in character. While some of the journals are "statewide", with contributions from both Czech and Slovak authors, there are also a whole number of periodicals which are published only in [pageend67]Slovak, or which are strictly Slovakian ( even though some of them also publish contributions in Czech). And, of course, there are regional and local joumals in Moravia, Brno, Ostrava, northem Bohemia, etc. There is one large and entire autonomous sector of samizdat publishing made up of joumals devoted to ecclesiastical, religious, and theologi- cal matters, brought out by members of the cath- olic laity. This category can be further sub-divided in terms of subject-matter, or readership, or ac- cording to whether the joumals are published in Slovakia or in the Czech-speaking areas. Wide variation are also displayed in therms of periodicity. There are samizdat monthlies, quarterlies, specialised twice-yearly publications, year-books, or almanachs appearing at regular intervals. Samizdat periodicals also differ greatly in terms of editorial level, graphic presentation, reproduction technique, etc. etc. There is one thing that they all have in com- mon. They are an expression of a society liberating itself. They reflect the mushrooming of citizens' initiatives independent of the totalitarian state, and are a sign of their increasing self-confidence. They help boost morale and foster a sense of identity. The fact that such a broad spectrum of samizdat periodicals exists, that they are improv- ing all the time and emerging from the ghetto of dissent to reflect increasingly the concems of all sections of society, while all the time more and more joumals appear, catering for specific areas of interests, testifies to the progress made over the past decade by the germinating seeds of civil so- ciety in Czechoslovakia. lt also highlights the needs of society as a whole and of its component parts, in national, political, economic and cultural terms. Allow me to illustrate what I mean by re- calling the situation that existed fifteen years ago. This brief historical digression is also intended as a tribute to the forerunners of today's samizdat joumals. To my knowledge, only two joumals existed during the first half of the seventies. One of them was Fakta, připomínky, události /Facts, comments and events/ which bore the sub-title "political monthly" and described itself as follows: '½ self- service publication whose 'print-run' is deter- mined by its readers, according to the number of copies they make of each month's issue. lt is dis- tributed solely among friends and trusted ac- quaintances." We have only two issues of that "self-service publication" on which to base any assessment: one - four pages long - from January 1973, the other- seven pages long, excluding the title page- published the following September. The other joumal from that period was Ná- rodní noviny IN ational news/ which said the follow- ing about itself on its title page: "Published by the Czech nation at its own cost and reproduced by its readers themselves. lt is distributed solely for the benefit of trusted and reliable friends; every slip- up could lead to prosecution. The joumal is pub- lished regularly and is not for sale." We have only managed to obtain four issues of Národní noviny dated respectively April, October and November 1973, and April 1974. Their length varied from four to eleven pages of typescript. Both joumals carried news of activities that dissented from the normalisation policies of Husák and Brezhnev, and of resistance to them at home and abroad, as well as information and comments on political 65 [pageend68]trials and other forms of persecution of non-con- forming citizens, together with foreign news ig- nored by the official press. An obvious precursor of today's samizdat pe- riodicals was the series of feuilletons initiated by Ludvík Vaculík in March 1975. One of them ap- peared almost every week, although on occasions there were even two, making up for leaner weeks. These were highly individua!, literary comments on current events, which were topical without necessarily referring to the main political issues of the day, and circulated in countless copies among readers. During the first year of the series' exist- ence, 41 feuilletons appeared by a total of24 auth- ors. The inauguration of Charter 77 at the begin- ning of 1977 coincided with an explosion of inde- pendent joumalism. Alongside the various docu- ments and statements of Charter 77 and its spo- kespersons, which were published in quick succes- sion, there was a wave of declarations by groups or individuals, as well as open letters, reactions to official attacks on human rights activists, legal analyses, protests, etc. distributed in samizdat. Another feature of that period was a sudden upsurge in the literary genre traditionally known as the feuilleton, even if the 1977 variety departed somewhat from tradition in by their use of new means of expression and their choice of topical subject-matter. Mention must also be made of a notable example of samizdat joumalism of the time: Ladislav Hejdánek's series of articles, Dopi- ~ příteli /Letters to a friend/. During its first seven months of publication - from February to Sep- tember 1977 - the philosopher had issued 21 pieces on ethical and political topics, each of 66 which circulated in hundreds of typewritten copies. Nevertheless, the actual era of diverse samiz- dat periodicals appearing regularly alongside one another in the advanced and polished form we now know them did not commence until the end of 1977 and the beginning of 1978. The first four titles of that period - two of which went out of existence while the others are still with us - were of quite a different order. Dialogy /Dialogues/, published by Rudolf Battěk, Ladislav Hejdánek and Jan Tesař, started life as a series of tracts on historical, political and philosophical themes. The untitled literary and cultural journal that was re- printed abroad under the name Spektrum would seem to have been conceived as a regular alman- ach covering all fields of literature and thought; it was also very ambitious in terms of content, layout and artwork. Informace o Chartě 77 /News of Charter 77 - "Infoch"/, originally 4-6 pages in length, was conceived at the outset as a newslet- ter, whereas Historické studie /Historical studies/ was planned as a specialised periodical devoted to a historiography, independent of official concepts of history and historical study. An idea of how the situation developed up to the end of 1988 can be gained from the following Prelimina,y list of Czechoslovak samizdat peri- odicals 1977-88 prepared with the assistance of Lubomír Martínek. This alphabetical list com- prises brief descriptions of a total of eighty samiz- dat periodicals about which we have at least some information, plus details of two new titles from January 1989. There then follow several tables in which periodicals are listed according to specific criteria, providing a broader picture of this area [pageend69]of self-help publishing activity. We make no bones about the fact that the details in the main list are incomplete and fragmentary. There were even some aspects of the record that we were obliged to pass over for the time being. Neither the main list nor the subsequent breakdown analyses tel1 us anything about the growing print runs of the sa- mizdat journals. Little can be learnt of the clearly rapid evolution from the almost exclusive use of typewriters to the other methods of reproduction which have started to come in over the recent period. They tel1 us nothing about increasingly ambitious standards of editing fostered by the publishers. They reveal nothing of the enormity of the task undertaken by the publishers of Lidové noviny, for instance, which has managed to thrive for twelve whole months already. Anyone with even a vague notion of the state of affairs in Czechoslovakia over the past twenty years will realise that each the journal listed was a story of intense drama for the individuals or groups of people involved in their production: countless hours oflaborious work; battling against all odds to create some kind of editorial and writ- ing environment; the tricky and hazardous task of finding technical and financial support - all in a situation of permanent tension: convinced, on the one band, of the vítal need to public texts and information, while realising, on the other, that their publishing activity would inevitably attract the attention of the State's repressive apparatus and could lead to persecution and penalties of all kinds. The following lists are also intended as a re- minder and an appeal to all those in any way involved. Never forget to record for posterity everything done and achieved in the field of inde- pendent publishing, while there is still time and while it is still fresh in your memories. Acta was created precisely to carry such testimonies. *** The list has been compiled on the following pat- tern: 1. The first line of the entry gives the precise TI1LE and, where applicable, suB-TilLE of the periodical, where these data appear on the cover or title page. Any changes that occurred during the periodical's existence are recorded in round brackets. 2. For reasons of space and simplicity, all other details, such as the periodical's objectives, edi- tor( s), place and frequency of publication, etc., are entered according to the following system: D: Brief description of the periodical where not evident from its title or sub-title E: Editor( s), place of publication L: Date when the periodical was launched, and, where applicable, the year it ceased publica- tion P: Frequency of publication F: Format, number of pages, reproduction tech- nique, binding, illustrations T: Tatai number of issues or volumes published A: Those issues or volumes available in the Centre's archives METHODICAL NOTES AND EXPLANATIONS: a) The list has been compiled from data avail- able within the ČSDS archives, bearing in mind that the Centre does not have complete sets of all 67 [pageend70]samizdat periodicals. Where details were unob- tainable, certain headings were omitted. b) Details obtained elsewhere than from the title page or imprint are given in square brackets; these include, for instance, the names of publish- ers or editors, as given in the list of signatories to the Declaration of Solidarity with Ivan Polanský, or details about place of publication. In the case of undated issues, an approximate date of publication has been deduced from the content. Remarks printed within inverted com- mas are quotations from the publication in ques- tion. c) Because of the very nature of samizdat periodicals, their content and, above all, their ex- tent vary a great deal over a given period of time. Very few of them start life with a distinct concept. The description given bere applies in general a given journal's current profile. Since most of the periodicals have tended to expand, we have re- corded their lowest number of pages - usually in their first issues - and the number of pages in their largest - most recent - issues. The figures corre- spond to issues in the ČSDS archives ( and in some cases refer to the single issue available to us at the time ). As one might expect, the greatest differen- tial occurs in those periodicals longest in exist- ence. d) Information about periodicals not in the Centre's archives was obtained from outside sour- ces such as the "Periodicals" section of Kritický sbomfk or the regular feature on new periodicals inlnfoch. 68 e) Entry ''N..' is intended to serve a dual pur- pose. Firstly, it will inform those wanting to con- sult samizdat periodicals which issues are avail- able at the Centre for in situ perusal or of which copies may be obtained. Secondly, it constitutes a list of our wants and an appeal to the publishers and to ČSDS supporters to help us fill these lacu- nae in our collections. *** The list of periodicals which is compiled al- phabetically by title, irrespective of when the jour- nal was launched or any other considerations ( such as whether it still exists or has since ceased production ), is followed by FIVE TABLES in which the periodicals are listed by suB-CATEG0RY. These are intended only as appendices to the main list, but in many ways they are extremely informative about this particular area of samizdat publishing. In these tables, the only data given are the periodical's title and its lifespan, or alternatively the date of its launch if it has been published continuously to the present. For ease of reference, the titles of periodicals which have ceased publi- cation are preceded by a cross ( + ). Those peri- odicals where we lack sufficient evidence of their continued existence at the end of 1988 are preceded by a question-mark (?). One of the ta- hles lists periodicals in Slovak about which we had information at the end of 1988. Tables 1 to 5 give only the Czech or Slovak titles of the periodicals; readers are kindly asked to refer to the main list for the English equivalents.

The Documentation Centre and Acta have lost not Just a f~iend, but also a colleague always ready to gtve advice and reliable information, and above all to offer assistance with his exceptional talents as a translator. His legacy in the field of transla- tion has done an enormous amount to promote knowl_edge of Cz~ch literature in the English- speakmg world. H1s achievement is richer and far more extensive than any of us yet realise. This will be evident from the bibliography of Theiner's translations being prepared for publication in a future issue ofActa. In the meantime, we have decided to publish a survey of his ~ain translations prepared by Index on Censorship. We are grateful to the editors of_ l~dex for thi~ m~terial and for their kind per- m1ss10n to repnnt, m Czech and English, Václav Havel's reminiscence written for that journal shortly after George Theiner's death. *** When members of the Royal Shakespeare Co~pany who staged my play Temptation visited me m Prague and presented me with a video of their production, I invited several of my friends and we all watched it together. The video ended with the entire cast dressed in their ordinary clothes assembled on the stage: in the middle of them stood George Theiner, translator of the play, who looked warmly straight at me, lifted his glass in toast and congratulated me in Czech. lt was such a truly touching little surprise that I had a bard time trying not to get all emotional in front of my friends. I think that forever now, George Theiner will remain in my memory in his role of toast-master on that stage. I never met bim in person. Severa} times I spoke with bim on the telephone, I saw bim on several videos, and of course I knew his work as the author of excellent translations from Czech into English and as the editor of Index on Censor- ship. From all this I formed an impression of bim as an exceptionally nice and gentle, modest and hard-working man. I owe bim much gratitude, as do many Czechoslovak writers. And I firmly be- lieve that after his departure, Index on Censorship will not only keep its high standards but will also continue to play its unique and irreplaceable cul- tural role, as it did under the editorship of George Theiner.

From the moment of his arrest, Ivan Polan- ský's case was monitored by VONS (the Commit- tee for the Defence of the Unjustly Prosecuted), 86 the independent citizen's initiative established in 1978 by Czech signatories of Charter 77. VONS issued reports about Polanský's arrest, his interro- gation and his state of health, as well as about the sentence and its confirmation by the Slovak su- preme court. In October 1988 an Ivan Polanský Solidarity Committee was set up in Czecho- slovakia. The Committee's Declaration was signed by 83 independent journalists and publishers of sa- mizdat periodicals and literature from all over the Republic. Most of the signatories appended the title of the journal or book series to which they contribute, or which they help to produce or dis- tribute. There were a good thirty journals or book series listed in this way. Until that moment, much of the information had been only known to those directly involved since many independent editors have been in the practice of using pseudonyms as a cover or have published journals anonymously. We are printing in full the Committee's Dec- laration and the list of its signatories as a note- worthy example of solidarity with all those whose civil and human rights are denied or whose exer- cise of them is restricted. Such solidarity without regard to nationality, political views, religious be- liefs, age or occupation, has become the rule with- in independent circles in Czechoslovakia over the past tenor twelve years. On the back cover of this present issue we are printing a facsimile of a letter sent to Ivan Polan- ský's wife by Cardinal František Tomášek, Arch- bishop of Prague. While the present issue of Acta was going to press, it was announced that Ivan Polanský's sen- tence had been reduced to two years' imprison- [pageend89]ment as a result of an amnesty at the end of Oc- tober 1988. He was conditionally released on 15th December on four years' probation. The editors DECLARATION OF THE IVAN POLANSKÝ SOLIDARITY COMMITIEE Fifty-two-year-old Catholic lay activist Ivan Polan- ský from Dubnica nad Váhom was recently sen- tenced to four years imprisonment for duplicating and distributing publications and litera ture, most- ly on religious or historical topics. lt is our view that everyone has the right to engage in inde- pendent joumalism, as well as in the publishing and distribution ofliterature of all kinds. This right is also guaranteed under article 19 of the Intema- tional Covenant of Civil and Politi cal Rights which has been in farce in Czechoslovakia since 23rd March 1976. Ivan Polanský's conviction is unlaw- ful, among other reasons, because his activities in no way impinged the limitations to which the exer- cise of the right of freedom of expression is subject under article 19 of the covenant in question: both as author and publisher he respected the rights and reputations of others and in no way threat- ened national security, public order, or public health and morals. The arrest and conviction of Ivan Polanský are yet another demonstration by the organs of state power that they have no inten- tion of upholding the human rights covenants and that they regard the intemational pacts which they sign as no more than worthless scraps of paper. The absence of freedom of speech affects us all. Our country's state and party leaders are usur- ping the right to limit, curtail and suppress any utterance that they regard as detrimental to their power, even though their monopoly of power ex- tends to every area of society's life. In the circum- stances, independent publishing activities are vir- tually indispensable as a form of self-preserva- tion; ranging from fiction to specialised and relig- ious literature, and encompassing political texts and documents about the violation of human rights, as well as independent newspapers and free information media, they help maintain the historical continuity of culture and truthful infor- mation. It is not only a legitimate form of civil defence against the totalitarian manipulation of society, it is also a promise of freer conditions. In exercising his right to freedom of expression Ivan Polanský was motivated chietly by his awareness of this vital social need, and it was his religious faith that caused bim to regard free publishing activity as a moral imperative and his own per- sona} mission. Freedom is indivisible. A system of justice . which permits special exceptions must eventually tum into arbitrary power. The persecution of Ivan Polanský by the organs of state power is an attack on all of us involved, like him, in independent joumalism, and motivated by the same or similar principles. As independent publishers and jour- nalists of various cultural and political persua- sions, as well as of different religious faiths and none, we are engaged in precisely the same activ- ity as Ivan Polanský. Many of us have been in- volved in it publicly for years now. We cannot and will not remain silent about the fact that Ivan Polanský is actually in prison on behalf of us all. As members of the Ivan Polanský Solidarity Corn- 87 [pageend90]mittee, we issue the following urgent and resolute call to our country's state and political leaders - Put an end to the situation of legal abuses, stop flouting people's rights, and halt selective pros- ecutions whose sole aim is to maintain the whole of society in a state of fear. Either release Ivan Polanský or show some consistency in your per- verted system of justice by gaoling the rest of us. Our solidarity with Ivan Polanský can only be effective if the demand for his release wins the support of Czechoslovak and international public opinion. We appeal to all people of good will to help. An information service has been set up under the aegis of the Solidarity Committee to act as a clearing-house for information about Ivan Polanský's conditions of imprisonment and the situation of his family, as well as about actions in his support.

To quote from the joumal: The grant in memory of Bedřich Fučile will be awarded annually by a panel of specialists to young literary critics, theoreticians, historians or editors on the basis of praven creative achieve- ment, as an encouragement for them to continue work on topics which have no hope of being pub- lished, except in typescript, in the present status quo. The panel has decided to issue the following appeal to coincide with the announcement of the award: The Bedřich Fučile Grant bears the name of a man who spent his whole life in tireless, devoted, unassuming and self-sacrificing service to Czech literature. For years and years, right up to his death, he worked without respite, preparing criti- cal editions of silenced poets, thereby saving them from oblivion. In the spirit ofhis legacy, we appeal to the younger generation of literary specialists and critics to tum their attention also to the ne- glected problems of most recent Czech literary output and to the gaps in the study of modem Czech literature. The growing number and range of such gaps are an alarming sign of ongoing crisis. We would point out that in terms of objective academic treatment, literary theory and history in 90 Czechoslovakia have never got further than the 1945 watershed. The current preparatory work for a standard overall history of modem Czech literature displays a lack of responsibility which will result in a tendentious and partial historical account. Critical assessments of such prominent representatives of post-war ( and sometimes even 2re-war) poetry and prose as Deml, Zahradníček, Cep, Seifert, Holan, Kolář, Hrabal, Škvorecký, etc. are virtually non-existent. Often there is not even any reference to a whole number of banned authors, let alone to their bibliographies or critical editions of their works. University departments and other academic institutions are able to in- clude such topics in their curricula only in so far as they conform to current cultural policies, i.e. so long as it ignores or distorts information about key literary currents or personalities. It is up to us alone. We feel that everyone involved in literature in one way or another should keep this vacuum constantly in mind and regard this work as their persona} duty. We off er our assistance to all those wishing to work with commitment in the field ofliterary study or history. For instance, we are able to help them in defining areas of study and locating source material, as well as in terms of methodology, etc. Precise details are available via the editors of this joumal. Kritický sborník, 1988, Vol. VIII, No.2. [pageend93]VIADIMIR SOLOVYOV PRIZE AWARDED The members of the judging panel for the one-off prize offered in honour of the Russian philos- opher Vladimir Solovyov to mark the thousandth anniversary of the adoption of Christianity by Kie- van Russia, met in Prague on 30th June 1988. (Cf. Acta, 3 & 4/87, inside back cover.) They read and appraised an essay entitled "Could it be a case of ex oriente Lux, after all?", by Ivan Brod, further, a historical study: Russia and religion with the sub- title To mark the thousand-year pilgrimage through Russian history of God 's people by František Op, and finally a poem by lva Kotrlá entitled Famed land. The group commended the standard of the con- tributions received and voiced its thanks to the contributors. The hope was also expressed that authentic spiritual activity would continue to grow spontaneously, independent of the official struc- tures and free of ideological interference. This process would be assisted if the practice of award- ing one-off or regular prizes were to continue in future. The winner of the Vladimir Solovyov Competition was declared to be: Could it be a case of ex oriente lux, after al/? The author of the winning contribution receives our congratulations and the prize of 3,000 crowns. At the same time, we would thank all those who showed an interest in the topíc of "Russia and Christianity" and supported our competition's underlying idea, and wish them every success in their quest for enduring and authentic human values.

There is agreement both in independent circles in Czechoslovakia and in the Czechoslovak exile community that Jan Patočka's writings are a major component of the Czech spiritual herit- age and that conditions should be created so that Jan Patočka's collected works be made available in definitive form in the Czech language. 2. An editorial group is already working on the project. It consists of a care of experts on Jan Patočka's work - philosophers who studied under Patočka - assisted by other scholars and technical personnel. The group plans to prepare three vol- umes of the manuscripts per year, on the basis of a scheme for 12-15 volumes. At this rate, work on the entire manuscript will be completed by 1993 at the latest. 3. The Documentation Centre for the Promo- tion of Independent Czechoslovak Literature (ČSDS) plays a coordinating role between the editorial group and institutions supporting the project in various ways. The latter include the Charta 77 Foundation in Stockholm and the Ox- ford-based "Centra} and East European Publish- ing Project" (CEEPP), whose assistance will en- able the editing of the first four volumes of the 92 Collected Works. There is widespread support among European intellectuals for the view that the Czech edition of Patočka's writings is not sole- ly a Czech affair, but a matter of European cultu- ral importance and as such merits international support. 4. Following the publication of the complete bibliography of Patočka's works and the discus- sion about the formal arrangement of the edition and how it is to be printed, a consensus has been reached that the most practical approach is to undertake the work in two stages: a) Continuing the work of preparing the manuscripts of the 12-15 volumes of the definitive text, complete with all supplementary material, including footnotes, indexes, etc. (Preparation of the manuscripts involves writing the entire text to computer diskettes as a basis either for normal typesetting or for printing out on a computer printer.) b) The actual publication, in terms of printing (including print-run) and distribution, about which no final decision will be taken until early 1991, when the manuscripts of the first six vol um es should be ready. Alternatively, it might be possible to publish individua! volumes either as printed books (particularly in the case of those intended for a wider readership) or in the form of photocopies for study purposes. [pageend95]5. Acta will continue to provide news of the pro- gress of the work as well as information about foreign language editions of Jan Patočka's writ- ings. 6. The publication of Patočka's works in Czech is an enormous task. Its successful fulfilment will require not only the cooperation of the exile pub- lishing houses, but also - and above all, in the present phase - the support of sponsors and sub- scribers. We are therefore issuing a further appeal for help. Contributions can be sent as a (tax-de- ductible) donation to the ČSDS earmarked "Pa- točka's Writings". All such donations will be de- posited in a special account and donors will be notified in writing of the use made of them. -vpn- ČSDS PUBLICATIONS 1986-88 The ACTA CREATIONIS book series Reprints and collections of works originally pub- lished in samizdat; reference material about inde- pendent literature, and its individua} varieties and genres.

I have been informed of your husband, Ivan Polanský's com- mendable efforts in the field of catholic samizdat publishing. Over the past years he has printed dozens of titles and thousands of co- pies of different religious publications. Ata time when the Church was unable to publish its own litera ture officially, your hus band, through his activity, helped assuage our believers' thirst for relig- ious literature. By providing news of the afflictions suffered by catholic be- lievers at the hands of the police and the courts, he helped promote wider solidarity with those brothers and sisters bearing witness to their faith. Y our husbanďs publishing activity was safeguarded by the inter- national civil rights covenants which have also been signed by Cze- choslovakia. We ask the Lorďs protection for your hus band and all your fam- ily. I send my blessing as Archbishop to you, your husband and all your fami ly.
