London, October 1952 Dear fellow-students. You have before you the first number of a periodical to be published, more or less regularly, by a group of Czechoslovak students now living as exiles in this country, after having been driven out from their own universities by a regime which is depriving its citizens of the freedom of spiritual expression and academic teaching and study., „..- Our object in bringing out this publication is quite clear from its title« Qur-'desire is to inform you truthfully on University life in present-day Czechoslovakia, as well as on what passes for such there. Our information is gathered mainly from the official Communist press to which you in the normal course of your studies have either no access or which, owing to your unfamiliarity with the Czech language, you cannot follow, but we are also able to draw on other sources such as thě personal experiences of those who have recently managed to flee the country. Many of the items are accompanied by notes and comment on our part, but some of them will be found quite self-explanatory. We shall endeavour to make you understand at least to seme extent the spirit that pervades the Communist press and official propaganda the terms and expressions of which, for the Communists, have a meaning totally different from what is understood by them this side of the Iron Curtain;, neither that press, nor that propaganda is in the least interested in speaking objective truth, for from their point of view, truth is and can only be that which serves and bolsters up the Communist regime, whose victory is the ultimate goal. We wish to shoví you a few ex- : - amples of what the Communists are teaching the young generation behind the Iron Curtain to think of you and your way of life. Perhaps we shall succeed in making you at least momentarily aware of a dreadful reality where the universities which in the free world are temples of independent, progressive thought,and" centres which in a decisive manner give shape to mankind’s evolution, are under dictator regimes becoming no less than medieval catacombs in which young human souls are being deprived of their most priceless possession - spiritual freedom - and are being crippled and poisoned by drugs which turn thinking men into a mute herd of cattle. Our wish to make yoů^Řiis danger is all the greater, the more many of you will want to shut your eyes and not see it. The fate of all the people throughout the world to-day is such an intertwined affair that for one part of the world to try and shut its eyes before the problems of the other part is unwise and pluckless. By writing thus we want to provoke you into thinking about the future of us all from the broadest possible point of view, aid into not trusting too much the words of those who so glibly seek to assure you that it is possible to live side by side with an expansive evil in peace and amity, -vr DEATH C STUDENTS IN THE FIGHT FOR FREEDOM, According to reports in the Cosmunist press of Czechoslovakia, two students, V.Zelezny and A.Pokorny, were sentenced to death in Brno (Moravia) on June 13,1952. In the same trial, university assistant V.Jukl was sentenced to 25 years, and a woman professor in the Charles University of Prague, R,Vackova to 20 years imprisonment. All four were, accused of espionage« Czechoslovak students in exile pay homage to their fellow-students at home, who carry on with their traditional fight of Czechoslovakia’s academic youth for the freedom of both their nation and mankind in the same spirit in which they waged it during the occupation against the Nazis. These latest sacrifices show that they stand up for values higher than their own lives*- FORMAL END OF NUS INDEPENDENCE IN CZECHOSLOVAKIА. "Prace" , the leading journal of the Czechoslovak trades union movement reported in its issue of June 1, I952 that an "Association of Employees and Students of Universities and Scientific Institutes in ROH" (Trades Union Congress) has been formed. At the first national conference of this nevi ROH group in May this yearfKarel Kozelek, a student of the School of Political Studies was elected president. STUDENT NEWS FROM BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN [pageend1]Until then a formally independent body of Czechoslovak students, ŃUS has thus beccme a part of the nation-wide trade unionist movement, by whose constitution and regulations it has to abide. A lot could be added to what the press of the Best has been writing lately on the subject of Czechoslovak trade unionism, so as to make you realise what an obedient tool the trade unions are to-day in the hands of an authoritarian Czechoslovak government. The student movement is now also formally in the hands of the regime which will make quite sure that it will t©e the Communist line, JOSEPH GROHMAN IN THE LIMBO, That perennial fixture as IUS President and a well- known figure at post-war international student rallies, Joseph Grohman, who seme time ago resigned from his office has sunk beyond recall into tlie swamps of the Communist political scene. The reason that was given for his resignation from the IUS was that he had been offered an important civil service appointment. The official organ of the Czechoslovak Communist Party,"Ruda Pravo" stated in its report on the national conference of the SCM (Union of Czechoslovak Youth) that Joseph Grohman failed to secure election for the Executive Committee .His name is listed amongst those who met a similar fate on account of their alleged anti-government policy within the SCM, The ex-President of the SCM,Josef H ejzlar, was at the conference publicly exposed as "an enemy of the regime and a Western, agent", and is now in gaol. For quite a lang.time. a willing tool of Moscow, Joseph Grohman has been unceremoniously dropped either on account of his connection with HejzJar, or of any of the things that are taboo in Czechoslovakia, now, MATRICULATION REGLATIONS IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA. In the following paragraphs will be found a verbatim translation of excerpts from the matriculation regulations now in force, which we hope will be of interest. The information .was obtained fron the Ministry of Education Gazette No .VIII, fol.3, 1952. The Object of Matriculation Examinations in Secondary Schools, The object of the final secondary school examination is to discover to what extent the pupil is politically and educationally fitted to cope with the demands to' be placed on him by university study, and whether he is fitted to become a member of the new Socialist intelligentsia, faithful to the working class and Socialism, At the examination, the pupil must show the extent of his general education and of his knowledge of the basis of the scientific Marx-Lenin w o r l d -movement. During the period of preparation for and in the course of the examination, the school will form an opinion on its methods, of education-inter alia- from whether the pupil correctly chooses his future career or course of study at a University and seo shows his understanding of the important economic and political duties of the State. The examination is set by a committee. The chairman is named by the local National Committee (roughly equivalent to Borough Councils in the U.K.Jfrom amongst a number of well-tried secondary school headmasters. Deputy Chairman is the headmaster of the school at which the examination is taken, the other members being the class master, a delegate from the local National Committee and a representative of the local branch of the Union of Czechoslovak Youth, After the general classification of all the pupils they are invited to an interview before the committee where their life, future, future employment or further study are discussed. When all the pupils have been interviewed, the committee decides by voting in all cases whether a' given pupil is to be recommended for further study on the basis of the interview and of a written report prepared beforehand. These reports are prepared independently by the headmaster and his staff, the Committee of the SCM and the delegate of the local national conmittee, After perusal of the reports the committee must decide whether or not to recomend the pupil for further study or for his chosen employment. The committee decides on the recommendation to a University by voting,..,«............. UNIVERSITY STUDENTS* HOLIDAYS IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA. The journalistic mouthpiece of the SCM(Union of Czsl.Youth), "Mlada Eronta" published in its August I3 issue an appeal to university students, asking them once more to enrol in the September works brigade in aid of the. construction of the huge Klement Gottwald Foundries in Kuncice near Ostrava.A similar ‘voluntary* brigade was already organized in June and July, and about 3,000 students were supposed to have joined it, but the work there does not seem to have progressed at a sufficiently quick rate, or else the Communists feared the university students might idle their time away during the. holidays - hence the new recruiting drive«,. Officially these brigades are quite voluntary, but unless the students can produce before the autumn term a chit to the effect that they had taken part in any holiday brigades, they will be barred from attending as regular students at the universities. [pageend2]MILITARY TRAINING OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. The Communists are trying to convince the world how they love peace and,abhor most of all any idea of war. The evidence of a student who not long ago managed to escape from Czechoslovakia throws seme light on how things really are in that country. His experience is of compulsory military drill at the Slovak,universities (he studied at Bratislava University), but it is almost certain that the relevant regulations apply to the whole territory of the Czechoslovak Republic. The law governing compulsory military training for male university students was passed on October 1, 1951» and was extended to female students as from January 1, 1952» The students must give an undertaking that, after their studies are completed, they will attend at a military school for courses of training lasting from six to twelve months, according to the branch of service selected for them. On passing out from there they are given the rank of sub-lieutenant or lieutenant-specialist. The training comprises both theory and practice. Theory is being taught directly at the universities, practical training is done in gymnasia, on playgrounds, military drill grounds and in special camps,, The compulsory military training of the students is directed by a Chair for Military Affairs, which has been established in every university.The chair decides how the students are to be distributed over groups representing the various branches of the armed forces. Thus the students at an Institute of Science were directed as follows:- Students of civil engineering form sapper and building units, students of electro-technical engineering are being trained as telegraphists, operators of radio transmitters and radio jamming stations.listening-in apparatus and such like. Students of chemistry form units of engineers and pyrotechnicians and specialise further in (a) military gas warfare, (b)the laying and removing of mines, and (c) research in the field of offensive technical substances and their use. Students of mining technics are enrolled for the sane training as the chemists, and, finally, students of land survey engineering are being prepared for service with the Military Institute of Cartography in Prague о The members of ail these groups must naturally first of all undergo the current military arms drill. One day in each week is devoted to the miiitary training of the students. Besides this, there are from time to time route marches, night alarm drills,etc. Practical training is carried out during the first two weeks in February each year, and takes place in winter (military) camps. In summer this obligation also includes the compulsory working brigade from July!to July 30 and stay at a military summer camp, which is held from July 3I to September I5. These military camps are in charge of army officers. The various age groups of students (the Bratislava Engineering College has 3,700 students who are subject to training) are divided according to. service branch into companies, each of which has three platoons, sub-divided further into three to four squads of 11-12 men each. The leaders of every one of these units are without exception Communists, appointed by the Military Chair» The commanders of these Military Chairs are appointed by the Ministry of National Defence direct. The Military Chair .-..employs chiefly members of Czechoslovak army units who have come from the Soviet Union, partisans who have received Soviet training, and the like. The university units possess all the normal military equipment and are provided 'with all the current kinds of arms, lorries9motor-cars and motor-cycles. The practical military training consists of instruction in the handling of infantry arms such asthe rifle, revolver, automatic, machine gun, and in grenade throwing. The political schooling comprises lectures and seminaries on Marx- Leninism. These seminaries are being headed by specially schooled lecturers and the pick of Communists out of the ranks "of the people". The whole training is modelled on Red Army methods. Particular attention is being paid to the training of saboteurs and partisans, The imaginary enemy in all these drills is invariably the West, and those conducting the drills make use of the occasion by carrying on a virulent hate campaign against the Western Powers. Thus far goes the narrative of our fellow student, who has recently succeeded in making good his. escape from Czechoslovakia.As to the spirit in which all these training courses are carried on, one gets a fair example from one freely translated verse of a poem which a Cammunist journal of cultural pretensions, "Kultumi Noviny" has published a short while ago to encourage budding soldiers: "......... And if in drill you aim at the target,comrade, Just you try to imagine that the bull’s eye Is the face of a Western imperialist........ Your hand gets steady as a rock immediately....." -ric [pageend3]MASS-PRODUCED INTELLIGENTSIA. Before the Nazis during the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia closed down all Czech high schools of learning for the duration of World War II, Czechoslovakia had altogether 9 universities with 26 faculties. According to official, present-day Communist statistics, the number of high schools of learning in the country has risen to 22,with 54 faculties. A country with a population of 12 millions has 40»000 students, of whom 3,000 are so-called "worker students" who do not get into the universities after having passed an eight-year secondary school training, but on the strength of a passing-out certificate from a special, eleven-month course. In this way the regime makes sure of an influx of a "class—conscious" element whose proletarian origin is a guarantee of its reliability and becomes the backbone of a new university intelligentsia. Although we could comment in plenty on things connected with this new university elite in Czechoslovakia, we think it will perhaps be better if we reproduce verbatim.a report, issued by the principal Communist daily "Rude Pravo" on August 25, I95I» ioe.at the time the first of the special, eleven-month courses for worker students had ended. It says5- "The course of preparation for studies at the School of Mining, Metallurgy and Electro-Technics in Horečky nr.Frenštát p.Radhostem was attended by 95 pupils. Not a few of them were unable once to finish even only a higher elementary school training........those eleven months at the preparatory school meant for them a hard, tenacious struggle with themselves, with fatigue, with easy-going, with not being used to systematic- studying and with insufficient aids to study. But they won through.....It could be seen that many of the youngsters succeeded in making a deeper and more painstaking job of their studies in eleven months than students of industrial subjects at a normal secondary school. They have already behind them - with good results - the written part of their passing-out examination« They line up for their examinations with a song on their lips, the song of the Union of Czechoslovak Youth: "We’re being watched by thousands of eyes, looking whether we fail or move on "the world", You, our readers and fellow-students, who’know well what university studies mean, can after reading the few linequoted above form your own opinion as to vrhat is happening to the high seats ef learning in Czechoslovakia nowadays« MATRICULATION EXAM. IN SOCIAL SCIENCES. In the town of Chrudim, a farmer’s son from a near-by village was sitting for his passing-out examination. In the social sciences part he was asked what meritorious role Lenin had played in the Russian Revolution. His pat, unruffled answer was that no credit was, nor indeed could be due to Lenin for it. In proof of this, he quoted to the dumb-founded examiner a passage from a recently published Communist pamphlet, according to which "no individual can change anything, can undertake anything, no one but a collective body can do so," The result of that particular candidate’s examination was of course a non-pass. and, irrespective of the contents of the pamphlet he had referred to, he ever ■ since then toils away cn the family farm - provided this has not meanwhile been collectivised and turned into a kolkhoz unit-. -ric $ « $$ d is Sisd d$ $$ 4 Ф - d $ * v 0 d d ф d d c $ ФФ $ л ď о ф d d •; ■ ". : * STUDENT j®S FROM BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIL is published by the Czechoslovak Democratic Students Association, 26,Gwendolen Avenue , London ЗЛ.15? where any comments on this publication will be greatly appreciated.
