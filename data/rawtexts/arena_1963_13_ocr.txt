As a mathematician, I suffer from certain professional deformities. I like to define as best I can the concepts I am talking about. For instance, when I use the words : “looking for the truth’’ this is what I mean by them : Given a phenomenon, be it the birth of a child, the expanding universe or simply a falling apple from a tree, one tries to answer the questions “how” and “why”. This brings us immediately into the interrelation between science and religion. In fact, science tries to answer the question “how” by systematic description, while religion tries to give us the answer to the question “why” by means of causal explanation. Let me stress that according to my opinion as a layman the causal explanation is completely outside the actual realm of science. To avoid any misunderstanding, I have to define the concept of religion as I understand it. In the field of science we recognize two principal branches—pure religion and applied religion. I shall consider chiefly the realms of pure science and pure religion. To this effect, I have first to make clear what I understand by applied religion. Applied religion is derived from the impact of organized. human society on the urge of human spirit to explain the truth. Therefore, applied religion always re1 [pageend3]fleets to a certain degree the evolution of the human brain; in other words, it is prevalently anthropomorphic not only in its ultimate goal but also in its kind of communication. Hence, it is quite natural that we have different kinds of applied religions (creeds). Every kind of applied religion seems to derive its existence from the same tragic struggle between two endeavors: on one side there is from time immemorial a sociological urge to build up out of a certain amorphous host of human individuals an organized society; on the other side there is a mysterious !urge to grasp the meaning of truth. Although of the same origin, these different kinds of applied religions may appear very distant from each other. Let us now define the common aim of pure science and pure religion. It is the discovery of truth which is independent of TIME, space and MAN and goes far beyond the anthropomorphic experience of mankind. It is clear that both pure science as well as pure religion aim at the same objectives by different ways. But the means by which pure science and pure religion try to achieve this goal differ only in the stress put on intellectual activity. In order to see it clearly, let me remind you that the approach to a problem is based on four principles : empiricism which is a product of sensing, rationalism guided by more or less objective thinking, 1NTUITIONISM derived from emotional reactions and, finally, the dictatorial approach based on personal belief. Pure science as well as pure religion uses all four principles in the trial to achieve the ultimate goal. The difference is only in the stress put on these ways of approach. As far as pure science is concerned, rationalism is stressed in favor of the other principles, although the remaining three are also present. Of course, the scientific approach starts with empiricism. 2 [pageend4]What makes a man a scientist is his intuitional reaction to empiricism, this reaction serving only as a medium to reach a rationalistic approach. Strange as it might seem, pure science also uses a dictatorial approach. Let me give you at least one example. Geometry is based on Euclid’s axioms. These arc simple statements about geometrical objects and offer a nice example of pure abstraction derived from empiricism.. This set of axioms was presented without proof by Euclid as describing elementary properties of our space. It took two thousand years before this dictatorial approach to the problem of the structure of our space was definitely “reproofed” and before it was shown that this set of axioms is an act of our volition and does not necessarily represent the properties of the space we are living in. Because pure science uses intuition only as an intermediate step to a rational approach, it seems to me that the causal explanation (i.e., the answer to the question "why”) is outside the realm of pure science. To illustrate this statement, let us analyze the famous case of the falling apple observed by Newton. Using first the empiric experience of observation, Newton applied his intuition to find an adequate analytic description of this phenomenon and finally based his final result on rationalism. Thus, Newton’s "law of gravitation” was born. The essence of this law is the mathematical description of observed phenomena, i.e., the answer to the question "how” without any attempt to explain the gravitation itself, i.e., without any ATTEMPT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION "why”. Gravitation itself remained a mystery to Newton. In some ways, he was more fortunate than we are after Einstein’s discovery of the Equivalence Principle. The theory of relativity describes adequately more phenomena than Newton’s theory, ,4s a result of this theory, the true meaning of gravitation as a geometrical property of 3 [pageend5]time-space becomes more mysterious than it was in Newton’s time of absolute time and absolute space. Pure religion also applies all four principles in seeking truth. However, here—in contradistinction to pure science—the stress is laid chiefly on intuition. To be sure, rationalism is also used after the facts ARE established by intuition. Thus, for instance, St. Augustine discussed various ways in which the work of Six Days might be understood and St. Thomas Aquinas distinguished between the initial creation of matter and the establishment of natural laws that have continued to effect changes in the physical world. To justify the use of intuition as a chief tool of religion, let us go back to the concept of truth as independent of time-space and Man and by no means anthropomorphic. Truth conceived in this way is a bare necessity imposed on mankind\ by its environment. In fact, our solar system is but a tiny spot on the rim of an outer arm of our galaxy. It is one of millions of other similar tiny spots which constitute the galactic disk 80,000 light years in diameter. On the other hand, our galaxy is but a tiny spot among billions of similar galaxies in the universe. The period of complete revolution of our starry island is 200 million years. Hence, it is quite appropriate for us, inhabitants of this island, to measure the time by the rotation of our galaxy. The first mammals appeared on Earth just some three galactic months ago and the human race was born yesterday. It is a newborn baby, almost blind but performing considerably well its first intellectual steps. A strange thing happens whenever this newborn baby tries and succeeds to acquire new knowledge of its environment. EVERY SOLVED PROBLEM OPENS NEW WAYS TO MORE MYSTERIES. Instead of reducing the empire of unknown and unattainable, pure science, by solving problems, automatically enlarges the realm of the unknown. Once i [pageend6]this is fully recognized, it becomes imperative to use another way of attacking the problem of truth. We have no great choice among the four principles if we reject dictatorial approach as futile and demote empiricism to a necessary but not sufficient condition for further investigation. From the two remaining principles science preferred rationalism so that the only remaining way is to prefer intuitionism, i.e., to ask for help from pure religion. (On the other hand, even pure religion bears some anthropomorphic marks and, therefore, it uses also the dictatorial approach.) It is interesting to observe the interrelation between pure science and pure religion. The above mentioned way which leads from science to religion is subconsciously followed by many scientists. This is probably the reason why so many of them turn for their comfort to art or philosopy. Both these creative processes are based chiefly on intuition and, therefore, constitute a branch of pure religion. On the other hand, the trespassing of pure religion into the realm of pure science is not always very successful. Let me remind you of the Irish Archbishop Usher who proved in 1650 that the Creation took place on Sunday, October 23, 4004 B.C. Let me now approach a problem which was, some fifty years ago a cornerstone of lively discussions. I mean the conflict between science and religion. To understand its origin and its futility we have to go back to the more primitive stage of the human spirit. As human society began to organize itself, applied religion dominated the life of each individual and played the role of pure religion as well as of pure science. There was no distinction between the systematic description and causal explanation of truth. The intellectual activity, if any, was based on intuition, emotional reaction and dictatorial approach while objective thinking was still to come. In this primitive stage there was no conflict betwee religion and 5 [pageend7]science because these two branches of the intellectual activity were comprised in a kind of primitive religion. The conflict, however, was bound to come with the impact of pure reasoning, with the development of scientific methods. In my opinion the conflict was due only to the misconception about the common objective of science and religion and its immediate cause was only a subconscious semantic difficulty. In fact, the noble objective of religion and science is to find truth, independent of time and space. The truth of the microcosm as well as of the macrocosm unaffected by the more or less haphazard existence of mankind. This task, imposed on a newborn baby of humanity, was and still is far above the capability of the human brain. We are, at most, capable to see some small facets of truth, some parts of a jigsaw puzzle which we cannot as yet combine into a satisfactory picture. One reason, by far not the least important, lies in a semantic difficulty, i.e., in the lack of adequate language. This difficulty is inherent to our noble aim. We are trying to find the truth beyond man and its meaning without man, the truth which is not anthropomorphic, but our means of communication and description are only human. Therefore, this description is a priori not a sufficient means and could be only fragmentary, bearing the mark of the human way which lead to it. So it is to be expected that the one and the same phenomenon could be described in two different manners which seemingly contradict each other. This is not necessarily the sign that one or both statements are wrong. It could indicate also one of the following possibilities : 1) One or both statements are tautological in the sense that they describe a phenomenon not attainable by human brain by means of concepts which are again incomprehensible to man. The simplest example is the definition of “Creation” which in Judeo-Christian religion 6 [pageend8]explains the statement that God created the Universe: “To create means to make Something out of Nothing.’’ Bergson and St. Augustine reacted in their own way to this definition. When St. Augustine was asked what God did before he created the world, he answered, “He created the Hell for those who are asking this question.” Bergson proved that the concept of Nothingness is impossible to understand in its full meaning. This simple example illustrates clearly the tragic fate of the human spirit when trying to conceive and express phenomena which are beyond the capacity of our brain. The result is either a vicious circle of tautology or a result we can describe only by symbols, the true meaning of which forever escapes us. This is, for instance the case of the theory of relativity which describes systematically the physical universe in terms of four-dimensional curved space-time. We master completely the formalistic part (i.e., the mathematics) of this theory so that we are even able to make predictions of physical phenomena, but the true meaning of the curved four-dimensional space- time, i.e., THE TRUE MEANING OF THE MATHEMATICAL DESCRIPTION REMAINS IN THE PRESENT, AS WELL AS IN THE FUTURE, AN UNSOLVABLE MYSTERY. By the Way, this example is illuminating also from another point of view. It shows that the human brain is able to reach BEYOND ITS REALM, BUT THE TRUE MEANING OF THIS RESULT IS INACCESSIBLE TO MAN. I.et us now consider the second possibility of two conflicting statements. 2) Both statements are right in their own way, i.e., they are, if completed by suitable explanation. Thus, for instance, there was an argument between science and religion whether the universe is geocentric or not. It was seemingly resolved with religion retreating in this case. On the other hand, the impact of the theory of relativity on human thinking and, in particular, the impossibility 1 [pageend9]of preferring one inertial frame of reference of the space- time to other such frames resolved, this argument in an unexpected way. According to the theory of relativity, the motion, of a particle could be described only with respect to another particle. Therefore, it is quite possible to conceive the universe as geocentric defining all motions with respect to the Earth. However, it is much simpler from the mathematical point of view to describe the universe as centerless. Both descriptions could be adopted with equal right as a working hypothesis although from the anthropomorphic point of view the centerless universe offers less difficulties to be dealt with in terms of mathematical description. Another, still more striking example of an apparent conflict between religion and science is the statement in the Bible that God created Light on the first day and the Sun on the fourth day. At a first glance, this seems to be a completely wrong and illogical description. But with the further development of science we have to be more modest. First came Einstein in 1905 with the hypothesis of equivalence of matter and energy (the tragic validation of this hypothesis came 40 years later in Hiroshima). Then Abbé Le Maître and Gamow proposed a new theory explaining the expanding universe. According to this theory, the universe was in a state of contraction which lasted until all matter (in the form of elementary particles) and energy were squeezed together in a kind of primordial super-atom. In this state energy prevailed to matter and manifested itself by radiation and, in particular, also by light. Following the moment of supreme contraction this cosmic mass blew up, the energy began to be transformed into matter and nuclear forces took over and material for future galaxies and individual stars was shaped. Thus, according to this theory, light was pre-existent to the sun as it is stated in a more poetical form in the Bible. 8 [pageend10]Let us analyze this example in greater detail. The scientific answer is based on the interpolation of certain equations; it is A pure description of mathematical symbols in the usual language. Rather than solve the problem of Creation, it opens a new way to further puzzling questions; it shifts the ultimate solution farther away from us. If we accept this theory, we have to accept the concepts of infinity and of the origin of time (for our universe) which are unattainable by human brain. On the other side, the religious answer explains the mystery of Creation that God created the universe. This is a definite answer opening no way to other problems. On the other hand, it is by no means more comprehensible than the assumptions which underlay the scientific description. Both answers operate with concepts which are inaccessible to the human brain. Both validate the tragic suspicion that to understand the ultimate truth is beyond the possibilities of mankind. Both serve their purposes. The religious answer indicates in a straightforward way that the understanding of the ultimate explanation remains a mystery; the scientific description is more challenging because it offers more adventures in learning the hard way the lesson of religion. There are many other instances, in particular in modern cosmogony, where science impinges on the realm of religion and their stories seem to converge more than ever. There are many other illustrations which all show that there is not and cannot be a conflict between Religion and Science. Seemingly contradictory statements arc due to some purely semantic difficulties. These difficulties arise from the necessarily anthropomorphic approach to problems which are as yet beyond human understanding. These semantic inadequacies manifest themselves very often in a disguised form. Thus, for instance, a scientific result is always based on some 9 [pageend11]axioms which are not always clearly staled and almost always imperceptible to a non-scientist who learns the result without taking into account the limitations of the underlying axioms. On the other hand, religion is based also on axioms which under the form and name of religious dogmas are more accessible to a layman than the deeply rooted scientific axioms and, therefore, more exposed to superficial attacks. We have to keep in mind that scientific axioms play exactly the same role as religious dogmas in descriptions and explanations of the mysteries of the universe. They are both backbones of a working hypothesis which tries to answer the questions "how” and "why”. Let me use this occasion to stress again that on a galactic time scale mankind was born yesterday. Therefore, we cannot expect that the axioms-dogmas underlying our intellectual search for God are already complete, perfect and not subject to gradual improvements proportional to tha, intellectual heights reached by the human spirit in its most noble task. In fact, everybody who knows at least something about the history of the development of human intellectual activity is aware of the fact that scientific axioms and religious dogmas changed considerably during the last few galactic seconds of the cultural life of an organized human society. Therefore, it is quite conceivable that the progress of human understanding will bring new forms of these axioms and dogmas. Of course, the scientific axioms are subject to quicker change. This lies in the nature of scientific inquiry based prevalently on rationalism which in its turn is based on scepticism. If the day should come when scientific axioms will be fixed once for all times to come, this moment will mark the irrevocable end of science and show us the way back to the trees. On the other hand, religion based prevalently on intuition and belief cannot change so quickly its dogmas because 10 [pageend12]they arc not subject to rational approach. Therefore, any change in the dogmas or any introduction of new dogmas is dangerous to religion. Should once religion perish as a result of too quick a change in its fundamental dogmas, the human race as such would cease to exist and would be transformed into a totally utilitarian clan of slaves similar to the organized society of ants. Unfortunately, we witness such a trend in one part of our planet. It is impossible to speak about religion and not mention morality. As I see it, we have not only pure and applied science, pure and applied religion, but also pure and applied morality. Let us deal first with applied morality. It is the most difficult subject to deal with. In fact, I do not know whether it is a purely anthropomorphic by-product of human society or whether there are some signs that even this applied morality is a reflection of universal laws. By applied morality I understand the laws which govern the behavior of every human individual in human society. I do not mean only laws decreed by governments. I have chiefly in mind the by-products of applied religion, which in turn reflect the impact of organized society on the human spirit. This implies that applied morality depends on time as well as on the organization of the human society. In other words, its content changes with time and with sociological conditions. This part of it is certainly a human product reflecting the interrelation of the human society and applied religion. Thus, we may expect to see a whole- scale of different applied moralities based on applied religions. At the most primitive stage, we have cannibalism performed for religious reasons, while the noblest form of applied morality is derived from Judeo- Christianity and Buddhism. 11 [pageend13]The more primitive forms of applied morality are easily explained as by-products of a carnivorous society endowed with more or less primitive intellect. The real difficulty starts with the evaluation of applied morality in its highest form. It is true that some of the noblest feelings like the mother's love of her children could be reduced to a chemical reaction of certain hormones. On the other hand, the law of loving your neighbor is in direct contradiction to the carnivorous nature of man. There are two possible explanations of this law. Either it is really a reflection of some universal law or it is a pure intellectual reaction to the fact that man, among all other living beings, is the most skilful in masterminding genocide. As we are faced in present time with this danger we see that even the least scrupulous dictators sing to this tune. If this explanation is incorrect, then the law of loving your neighbor has an origin which escapes the understanding of carnivorous man. In fact, if we accept that we explain the fact that apart from felines probably only man kills not just for survival but out of pure pleasure. Here I am really lost and, therefore, I use the benefit of doubt accepting with Kant the mystery of inborn moral laws. Pure morality is the third step on the ladder whose first and second steps are pure science and pure religion. Its rules are the most difficult to grasp because they presuppose the understanding acquired gradually by science and religion. Pure morality is the ultimate answer to the question of the meaning of the whole universe or, in other words, of the meaning of all manifestations of God. We have to be aware of the fad that, pure morality or the discovery of the universal laws could be attained only as a result of scientific and religious activities. Moreover, we have to be aware of the fact that, science as well as religion unveiled, only some discreet parts of the truth, parts described in more or 12 [pageend14]less anthropomorphic way. As a result of this rather small progress we have to be patient in the endeavor to discover the laws of pure morality. It is almost certain that is is not anthropomorphic, but it is not certain whether the human race will live long enough to be able to see it in its non-anthropomorphic form. As of yet, we have to be very modest in asking questions as deep as the meaning of the human race, let alone the meaning of the universe. We are simply not advanced enough to answer these questions. Any attempt to answer them must end either in tautology or in meaningless assertions. I cannot prove these statements; I have to confess that I derived them from scientific experience only. In the scientific field one of the most important factors is to ask the right question. It may happen that some questions are too premature and lead rather to confusion than to clarification. This seems to be also the case in the field of pure morality the understanding of which seems to me to be the highest, noblest and most important achievement of the human spirit. Let me end by describing the relationship of mankind and the universe. On the galactic time scale the human race was delivered just yesterday by a mother of twenty-five galactic years. Thanks to the miracle of the propagation of light, we see far back into the past. When an astronomer looks outward in space he looks backward in time. The light by which we discern the most distant galaxies came to us after a journey of two billions of terrestrial years. Their light which we see today started its immense journey when life on Earth was barely starting in the primordial seas. On the other hand, looking into the depth of the sky we see also what will probably be our fate in the distant future. When the supply of hydrogen will be exhausted by the sun, it will blow out, boiling away all possibilities of life on its planets. Then the sun will start to 13 [pageend15]die as a white dwarf encircled by cold and lifeless satellites. Mankind in its present form will probably not witness this astronomical cataclysm. It will be either extinct or physiologically changed. Hence, mankind has a limited period of life in this solar system. Wc cannot predict how far it will go in the exploration of the mysteries of microcosm and macrocosm. We do not know if mankind ever will approach the ultimate truth of the meaning of the universe. But, even so, we are witnessing a miracle. Among all living beings on our Earth only man was endowed with the urge to commit the original sin and to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Only man was endowed with the urge to explore the unknown, to reach beyond the limits of his brain. And he finally becomes aware of the fact that pure science, pure religion and pure morality are three different aspects of this mysterious urge, reflections of God’s trinity. The further he reaches, the more the ultimate answer is receding from him and all that is left to him is humble faith. V. HLAVATY 14 [pageend16]FORUM ROBERT NEUMANN MARCUS, OR EXILE A male human being, a Jew by the name Marcus, was born in the year 1894, and two months before his time. Which is worth mentioning firstly because it caused the birth to take place, not ini the mother’s home at Frankfort but in the hospital of a little Bavarian town which she reached in the nick of time (Starnberg, south of Munich on the Starnberger See). Secondly, because a certain slightness of limb, almost a transparency of body in the otherwise tall and well-grown Marcus (his first name was Werner) was ascribed by him, rightly or wrongly, to this cause all his life long. Thirdly, because the mother (a von Goldschmidt-Mendelssohn by birth) fell sick and died owing to this premature birth. The father Marcus (Metal Processes, Frankfort) followed her eight years later. The orphan’s education was undertaken by a maternal aunt who lived in Munich united in matrimony to a Herr Eichhacker, a bank official and a retired Bavarian lieutenant. This same uncle by marriage took over the management of Marcus, Metal Processes, Ltd. This he did just successfully enough for himself, just unsuccessfully enough for the orphan boy, and just sufficiently restrained in his actions by the remnants of his Bavarian officer’s sense of honesty to leave Werner Marcus upwards of two hundred thousand Reichsmarks to his credit when he left school at eighteen. He also came into a decently fat packet of Eichhacker- Marcus shares held in trust and the possession of the so-called Schloss, a turreted, overgrown villa at Am15 [pageend17]bach, on the Starnberger See, that no one really wanted. It was the vety same villa from which eighteen years before his mother had set out on her fatal journey which was to end in those premature birthpangs. In a later period of his life, when he had become pensive and brooded unprofitably over airy fancies, such as predestination and the goal of existence, Werner Marcus was tempted to trace a certain susceptibility to fate, a catastrophic affinity forward from this early event. A catastrophe-magnet that he carried in his heart : that was how he once expressed it in writing. Marcus’s vital needs were secured, independently of his inheritance, by the fact that he was a poet. Early success in a literary competition and a privately printed volume of first poems was followed by an epic in verse which first attracted wide attention to this very young man before something else attracted even greater attention to itself. It was August 1914. At that time Werner Marcus still believed what was written in the newspapers. It said in the papers that perfidious Albion and the sly Latins grudged his, Marcus’s Fatherland, its place in the sun, and had lain in ambush for it. Not only did Marcus volunteer for active service before his time, but he also wrote that ode To the Enemy, which, as is well known, was soon spread over the whole globe. It ran the gamut of trenches, dance-bars, gramophone records, it was printed on picture post-cards, worked on cushions, painted on stained-glass church windows in black letters. He was stunned by its echo and astonished at the fame it brought him for four long years. It cost him much bitterness and disillusionment, much wrestling with himself, and much service to peace, poetry, and the spirit to overcome this fame. Still, he won through, though not until 1928, ten years after the armistice, or, more exactly, with the publication of his trilogy of novels, the well-known Disinherited. At that 16 [pageend18]time he kept house in Munich, a big house frequented by many visitors from the city, the Reich, and abroad, who came to see a slim man with smooth black hair and a strong, serious forehead above beautiful, feminine, long-lashed eyes, a bold but delicate nose, and a weak, restless, yet noble mouth. There had been in his past women of good family, including a wife. After her accidental death (accidental death again !) he lived two years alone in his turreted Schloss. Then he bought jewellery, dresses, a little soprano voice, and a stage name, Loo de Majo, for a certain Leopoldine Mittelgruber, a severe blonde like his dead wife (she was the daughter of a book-keeper at Eichhacker-Marcus’s). In 1933 she was his mistress. Concerning certain events which occurred in that year in Werner Marcus’s Fatherland, it is to be observed that the author was then practising a virtue, or else a vice, which he had once described (in his study of the Anarchist Postulate of the Spirit) as benevolent objectivity. It was this objectivity which enabled him to see in current events, not the device of bankrupt Junkers, not the jingling parade of armoured filth, but the revolt of youth in favour of a greater and freer Germany. (That was what we all wanted, objectively speaking !) This benevolence again led him to see in the Reichstag fire, not the impudent farce of petty bourgeois brains in search of an alibi, but a Communist plot. (A man had been arrested without a rag on his back but carrying a Bolshevik party-card in his pocket !) When those of his circle disappeared overnight, it was the same objectivity that prevented him from inquiring too closely whether they were over the frontier or in a concentration camp. (If they were over the frontier they were panic-stricken fools, and if they were elsewhere and had taken some harm on the way, one had to concur objectively that----- ) 17 [pageend19]But W. Marcus was not of this opinion out of littleness of heart, but out of magnanimity. When a member of the Government—the propaganda expert—attacked him publicly and scabrously, he sent the paper in which he read the report a courageous and stylistically impeccable protest (which w'as not printed). When he met a rabble of university students demonstrating against the windows of Jewish shops (and many of them must have known him, even if only because of his public oration ‘On the Birth of the German Republic’), he did not give them the wall, but went his way, letting them step aside before him. He was so confirmed in his obstinacy throughout (since, by accident or design, he was ignored), so tempted to ignore the danse macabre around him, that he declined the warnings of his friends firmly and politely both by word and letter. He did not leave in the days of inspired Jew-baiting, when the hue and cry and cudgelling and plundering swept past the rich quarter where he lived, leaving it unscathed. He left not under external stress at all, nor on political grounds, but on aesthetic ones as it were. It rvas on 10th May, 1933. The events of this day demand rather exact reporting. At six p.m. the poet telephoned his blonde, asking her not to come at eight, but at nine. He had an errand, a somewhat curious errand, to do first. (At this point a low, nervous laugh could be heard over the telephone.) It seemed there was a burning of books arranged in the courtyard of the university, yes, a public bonfire, quite in the medieval style. He had been informed that he himself (more nervous laughter)—even his, Werner Marcus’s literary works would attract flattering attention on this occasion. It would interest him, Werner Marcus, to watch it in person at close range, just for the sake of amusement, from the angle of pathological psychology. In short, the de Majo would quite understand : he, 18 [pageend20]Werner Marcus, had his place at this public bonfire. Therefore—here he laughed again—it would be better not to dine until nine. But it was ten, or maybe even a few minutes after that, when he came home. The de Majo was lying sulking in an easy-chair, browsing over books, wanting him to beg her pardon. When he came in, his hat still on his head, without bidding her good evening, and she saw his face, she got up without a word. He was in no way disarrayed. On the contrary : if that signified anything, he was even more correctly dressed than usual, his hat was on straight, his tie straight, his gloves spotless, not a speck of dust on his coat. Only he was rather pale, indeed very pale when one looked closer, with a corpselike pallor that was terrifying at first sight. He rang for his valet. ‘Pack the bags,’ he said in a flat voice. Then at last he turned to the blonde. ‘It’s the devil,’ he said quietly. He cried aloud, ‘It’s the devil !’ Ah, yes, excitements. Readers of Werner Marcus’ novel, The Disinherited, will perhaps remember the episode dealing with the experiences of a panel-doctor at a death-bed. How he has to tell a man that his hour is come. But after the first terrified shock this is still far from being a spiritual reality to the patient; he knows it, and immediately he has forgotten its meaning. You are sitting at lunch, a visitor comes, you laugh at a joke, and perhaps not until dark does the knowledge creep up on you again, and frighten you out of your sleep. And when you lie on the last bed of all, and your heart flutters, and there is a pain in your guts and your forehead stands all in a sweat—and still you think : no, this is not real, it’s always other people that die,, perhaps it’s someone else this time, too, not you, not you. Or you realise something, such as, ‘It’s the devil !’ for example. But half an hour later you are sitting down to dinner and half an hour after that you are in bed with a blonde, 19 [pageend21]and if anyone in the whole world were to mention the devil to you, you wouldn’t know what he was talking about. The blonde will stay behind in Germany, and take over the running of the town and country houses. Of course they will meet again when this nervous excitement is over. The valet drives the seven well-packed bags to the station. The blonde has a cousin in the S.A. who is willing to bring any sum you like to mention over the frontier, just for the sake of old times and fifteen per cent. But you need not take too much out at once. He clicks his field-boots together and is at your service, Herr Doktor, at all times. The secretary comes over from the Police Presidency, too, bringing the new passport that has been unhesitantly made out despite the croakers. There it lies, simple but decorative, with many durable virgin pages, an exercise-book blown about by the fat- winds of wandering, smelling of mountains and plains and sea—and it was all certain to last for ever. Up then, Werner Marcus, with, your passport and your money and your seven bags. You are not badly equipped for the battle of life, take it all in all. Emigré life, emigratio communis primaria, is distinguished from other chronic diseases, firstly by the fact that the patient does not become aware of his infection until the end of the incubation period, which varies with individuals. Secondly, it is marked by spasmodic periods of a deceptive sensation of well-being, clinically known as euphoria. These latter, thirdly, alternate with a condition of acute despair, typical of this disease, called desperatio emigratica. This condition is highly contagious, and the patient will either (type A) seek solitude, or (type B) avoid solitude and run amuck in search of those similarly afflicted. Fourthly, the species of corrosive disease under consideration inevitably ends in death. 20 [pageend22]The patient, Werner Marcus, spent the period of incubation in a quiet but expensive hotel in Paris. An abnormally long time elapsed in this case before the disease broke out, because of (a) the patient’s characteristic stubbornness in retention of a given fact or illusion, and (b) plentiful supplies of strong antitoxin, in the form of hard cash. At that time other cases of emigratio communis (popularly called émigrés) were already writhing in the contortions of the more advanced stages of the disease, and howling like wolves or dying men on a battlefield. But the patient Werner Marcus did not take part in this howling. He signed no manifestoes or protests, indeed, he deliberately and systematically dissociated himself from all manifestants and protestants. He told an interviewer that he was naturally filled with flaming indignation against certain happenings on the other side of the frontier, but on the other hand he was opposed, now as always, to any form of distorting propaganda. A few extremists ought not to be confused with the German people, fidelity to which latter was and remained for him, a German writer who happened to be of the Jewish faith, a condition of his dignity. Yes, he used the word for the first time—dignity. The preservation of dignity, that was the greatest necessity of the hour. Protests could be safely entrusted to more potent forces than embittered individuals in exile. They should be entrusted to the League of Nations, to the Western Democracies. Here—the writer picked up a newspaper—read this report of a debate in the House of Commons. England would make the cause of the exiled her own : there it was in black and white. At this point the interviewer (he was an Englishman) rather hastily changed the subject to the writer’s new novel. Marcus confessed that he was still working on his great Odysseus novel. He was fleeing passionately, the writer said, from the present into a past which he could cut and 21 [pageend23]chisel to his fancy. Now he pronounced the sentence, prophetic and rather wistful, and a little coquettish and epigrammatic, that provided the headline for the whole interview. lúke the cameo-cutter of Herculaneum, who while the earth cracked and the lava bubbled and it rained ashes, calmly went on carving at his tin_v plaque, though he knew that in a little while both he and his jewel would sink down into nothingness, so he, Marcus, would keep on chiselling. He would file away at his gem for another two years as the lava had spared him. He finished, dissolving his seriousness in a smile. The newspaperman asked, ‘Where will the book be published?’ The poet, who had got up to' take his leave, looked at him in slight astonishment. ‘In two years!’ he said. ‘In Germany, of course.’ After this description of symptoms there remain a few words to be said about the antitoxin M, money. (It can also be advantageously used in other ailments, particularly as a heart stimulant in the later stages, when the smallest doses are sufficient.) This antitoxin has a metaphysical virulence in its effect with inner laws of its own. Therefore the uncle by marriage could not be really blamed for successfully overcoming the remnants of his Bavarian officer’s sense of honour. In accordance with the absolutist programme of the new era, he laid his hands on a certain packet of shares in settlement of a dashingly built-up claim (compensation for education expenses). The curt letter was subscribed: Heil Hitler. It was only natural that this should encourage the bookkeeper’s artistic daughter. Once she had successfully overcome certain scruples, she managed to tempt Werner Marcus, still blinded by antitoxin, into crossing the frontier, guaranteed by her cousin to be without danger. (She was to hand over certain financial papers to Werner Marcus, and also, so she wrote in her clear, hard hand, she was yearning for Marcus’s arms.) The interview took 22 [pageend24]place. Nothing more was said about the financial papers. Ç)n the contrary, there was a document already drawn ijip and headed, ‘Unconditional Power of Attorney’ in favour of Leopoldine Mittelgruber, alias Loo de Majo, member of the Deutsche Frauenschaft. Its items specified all sorts of things, a house in Munich, for instance, and also a furreted Schloss by a lake. It happened early in the morning in the clean bedroom of a village inn. No, said Werner Marcus; yes, said Loo de Majo. Suddenly lier cousin appeared in uniform, looking not so much a cousin as a fiance. Such words as settlement and dowry were heard. No, said W. Marcus. Whereupon the word Rassenschande began to be tossed here and there in conversation. A short two hours later the patient, W. Marcus, walked back over the frontier, past a guard who seemed to be purposely burying himself in a newspaper. Neatly dressed from head to foot, though rather pale, rather the colour of sheets or corpses on close examination, he went his way with bloodless, closed lips, calm and quiet, without using metaphors from apocalyptic mythology. Apart from his bags left in Paris and a modest though comfortable sum, he possessed his passport, still only lightly thumbed, with many of its bright pages intact. He could travel north, east, south, west, wherever he wanted. This ecstasy of freedom, fancy - freedom, unburdened, is a typical symptom of the condition. The incubation period is over, the disease has been brought to its normal active state. The patient had hitherto thought of himself as arf émigré. But his real exile began now, with this feathery feeling of lightness. Werner Marcus chose the British democracy and the city of London. He was influenced in this choice by the fact that he was already a famous figure in England. Five of his books had been published there in translation. Besides, this was the very country that proposed to make the cause of the homeless exiles her own. ikfter his 23 [pageend25]launching into infinite space and his infection with its consumption, England was to provide him with shelter and leisure to work; not an asylum, but something more, a residence. The distinguished émigré, Werner Marcus, chose England. There is a document of his extant belonging to this period. A short newspaper article, called 'Eondon Notes’, printed by a German paper in Paris, in which Marcus, using a chatty style strangely foreign to him, reports some of his experiences in England. A certain festive excitement flashes through his phrases. Ah, what a country ! You go to the authorities. Here I am, you say, your Brother Exile come to live with you to your joy. Welcome, say the authorities, we will write to you; you will have to wait a little while, just a little while. So you are the author ? We know your work, we esteem it, we read it. Please spell your name. Or you ring up your publisher and his secretary answers. ‘Re what are you ringing us, Mr. Marcus? The chairman is going fishing to Scotland to-morrow, until Thursday week. Then he will be at his house for the weekend, and the week after that he has several engagements already. But I should advise you to ring up the week after, perhaps I shall be able to tell you when he can see you. Do you write under your own name? Marcus? Please spell your name. Of course, we will arrange for an interview, you must wait a little while, just a little while,’ That is the great secret of living here. After years of haste and hurry, of futile turning to find out this and that, life in exile entrances you with this, the wisest and most confidential of its hospitable gifts. Doubtless one had grown too important, too' lordly. Just wait a little while, spell your name, and meanwhile—here came the rather odd ending to Marcus’s good-natured, enthusiastic prattle—three cheers for life in the shadows ! The manuscript had said something about a whole 24 [pageend26]sea, a whole high mountain of shadows being there to choose from. But the editor, autocratic as editors are, had deleted the passage, because it seemed to him confused and darkling, suggesting, contrary to the author’s meaning, an almost defeatist undertone. In Marcus’s diary—he still kept a diary in those days —there is a note under the same date. ‘Article for Paris. Also plan for further article, to be called: “Keep Smiling”. To-day, Monday, beginning of eleventh week since they promised» me a residence permit; eighth since stopped work on Odysseus novel, owing to recognition of fact (seventh week) that sinking self in history and mythology unworthy of man. Witnesses of these times are needed. When the younger Pliny was at the destruction of Pompeii, he did not write poems, but the destruction of Pompeii. Hence fifth week since writing essay, Facts about These Times, in English, and fourth week without news of its publication. Third week without answer from film people about work on scenario dialogue. Second week since beginning of wait- ing-for-post complex (meeting postman at corner of street). First week since beginning of boarding-house- bill complex; current week of resolution which I hereby make, “Never to wait for Anything any more. Never no more”.’ The writing breaks off here. Below it the hand becomes legible again, and reads: ‘Plans for an Examination of Apocalyptic Qualities in Space’. Feeble, lukewarm, a bad title. A single, furtive year flitted by between intention and achievement. When it was at last written it turned out not to be chance reflections on the consumption of infinity, beginning with the earth, north, south, east, west, or at least Democracy, or England, or the city of London. Werner Marcus the émigré had seen further than that. He had long since got past the stage of regarding London as his limit of 25 [pageend27]space. »Space, he observed, betraying the philosophic standard of his earlier researches, and becoming somewhat mentally threadbare, space was a function of money ! Space was something living that beat like a living heart, expanding and contracting with rise and fall of money-pressure. If you live in Paddington, it depends on your mental attitude towards the magic figure sixpence as expressed in a sixpenny ’bus fare, whether Putney Bridge or Hampstead Heath still lie within the bounds of space or beyond the threshold of its consumption, in the irrevocable limbo, the black abyss, and is non-existent in the empirical sense. Marcus noted that he sang no more of the river and the little copse on the knoll. In the land of shadow-dwellers the consumption of space had, narrowed it down to his own room, no more. He had a mind to sing the Apocalypse of the bed-sitting-room. But Marcus had not even properly worked out this Apocalypse of the bed-sitting-room. He got no further than sketches and notes. O space, it read : O four- windowed room in Paris of old, with the view of tree- tops, O bathroom, O desk, O telephone! O second room in that London boarding-house, it went on, the first of a long and gloomy series of boarding-houses that changed as people’s faces changed and yet remained diabolically equal. You can’t look the room in the face any longer. You hate the mirror, the string of coloured-glass beads on the reading-lamp, the creaking door and the mouldy smell of, the cupboard. (Distance itself is mouldering, uncounted, unknown far journeys are mouldering in the cupboard !) Has anyone yet written the Great Martyrdom of Wall-paper? No matter. It is as sure as death that the next room will be more diabolical still; the wallpaper duller and yet more glaring, the mirror blind, plugs blocked, the souls of past tenants lurking in all the corners, two people squabbling next door and someone 26 [pageend28]playing the piano. O man, you have wasted your space on this earth ! The vice of space-squandering, that was it. Now just shut your eyes, Herr Marcus. Where did the mirror stand askew in the corner ? Quite right : in boarding-house number three. Whereabouts in boardinghouse number twenty-two was the chest of drawers with the infernally alien family group—right, left, front, back ? (Remember, the second drawer from the bottom could not be opened, and when it did open, there was the corpse of a fountain-pen rattling inside.) Wrong. The chest of drawers was not behind on the left. (That was boarding-house number sixteen !) In front on the left. Behind on the left was the damp spot with the picture of Queen Victoria that was supposed to cover it, and next to it was the tap that dripped all night long. Having established this, Marcus got up from his settee, a rather rickety settee, it is true, but quite a comfortable one if you lay quite straight on it. He went to the mirror and straightened his tie : his shirt was all right, his hat irreproachable. He opened his fourth suitcase, which was half empty, and took from it a silk-lined summer coat which he did not need just then, to take it to the paw- shop. For after all, Werner Marcus was still alive, and this room, hateful though it was, still his room. Was it just ten to three? What was one to think of a man who was resolved never to wait for anything any more, who went very slowly downstairs, the coat to be pawned over his arm, his face rather pale but his clothes respectable? If he dawdled at the same pace along the pavements to the corner, he had a fair chance of meeting the postman. There were compensations. The more consumptive space grew, the more splendid became the patient’s wealth of time. If he looked into his trunk, there was time in the bottom. If he pulled out the drawer of his desk—more time. If he put his hand in his pockets 27 [pageend29]thej’ were stuffed with it : he could strew clinking coins of time about him like a nabob. He locked himself in, but it poured into his room through keyhole and crack, so that he could not defend himself against its extravagant abundance. Besides, the Great Despair only attacks those who have seven suitcases to lose in this life. When Werner Marcus had only one, he was no longer encumbered. He also had the coat he was carrying and the heavy, expensive fur coat which the moths had got at so that it could not be pawned anywhere. Also a bundle of manuscripts and a number of books that no one would take, and he had his passport. There were compensations. He managed to write the short story—he called it ‘the short story’ to distinguish it from many other short stories whose fate was less glorious. The Star paid ten guineas down for it. This, his ‘Song of the Bedsitting-room’, was printed in the periodical at Prague. Even if it only brought in enough for two suppers, there was still the glory of it. Also about that time he met an acquaintance from Italy, a merchant who had once been his guest at Munich. It only cost him a moment’s heartbeat and then it was not too difficult to bring out a long sentence ending with the casually-dropped words : ‘. . . . five pounds, just for a day or two’. Let others carry the burden of that illusion, that mental changeling called dignity : freaks, recluses with seven trunks, nonsigners of manifestoes, cutters of gems and fine gentlemen. If he had opened a gulf between himself and those who were left howling on the barbed wire of the battlefield, that gulf was closed when he waited in the queue before the entrance of the Jewish soup-kitchen at Woburn House. Some ex-rebel recognised the ex-æsthete there. His first silent glance said, ‘Is that you?’ His second said, ‘Are you a Jew, too?’ The third said, ‘Are you still alive, too?’ Then the two one-trunk men smiled at each other. They offered each other their hands, as if in 28 [pageend30]Reinhardt’s foyer during the entr’acte of a first night, and said, ‘Ah, Herr Kollege! Guten Tag!’ They muttered something about chancing to be in the neighbourhood and wanting to have a look at things. After five sentences they were led into the eating-room with its long, clean, hospitable, despairing tables. The little tidy-haired woman, with the bright eyes and brown hair, next to him, was very young or very slim or else suddenly wasted, once could not tell which. It was not easy to see in the half light. She was introduced to him with a cosmopolitan gesture, ‘Herr Kollege Marcus, do you know Frau Sonnenschein the architect?’ Just as he was getting his hospitable plate of hash and pudding and cabbage, a woman’s voice said, ‘But I know you, Herr Marcus ! You are one of my most vivid memories. The Ode to the Enemy ľ There had been a time when one would have blushed at the mention of that poem. But that time was past. Take it all in all, one was still alive, recognised, known by name ! What was he working on now? ‘On my Odysseus novel.’ And the architect? ‘Oh, you know the taste in building hereabouts. I can’t compete, I have gone back to painting. Or rather. . .’ Here she hesitated, but only for a moment, and then went on bravely, ‘As a matter of fact, I am going to concentrate on book illustration for the next few' months!’ She looked up, quickly, hastily summing up Herr Werner Marcus as a business connection. It did not work. So she said courageously : ‘Book illustration or stage designing. Did you sa\’ an Odysseus novel? How’ interesting. Cochran, the re vue-producer, you know, has just made me a proposition. The contract will soon be signed.’ Now it so happened that this phrase had become a form of greeting among those who were as light as air in that year of No Time. Whenever they met, instead of ‘Good morning’, they said, ‘Will it soon be signed?’ In the case of Frau Sonnenschein the architect in particular, 20 [pageend31]she had slightly simplified her autobiography to Herr Marcus as she sat next to him in the Jewish soup-kitchen. From the architectural jobs which she had, much to her regret, to refuse, her way had led as a matter of fact to picture commissions for the press. (She had that good little camera with her.) Not until that plan was unmasked as a dream and the camera had fallen a victim to the consumption of space, did she say : never mind, I will try drawing cartoons. After a short time of waiting, in which she had got just a little thinner and paler, she had said: never mind, I will give language lessons, French and German. Then she had said : never mind, I will try children’s nursing. The smallest number of such ‘never minds’ had passed her by and left her thinner, apparently younger in the half light. In fact, she had been busy lately, sewing- gloves in her room. She had sold five pairs in the month, for they were beautiful, brave gloves, designed by an artist. She could make German cakes, too, if anyone wanted German cakes. So she had rather sketched and foreshortened her autobiography. That plan for illustrating books was a brave inspiration of the moment, brought about by the fortunate discovery of a business connection at one’s side who had wandered into this kitchen of the poor out of social curiosity. As for the relations of Frau Sonnenschein, scene-designer, with that revue-producer, they were confined, when seen in the cold light of reason, to the hasty delivery of a recommendation in the passage and a conversation that took place two years ago, and only lasted less than sixty seconds. (Thanks, I’ll remember your address.) But what did it matter, who wanted all these details? The idea of making a revue out of the Odysseus novel, now faltering owing to a more mature change of viewpoint, was not so bad. It would be something new to have a revue by a poet, biting, lashing, if only, for the sake of 30 [pageend32]prudence, between the lines as it were. And to work on it with this very young, slim, beautiful woman, who had influence with revue-producers, and knew one’s reputation as a poet ! Gnädige Frau, may 1 invite you to an important business conference at Lyons’ to-night ? It should be noted among the symptoms of the disease emigratio communis that the already-mentioned feeling of false well-being, clinically known as euphoria, is gregarious, in contrast to the earlier stages. For instance, the patient invites someone to a business conference. While waiting for his partner he indulges in certain illusory stimulants. For instance, the émigré newspaper, a drug obtainable without prescription, and depending for its effect (a) on the mutually accepted fiction that one is still alive; and (b) on the toxic power of the word ‘to-morrow’. (The man in Germany has cancer of the larynx which will kill him to-morrow. The Germans are discontented with the price of butter, which lias gone up two pfennig, and this must lead to a revolution to-morrow. One knave in Germany is enraged against another, and he again against another, in consequence of which, tomorrow. . .) The patient and his partner are sitting tête-à-tête. The patient, euphorically stimulated by the drug, becomes bolder. Unmindful of time and money, he gracefully pays a bill that comes to nearly five shillings. What they call everyday cares are left behind. The toxic spell is strong enough to cause the purchase of a two-shilling bunch of tulips. Its impetus carries them through the noisy street to the lady partner’s furnished room. (Being the possessor of a coffee machine, she will brew some coffee. Also they are going to have a look at some sketches, since business has cropped up again, although somewhat softened by euphoria.) They are soon there, and plunge straight into their conference : they will entrust the revue to a sound 31 [pageend33]agent to-morrow—ten per cent., fifteen per cent., America. . . What a furnished room Frau Sonnenschein occupied in this boarding-house ! Even if there was a damp patch on the wall, such things are found in the best houses hereabouts, and in this case it was covered by a cheerful family group; and the cupboard, so full of mysterious exotic smells, offered plenty of room for a woman who was sensible enough not to go about burdened with much luggage. The glass-beaded lamp gave out a strong, comforting light, and luckily the price of current was included in the rent. Ah, what a room ! The steaming coffee makes them forget that the gas stove is out of order. This furnished room is only separated from the one next door, worlds apart, by a door unconvincingly disguised as a cupboard. Which means, at this late hour, that they must modify the tones of their discussion. This in turn means that they must sit confidentially close together for business purposes. They will submit their sketches in Paris; the patient will arrange their reproduction in an illustrated weekly, to-morrow; he will personally ring up the revue-producer, to-morrow; ah, look at this, brilliantly dashed off, a scene-sketch of the Isle of Circe ! Allow me to lean closer over you so that I can see it better, then I will get my hat and coat and go, and to-morrow—ah, what is this coming over us, suddenly overcoming us in the secrecy of this room, Gnädige Frau, Herr Doktor, what is this wave breaking over us? Yes, you have heard aright, the diagnosis tallies, we are confronted with an attack of that acutely increasing derangement of sense and senses on the knife-edge between illusory happiness and desperation called libido emigratica—the libido of feather-lightness—-and libido ordinaris : the former is characterised by its panic character. It is a special form of emigratic panic, im32 [pageend34]mediately explained by the physical law : nature abhors a vacuum. Torn and tossed by this horror, the patient behaves more libidinously, he runs amuck in more animal fashion : a self-destructive self-projection is characteristic of this stage of the disease. The familiar horror known to science leads to hallucinatory blindness in the choice and valuation of the object of passion, and this confusion of values stimulates the urge, simultaneously degrading the meeting of even highly organised individuals into the phallic plane. Here the moment of illusory triumph sets in. His/her priapic exploits appear even to the highest type of patient (male or female) more valuable than any of his/her previous intellectual efforts. No one has ever dealt with any other before as he/she deals with her/him. Shouting down the fear which is never entirely absent from this triumphant feeling, veering disorientated between pleasure and death, the patient (male or female) know's no reserve in naming obviously fictitious values out loud. For instance : ‘Love’. Mention is also made of temporal gradations anywhere between 'to-morrow night’ and ‘for ever’. While the undertone of terror is already mounting and the panic moment flees and (mechanical reflex) the brain, suddenly exhausted of blood, still murmurs high and stimulating words— (“Yes,’ said Werner Marcus, the émigré, wild-haired, panting, triumphantly exhausted, to the lovely tumble of dress and tender body that he held in his arms. ‘Yes, darling. I’ll ring him up to-morrow'!’ She felt him by her and above her, a being at once strange and intimate to her, a beloved, a destroyer of lonely space, a bulwark against the great fear. She felt weak and strong at once. There was her room again, already becoming rather material, but still glowing with an inward light. Some glove-leather lay folded on the chest of drawers, smiling at its unimportance henceforth. ‘Yes, darling, to-mor33 [pageend35]row you will ring the revue man up. We’ll have the première in the spring, and in the summer we’ll take a little car to the Vosges. It’s not quite so pretty there as in the Black Forest on the other bank where I come from. But you can see it from there, you can see the woods and the villages with a telescope. Yes, to-morrow, next summer, next year !’) —while the brain (mechanical reflex), exhausted of blood, murmurs high and stimulating words (to-morrow, next summer, for ever) the tight-rope walker (male or female) loses his/her balance on the razor-edge. A displacement of the centre of gravity, an emotional landslide from illusory triumph to reality can no longer be avoided. The patient crashes down and lands in the region of sad aftermath, triste post coitum, whose emigratic sport is distinguished from the common species by height of fall, shock of impact, and consequent shattering effect. ‘Yes,’ says the patient, for instance, to the great darkness of space. ‘Yes, the Black Forest; I know someone there who will get us over the frontier. It doesn’t cost much, fifty or a hundred pounds, and then we’ll go over to the Starnberger See. I have a turreted Schloss there ! ’ The peripateia is carried through radically. Should the doctor shift his attention for one moment (for instance to one of the other rooms in the boarding-house, each of which has its own bogies) and then return to his subject, he will find the transformation already complete. The only temporal gradations that are now used in this room are ‘never again’ and ‘no more’. Up on the wall a damp patch is spreading, and a strip of glove-leather still uncut is giving off its sharp smell; if it were articulate it would cry, ‘Want!’ The patient has already come through the first phase of shattering descent. There he lies, the famous author of literary works and ex-possessor of many things. His many features that were to have been another’s bulwark 34 [pageend36]against the great despair are womanlike bedewed with tears. He bends down his thinker’s head that had once- been an image of God into the suddenly stilled confusion of clothes and woman’s body, and weeps. Painful confessions are being forced from him. He is a nothing, an empty shell, the ghost of a mind, he will never write anything again, nothing of his will ever be printed again, he will never see that German countryside again in this life—O debts, O despair, 0 misery—it is the end. The morning, grey with fear, peeps in through the square of window. The woman, hardly able to hear her own voice, offers the huddled form words of comfort which get no response. But unwittingly the disorder of her clothes has put itself right. She stands up, her lips quivering slightly. How comes it then that the émigré, Werner Marcus, has mastered his tears and stands silent and rather shamefaced, his hat in his hand, and his coat on his arm ? He tries to get out a sentence that will not come. It is intended to contain the word ‘to-morrow’. He gives up the attempt. ‘Of course, you don’t know my address,’ he said. He smiled sadly and wrote it on a sketching-block. (There is something roughed out on it. What could that be?) ‘Here you are,’ says he, ‘and here is my telephone number.’ ‘Thank you, but please go away now,’ says she, as if she were suddenly in a great hurry, ‘and don’t make a noise on the staircase. Good-bye.’ While he was still standing in the doorway, she fumbled with her handbag, searching in it vainly. Her lips trembled. Then she asked, ‘Have you got a shilling? It’s for the gas-meter. It works all right, but I can’t find the right coin. I want to put the stove on, I am cold !’ Whereupon the émigré, standing in her doorway with hat and coat on, gave her the shilling. That left three- and-sixpence in his pocket. He could not show any hesitation in the matter because in the first place he was 35 [pageend37]afraid that to refuse the request might be misconstrued as pettiness, and secondly because the morning frost indeed lay cold in the room, and thirdly because Frau Sonnenschein actually shivered as she spoke. Having given her the coin Marcus went home. That is established in a police statement taken down from him during the following forenoon. A man in plain clothes came into his room and put his hat down on the bed. ‘Mr. Marcus, your address has been found on a sketching-block.’ The stranger sat down just asking for a little information. He interrupted it to say, ‘The woman is dead.’ Readers of Werner Marcus’s novel The Disinherited will probably remember the famous passage describing a foxhunt. They will remember how afterwards the raisonneur gives vent to the opinion that the tragedy of the quarry is due to a lack of intelligence, a misconception. After all, what the field wants of him is only a little cxcercise in the open air. But the quarry, mistakenly enough, takes it personally, he is lacking in detachment, he does not enjoy the patches of wintry sunlight, the clop of hooves, the joyous clamour of hounds, the sweet picture of virginal excitement that is the young lady galloping in the first flight. No, he feels himself manoeuvred into a corner, he waits with bristling hackles for a certain painful denouement. In short, he doesn’t want to play. He cowers shivering in the undergrowth while huntsman and horn and pack stream past. But you, creature of God, still cower under your bush and simply cannot realise that the hunt has long since passed and has nothing to do with you; your nerves cannot stand it, you have a craving to end it all, to lure the huntsman and his pack into the covert; you have a deadly, sweet temptation to arise from your refuge with broad gestures and howl and howl. It was not until two' weeks later that the patient Werner Marcus decided to arise. He spent the last fortnight 36 [pageend38]in bed. The chairs and dressing-table of his room were covered with plates full of stale remains of meals, the bare surface of his writing-desk had been long unused and was thick with dust, a jungle of old newspapers covered the floor. The patient had been reading them, but now he arose. He shaved. He packed his meagre effects tidily in his one suitcase and left it lying. He looked at the calendar and saw it was 11th November. He tore up the calendar and threw it in the waste-paper basket. On the chair next to his bed was a piece of paper covered with notes. He had been planning to write an Apocalypse of the Authorities ! The Parable of the lire at Moloch of Income-Tax Inspection. The Vision of Judgment of the Apostle of the Residence Permit. The Alkaic Ode to the Ante-room Chair. The Liturgy of the Hire Purchaser. The Great Pæan to the God Behind the Desk. The iambic-anapæstic Nightmare of the Glittering Uniform. He read the notes and tore them into small pieces. He had a mind also to tear up his passport, that exercise book of frustration, that mocking paper derision with many limp leaves like a tree in autumn. But he thought of another idea and put the wilted document, seamed with the scars of stamps into his pocket. He went downstairs and paid his bill. He was dressed in his moth-eaten fur coat and his black suit, his hat was on straight, his tie was irreproachable. For the patient Werner Marcus had decided to arise and go to a street known as Whitehall. He had just read in the papers that the king would be going there on that 11th November with his ministers and generals to commemorate in a two minutes’ silence the fallen, the buried dead. The patient Werner Marcus had his place at that ceremony. Among the men standing in the roadway cleared for the ceremony was a Mr. C. B. Peckham, of Glasgow, who had got into conversation with a Major E. H. Jones, 37 [pageend39]retired, of Torquay. A few hnndred yards further off His Majesty the King had just got out of his car. Now he had only to cross the empty space to the Cenotaph, where his ministers and an aide-de-camp with a wreath were waiting. At that moment the two gentlemen from Glasgow and Torquay noticed a man who has pushed his way towards them with feeble insistence. He was fairly well dressed, even if his expensive heavy fur coat was perhaps suited neither to the weather nor to the occasion. In contrast to such modest comfortableness, the face of the well-dressed man was of a greyish white, and he was shivering. Fever, thought the two gentlemen, stepping aside a short pace and taking no further notice of their chance neighbour. But the gentleman in the fur coat had thought it all out. During the two minutes’ silence he would breakthrough the cordon and charge up the steps of the Cenotaph to be seen and heard of all, face to face with the ruler of an empire : there he would stand and speak out ! For it had to be spoken out. A spectre from the abyss, a madman ever in wrath, foam at his lips, every word a broken promise, every step trampling on human dignity, a bogy of clay, his black forelock plastered to his forehead with blood, specks of blood on his heavy jowl, his fingers smeared w’ith blood—but you have forgotten it already and shake hands with this apocalyptic figure once more without feeling horror in the marrow of your bones ! As if he had never wallowed in the bowels of dead men. As if he had never boiled the blood of the slain by the fire of burning houses. As if a thousand thousand men were not suffocating upon his account. A thousand thousand men are rotting in hutments guarded by the electrically charged barbed wire. Children die. Women begged a shilling for the gas- meter, and in the morning they sometimes did not wake up. People lie delirious in the no-man’s land be- 38 [pageend40]\ ttoeen the frontiers. They creep on all-fours; they are dragged from their death-beds; they rot among the rats in\ ship’s holds. A thousand thousand, their coat collars turned up against the rain, tramp and tramp, but you gentlemen cannot hear that great tramping. It must be made clear to you that it is the same old foxhunt. Otherwise it would tear one’s heart with despair. Something has to happen. You must shoot someone or blow out your own brains or blow something up or at least throw yourself under the wheels of a Cabinet Minister’s car as he is driving to the airport, or at least under a bus so that anyway it will be in the papers to-morrow. It must not be that they ride past you with hue and cry, past the bush under which you are sheltering, having forgotten you already. If you but die you will prove to them at least that you were alive. For we have not croaked yet, gentlemen. When a few miners are buried alive in your coal-pits your heart is moved to pity and you come with pick and shovel and send for the ambulance. Now I arise from the undergrowth in the name of all those who are buried alive, of all the stubborn survivors on this earth, of a great pale army, and wave my arms and cry aloud. So the incident occurred. Up to now the king had still been standing in the background beside his car, genially, democratically bending over a little old man with many medals on his black civilian overcoat. So those two gentlemen from Glasgow and Torquay still had leisure to continue their private conversation in a half-whisper. Mr. Peckham had just come back from a two weeks’ holiday in German}', where, intoxicated by Rhine and wine, he had been exhaustively informed of national conditions by two conversations, one with a ’bus conductor and one with a hotel porter. He was now engaged in telling Evan Jones (major, retired) something very sensible, namely, that it would be much better for 39 [pageend41]Britain to keep up friendly relations with the Führer df the German Reich, who had, objectively speaking, been misrepresented by propagandists and, objectively speaking, wanted nothing but peace; which had just recently been proved at Munich by a peace guarantee and ihn agreement. . . . It was at this point that the man in the fur coat, forgotten by the two gentlemen, began to shout. He had saved himself up to wait for the right time and place, the middle of the two minutes’ silence; time was drawing on, the ministers were waiting, the king went to his place; but the man in the undergrowth could not hold out any longer, something was dragging and he could not resist the dragging of another quarter of an hour, not even another minute. He had been going to express himself in well-turned phrases, but now he stood there with his face grey and twisted in front of the two strange gentlemen and shrieked aloud. ‘Objective,’ he shouted, shaking his lists in feeble fuiy. ‘Ha, ha, objective!’ That was all. This was changed to a kind of convulsive shriek, followed by a laugh. ‘Objective!’ He laughed loudly and meaninglessly. It was at that moment that His Majesty the King left the old man and went on past the people lining the route. He strode along, a serious young man weighted with the burden of his office and the solemn mourning of the day. Had the gentleman behind the front row shouted something? Perhaps it was a cheer. He acknowledged it courteously. At the same moment he noticed the white-gloved hand of a policeman stopping the cheerer’s mouth. When he had placed the wreath and was standing in front of the Cenotaph in silence with his ministers and his generals, three or four gigantic, anxiously considerate men had found the cheerer a chair and a glass of water in the porch of a house. A passing doctor took 40 [pageend42]\ Icare of him. It was his opinion that the unknown gentleman had probably eaten nothing that day. 1 \ Next morning, coming back from a small errand, the patient learnt that a policeman had been asking for him atain. He left the house and never went back to it. In making that protest against objectivity, he had committed a political offence : of that he was convinced. Now they were going to arrest him. And, in fact, it was only a policeman who had come to say that Mr. Marcus would have to wait a little while, only a little while, before his application for the extension of his residence permit was granted. The fiscal authorities were not concerned with him either, for he had earned nothing. As regards a certain inquest, he had played a perfectly honest part, he had only lent a shilling. Besides, his passport was still valid for many weeks : but he left the country in haste. Indeed, the émigré, Werner Marcus, quitted England’s hospitable shores. A distant British acquaintance had lent him four pounds, influenced by the fact that the émigré, lacking another coat owing to the consumption of space, was still going about in the fur coat that nobody wanted. He meant to go to France. He succeeded in getting past the port authorities, but was detained in Arras. They put him over the Belgian frontier. He was arrested in Antwerp. That was how he got to Holland. Holland was a hospitable and easy-going country. The aliens’ department did not come across him for three weeks. At Harwich, a port in the British Isles, they would not allow him to land. So he came to France, where a sailor helped him to land. The police nearly got him at Lille, but he escaped, leaving his suitcase behind him. That did not matter, he was travelling according to a fixed programme. At Paris he escaped four successive raids on four successive nights. 41 [pageend43]Was there not still that Mediterranean country where one in whom the scales of life an death were level, could still live and die fighting ? He, usually no fighter, had a mind to fight this time. The thoughtful reader will remember that it had been that expensive fur coat, silent witness of better days, that had got the money for Marcus’s journey. But now it gave pause to the men at Marseilles to whom he applied to join the International Brigade. They looked the man in the fur coat up and down, and said, No, no more men were needed in Spain. Here at Marseilles Marcus, his passport nearly run out, stowed himself away on a ship. Two days later, he was discovered on the high seas, and was going to be handed over to the authorities at Port Said. But an American, an ex-boxer, a Jew, managed to flash a small cheque, which was just enough to convert a stowaway into a passenger. The friendly boxer asked why he should not go a little further east, to Palestine. After all, a Jew should feel at home there. Yes, why not go east? Consumption of space only existed for the luxurious man, the man of property that still had one suitcase to his name. Now that he had not a single suitcase left, narrow bounds had no terrors for him. For what could they hem in? There was no more distance, for what could be far away—where from ? And no more time—for, short or long, to wThat goal could time draw on ? 42 [pageend44]NGHIEM-XUAN-THIEN A LOVE LOST (A tale from ancient China) That summer was particularly hot. Prime Minister Huang said to his wife: “My dear Lady, you need not wait for me to go with you to our Palace by the river. The Emperor still has plenty of problems to study, and I can’t leave the Capital before the end of next month. I am sorry to tell you to go to the riverside with our beloved daughter Ai-Liên, without my company, but really it is too hot here.” Lady Huang looked up from her embroidery work. The Prime Minister was dressed in his beautiful red silk court robe, the colour of which was an attribute of his rank, ready to go to the Imperial Palace for the daily council of Ministers, under the Emperor’s presidency. He was on the wrong side of forty but still looked very young and very handsome. He enjoyed the reputation of being a great scholar; and the Emperor, well aware of his great merits, appointed him Prime Minister two years ago, and since then, he had fully shown that he deserved such an honour. They had been married for twenty years and had only one daughter, sixteen years old. But Nature seemed to do her best for redeeming her parsimony towards them by being overgenerous with Ai-Liên on whom she lavished her most enviable gifts. Ai-Liên was as beautiful as a rose in the morning of a sunny spring-day. And when she smiled the sky seemed bluer, the air brighter, the flowers redder, the birds’ songs sweeter, and the human race happier. And indeed happier was 43 [pageend45]her mother who was very proud of her heavenly beauty. She played music wonderfully, so wonderfully that at the sounds of her music, birds stopped singing, clouds stopped flying, men stopped working, children stopped crying, women stopped gossiping and listened, lost in dreams and ecstasy. Her songs beat the sweetest songs of the nightingale and the most marvellous songs of the dying swan. Lady Huang looked up at her husband, and thought of her beloved daughter. If her husband had a palace built on the riverside, it was only for Ai-Liên. Hadn’t Ai-Iviên one day last year, expressed the desire to be able from time to time to go out of the Imperial town where she had lived ever since she was born, and to spend her holidays on the riverside? “It must be wonderful,” she cried, “to live on the bank of a river, for a change from the monotonous life at home. There I can see plenty of beautiful things I cannot see here. I like the great junks with their immense sails that swell in the wind. I like the fishermen’s small boats that glide on the surface of the water so rapidly that they seem to flv in the air. And how sweet to listen to the rustling of the reeds that grow on the riverside, and to the lapping of the waves that come and go. They always seem to tell an unending fairy tale to the ears that can understand them.”—“And you can understand them, my darling!” said Lady Huang, greatly amused by the inflamed imagination of Ai-Liên.—“Oh-yes, mother, I do understand their strange music, and their still stranger language !” And she laughed. That laugh sounded like the tinkling of a crystal bell, Lady Huang still heard it now, as she looked up at her husband. And she smiled and said : “I am so sorry that you cannot go now. Our Ai-Liên is impatient to spend the summer holidays on the riverside. She has seen the new palace once, when it was just finished, and she 44 [pageend46]likes it. She has chosen her room, which is in the front part overlooking the river. I have had it furnished to her taste. Now, as you allow me to take her there, I shall tell her the news, surely she will be very happy. But I pray you, do all possible things to join us, as soon as possible.” Prime Minister Huang smiled a happy smile to his wife, and went out to the Court . . . * * * The journey was hard, though it covered a dozen miles only. The palanquin was borne by six strong men, who ran as fast as the wind; and in order to avoid their slackening through tiredness, the team of bearers were changed every two miles. That evening, when Ai-Lien retired to her chamber, after bowing respectfully to her mother, she felt that she could not stand on her feet. She threw herself on her bed, abandoning herself to her maids for dresschanging. She slept a very sound sleep, and dreamt beautiful dreams. She saw herself in the midst of a party of fairies, as light as air, and as beautiful as dawn, who danced a frantic dance on the riverside. Instinctively, she joined them, and whirled with them in the air, ran with them on the surface of the river, flew with them to the moon, to the stars, and came back with them again. The fairy dance went on and on, in an unending round, and when, exhausted by their gambade, all the fairies and Ai-Liên stopped, sat down on the grass, took their breath, and rested . . . Suddenly, the most beautiful of the fairies rose to her feet, and sang . . . Ai-Liên had never heard so beautiful a voice. The song flew into the air, inundated the space, and sounded like a cascade of silver. It charmed the cars, captivated the soul, and petrified the whole audi45 [pageend47]ence with ecstasy. Then the singer resumed her dance, whirled in the air, ran over the surface of the river, flew to the moon and the stars, and the other fairies followed suit. Ai-Ifiên wanted to do the same, but her feet seemed to be fastened to the ground, and in the violence of her movements to liberate herself, she collapsed . . . She uttered a scream, and woke up. She rubbed her eyes, rose on her elbows and sat up in her bed. Through the lattice of the window facing the river, the pink light of dawn filtered into her room, and she said to herself : ‘ ‘So, it was only a dream ! But what a beautiful voice I have heard ! It is a great pity that 1 shall never hear it any more!” And she threw her beautiful head on the silk pillow of her beautiful bed, ready to compose herself again to sleep. But, hark ! what was it, the beautiful voice she thought was gone for ever, seemed still to fill the air, and to reach her ears. It came from somewhere, on the riverside, and slowly but steadily, it came nearer and nearer . . . Ai- Liên, still drowsy, wondered whether she was dreaming. This very voice which came into her room with the first light of the day, seemed to be alike to that one she had heard in her dream, the most wonderful voice that had ever existed on earth. The beautiful fairies of her dream were all gone, but it seemed that this voice still lingered and stayed behind, and here it was, coming from the river, it filled the room with magical music, and threw her soul into a rapture she had never felt before. It stirred her heart, upset her mind. Was it a dream or reality? She must be ascertained of this. She sprang up from her bed, ran to the window, flung it open, and feverishly cast a look on the river. The rosy sky reflected itself on the smooth water. The morning wind gently wrinkled its surface. Here and there, small sail-boats went down the river. They were fishermen’s boats, as could be seen by the nets they 46 [pageend48]dragged behind. But one of them, sail down, went faster than the others, leaving a long wake, which slowly spread, fanlike, from the middle of the river to its banks overgrown with reeds. And as it passed her palace she heard clearly a beautiful voice that sang an extraordinary song, every note of which resounded in her heart, that beat faster and faster. And then gradually, the voice weakened, faded and died away, as the small boat slowly, very slowly merged into the glare of the morning sun that was reflected on the water. Ai-Liên could not believe her ears, and still less her eyes. She slowly returned to her bed, sat down and thought. Suddenly, she rang. A maid came in, stood respectfully by her side. She looked up, hesitated, and finally asked: “Did you hear that voice . . . that wonderful voice that has sung just now?” The maid shook her head, and said : “I pray my young lady to forgive me. I am so busy in the morning, and have noticed nothing. Maybe, somebody has sung down there on the river, as fishermen usually do when they go to their work.” In an angry mood, Ai-Liên dismissed her, and when alone again, resumed her thoughts. The day wore on, very long, it seemed to Ai-Liên. Lady Huang noticed something very unusual in her daughter’s behaviour : she was absent-minded, and spoke only when talked to. Even the food left her indifferent, though the servants had made the best dishes for her. “You are perhaps tired, my darling,” said Lady Huang. “The journey has been very hard, and my back actually aches because of the swinging and shaking of the palanquin. I am already an old lady, but if I were as young as you are, I am certain that a good night’s sleep would make me as lively as a sparrow. Perhaps, you are not yet accustomed to this palace, or are 47 [pageend49]thinking too much of your good father who cannot be here with us, at least for the present time.” Ai-Liên made en effort to smile : ‘‘I apologize, mother,” she said, ‘‘if my company is too dull for you. But, in fact, I do not feel quite well, perhaps because I am not accustomed to travel, and the weather is dreadfully hot.” When night came, Ai-Liên, after taking leave of her mother, retired to her chamber. Her mind was haunted by the beautiful voice that had stirred her soul so deeply, and she longed to hear it again. “Who is he,” she said to herself, “who has so wonderful a voice? I should like to see him one day, though he is only a fisherman. If I believe in fairy tales, I should think that he was some angel coming on earth to mingle with men in our terrestrial world.” And she recalled all the legends that her nurse used to tell her, when she was a child, in which beautiful fairies, male or female, came to earth to live with humans, performed supernatural deeds, and finally married the girls or men they loved. Had not one of them saved the Empire from the invasion of a barbarian horde ? She could not decide whether the story was true or not, but a splendid temple had been erected in his memory, a few miles from the capital. Her mother had taken her there, one day, long time ago, on a pilgrimage she used to make in springtime, when the weather was warm, and the sky was cloudless and uniformly blue. She remembered that she had uttered cries of terror when she was in front of the colossal statues of the Guardian Spirits in charge of the security of the Temple. Preoccupied by all these thoughts, she tossed on her bed restlessly, and fell asleep in the small hours only. When morning came, she was awakened by the very voice that she heard the day before, singing a 48 [pageend50]wonderful song, every note of which resounded in her heart and made it beat faster. She sprang to her feet, ran to the window overlooking the river, flung it open. In the pink light of dawn, which was reflected on the water, a small boat went down past her palace. And on the boat, the figure of a young fisherman, wearing a conical hat like all hats worn by fishermen, stood clear- cut against the background of the glaring horizon. His voice filled the morning air with its marvellous notes, charmed the ears, stirred the hearts and captivated the soul. It was clearly heard for a few minutes, then it died away, as the small boat and its singer slowly but steadily disappeared in the dazzling light of the flaming river. And every day, at the same hour, when dawn began to tinge the Eastern sky, the same beautiful voice wakened Ai-Liên, stirred her soul, upset her mind, and left her in distress, when it died away . . . Weeks, months passed. The beautiful voice, wafted by the wind into her room every morning had become part of her life. She lived for it, was happy when she heard it, and became distressed when it faded away and was heard no more. And the slim figure of the unknown singer, standing on his small boat, with a conical fisherman-hat on his head had become so familiar to her eyes, she could visualise it, whenever she longed for the song. Gradually, the weather cooled, and Autumn came. Her father, Prime Minister Huang sent a word telling Lady Huang that he could not join them, so, if they chose, they could come back any time they liked. When she had to leave her summer palace, Ai-Liên felt her heart break. The wonderful voice, that had been her good companion for months, that had moved her in her deepest soul, was going to be heard no more. It would be hard to live without it when it had become part of her life, of her soul. 49 [pageend51]It was an Ai-Liên completely transformed who came back to her father. The young girl full of life, singing or playing music all the time was no more. In her stead there was an austere girl, absorbed in dreams and thoughts. Her gaiety was gone and a tinge of vague sadness made her look more mature, and gave some majesty to her beauty. Then she fell ill, and no physician could cure her, not even the most celebrated ones of the Empire. Her mother spent most of her time by her bedside, but Ai- Liên was so weak that she rarely spoke to her. In her anxiety Lady Huang sometimes wept silently. She would give all the gold she had to any man who could restore her daughter’s health. She went to the Pagoda, knelt before the Goddess of Mercy, and made a vow that she would give up her earthly life to devote herself entirely to Buddha-worship in a nunnery if her daughter was saved from the strange illness that endangered her life. But it was of no avail. Ai-Liên, like a young flower, plucked off a tree, went on withering away. One day, Lady Huang, taking advantage of a moment when Ai-Liên was quite awake, repressed a sob, and said: “My darling, what ails you? What makes you so ill? I guess you have a secret. Why don’t you confide in your mother who loves you more than anything on Earth ? Tell me the truth, and I will do anything for you.” Ai-Liên shook off her dreamy mood, slowly raised her beautiful eyes towards her mother, and after a moment’s hesitation, said : “Forgive me, good mother, for all the troubles I am giving you. But my mind was so haunted by a fisherman’s songs that it leaves me no peace, and I wish I could hear the wonderful voice again, that sang every day by the riverside last summer. It has become part of my soul, I have tried to forget it but you see, mother, I can’t.” So Lady Huang sent for the young fisherman with 50 [pageend52]the wonderful voice, who used to sing by the riverside. But nobody could find him. He had left his hut in the early days of autumn, and nobody could tell where he had gone to. He was a bachelor, and had no relatives. Indeed, he had a marvellous voice, and many a girl had been upset by his songs, and had fallen in love with him but he was indifferent to all of them, and left all of them broken-hearted. His hut was still there, by the riverside, but the man and his small boat had gone nobody knew where. The news of the fisherman’s disappearance greatly afflicted Ai-Ifien. She never recovered her gaiety and her health of old. Then one day, she died, leaving her mother and her father is great despair. Three years passed. According to a custom of long standing, Ai-Liên’s remains were removed to another grave. And to the astonishment of her parents and relatives, in the place of her heart, a lump of transparent stone was found, which looked like an enormous ruby. Prime Minister Huang, overcome with pain, picked up the stone, and kept it as a relic of his beloved daughter. One day, an old friend examined the stone, and suggested that it might be given to a famous jeweller to be cut into a set of tea-cups. In the olden time, it must be remembered, connoisseurs drank their tea very hot, in cups as small as thumbs. Actually it was not the tea they drank, but its perfume. And the colour of tea had a very great importance also. Good tea must be amber-coloured. The set of tea-cups made from the stone found in Ai- Ifiên’s breast was very strange indeed. When tea was poured into them a tiny figure of a man, wearing a conical hat, was seen standing on a small boat which kept moving round and round the cup, and at the same time a melodious song was heard, faintly yet distinctly. It 51 [pageend53]seemed to come from afar, but it was unmistakably distinguishable. Prime Minister Huang kept the set of those wonderful tea-cups with the utmost care. Only intimate friends had the privilege of being offered tea in them. Every one admired those wonderful cups, and was never tired of gazing at the tiny figure standing on the small boat that kept moving round and round. And every one listened in ecstasy to the beautiful song which seemed to come from somewhere, very far away, and many a guest was so absorbed in looking and listening that he let the cup cool in his hand, and forgot to appreciate the tea. The fame of those cups spread over the whole Empire, and the Emperor himself had come to the Prime Minister’s Palace to admire such marvels. The story of Ai-Eiên had upset him so much that, in spite of his majestic dignity, a tear came to his eye when he was listening to it. Years passed. The story of Ai-Liên seemed to be forgotten by all men except her parents and close relatives. But one day, a man came to the Prime Minister’s Palace. He looked young and very strong. He was very handsome too, though his rather dark complexion told of his hard life in the open, battling with rains, storms and sunshine. He asked to be introduced to the Prime Minister. The guards drove him away and even threatened him with their halberds. But the young man, far from being frightened, insisted on being allowed to see the Prime Minister, and said that he would not leave the Palace without meeting him, were he to be cut to pieces by all the soldiers of the Empire. His strange behaviour, his recklessness finally so impressed the guards that they preferred to come before the Prime Minister, and reported the young man’s desire. Prime Minister Huang was alone in his garden, among 52 [pageend54]the beautiful flowers of all kinds his gardeners cultivated with art and love for his leasure. He was not angry of being disturbed in his solitude, moreover the young man’s attitude intrigued him, so he gave orders for him to be admitted. The young man told the Prime Minister that he had heard of the marvelous tea-cups, and asked for the privilege of seeing them. Such a bold demand might be considered as a great offence, and severely punished, but the good-natured Prime Minister had became very lenient since the catastrophy of her daughter’s death, besides he wanted to find out what the young man was up to, so he led him into his drawing-room, and ordered his servants to offer tea in the magical tea-cups. The young man seemed to be greatly moved at the sight of these cups, and holding one of them in his hand, he saw, as was expected, on the surface of the amber- coloured tea the figure of a man, with a conical hat, standing on a small boat, turning round and round along the brim of the cup. His face was wrinkled with pain when he heard the supernatural voice, singing a beautiful song. Suddenly, in a vision, he saw himself standing on his boat, going down the river past the majestic palace, that somebody told him, a great mandarin had ordered to be built for his daughter to spend her summer holidays on the river bank. He remembered what he used to sing when he went to his work. He knew that he had a wonderful voice, many girls in the fishing village had told him so but this had left him quite indifferent. He sang for he was happy, he sang for himself and for nobody else. He remembered also that whenever he rowed past the palace, the bang of a window being flung open resounded in the morning air, and caused him to look up, and he saw the delicate figure of a girl looking down. He never saw her closely, and could not tell what she was like. But rumour ran 53 [pageend55]among the folk who lived on the riverside that she was the Prime Minister’s daughter and that she was the most beautiful girl who could ever be seen on earth. But it never occurred to him that such a girl could love his song so passionately that she could not live without them. She must be oversensitive or pathologically sentimental ! But girls sometimes were so whimsical that they were beyond the understanding of common men. It was a great pity that a beautiful girl of so great a family, whom everything seemed to destine to fortune, honour and happiness, had come to die so prematurely, her soul tortured and torn to pieces by despair. This was all his fault ! Had he known that his songs had the power of calling her to life, he would have come to her window and sung for her, for as long as she wished. Xow she was no more, but here was her relic that spoke of her deep love, and the storms that had stirred in her soul, all recorded so faithfully by the supernatural power of her will, reminding posterity of her unfortunate passion. Post in his thoughts, the young fisherman forgot that he was in the Prime Minister’s presence, and in a moment, his painful emotions were so violent that unawares, he shed a tear that dropped into the tea-cup held so closely to his eye. Then suddenly, he let out a scream : the magic cup melted in his hand, and slowly flowed through his fingers, carrying away the fisherman’s moving image and his song. His scream was followed by the Prime Minister’s : the other tea-cups of the whole set, laid on a jade tray, one after another shared the same fate, and melted thoroughly. The news of the catastrophy broke out at once and spread over the whole capital. Friends rushed to the Prime Minister’s Palace, and found him and his lady utterly dejected by the sudden disappearance of their daughter’s relics. They comforted them by saying that 54 [pageend56]Ai-Liên’s tormented soul crystallized into those material cups for telling her misery to the world, was by now appeased and in peace, because at the long last her silent and passionate love was known and understood by the man she cared for, who repaid her by a sincere tear coming from the depth of his soul. 55 [pageend57]ANNALS OF EXILE JOSEPH WITTLIN TADEUSZ KOSCIUSZKO I In the neatly cultivated parks and squares of a dozen or so American cities stands the bronze figure of a young officer. Not very tall, he is clad in the colorful uniform of Washington’s day, and the day of the Directory. From under his cockaded bicorn, a braid of powdered wig falls to the nape of his neck, or à la Napoleon in Egypt, his hair tumbles in a long bushy stream to his shoulders. In Chicago and Milwaukee he straddles a horse cast like himself in bronze and flourishes a sword aloft. In Washington, D. C., in Boston and in Cleveland he is merely a pedestrian though no less theatrically bellicose and domineering. Only in the park of the Military Academy at West Point and in the little town of Yonkers, above New York, is his attitude one of modesty : the sword is sheathed, as no doubt it was when he stood before his superiors, the generals Horatio Gates and Nathanael Greene. It is evident from the prominent cheekbones and the fleshy nose that this officer—pride of so many American lawns—did not belong to the Anglo-Saxon race. Which is to say that he did not comply with the popularly accepted image of an Anglo-Saxon. His cheekbones, in fact, rather confessed a Tartar-Mongol strain, and the snub, fleshy nostrils—but enough of the bones and noses of heroes. It will profit more to decipher the name chisel56 [pageend58]ed so carefully on the pedestal. For the majority of the townspeople who pass these statues daily will have little success making out the name. Except perhaps in Chicago, which until recently held more Poles than the whole of Warsaw. There one might ask, “What is the name of this bronze snub-nosed equestrian?” and occasionally receive the phonetically faultless reply : Kos- ciuszko. The average American will twist his brain as well as his tongue trying to recall who Kosciuszko was. At school something or other had been mentioned about him, but that has long since passed out of the mind. Much more is known of that other Pole, Casimir Pulaski, who not only distinguished himself—as did Kosciuszko —in the American fight for Independence, but actually gave his life in its cause during the battle of Savannah, when he was only thirty-three. Pulaski became known as the father of American cavalry. Kosciuszko, on the other hand, was no cavalryman, he did not fall in battle; in fact, when the fighting ceased, he left the United States in excellent health. He returned to Poland a brigadier general, as modest and unassuming as when he had left. In the American army he had been engaged chiefly as an engineer of defense fortifications. The opportunity for bravura never came to him, even had his disposition been so inclined. Small wonder then if he is not so noted a figure in the United States as Pulaski. In Poland, however, only one of them can claim the enthusiastic love of the people to this very day, and that is Kosciuszko. He was a gentle warrior, a man of peaceful heart. As he expressed it, he wished rather to be loved than feared. It would help little to scrutinize his life—gay as it was with romance and adventure—for symptoms of vanity or violence. But he was not altogether the docile lamb. On the contrary, his White Ruthenian—or Lithua- 57 [pageend59]iiian—obstinacy was capable of asserting itself before the most powerful figures of his day : the czars of Russia, Napoleon, and such shrewd statesmen as Fouché, Duke of Otranto. Nevertheless, all who knew him joined in praise of his profound modesty, disinterestedness, and singularly winning manner. Necessity made of him a soldier and warrior. But had history dealt differently with his motherland Kosciuszko might well have become a painter. A nearly feminine sensitivity and tenderness was strangely mingled in him with a stubborn resolve. He was one of the few contemporary Polish revolutionists who refused to succumb to the magic of Napoleon. Fop Kosciuszko understood quickly enough that the murderer of the French Revolution would never fulfill his commitments toward Poland. All his life Kosciuszko grappled with the tragic problem of realizing the ideals of two great revolutions : the American and the French. But most tragic of all for this Jacobin sui generis—this Jacobin without atrocity — was the vety land in which he had hoped to sow the ideals of the republican revolution; this was the Polish land already plowed and torn by the bayonets of Russia, Prussia, and Austria. It is safe to assume that the United States would not have raised so many monuments to a single engineer of the war of 1776-1783—true, a distinguished and devoted officer of the engineer corps—had he not later in Poland become a symbol of the freedom for which his own people were fighting so desperately, so hopelessly, and indeed so illogically; and had he not been one of the first to champion democracy in Europe. Kosciuszko owes both his historical and his legendary fame, not to any great victories—of which there were few—nor to any military or political genius—which, it seems, he did not possess : Kosciuszko’s greatness emerged from disillusionment and defeat. 58 [pageend60]The world today is less and sympathetic to heroism of this kind. Power and success hold our admiration. We raise monuments to victors, spoilers and virtuosos of violence. Occasionally the hero of a lost cause is graced with a day of sympathy and then buried without éclat. But for those who still may wish to ponder the heroes of lost causes and limitless sacrifices there are the works of the English romantic poets, there are the tales of Byron. Here, perhaps, one may learn how it happened that greatness and fame could come to this modest engineer of Fort Ticonderoga, Saratoga, and West Point. And perhaps then it will be understood that the greatness of Kosciuszko was a greatness of soul. II Andrzej Tadeusz Bonawentura Kosciuszko Siechno- wicki was blessed not only with a long and difficult name but with a long and difficult life as well. He was born on February 12, 1746, in a village hitherto unknown and with a name probably chosen with the deliberate purpose of preventing any foreigner from ever uttering it. The name—with the indulgence of all Anglo-Saxons— was Mereczowszczyzna. Our hero passed the years of his childhood at Siechno- wicze, on his father’s estate, and from here he was sent to the school of the Piarist Fathers in Lubieszow in the province of Wolyn. No doubt, it was at the Piarists’ that young Tadeusz first discovered that ancient world of heroes unveiled ini the works of Cornelius Nepos and Plutarch. According to Kosciuszko’s own report, it was the figure of Timoleon of Corinth, that fascinated his youthful imagination most of all. This figure became a model which he was to follow his entire life. This youth, who later so nearly achieved the liberation of Poland, found in Timoleon the attributes of a true 56 [pageend61]historians disagree. There are those who claim that the royal protégé studied in France for five years, first at the school of engineering and artillery in Mazières, and then at the Paris École Militaire. Others dispute this fact, with the argument that; Kosciuszko’s name does not appear in the files of either of these schools. They do agree on one thing, however : he did study in France, but it was not military science, it was—painting. During the years between 1770 and 1774 he is said to have been a student at the well-conducted Academy of Painting and Sculpture in Paris, then under the patronage of the court of Versailles and especially guided by the lady who held all of Versailles at! her beck and call—Mme. de Pompadour. Among his foreign friends Kosciuszko, future champion of Polish democracy, is said to have availed himself of the title of count, a title which did not exist in Poland. If so, this innocent departure from the truth renders Kosciuszko all the more human for us, and confirms the fact that greatness is not always above vanity. Balzac too employed the “de” arbitrarily between his Christian and his surname. We do not know what actually was the case with that Paris painting of “Count” Kosciuszko, for neither the Louvre nor the Versailles Palace contain any of his canvases. This proves nothing, of course. Some of his drawings of later years were preserved along with a portrait of Jefferson. In any case, it is clear that the intellectual atmosphere of pre-revolutionary France brought immeasurable gain to Kosciuszko’s intellectual development. His sensitive mind was drawn to the movement of the Encyclopedists, to the works of Voltaire and Jean Jacques Rousseau. In addition, this count, captain, and artist-painter avidly studied economics. He was especially excited by the teachings of the so-called physiocrats, whose works dealt with the material status of the peasants and with the reform of taxation which 62 [pageend62]was so painful a burden on this social class during the reign of the last Louis. In Paris, Kosciuszko delved into the work of Turgot, Reflexions sur la formation et la distribution des richesses, and Dupont de Nemours’s La Physiocratie. Jules Michelet, an enthusiastic French follower of Kosciuszko and a friend of the Poles, rightly noted that “Kosciuszko’s ideology and his humanitarian tolerance reached maturity in France.” Independently of these studies, in his French period Kosciuszko gathered more than a little knowledge in the field of military science. He attended private courses which prepared candidates for the great military schools; but he was excluded from these schools, first, because he was a foreigner and, second, because he was too old. He is also said to have studied the fortification at the port of Brest, and to have studied military architecture under the master Perron et. Kosciuszko returned to Poland after the first partition. He found himself in difficult straits. He attempted to join the army hoping to serve his country, which had been dishonored. But even for a person with the rank of captain, and royal protégé at that, it was not easy in those days to join a regiment. For the entire Polish army had been reduced by the partitioning treaty to the absurd number of 11,000 soldiers, and if one wished a rank it was necessary to buy it from another officer, usually for the exorbitant sum of 18,000 Polish zlotys. Kosciuszko had no such sum at his disposal, in fact, he had no money at all. His share in the estate of Siechno- wicze, which his older brother had been managing, was so small and his brother’s management so disastrous that upon his return to his native land Kosciuszko stood face to face with imminent financial ruin. It was not only his personal troubles, or the political tragedy of Poland, that made the young officer’s stay in the country impossible. Unemployed as a captain and 63 [pageend63]branded a “philosopher”, Kosciuszko was compelled to tutor for a livelihood. He taught drawing and history to the lovely daughter of the patron who had once sent him to the Cadet Corps, the great magnate and military personage, Joseph Sosnowski. Drawings may be drawings, and history history, but, as the old saying goes, blood and water are not the same. The tutor fell in love with his pupil and the pupil with her teacher. The parents, of course, had not the least intention of giving their daughter in marriage to an insignificant officer without standing and with not a penny to his name. Kosciuszko sought the help of the king himself in winning the consent of the beautiful lady’s father. But the king, far from coming to the aid of his former protégé, preferred to warn the father in advance and on the very day of Kosciuszko’s projected visit to the house the young lady was packed off out of harm’s way. Not long afterwards she was betrothed to a duke, rich and well-known as a moron. Another version of this romantic tale has come down to us. According to this story, Kosciuszko had intended to elope with the girl in the manner of the knights of old. Learning of the plan, the enraged father sought to punish the daring romantic, who, it happened, was under his strict military jurisdiction. Captain Kosciuszko, faithful ever after to his first love, packed his belongings, borrowed some money and fled to Danzig. From there he sailed for America. A more credible hypothesis states that Kosciuszko left for France and from there sailed for America. But it is a matter of indifference to us whether this future hero of the American War of Independence experienced his first seasickness on the Baltic or in the English Channel. 64 [pageend64]Ill If Kosciuszko embarked for America not from Danzig, but from Le Havre, then by all odds he was in Paris first where the cafés resounded with the echo of events across the ocean. And it was in Paris that he may have learned the exact circumstances leading to the rise of the American colonists against England. Perhaps over a glass of steaming tea in a café alongside the Palais Royal he reflected on the resurgent mob which had spilled 340 cases of English tea into Boston Harbor. And a strong enthusiasm for the "rabble” of Lexington and the minute men swept over him. However, it is more probable that his desire to join on the side of David in' this modem battle with Goliath had already ripened to a decision back in Warsaw, where sympathy for the American rebels was high. The king himself favored these rebels, and indeed so did the prominent family of Czartoryski; who knows whether Kosciuszko did not carry with him letters of introduction from Prince Adam Czartoryski to Colonel Charles Lee, who not long before had been in Warsaw ! It would be more than tempting to bring together Kosciuszko and Beaumarchais, the author of The Marriage of Figaro and The Barber of Seville. It is well- known that Beaumarchais, together with a certain Dr. Debourg, actively concerned himself with recruiting volunteers for the American army. Unfortunately we cannot make the liaison for the simple reason that Kosciuszko was already in Philadelphia when Beaumarchais began his recruiting activities on a broad scale. Kosciuszko, like Lafayette, was among the first of those who came from Europe to aid the American revolutionaries; and he came at his own expense without the help of Rodrigo ILortalez et Compagnie, the Paris firm 65 [pageend65]which on behalf of the French government busily supplied Washington with men and ammunition. On September 31, 1776, Kosciuszko sent a memo to the Congress assembled in Philadelphia, offering his services to the Revolution. On October 18th he received a commission from John Hancock, President of Congress, as “an Engineer with the Rank of Colonel.” This commission Kosciuszko doubtlessly owed to the favorable opinion of the commander in chief, George Washington, though we have nothing to prove that he was ever personally introduced to Washington. This began the seven-year service of a Polish volunteer in the American fight for independence. It was an extremely important period of our hero’s life, not only because of what he gave America, but also because of what America gave him. He offered to these states as they wakened to freedom the whole of his generous soul, and all his talents—not least of which was his draftsmanship. And in return America brought to this admirer of Timoleon the first living example of how the ideal of a democratic republic could be realized, and this example he kept firmly before his eyes for the rest of his days. Immediately upon his arrival from that chaos of political intrigue—feudal Europe—Kosciuszko acquainted himself with the simple and noble contents of the Declaration of Rights of Virginia. No doubt he also read the eternally memorable Declaration of Independence, written by his friend of later years, Thomas Jefferson. On this native of Poland, where the life and death of millions of peasants were at the mercy of a small group of privileged nobility—on this idealist just come from France—where the peasant and the middle class of the Third Estate suffered inhuman oppression at the hands of the aristocracy—on this European—what must have been the impact of these words : 66 [pageend66]... We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by the Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. . . . But what mostly impressed Kosciuszko was the difference between the Congress which passed this act and the Polish Sejm (Parliament) where one vote was enough to veto the resolutions of the entire body. The Latin name of this venom that ran in the veins of the old Polish republic—a republic headed by a king—was Liberum Veto. In America fifty-six members of Congress approved and signed the Declaration of Independence; the fact that only one of these, Dickinson, opposed it was of course without importance. In Kosciuszko’s motherland Dickinson’s vote would have canceled the work of the entire Congress. ... And so he sketched and drew diligently. He drafted fortification plans for Billingsfort near Philadelphia. The Delaware River w'as to be closed by palisades three miles below the city and on the cape high ramparts were to be built. The work was still unfinished when Congress, in fear of the approaching English, left Philadelphia on December 2, 1776, and moved to Baltimore. The fortification of Philadelphia was to continue, but on the city side, for the English attack was no longer expected from the river. Fortunately the onslaught never took place. The Delaware did not freeze that winter and an attack across it w'oulcl have been too dangerous. In January of 1777, after a successful battle at Trenton, Congress was able to return to Philadelphia where fortifications wrere again in progress. Kosciuszko’s work on these fortifications was his baptism of fire, true, a christening without fire or smoke. From here on Kosciuszko’s activities in the American campaign link him closely with the person of General 67 [pageend67]Horatio Gates, who quickly recognized the outstanding talents of this Polish engineer. For his part Kosciuszko retained a great respect and deep friendship for his first direct superior, even when the so-called Conway Cabal later brought Gates into unpleasant conflict with Washington. It is possible that Washington’s obvious coolness toward Kosciuszko derived straight from Kos- ciuszko’s friendship with General Gates. Although this attitude was apparent all through the war, Washington in his generous objectivity was finally compelled to recognize Kosciuszko’s services. Coolness was altogether absent when, after many years, Kosciuszko came to America for the second time, having played a role in Poland similar to that of Washington in the United States, with the sole difference that Kosciuszko was not the leader of a successful uprising, but the unhappy hero of a defeat. It was then, in September, 1797, that Washington greeted him with these words: “I welcome you to the land whose liberties you had been so instrumental in establishing. No one has a higher respect and veneration for your character than I have.” But now it is March, 1777. General Gates has taken command of the so-called Northern Army in the “land of hills”. Kosciuszko came up in May recommended by General Patterson as a “capable engineer and one of the best and finest draftsmen.” Gates’s adjutant, Wilkinson, also has a high opinion of him and describes him as “timidly modest”. Indeed, Kosciuszko was so modest that, despite his own better judgment, he carried out the plans proposed by Colonel Baldwin, chief engineer of the Northern Army, for fortifications at Ticonderoga on the Hudson, the fortress which Washington had called “key to all colonies of New England.” When the worthlessness of the plan became obvious Kosciuszko wrote to Gates, who was elsewhere at the time: 68 [pageend68]General, above all I beg you not order me do anything until you arrive. The reason is this : I desire harmony and I wish to be friendly with all if possible. And if they should be stubborn and not accept my proposals which might be better, I will leave them freedom to do as they will, the more so that I am a foreigner. I know how cautious I must be and how much courtesy I owe to the natives. I tell you frankly I am sensitive, and I like peace. I would rather leave everything and go home and plant cabbage. Kosciuszko did not leave everything, however, and did not return to Siechnowicze to plant cabbage. He endured his thankless post and became reconciled to Baldwin. His compromising nature won him many friends but added nothing to his laurels. Out of the shadow in which his modesty kept him he emerged into the light only after the decisive battle of Saratoga on October 17, 1777. Here his engineering superiority finally made itself felt. When General Schuyler was removed and the command resumed by Gates, Kosciuszko worked out an excellent plan of fortification for Bemus Heights. This was his contribution to the victory over the English general Burgoyne. The victory at Saratoga had reverberated around the world and brought official recognition of the independence of the United States. With the name of Saratoga the difficult name of the Polish engineer will always be linked. After this victory Washington himself spoke of Kosciuszko in a letter to the president of Congress, Henry Lawrence, on November 10, 1777, as “a gentleman of science and merit.” It would seem that a promotion was due Kosciuszko after his first major success. But whatever efforts he may have made in this direction were restricted by his modesty. For how seriously could he 60 [pageend69]have been thinking of his career if he was able to write these words to Colonel Troup in January, 1777 : My Dear Colonel, If you see that my promotion will make too many jealous tell the General that I will not accept one because I prefer peace more than the greatest rank in the world. In our eyes, overstrained as they are by the sight of human pride and selfishness, these characteristics of Colonel—still colonel—Kosciuszko may qualify him rather for a cloister than for the staff of a fighting army where European volunteers in general, and the French in particular, didn’t hesitate to sing their own praises to the sky. Koseiuszko, however did not enter a monastery, though all his life he remained celibate. In March, 1778, we find him at West Point, where again under the command of a French engineer, Colonel du Portail, he is extraordinarily active strengthening the defenses of the Hudson River. In this work his colleague was also a Frenchman, Colonel Radière. Colonel Radière was a Parisian; Koseiuszko, as we know, was born in Mere- czowszczyzna. Naturally the Paris-born engineer considered himself cleverer than the engineer who had been no more than a student and visitor in Paris. And so the two clashed and out of the contest Koseiuszko emerged the victor. Colonel Robert Troup, who had now become chief of staff, reported to General Gates, now chief of the Board of War in Philadelphia : “The works in West Point are in a great state of forwardness. Koseiuszko is vety much esteemed as an able engineer, and has made many alterations in the works, which are universally approved.’’ In August, Washington himself rode down to inspect the fortifications at West Point. That was the first time Koseiuszko saw the commander in chief. As to how 70 [pageend70]Washington appraised the engineer’s work—judging from Kosciuszko’s letter to Gates on October 6, 1778, not too badly. But one couldi not have expected Kosciuszko’s report about himself to have been other than the following : “His Excellency was here with General du Portail to see the works. After all, conclusions was made that I am not the worst of engineers.” “Not the worst of engineers” remained at West Point from March, 1778, to the summer of 1780. And his achievements there? Here is what George Bancroft has to say : “West Point was a solitude, nearly inaccessible, now it was covered with numerous redoubts, constructed chiefly under the direction of Kosciuszko as engineer, and so connected as to form one system of defense which was believed to be impregnable.” So far as the saintly inclinations of this man who converted a desert into an impregnable fortification were concerned, lie continued to follow where they led him. British prisoners were kept at West Point. The food could not have been particularly appetizing if American soldiers and twenty-five hundred civilian employees at the defense center constantly complained of hunger. Our “not the worst of engineers” lived so modestly that from his savings he was able to feed the starved prisoners. This information has come to us by way of a certain Pole (who, incidentally, did some research on the life of Kosciuszko in America). It seems that on a trip to Australia this Pole was stricken with the yellow fever in Queensland. He was nursed back to health in the home of a shopkeeper whom he had never seen before. And upon inquiry he learned that the Queensland shopkeeper hoped in this way to pay a debt of gratitude to another Pole who once had saved his grandfather from starvation. That was at the time of the American Revolution in the fort at West Point, where the shop71 [pageend71]keeper’s grandfather had been held prisoner as a soldier of his Majesty’s arm} *. The Pole’s name had been Ko- skesko, or something similar. Even if this story is not true, out of all the credible documents touching on Kosciuszko’s activities in America there emerges the silhouette of a man whose actions were dominated by his heart. Today it is difficult to understand how a man possessed of so great a heart and such sensitivity to human suffering could ever have reconciled his temperament to the perilous duties of military service. It can be said of him that he detested slavery, oppression, tyranny, but never did he hate the people who were the instruments of these forces. It is hard to say whether Koseiuszko himself ever killed a soldier clad in the uniform of the enemy. We do know, however, that in later years, when at the head of the Polish insurrection against Czarist Russia and Prussia he held dictatorial powers, he was not to be compared with those who personify the dictator type today. When the insurgent Warsaw mob, on its own initiative, strung up a few royal traitors in the streets of the capital, Kos- ciuszko—supposedly a Jacobin who had seen the French guillotine—was enraged and declared that he would rather lose two battles than live again through this June day. But we are still far from the day when Koseiuszko became commander in chief of Polish insurrection of 1794. For the present, it was March, 1780, and Kosciusz- ko was chief engineer of the American armies. For this position he owed thanks to the British, who had captured du Portail, his predecessor. Before long, however, Koseiuszko took leave of West Point. At the instigation of General Gates he was appointed chief engineer of the Southern Army by Washington. But before he was able to reach the southern front—in the so-called ‘‘Black District” named for the many Negroes 72 [pageend72]there, where a “small battle” was in progress—General Gates suffered a disastrous defeat at Camden, South Carolina, on August 16, 1780. As a result Gates was court-martialed and relieved of all command for two years. The Southern Army was now placed under the leadership of General Nathanael Greene, one of the great figures of the American Revolution. Kosciuszko struck up an) even friendlier relationship with Greene than he had held with Gates. Under Greene, Kosciuszko was simply chief engineer; his duties included the selection of strategic positions in a difficult terrain, the draining of swamps, and the construction of pontoons for river crossings. The southern front bore another significance for Kos- eiuszko. Here for the first time he exchanged the “quiet of the study” for the front lines. Here he had his true baptism of fire, fighting as an ordinary rifleman, or leading a band of guerrillas. He stayed in the South until the end of the war. The entire year of 1782 he spent on the battlefield at Charleston. More and more frequently the American papers of that year referred to Kosciuszko’s braven^ and valor; his legend had already begun to grow. On December 14, 1782, lie rode into Charleston with the triumphant American army just a few hours ahead of Greene. During his stay in the Black District, Kosciuszko’s sensitive soul was touched by the fate of the colored people. And before leaving his many years of uncollected pay to the American Negro in his will, this Polish nobleman had already shown them his kindness. On September 2, 1782, he wrote to General Greene on the matter of distributing the clothes of Colonel Lawrence, who had fallen in battle : “I recommend to you two Negroes belonging to L. C. Lawrence . . . They are naked. They want shirts, 73 [pageend73]jackets, breeches and their skin can bear as well as ours good things.” Possibly, in advocating the cause of the Negro, Kos- ciuszko was thinking of the Polish and White Ruthe- nian peasants whose emancipation later became one of his primary objectives. In Polish eyes, the figure of Tadeusz Kosciuszko is visualized not in the resplendent uniform of a; general, but in the white linen peasant blouse which he w'ore at the time of the insurrection in memory of the battle of Raclawice fought against the Russians on April 4, 1794. Here, for the first time in the history of Poland, complete peasant formations appeared in battle with scythes for weapons—and these peasants won a decisive victory over the regular Russian infantry and artillery. When Kosciuszko called the peasants to arms, he not only visualized their liberation from statutory labor and slavery, but he saw in them the true future citizens of a democratic republic in which slavery or statutory labor would have no place. It was in the people’s army of Washington that Kosciuszko acquired a practical knowledge of the power of the people and the triumph of a republican ideal. He had come from a world where dukes, lords, counts, viscounts, marquesses, and barons were wont to achieve highest ranks in the army automatically, simply because they had been born into high station. In America it was quite different. Here lords were forced to capitulate to sons of the people, to farmers, merchants, untitled, unerested. General Nathanael Greene had been a simple blacksmith before the Revolution. Captain Ree had been a horse merchant. General Morgan, leader of one of Greene’s armies, had been no more than a coachman; General Schuyler owned sawmills in Albany. And the highest symbol of the American Revolution, George Washington, had no special privileges either. Pic was a farmer. 74 [pageend74]Nor was money a decisive factor in the American triumph. More often than not during the long campaign Washington’s army was an assortment of ragged tramps. For one who haď looked upon this army for seven years, who took part in its triumphs and its defeats, even for such a one who called himself “count,” as Kosciuszko sometimes did—it was impossible not to catch the germ of freedom and want to plant it on his native soil. At the end of the war Kosciuszko decided to return to Poland. He had been promoted to brigadier general. It was not a promotion on individual merit, however, nor was it a reward for distinguished services. Congress had elevated all officers one step in the hierarchy of the service. But it was a great honor for Kosciuszko to be admitted into the Society of Cincinnati, organized in June, 1785. He was one of the only three foreign officers admitted to this fine group of veterans. From then on the Order of Cincinnatus, a golden eagle with diamond studded eyes suspended from a white and blue ribbon, ornamented the chest of this Pole who always retained a great love for the United States and the ideals represented by it. He left America in June, 1784, passing through France to Poland, where he was soon to play one of the most tragic, though most beautiful, roles in the history of his country. IV How deeply Kosciuszko had become attached to America is apparent in the moving letters he wrote to his American friends. Each letter brims over with love for the country whose independence he helped win. One might say that the ancient noble blood running in 75 [pageend75]his veins was rejuvenated by the smoke of the American Revolution. Here is a letter he wrote to his friend Williams from Paris on August 26, 1784. (Despite his long sojourn among Anglo-Saxons it is full of mistakes.) My dear Williams, I dare say you think to this day yet, that I shall forget you—you see how often we are mistaken in our conjectures. How happy I should be if you could swallow only half scrupul of my affection, your heart would be open to the conviction, no longer mistrustful, but sure as of your own you would me always ready to render your service in my power.... I will not entertain you with the Eligency or afluence of Paris and the other places; because it will give any real pleasure to me or to you. We require more solid food to our unbiassed sentyment, and we are sensible of the strict conexion which nature assigned to peace the innocence, the richess to industry, to tranquility the valour, and the enjoiment of Liberty—dear Word—I wish my Country feel its influence .... Can you believe I am very unhappy been absent from your Country it seems to me the other world her, in which every person finds great pleasure in cheating himself out of common sense. The time may have some power to preposses my mind in your countrys favour and adopt the opinion of greater number of men, but Nature more, it is in every breast, here they take great pains to subside the Charmes whch constitute real happiness, but you folow with full speed the marked road and you fined by experience that domestick Life with liberty to be the best gift that nature had to bestow for the human specie. To morrow I am going to Poland and with some relictance as am informed by one of my countrymen that the affairs 76 [pageend76]of the republick as well as mine are in a very horrid situation, you shall know it in my next. ... 1 must prepare for the wors, perhaps you will see me again in your country, for this reason you must use your influence in Congress in my favor, and write me as soon as you can. Adieu your sincerely Thad. Kosciuszko. Indeed he had the worst to prepare for, though it did not come until after what Kosciuszko’s biographers call a “few idyllic years.” Between the first and second partitions of Poland there was a twenty-year lull, an interlude, separating the last acts of a dark tragedy. A Shakespearean light was thrown on this tragedy of both Poland and Kosciuszko by the ermine and purple of numerous royal personages. The shock of the first partitioning had produced great changes in the country during Kosciuszko’s absence. An extraordinary flowering of arts and sciences and the intellect had occurred. At the same time trade and industry had flourished, bringing relative prosperity to the land. Brilliant political writers, and statesmen— Wojciech Turski, Hugo Kollataj, Stanislaw Staszie— came to the fare with demands for radical social reforms, proclaiming that annhilation could be averted only by a nation whose people were free. The French Revolution had given wings to Polish radical thought. And of that revolution Kollataj wrote: “A people of twenty million that dares throw aside its crafts and its tools, risking burial in its own ruins, will terrify any power.” The people of Poland would never terrify the powers of Russia, Austria, and Prussia so long as they were willing to remain slaves on their own land. It can be said for the Polish patriots, however, that even before the outbreak of the French Revolution they had joined in an attempt to reform the system of the country 77 [pageend77]despite the powerful opposition of Russian bayonets and native reaction. In 1788 the four-year Sejm assembled and in 1791 the famous Constitution of May 3rd was passed. Though it was no more than a compromising act which brought equality of rights to the middle class alone and gave the peasants nothing more than vague promises, nevertheless, it may be considered an important step which might well have brought further advances had Poland been able to retain her independence. The constitution had the support of all progressive elements. The reaction, however, formed an ignominious confederacy at Targo- wica to oppose it; this confederacy, unfortunately, was later joined by King Stanislaw August, champion of Polish culture. To this day the word “Targowica” has the same sound to Polish ears as the word “Vichy”— though Targowica was never famed for its curative waters. Ret us look back to the first year of the four-year Sejm. This year was significant for Kosciuszko. For a bill was passed increasing the army to a hundred thousand men. As a result, after several years of public inactivity, Kosciuszko was now able to serve in the army of his own nation. In his effort to join the reorganized army he was aided by the very lady who once had been the cause of his voluntary exile. Ridwika, née Sosnowska, Princess Rubomirska was a fervent intercessor for Kosciuszko at the king’s court; the princess did not attempt to conceal the unquenched emotions she still felt for her former tutor of drawing and history. In 1790 the Sejm recommended Kosciuszko’s appointment to the army as a major general. And here the truly epic tale of the quiet engineer of West Point and Saratoga has its real beginning. Events followed one another with lightning speed. Kosciuszko quickly became the nation’s leader. In the war 78 [pageend78]with Russia in 1792 he led a division under the command of Prince Joseph Poniatowski, nephew of the king, who was later to become a hero of the Napoleonic Wars and a marshal of France. Superior Russian forces defeated the tiny Polish army at Dubienka in the Ukraine. Prussia, with whom Poland had signed a defense pact against Russia, not only failed to come to her aid, but betrayed her. Joining with Russia, Prussia carried out the second partition of Poland in 1793. Targowica was again Poland’s Vichy. The patriots and many generals, including Lieutenant General Kosciuszko, went into exile. L’Assemblée Législative in Paris had granted Kosciuszko French citizenship back in 1792. This honor the Polish fighter for freedom shared with George Washington, Friedrich Schiller, and Johann Pestalozzi. Using the pseudonym “Baron Poverty” Kosciuszko escaped through Saxony to France. There he sought to interest the French government in the fate of his country. The French spared no pains to prove their respect and sympathy for Kosciuszko and the Polish insurrectionist movement, but they contributed neither money nor diplomatic support. It is possible that they had little confidence in a nation ruled by the aristocracy, a nation which had not the courage to deal with its king as they had dealt with theirs. A certain Citizen Parandier, an agent of the French government, who was favorably inclined toward Poland, attempted to persuade his government to lend the Polish rebels twelve million francs after the outbreak of the insurrection. He explained to his superiors that Poles deserved from the French republic the same sort of help that Americans had received from the “Versailles despots.” But in vain. It was to the advantage of France at the time not to interfere with the partitioning powers. It was preferable to have these powers occupied in the east 79 [pageend79]rather than in their own territory in the west. In any case, the rulers of France had more important matters to fill their heads—which at the time sat precariously enough on their shoulders. So Kosciuszko’s hope for foreign aid was crushed. It was left to the insurrection to succeed on its own strength. It burst forth prematurely and was quickly suppressed. The victorious battle at Raclawice, in which the peasants so nobly distinguished themselves, sent a wave of enthusiasm rolling through the land. On May 7th, in his camp at Polaniec, Kosciuszko, now leader of the nation, issued a memorable manifesto which was more or less supplementary to the Constitution of 1791. To peasants he granted personal liberty and the right of each to till his own soil. The revolutionary slogans that he proclaimed took hold of the middle class as well as the peasants. The “Raclawice miracle” was contagious. The workers of Warsaw, led by a shoemaker named Jan Kilinski, expelled the Russian troops from the capital. King Stanislaw August favored the insurrection, but his rule had been taken from him. He was now completely subordinate to the man who had once been his protégé at the School of Knights. It is easy to guess that Kosciuszko was both generous and respectful toward his former patron—a fact which was later frowned upon by the guillotinists of Paris. The rapture of victory was short-lived for the rebels. The strategic errors of Kosciuszko—who attempted to apply his American experience to this war—and the numerical superiority of the enemy hastened the collapse. On June 6th, Kosciuszko suffered a defeat at Szczekociny. A Prussian bullet shot his horse from under him. For unexpectedly in the midst of the battle with the Russians, Polish horses and Polish men found themselves under a hail of Prussian bullets. The Prus- 80 [pageend80]siaii King Frederick Wilhelm II rode at the head of his troops at Szczekociny. On June 15th his forces seized Cracow. But in Warsaw the heart of the insurrection still beat. A Radical Club, modelled on the Jacobins, was founded in Warsaw with Kollataj at its head. Kosciuszko led a magnificent defense of the capital in which—as in September, 1939—the civilian population took full part. The Prussians were compelled to abandon the siege. Yet the insurrection was not saved from disaster. On October 10, 1794, at Maciejowice, a superior Russian army under command of Fersen delivered a mortal blow to Poland. Kosciuszko, severely wounded in the head and leg, was taken prisoner. To the end of his days he denied that at Maciejowice he cried, “Finis Poloniae.” The third complete partition of Poland was but an epilogue to the battle at Maciejowice and the subsequent massacre of civilians iti the suburb of Warsaw called Praga. The wounded Kosciuszko was accorded great honor by his captors. Those were knightly days, and a defeated foe was held in respect for the virtues of his spirit and the greatness of his soul. After the battle of Maciejowice the victors feasted and drank the health of the broken Polish generals. At the command of Empress Catherine, Kosciuszko was brought to Petersburg and placed in the Fortress of Sts. Peter and Paul. There he wras subjected to an inquiry—with great courtesy—by Attorney General Se- moilov. The records of this inquiry are a priceless testimony to Kosciuszko’s nobility of character. He took upon himself full responsibility for the insurrection. Shortly thereafter the empress ordered his removal from the fortress to the palace of Count Orlov, and here the wrounded prisoner lived in greater comfort than he had 81 [pageend81]ever enjoyed in his life. His wounds were attended by an English physician, Dr. Rogerson; he was supplied with a personal servant, a Negro, and with a cook named Jean. He was allowed to drive in a carriage through the city. During the two years of his imprisonment his chief diversion was a lathe-shop. There exists a well-known engraving which depicts the moment when the new Czar Paul, immediately after the death of his mother, pays Kosciuszko a visit at his elegant prison. Supported by an extravagant retinue and accompanied by his son Alexander, Paul pompously informs Kosciuszko—who has not so much as stirred from his sofa—that from this moment he is free to come and go as he pleases. The chronologist who relates this event states that as Paul offered freedom to Kosciuszko he professed himself an admirer of this prisoner of his mother’s, assuring him that he had always opposed Poland’s partition and pledging himself to restore her liberty. Kosciuszko was now free to go to his foster motherland across the ocean, but before he left he made what was probably his greatest sacrifice. In order to free twelve thousand Polish captives who were distributed in Russian prisons or had been deported to Siberia he took an oath of allegiance to the Marshal of the czarist court, George Wielchorski. From Paul he received a gift of sixty thousand rubles which he planned to use on behalf of his people. He paid a farewell visit to the czar’s family at the Winter Palace, presenting himself in the uniform of an American general. Here he was received not as an enemy prisoner but as a cousin. The czar embraced him, again assuring him of his friendship, and loaded him down with gifts. To the Empress Maria Fedorova, Kosciuszko presented a snuffbox, which he had himself made, and the peasant russet which he had worn at the battle of Maciejowice. The empress reques82 [pageend82]ted that he send her garden seeds from America. Such were the times. Kosciuszko traveled through Finland, Sweden, and England to the United States. On the way he was showered with honors as if he were a king. Ovations greeted him on every side. Orchestras serenaded beneath his windows, regiments paraded, elegant ladies of the highest social rank made pilgrimage to this Polish invalid who had lost a war and a fatherland. Stirred with emotion they wept at the sight of him, and gazed with awe upon him. It was no doubt the greatest triumph a conquered man had ever enjoyed in modern times. The essence of this triumph was moral and it evokes nostalgia for a world so completely fascinated by greatness of soul and so deeply moved by one man’s unhappiness. Ksciuszko had become the prima donna of suffering. On August 8, 1797 an American freighter, the Adriana, brought the sick and defeated Kosciuszko to the very same Philadelphia pier at which eighteen years earlier the young, healthy and hopeful volunteer had disembarked to join the War for Independence. In Phila- dephial the triumphal ovations of Europe were repeated. Philadelphian Quakers unharnessed the horses of Kos- ciuszko’s carriage and themselves brought him to the house at which he was to stay. Not long afterward George Washington sent him a letter expressing full admiration and respect and inviting him to Mount Vernon. This invitation Kosciuszko politely declined; he remained in Philadelphia, where he struck up a lifelong friendship with Thomas Jefferson. And it was to Jefferson that he entrusted his last testament which read : I Thaddaus Kosciuszko being just in my departure from America hereby declare and direct that should I make no other testamentary disposition of my property in the United States thereby SB [pageend83]authorise my friend Thomas Jefferson to employ the whole thereof in purchasing Negroes from among his own as any others and giving them liberty in my name in giving them an education in trades or otherwise and in having them instructed for their new condition in the duties of morality which may make them good neyghbours, good fathers or mothers, husband or wives and their duties as citizens teaching them to be difenders of their liberty and country and of the good order of society and in whatsoever may make them happy and useful and I make the said Thomas Jefferson my executor of this. 5th May 1708 T. Kosciuszko Why Kosciuszko suddenly left America, where he had intended to spend the remainder of his days farming, is a question which historians still ponder. It is possible he was discouraged by the antirepublican government of President Adams, which at the time passed the so-called “Alien and Sedition Bill” directed against foreigners. The more likely assumption, however, is that he left upon receiving news that a Polish legion was to be formed in the French army under the command of Jan Henryk Dabrowski. He beat about France to the end of his days, twinkling somehow at the edges of Napoleon’s star—whom, incidentally he did not hold in high regard. He engaged in diplomatic and political affairs, attended meetings and banquets at which Poland was toasted and crocodile tears were wept. Immediately after his arrival in France, while he still hoped that another armed uprising of the Poles would take place, he attempted to repay the czar the debt which had been burning his conscience, the money he had received in Petersburg, and which he had deposited in an English bank; with the money he sent a polite note renouncing his loyalty and obedience 84 [pageend84]to the czar. The note explained that he had taken the oath of allegiance under pressure of the czar’s ministers. Enraged, the czar refused to accept the money and declared Kosciuszko an ungrateful traitor. In 1806 Kosciuszko was in close contact with Napoleon. The French emperor hoped to make use of the name of the beloved Polish leader to win over the Polish people in his war against Russia. It is said that Fouché forged Kosciuszko’s name to an appeal to the Poles. Kosciuszko was firm with Napoleon; he demanded clear guaranties of Poland’s independence and the liberation of the peasants from statutory' labor. These guaranties however, were not given; Napoleon considered Kosciuszko a naïve lunatic. In 1812 Czar Alexander I of Russia, who like his father Paul professed admiration for Kosciuszko, sought to win him over. Again Kosciuszko demanded Poland’s independence and the liberation of the peasants. Alexander invited Kosciuszko to attend the Vienna Congress in the hope of strengthening his own position as king of Poland by winning Kosciuszko’s support. Kosciuszko maintained an attitude of friendly reserve. He committed himself to nothing. He was grateful to Alexander for having at least restored the name of Poland in the Congress kingdom. As a matter of fact, Kosciuszko did not take an active part in any independence movements in Poland after the Maciejowice battle. His final years were spent at Soleur, Switzerland, at the home of a family by the name of Zettner. On April 2, 1817, he liberated the peasants on his estate at Shiechnowicze from statutory labor. On October 15th of the same year he died, adored by his neighbors, especially the poor toward whom his kindness was almost legendary. A year later his body was transferred to Austrian-occupied Cracow, where he was ceremoniously buried in the Polish National Sanctuary —in the royal catacombs beneath Wawel Cathedral. 85 [pageend85]ARGU M E N T We continue the publication of the discussions at the Stockholm Conference of the P.E.N. in Exile with the text of another introductory lecture by Dr. Ivar Grunthal HISTORY AND IMAGINATION The element which gives purely personal experiences a wider meaning to everyone is the human element. A reconstruction of the past can be given by any poet today as the play about1 "Everyman”, with the poet, himself, as writer, producer and leading actor. Compared with reality, the reconstruction of personal experience becomes a tale at second hand. The lens of the mental eye is fixed upon an event which has already been reported by our sensory impressions and stored in our consciousness. And in the recreation, the result of the development is a double exposure. The features of the finished picture show a pattern that differs from the lines of the original experience. At the most, the change is limited to the distance between two different points in time. But if the power of expression, and the productive impulse, do not coincide, then the difference between the inner thought and the outward expression produces a more devastating effect. Instead of the intended living picture of the narrator in the centre of events, there appears in the developed negative a lifeless body. The artist has been crippled by the artificial effect —and spontaneity suppressed—because of the disparity between thought and action. Thus, the artistic paradox has impacted as an aesthetic miscarriage. And if the interpretative attempt is only content with a formal sur86 [pageend86]face-appearence and ignores the central message, then the creative power results in an immature foetus. The juggling of psychological concepts not based upon elementary neuro-physiological facts also leads to dangerous faults. Human deeds survive the earthly life and are transformed into history. Regarding our mental life, new discoveries in the physiology of the consciousness have opened far wider perspectives than the Freudian theory on neurosis. The empirical foundation based upon case- histories of the upper classes at the end of the 19th, and the beginning of the 20th centuries, in Vienna, later on got its only important addition from the well-to-do American Puritans. And today, new cases are to be found among the “New Class’’ leaders in the ‘popular-democratic’ republics behind certain political curtains. In any case, Freud at least meant well. He wanted to heal—not harm. The scientists who, after directives of both Hitler and Stalin, systemized brain-washing had clearly destructive plans for homo sapiens, what was human was made inferior to the sub-human. Already in the past, the dreams about Golem and Frankenstein’s Monster were to produce the artificial man as a servile and obedient automaton—a tool with no human feelings. On this point, I wish to say clearly that I am not attacking data machinery with electronic brains, nor do I include tranquilizing drugs used in the fight against mental diseases—and I do not wish to cast suspicion on the use of isotopes in cancer therapy. What I am reacting against is a wider exploitation of the Pavlovian theory on conditional reflexes which aims at wiping out in a victim his liberty as a free soul and, thereafter, to channel the victim’s instinct of self-preservation into a welter of permanent split-personalities—so that from such broken-down material the executioners can obtain grist for the mill. 87 [pageend87]The human fiends in our time and with their power, have not been satisfied however, with the breaking down of the acquired qualities locked in our nerve- system. The dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima stunned civilization—and now with the event of the Russian megaton bomb, the trap-door to oblivion has been forced open for all humanity. Parallel with the experimental cultivation of hybridizing corn, an aimless but unavoidable impoverishment of our chromosomal hereditary qualities continues- This fact is, today, a deadly truth. In itself, it signifies the beginning of the end in the living tradition about the unalterable human being which, in European literature, has stretched gloriously and continuously for three- thousand years from Homer till today. All gods have formerly moved in orbits around this human axis. This orbital movement has gone on in different aspects and at various distances. At the present time, the dance goes on around an idol where the soul is camouflaged as a Space Man. To the thinking man, a cosmic flight in fancy loses the joy of novelty since the arch-type of the super-terrestrial has spun in our collective consciousness since the fable about Icarus. From about that same time also arose the goal of Indian philosophy—ascending to Nirvana—and also the Hebraic dream about Paradise. Strangely enough, this last fantasy has a connection with the material in The Prophets—that there is already now on earth a Land of Canaan within reach. The later realities of Christianity’s New' Testament were based upon the belief of God’s justice on Doomsday. Today, this belief in God’s justice and God’s privileged rights has been replaced by human knowledge about the possibility of deciding in advance the exact time for exterminating the human race. Thus, the justice of God has been handed to the human leaders of certain political factions in an interplanetary atomic society. 88 [pageend88]Such a statement basically alters our belief in human progress as a chain of questions and answers, and where the human factor is a permanent being restricted to matters of time and procreation. An introspective examination of man’s conditions and possibilities now becomes, historically, doubly significant. In experiencing again all that we have learnt we get, pictorially, stronger contrasts when we pessimistically look at the future. It is easier for us to get headaches during low atmospheric pressures, but if we are not afraid of lightning then the sight of lightning is uplifting in character. Every source of light streaming into our consciousness from the outside is caught by the periphery of our perception, but they are stored as reflexes, a memory of light, in the central parts of the brain-cortex. The centre of our sight is situated behind the visual horizon of our pair of eyes—and our visual impressions are fixed, classified and stored in the darkroom of our ganglion cells. We can compare the ganglion cells to a darkroom with our consciousness as the red lamp shining more or less brightly according to the degree of our wakefulness. Impressions from the outer world are divided into light and shade on a film strip emulsified by the five senses. According to psychoanalysts, our mind, in spirit, is already filming during the foetal stage. Such an assertion is beyond optical laws. A compact darkness does not register on the film-plate. If we have the misfortune to be born blind, it takes us years before we can learn the Braille alphabet by our sense of touch. Among children with normal sight, the duration of the exposure-time is decided by the degree of impact on the emotions. Such a flash of light is taken up and absorbed by the hypothalamus—meaning that portion of the diencephalon concerned with emotional expression—and where the orbits that ring and criss-cross our instinct-guided life lose a part of their autonomy and become transformed into centrally-located 89 [pageend89]impulses. If we regard the period of our adolescence as a continuous period of filming, then the light strength of the emotional tension becomes reduced proportionally to the repression of the growth in experience. Our conscious power of reception works best in the stage limited from the second to the twenty-second year of life. The amount of film, in the form of ganglionic cells, is strictly limited-—and most of the rolls are already used up by the time we start to write creatively from our own minds. Nearly all the stock of images stored in the conscious mind is made up of lightning snapshots from our childhood—a period in our lives that most often coincides with upbringing and education. A writer is born at the moment when he is gripped by the mental suffering that takes place when he understands the terribly deep gap between his will and his knowledge. In the conscious life of the writer, the self-critical function is a repression of the mind. The handwriting and drawings from the hand of an insane person are reflexes from the few cells that are left intact by the illness. The cells that have been disturbed in their metabolism are, on the contrary, repressed in their function. In an untreated or incurable schizophrenic, repression reaches its optimum as a sensory autism and motor catalepsy. In an insane person who has been cured of his defects, the intact ganglionic cells function normally—and it is the limited quantity of such remaining normal cells that accounts for the resumption of a somewhat stereotyped mental activity. It is only in the first stage of the sickness that we can find signs of an intensified creative power, together with an increasing absent-mindedness and a declining need for sleep, food and sex. But even the poisoned consciousness makes use of the stored stock of mental images, and it chooses its material according to the dominating feature in the type of illness. 90 [pageend90]All talk about writing by automatic action is, from the neuro-physiological viewpoint, wholly nonsense. Everything that is stored in the form of sensory impressions in our minds during our childhood, lies latent there in readiness as a future source for our writings. Even that illustrious collection of arch-types, which was classified by Jung as a manifestation of humanity’s sub- consciousness, has been made up of the conscious meditations of the pathfinders who went before him. The personal touch which is reflected in a finished work has been put together, in part, from personal experiences and, in part, from important mental images imprinted in the mind from other sources. The strictly egocentric is humanly possible only in a few and very special exceptions. More often, as autobiographers for the public eye, we become cross-eyed servitors of the visual. But if we, instead, write a story about events that we have heard or read—in any case, that we have absorbed wholly through our consciousness—then the relating, at second hand, gets a freer play and more variable content, in contrast to reality, because of the ominous double exposure. Instead of a number of photographic snapshots, a motion-picture film is the effect. In a work of fiction, it is easier to depart into flights of fancy. Before we can even think about planets and stars, we must have some comprehension about them. But we do not need to put down on paper our thoughts about the universe right on the spot while out-of-doors. Whatever was made objective in the beginning, by means of inert things and events in time, becomes a mobile part in the conscious stream. The formation of such mirrored images can be recombined into new mental pictures, and give impetus to new objectives. And that what was learnt loosens its firm grip—the freed imagination soars into 91 [pageend91]the blue—and a new idea comes into existence like the end of a rope in the hand of an Indian magician. The richness of past memories gets its plasticity through the power of change in the actual material ingredients of the work being projected. This elasticity in Western cultural tradition was very neatly formulated by Arthur Koestler who, in a lecture given some years ago, spoke about a continuity through change. This concept was introduced fully two thousand years ago by a quartet of Roman writers. The youngest of this quartet, Ovid, was at the same time one of the first—and is still one of the foremost—among writers-in- exile throughout history. He constructed his Metamorphoses on Roman soil, but of Grecian stones, and filled the gaps of that allegorical facade with Hellenic mortar of Alexandrine origin. Ovid’s temple to the unknown god who, within his godly self, combines human weakness with human courage was soon filled by Ovid’s successors with Christian atmosphere. Ovid’s theory of change spread out into most of the morality plays—like Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress and Shakespeare’s The Tempest—of the Middle Ages. It then flowed into the second part of Goethe’s Faust. After this, it took a dominating position in the Austro-Hungarian drama and prose of the Franz Josef era. And still later, it fell into the hands of Franz Kafka and Robert Musil, to become an inheritance which is still, historically, valid in our times. The Homeric epics were cultivated by Virgil, the second of that Roman quartet. Virgil, in a highly realistic manner but bowing to the imperial demands of those days, gave the Aeneid the glory of an heroic poem. In the same servile manner, but with ironic emphasis, Dante, the poet-in-exile, wrote his Divine Comedy—and Cervantes, with tragic undertones, his Don Quixote. The grotesque perspective was refined by Gogol in his Dead Souls. And a Ulysses, shorn of all his imperial 92 [pageend92]glory, but retaining his human qualities, was synthesized by James Joyce in his self-chosen exile. In recent times, a return to original sources is taking place. In part, critics of literature agree upon the Unitarian theory as a genetic proposition for the Iliad and the Odyssey from dictation by the blind Homer. And in part, Robert Graves has created delightful pastiches in the late-Roman spirit; Niko Kazantzakis has written a neo-Grecian continuation, and the Swede, Eyvind Johnson, has retold the wdiole saga as fiction in a setting of our times. The third Roman of that quartet, Horace, had, in his central lyric that was heavy with fate, created a neo- Platonic sounding-board of ancient tragedy with insistence on self-control and self-sacrifice. His voice further echoes in the Patin liturgies, and re-echoes in the elegiacal voices of Leopardi and Rilke—and in modern poetry, in the Orphean blood of Vilhelm Ekelund, Bertil Malmbcrg, Hjalmar Gullberg and Johannes Edfelt. In Estonian narrative art, that line of Horace’s, “Non omnis moriar”, forms a bridge between traditional and avant-garde trends in the stories of Karl Ristikivi. Finally, the fourth Roman of the quartet, Catullus, became a pioneer along the path of Sappho on the long road to bring together the language of poetry and the spoken word. The most modern counterpart of Catullus is seen in the earlier love lyrics of T. S. Eliot, and the astonishing “graffitto” elements in recent poetry by that Swede, Gunnar Ekelöf. All these four Roman predecessors were given an epoch-making reality through that majestic work by Sir James l^razer, The Golden Bough, which, surely, has been of greater import to w'riters of today than any of the united research contributed by Freud and Jung. Frazer’s work fixes the central position of “forum romanum” as the “alma mater” for the generations that 08 [pageend93]came after the fall of Rome. The centres of mythology which, after the Roman era, moved geographically toward the West and the North, were crystallized in the Nibelungs, Beowulf, variations of the Edda, and the Finno-Ugric legends of Kalevala and Kalevipoeg—but these stand as minor edifices when compared to the cultural centre of the Eternal City. It now only remains to mention some remarkable attempts to demarcate meridians between these poles. First of all, there is Joyce’s Finnegan’s Wake; and then, a few years ago, the published work of Eyvind Johnson entitled in Swedish “Hans Nades Tid’’. This latter work projects events from the empire of Charlemagne, and it places the Alps as the spinal column, with the Rhine as the cerebrospinal fluid, in the body of Europe. The message of this Swedish work ends in a tragic optimism of Humanity—trembling like the leaves of an aspen tree on the brink of ruin. May we tremble to the core of our spine in the face of the coming cataclysm. But let us also, at the same time, search our horizons for the sanity and inner harmony that lie between the site of our intellect and the leaves of our trembling senses. 94 [pageend94]ALEKSIS RANNIT IRAN IN RUSSIAN POETRY *) *) This essay was written as a contribution to the theme of the P.E.N. Congress in Teheran which was unfortunately cancelled by the Iranian Government. We are proud to publish it as an example of Professor Rannit’s deep erudition and critical brilliance. I One of the interesting aspects of the literary history of any country, is its debt of inspiration to the literatures and cultures of other nations. The poetic vision called Iran or Persia has haunted the minds of Russian poets for some hundred and fifty years. Since the Russians arc neighbours of the Iranians this literary phenomenon seems of very recent origin, especially when one considers the thousand years influence of Persian poetry on Urdu, Turkish, and Hindu literatures. But Russian poetry, that is the Kunstdichtung (to use the German term), is no older than about a hundred and eighty years—Gavriil Derzhavin (1743-1816) being the first Russian poet of distinction. Neither the old Russian folksongs, nor the longer epic poems called byliny, mention Iran. The man who seems to have discovered the exquisiteness of Persian verse for Russian letters was Vasilii Zhukovskii (1783-1852). This poet was famous in his lifetime for patriotic lyrics and for his very successful poetic translations. Zhukovskii’s style developed parth' under the influence of German Romanticisifl, and it was through the medium of the German language that he became acquainted with the translations of Fir- 95 [pageend95]dausi’s Shah-Naméh made by the German poet and orientalist, Friedrich Rückert. This vigorous and lofty epic enchanted Zhukovskii, and in 1844-47 he produced his own rendering of the Shah-Naméh, calling it a “free imitation in the manner of Rückert” (“Voľnoe podra- zhanie Riukertu”). The Russian version of Firdausi’s monumental work (which appeared under the title Rustam and Sohrab) owes structurally nothing to the Persian original, which is written in a meticulous, quantitative meter. It is not even rhymed. Nevertheless this experiment was a Persian literary success in Russia. For the first time Russian readers became interested in Persian poetry. In original Russian verse, Iran and Iranians first appear in the work of the two great Russian poets of tliei 19th century—Aleksandr Pushkin (1799-1837) and Mikhail Lermontov (1814-1841). In 1824 Pushkin, who because of his perfect strophic mastery may be called the Sa’di of Russian poetry, wrote nine poems called Imitations of the Koran, containing variations of professed divine revelations to Mohammed. Later, on May 22, 1829, not far from the Kazbek mountain in the Caucasus, Pushkin met a Persian poet of the Imperial Court named Fazil Khan—whom he describes in his Journey to Arzarum as a “plain, wise, and polite man”. Fazil Khan promised Pushkin a visit in St. Petersburg, but whether the meeting ever took place is unknown. In his poem To Fazil Khan, Pushkin writes: Blessed be your new heroic deed : your journey to our severe North where the spring reigns only briefly, but where the names of Hafiz and Sa’di are known. You will visit our midnight land— so please leave behind a mark— 96 [pageend96]strew in our northern snow' the flowers of your oriental magic. Pushkin’s assertion that the works of Hafiz and Sa’di were known in Russia, must probably be understood as a phantom of his imagination, or as a compliment to Kazil Khan and to Persian in general, for neither of these Persian poets had yet been translated into Russian. The only Russians familiar with Persian verse were linguists. It was not until 1819 that the Persian language was taught in the University of St. Petersburg. Rater Moscow, and especially Kazan', became the centres of Persian studies in' Russia. However Pushkin probably had in mind members of the Russian aristocracy, w'ho may have been familiar with the various translations from the Persian into French, English and German. Pushkin’s second “Persian” poem is called From Hafiz. This title is, nevertheless, a pure invention of poetic fantasy : there is no such poem among Hafiz’s works. It reads as follows: Don’t be enraptured by the martial glory, handsome young man ! Don’t throw yourself into the bloody battle, together with those from the Karabagh mountains ! I know death will not be waiting for you : Azrael—amongst all the swords— will notice your beauty and there will be mercy for this beauty’s sake ! Yet I am fearful : amidst these battles you will lose forever the timid modesty of your movements, the delicacy and charm of bashfulness. In Mikhail Lermontov’s work Iran occupies only a peripheral position. In one of his famous poems, called Spor (Dispute), the writer speaks of “Teheran slumber97 [pageend97]ing next to the pearl-like fountains”. In the 1833/34 variation of Lermontov’s most visionary poetic work, entitled Demon, the poet describes Tamara’s eyes— which are so beautiful that ‘‘neither the Ruler of golden Iran nor any other earthly king has ever kissed such eyes”. With the exception of the pioneer work of the philologist V. Zhukovskii, and of several other Russian orientalists who were doing research in the field of Persian language and literature, Persia seems to have offered little inspiration to Russian men of letters of the 19th century. Sometimes she appears only amorphously as for example in a poem which Denis Davydov, a Russian poet and a general in the army (1784-1839) entitled Seeing Moscow from the distance after the return from the Persian war. An exception is Andrei Podolinskii (1806-1886), a contemporary of Pushkin and Lermontov, who in 1827 wrote a work consisting of 32 poems, Div and Pari. It tells the story of Pari, imprisoned by fallen angels, Divs, and liberated by Izrafim—a story of the struggle between good and evil as reflected in Zoro- astrian teachings. The romantic and elegant work of Podolinskii was admired by his contemporaries, but from today’s perspective its importance is secondary, even for the Russian letters of the early 19th century. The playwright and poet Aleksandr Griboedov (1795- 1829) probably dealt more than any other Russian writer of that period with Iran and Iranians. He was one of the Russian diplomats who prepared the Russo- Persian Peace Treaty of 1828, and who was afterwards appointed to be Russian Minister to Teheran. Griboedov depicts Persian in his excerpt from the unfinished longer poem Pútnik (The Wanderer), entitled Kal'ianchi (Boy selling the hookah). In it the poet, using an actual story, tells us about a traveller meeting a handsome boy who sells him a hookah and recounts to the 98 [pageend98]stranger the tale of his young but stormy life. The poem is written in a colourful, rhapsodic style. In addition to Kal'ianchi and his diplomatic reports, Griboedov wrote only once on Persian life. In a nostalgic love letter addressed to his wife from Kazvin on December 24, 1828, he describes the wedding celebration of Vizier Mirza Nabi, finding it too fanciful, unreasonable and eccentric for his taste. It is certainly possible that Griboedov would have given us many more accounts of Persian life if his own life had not been cut short in Teheran, soon after his arrival on January 30, 1829. — Of the little known poets whose texts have survived mostly in popular songs, one remembers Dmitrii Sadovníkov (1847-1883). In one of his Poems to Stenka Razin, the legendary brigand imprisons an Iranian princess, falls in love with her, and then, because of the criticism of his companions, throws her into the Volga as a “gift from a Don Cossack”. Among the poets of the second half of the 19th century whose work reflects the Persian influence, the German born Afanasii Fet (Foeth, 1820-1892), is outstanding. Fet’s lyrics are regarded as the most melodious Russian poems of the 19th century. Also remarkable is his technical mastery of the different forms of Russian verse. Fet has convincingly manifested these qualities in his twenty-seven translations of Hafiz, among them a number of ghazals—introduced into Russian poetry for the first time. Although Fet did not know Persian, and has followed what he calls “very exact German translations”, his versions, or paraphrases of Hafiz are real Umdichtungen, original poetry in the truest sense. Regardless of the fact that many Russian poets have later attempted to translate Hafiz, not one of them has been able to produce poetry as pure and vibrant as Fet’s renderings. In the introduction to his translations Fet asserts that the poetry of Hafiz reveals an ethereal quality not attained in the 'West until long after. 99 [pageend99]Of the important Russian writers who have visited Iran, the Noble Prize winner, Ivan Bunin (1870-1953), is best known to the outside world. Coming from Egypt, in 1907, Bunin made a cruising voyage in the Persian Gulf and Indian waters. He visited the harbour city of Jask, but it is not known whether he ever went to Shiraz and other places in Persia. As a poet Bunin is deeply rooted in the 19th century Russian tradition. He is allied with the classicists and Parnassians; but the symbolists—his contemporaries—have, strangely enough, left no trace in his work. Bunin demonstrated that distinguished writing will be accepted even when its style is outmoded. A good example of this style : descriptive, bare and symmetrical, is his poem The Roses of Shiraz, which also uses the 19th century sentimental image of “diamonds of tears” : Sing, nightingale ! The roses languish in tents of patterned mimosas; on their eyelashes the diamonds of large, weary tears gleam like silver. The garden of that night is like the garden of Irem. The voluptuous and pale moon looks through the design of branches as if into shakhnizir, the secret place of the harem. The chalk of the wall whitens dimly but there—where the light is—its satin sparkles greenish and passionate like the emerald of a serpent’s eyes. Sing, nightingale ! Desire makes one suffer. The flowers are silent—they have no words : the fragrance is their sweet call, the diamonds of tears—their resignation 100 [pageend100]In 1913 Bunin created a variation of the famous poem of Sa’di which bears the title The Bequest of Sa’di: Be generous like a palm tree. But if you cannot be like it, be the trunk of a cypress,—be straight, simple and nobleminded. As is known, Sa’di’s idea is a different one. In his version we read : be free like a cypress tree. II At the turn of the century the style of Russian poetry changed drastically to a new, so called "decadent”, experimental manner. The period between 1900 and 1917 might be almost called the "Persian era” of Russian poetry. It was characterized by a florid and flamboyant style, ornate diction, the ecstatic praise of erotic as well as Sufi-like mystic love, a rhetorical and didactic form of speech, serenity mixed with obscure symbolism and, again, the involuted arabesque delicacy of musical design in poetic structure, as well as in metaphorical, iconic ideas—which remind one vividly of both Persian illuminated manuscripts and Persian poetry. There is a special affinity with Persian miniatures in sensual pleasure derived from the word as such, from its "colour”, musical pattern and its power of conveying the emotional charge of a situation—to which both the elaborate wording and the refined form contribute. The result is a subtle harmony of the intellectual and emotional. The harmony could easily derive its evocative power from Persian aesthetics. Almost every one of the 101 [pageend101]famous poets of this period : Bal'mont, Briusov, Via- cheslav Ivanov, Kuz'min, Severianin, have made contributions to this style. The ghazal became one of the most graceful, selective poetic forms. It was used with considerable virtuosity by Mikhail Kuz'min and Igor' Severianin, with lyric persuasiveness by Eduard Bag- ritskii, with sovereign mastery and simplicity by Mi- kolai Gumilev, and with sonority and sublimity by Viacheslav Ivanov. The structural variations of the Russian and Persian ghazal offer an unusual opportunity for a study in comparative poetics, as well as in musicology. Valerii Briusov (1873-1924)—the founder of Russian symbolism and the main theorist of its early period— was an epicurean of poetic forms. He composed Russian ghazals of ultimate refinement, grace and musicality. His Gazelia—Podrazhanie persidskomu (Ghazal—A Poem in the Persian manner), is laden with symbolist images and adjectives. An accomplished craftsman, Briusov, who had been constantly seeking formal perfection in his verse, uses in this ghazal—besides a highly euphonic and exact metrical structure—f our rhyming schemes. One consists of end-rhymes and three of internal rhymes : 1. zvenia-menia, ognia-menia, khrania-menia, gonia- inenia, zapadnia-menia; 2. peli — gazeli — ushchelii — eli —rozoveli — zveneli; 3. riadom — vzgliadom — usladam — kladom — arkadam — iadom; 4. Hubil — pálil — tomil — manil — bez sil — otrávil. A literal translation of this captivating love poem would not do justice to its author, nor to the reader who does not know Russian. To perceive its frail, “Persian”, filigree-like musicality, it must be read in the Russian original : * 102 [pageend102]ГАЗЕЛЛА Подражание персидскому В ту ночь нам птицы пели, как серебром звеня, С тобой мы были рядом, и ты любил меня. Твой взгляд, как у газели, был вспышками огня, И ты газельим взглядом всю ночь палил меня. Как в тесноте ущелий томит пыланье дня, Так ты, маня к усладам, всю ночь томил меня. Злой дух, в горах у ели, таится, клад храня, Ах, ты не тем ли кладом всю ночь манил меня? Минуты розовели, с востока тень гоня. Как будто по аркадам ты вел, без сил, меня. Пусть птицы мне звенели, что близко западня: В ту ночь любовным ядом ты отравил меня. 1915 A fellow symbolist and a contemporary of Briusov, Konstantin Bal'mont (1867-1942), a spectacular, colourful and selfcentered romanticist (whom one might call the Russian Swinburne because of the mellifluous quality of his verse) was always attracted by the lore of strange lands, and travelled extensively in the Eastern and Western hemispheres. In his book entitled Zovy Drev- nosti (The Call of Antiquity), published in 1908, Bal'mont speaks of the “alpine freshness of Iran and of the songs of Zoroaster, full of vigorous fascination”. Nine long poems in this book constitute the cycle called Iran. They are predominantly concerned with the Avesta faith and Iranian mythology. Bal'mont praises the Zoro- astrians as warriors of God, and glorifies their duty to 103 [pageend103]struggle against evil. The spirit of selfless dedication, self-control, wisdom, courage, power, glory, sublimity, and the justice of God are the subjects of these odes, written in the form of blank verse. In these Balmont abandons his usual structural form and the poetry itself is rather at the mercy of his ecstatic inspiration. Although bombastic and too didactic, the odes nevertheless have a quality of ease and fluidity. Nikolai Gumilev (1886-1921), a pupil of Briusov and the leader of the so-called Acmeists, was a poet of considerable precision, concreteness, laconism. One of his poems, Persian Miniature, bears both the symbolic title, and the reflection of the art of Persian illumination, of which Gumilev was an ardent admirer. The poet dreams of becoming himself a Persian miniature : When I finally finish playing hide-and-seek with death, the Creator will make out of me a Persian miniature. The heavens are like turquoise. The prince hardly lifts his almond-like eyes to follow the upw'ard flight of the maidenly swing. The Shah, with a blood-stained lance, rushes on a treacherous path to the heights of cinnabar after an escaping roe. Neither night—nor day-dreams, mysterious unseen tuberoses, nor lotuses already bent to grass in the sweet evening------ 104 [pageend104]And on the reverse, pure as the clouds of Tibet, 1 shall with gratitude wear the mark of a great artist. This is a typical ornamental, mosaic-like poem in the “Persian” style. The figures and images look a little as if they had been cut out of coloured paper and distributed over the page to make a perfect pattern. It is a poetic fairy garden the imagination can wander through without ever wearying. Gumilev whose verses are inspired by his long travels in Africa, and who was marked by a passionate liking of the exotic—never visited Iran. He would have been a perfect poet to sing the beauty of Iranian life. For him, Persia would probably have been a more significant experience than moon-lit ruins enchanted by memories of a jewelled court and magic swords. At the end of the First World War Gumilev, who was an officer in the Russian Imperial Army, asked the Russian High-Command to transfer him to the Persian front. His request was refused. In 1918 he returned to Petersburg where in 1921 he was executed by a Bolshevik firing squad. Ill The period which I have called the “Persian era’’ of Russian poetry came to an end with the Communist Revolution of 1917. The new, expressionist experiments brought a vulgarization to Russian poetic language. The plebeian and rustic style which became triumphant, could not possibly produce the exquisite chamber-music quality of the verses, or the delicate, lace-like ornamentation. 105 [pageend105]('r c orgii Ivanov (1894-1958), a follower of Gumilev and a poet who has manifested the skill and concentration of the old school, summed up the lost beauty of the past in this nostalgic Persian poem before he left Russia forever : Where are you, Selim, and where is your Zaira, the poems of Hafiz, the lute and the moon ! The cruel beam of the midday world has left in my heart only the names. And my song, burning with anxiety, does not know the limit of its longing And the wind over the tomb of Selim drops petals of oriental roses. In a style not too distant from Georgii Ivanov’s two younger contemporaries of his, Andrei Globa and Konstantin Lipskerov, have written poems based on the oriental manner of stylization. Globa is noted for his ghazals, Lipskerov for his sonnets called Imitations of Gulistan. Especially masterful is his Dedication to Sa’di. Mikhail Lozinskii (1886-1955), a friend of Gumilev and one of those Russian poet-aesthetes who worshipped a dream world of words, and of traditional patterns of balance and harmony, found himself isolated in the Soviet Union. Not being permitted to write poems in his own style, he gave up original writing and became a translator of classical literature. His masterpiece is the Divine Comedy, which may be the best translation of Dante’s work into any language. In connection with the celebration of the Firdausi millenium, Lozinski translated approximately a fifth of the Shah-Naméh in a meter as close to the original as possible. The language Lozinskii employs in his translations of Firdausi is one of great clarity, classical order, brevity, and directness. 106 [pageend106]No other twentieth century Russian translator of Persian poetry has created a similar work of art. In the 1930’s, and again after the Second World War, a considerable number of Russian poets (seeking an escape from Soviet reality) translated classical Persian poetry. For reasons of cultural annexation and sovietiza- tion, Persian poets are constantly contemptuously presented to the Soviet reader as Tadzhik or Azerbaidzhani poets. A complete translation of the Shah-Naméh, with the usual Soviet propagandistic introduction, appeared in Moscow in 1957. It was edited by Braghinskii and S. Shervinskii. In addition to the unsurpassed renderings of Firdausi made by Eozinskii, other partial translations of this epic work have appeared in periodicals and books. These have been done by S. Lipkin, S. Sokolov, M. Diakonov, V. Derzhavin, I. Seľvinskii, V. Ee- vik, V. Zvegintsev, K. Lipskerov, M. Petrov and others. Nizami has been translated by O. Rumor, I. Bruni, A. Tarkovskii, V. Rozhdestvenskii. Hafiz, who for the taste of the Soviets, is “too liberal an aesthetician and illusionist” (E. Dunaevskii), was very much appreciated in Russia before the Communist Revolution. In addition to Fet and Bunin, of whom we have already spoken, Hafiz was translated by Aleksandr Bestuzhev - Marlinskii, by M. Prahov, A. Krymskii, the academician F. Korsh (the author of the posthumously published anthology Persidskie liriki X-XV vekov, Persian Poets from X to XV century; Moscow, 1916), by N. de Vitt, N. Eozeev, V. Rafaľskii, I. Umev, V. Belanovich, and V. Tardov. In 1935 the publishing house Akadeviia in Eeningrad, issued a selection of Hafiz’s lyrics in a translation by Evgenii Dunaevskii. These translations are conscientiously done, but since Dunaevskii is only a third-rate poet, he was unable to convey the technical mastery and the natural sweetness of Hafiz’s language, his melodiousness and gracefulness. He also omitted the 107 [pageend107]Hafiz poems rich in Sufi imagery, probably for political reasons. The Sufi poets, indeed all metaphysical poets of Persia, are either forbidden reading in contemporary Russia, or considered unworthy of critical attention. Thus Rumi, the great mystical poet of Persia, is almost completely unknown to the younger generation of Soviet readers— as is also the grat philosophical Russian poet, Viacheslav Ivanov, who died in exile in 1949 and whose work is not being published in the Soviet Union. In both Rumi and Ivanov we find high spirituality combined with rich poetic genius. Their expressions are eloquent manifestations of God; and their thoughts profound and subtle. Of all Persian poets, Umar Khaiyam is the most popular in the Soviet Union—as also in the Western World, but for very different reasons. The Soviets admire Khaiyam for his “militant atheism and social revolutionary ideas”—and for this reason he is eminently acceptable to them, and they disregard the fact that he does not rank high in Persian literature. The best poetic adaptation of Umar Khaiyam’s Rubayat is by a Russian émigré writer, Ivan Thorzhevskii. His translations appeared in Sovremennye Zapiski Paris, vol. 29, 1926. In the early years of the Soviet regime Persian motifs appear in the work of some poets, for example in Vele- mir Khlebnikov’s (1885-1922), T rump et-of-Gul'-Mulla, probably written during the poet’s stay in Iran in 1921. The imagist Khlebnikov, in a letter to his sister, describes in an ecstatic, but grotesque manner his Persian travels: "Enjoying the calm weather—similar to the smile of heaven which belongs to all mankind—I am sailing on Kursk southwards to the shores of Persia. The summits covered with the silver snow are like the eyes of the prophet hidden behind the eyebrows of clouds. The snowy patterns on the summits look like 108 [pageend108]the reflection of the severe thought in the depths of God’s eyes, or rather like the severe eyes of the proud thought itself. The blue miracle of Persia above the endless silk of red-yellowish waves reminds one of the eyes of Fate coming from a different world. The golden South, flowing softly like splendid silks thrown at the feet of the Northern Mohamed changes—and the seascape behind the poop of the Kursk is like dim blue silver and the twisting glass of waves is greener than grass. The snowy snakes of foam bite themselves and serpeutize in convulsions like the beheaded ... I rushed to the sea in order to listen to its sacred rumour. I sang, and embarrassed with my singing the Persians. . . .” The most striking poetic eulogy to Iran, to its landscapes and women, was delivered by a very much beloved poet, Sergei Esenin (1895-1925). In his Persidskie motivy (Persian sketches), his fascination with Persia was rendered in an idyllic and melancholy style that achieved the same unique poetic sincerity which is characteristic of all his poetry. Esenin’s was a powerful lyric genius whose inspiration sprang from a religious nature, and from his love for the soil and landscape of Russia. As a peasant and revolutionary mystic, Esenin suffered a progressive disillusionment under the proletarian, industrial and materialistic Soviet system. On December 28, 1925, he slashed his wrists, and then hanged himself in a Leningrad hotel room. Esenin’s Persian poems may be considered his poetic means of escape, his self-liberation or jail-break. In magically simple, yet virtiroso diction the poet speaks of Iran as “the blue homeland of Firdausi”, of “roses silently running in fields” (“tikho rozy begut po poliam”), of “the gold of roses” and describes the rose flower as a “svetil'nik”, the ecclesiastical lamp. Names like Sha- hané or Lala (probably a variation of the Persian “Leila” or Laléh”) symbolize the perfect loveliness of Persian 109 [pageend109]women. The names of Sa’di and Khaiyam and Firdausi, Shiraz and Khorasan appear as ornamental elements of these poems. To give a perfect translation of Esenin metrically, or even in prose in a foreign tongue, is impossible; just as it is impossible to translate William Blake with whom the Russian poet shares a quality of rare lyric ingenuousness and immediateness. One can translate intellectual poetry, but it is almost impossible to produce the inner tone of the purest lyrics of the Blake—Esenin type. It is only for the sake of intimation that I give below a translation in pedestrian prose of one of the central Persian poems by Esenin.— Today I asked the money-changer who gives one ruble for half of a tuman : how should I say, in Persian, to the beautiful Lala, the tenderhearted words: “I love you”? Today I asked the money-changer, being even more weightless than wind, and more placid than the waters of Lake Van, how should I say to the lovely Lala the caressing word “Kiss”? And I also asked the money-changer, hiding timidity deeper in my heart, how should I say to the beautiful Lala, how can I possibly tell her that she is “mine” ? And the money-changer answered shortly : one does not speak of love in words, one only stealthily sighs after love while the eyes sparkle like sapphires. A kiss does not have a name, a kiss is not an inscription on a grave : 110 [pageend110]kisses drift like red roses with petals melting on lips. One does not demand a pledge from love, with love we learn joy and grief alike. Only those hands can say: “You are mine”, which tore off the black yashmack. This and other poems of Esenin convince one of their authenticity as poetic documents of real experience. Yet contrary to the assertion of Georgii Ivanov and some other critics who speak of Esenin’s Persian travels, Esenin never visited Persia. In the winter of 1924/25 he met the journalist Veniamin Popov in Tbilisi, Georgia, who had just returned from a two-years’ stay in Iran. Popov told Esenin endless and enchanting stories about his life there. From the private library of Popov Esenin also obtained the anthology of Persian lyrics edited by the academician Korsch, and was affected by the out-of- the-ordinary beauty of the Persian world. The result was a poetic outburst of complete reality and naturalness. Thus an indirect contact with Persia evoked the creation of the most direct Persian poems in the Russian language. Ill [pageend111]PROFILES A VOICE OF EUROPE IN AMERICA I. The attitude toward the American continent of an European intellectual is always of interest, especially when he is a writer and thinker of such intellectual and moral authority as Eugene Relgis. The author of some 54 books which have been translated into 14 languages, Relgis is, nevertheless, very little know'll in the Anglo-Saxon world. It as to be hoped that this situation will be remedied, and there are signs of growing interest in his writings *) It would be a great shame if more attention were not dedicated to this poet, novelist and philosopher, whose works have enjoyed consideration and respect for years in Europe, and are now becoming known in Latin America through Spanish translations. *) See Felix H. Frank and John H. Hershey, “Eugen Relgis : Rumanian Humanist”, The Humanist (Yellow Springs, Ohio), No. 1, 1951; and W. T. Starr and F. S. Stimson, “Eugene Relgis, Pan-Humanist”, Books Abroad (Norman, Okla.), Spring, 1961. **) Published in English by The Oriole Press of Berkeley Heights, New Jersey. Relgis was born in Yassy, Rumania, on March 2, 1895. He appeared in the literary world of his country in 1913 with a volume of literary fantasies, ‘‘The Triumph of Non-Being”, written when he was 17 years old, followed in 1914 by “Madness” and in 1919 by “Muted Voices”, a novel with a prologue by Stefan Zweig ** ). From 1915 to 1917 he wrote a trilogy entitled “Petru Arbore”, published in Rumanian in 1924 and in a revised edition in 1946. However, his most characteristic works are the descriptions of his travels through Europe, such as “Twelve Capitals”, and especially the essays in which he elaborates the philosophy which he terms in Spanish “humaniatarism”, and which has been rendered in 112 [pageend112]English as “humanism” or “pan-humanism”. I believe that the latter term is more descriptive of Relgis’ universalist and pacifist doctrine. A basic work in understanding this philosophy is the book originally entitled “Umanitarismul si in- ternationala intelectualilor” and which has been published in Spanish under the title “El humanitarismo” (Editorial Américale Buenos Aires, 1956). Relgis, an idealist deeplv preoccupied with social problems, maintains that a philosophical-moral system which transcends borders, political and religious ideologies and, in short, anything that tends to separate man from man and cause wars, is necessary to assure the peaceful existence and true progress of the human race. As a practical and not a utopian thinker, Relgis understands the necessity of basing this progressive evolution on ever greater advances on the social and economic level. Such a philosophy won for him the persecution of four dictatorial regimes in his native country, and he finally arrived in Montevideo in 1947 as a political refugee. The impact of this thinker on an America thirsty for new horizons can be seen in the following statement by the Argentinian academician Arturo Capdevila : “You, Eugene Relgis, ought to be counted among the most meritorious travellers. You came, you saw and you understood. You understood with your penetrating vision a complex and vast reality. For that reason you have been able to give us with your book a brave and vital message. You can say from now on that you did not suffer in vain, gravely and deeply, the sorrows of the spirit. Your voice will be heard ; all of your lesson will be applied.” (From a letter to Eugene Relgis about his book, “Cultural Perspectives in South America”.) It is the projection to America of the vision of a writer who, as Stefan Zweig said in the prologue to “Muted Voices” : “struggles tirelessly for the great goal of spiritual fraternity.” II. In 1958 the University of Montevideo published an essay by Relgis dedicated solely to the problems of contemporary America. This book, “Cultural Perspectives in South Amer- 113 [pageend113]ioa”, received a prize from the Ministry of Public Education in that- same year and was greeted by Arturo Capdevila in the terms we have seen above. It contains in synthesis the message which Relgis, as an European intellectual, has brought to America. Relgis begins by clearly differentiating between “civilization” and “culture”. He shows that civilization is the transitory, temporal form which society adopts in each phase of its development, while culture is the basic intellectual, moral and artistic content which persists through the different changes which may take place in the civilization or external organization of a country or group of countries. The author suggests that the American continent has at present several types df civilization, but that a typically American culture or cultures had not yet developed. Nevertheless, he considers that America is an extremely fertile terrain for cultural creation, if American intellectuals know how to properly take advantage of its possibilities. And, within South America, Relgis asserts that Uruguay is the most probable country for this process to be initiated, that it is, in his words, “a country of the future”. In the first place, he believes that small countries are better able to conserve their spiritual independence from the lethal embrace of the large powers now struggling for the control of the world than the larger and more strategic nations, and that they may thus escape the tendency visible in these giants and their satellites toward the dehumanization and mechanization of life, antithesis of the humanistic ideals of Relgis. He feels that the small countries on the fringes of the cold war offer “persecuted man ... a refuge for his honest labor, in accord with his abilities, and allow him to recuperate his dignity as an individual and as a loyal comrade of ‘his brothers, his fellow human beings’.” (p. 87). But of even more importance for Relgis is the extensive mixture of Uruguay and of the entire continent, which seems to him to be likely to produce a new human type : “the type of integral man of whom we dream : healthy and strong in body, who enjoys the benefits of civilization and of nature, and whose intelligence can develop without the bonds of a superrefined culture, without the terrors of a mentality 114 [pageend114]enslaved by dogmas, tyrannical ideologies or ancestral superstitions.” (p. 64). This “integral man” of Relgis resembles the “cosmic race” of the Mexican philosopher Vasconcelos, but I believe that Relgis’ concept is more universal, as can be seen in the following description of the kind of culture which he hopes will be created by the new American man : “It is for that reason that I believe in the future of America. Not as the specific manifestation of a certain period and of certain nation, but as a healthier and more harmonious development of universal culture, as the most varied manifestation of a humanized science and art, which were too confined in the laboratories and museums of Europe.” (p. 60). In other words, the cultural mission of America consists in a careful selection of the eternal and universal values of Europe and their assimilation into American cultural life in order to create typically American values that later, transcending the limits of this continent, will carry their message of peace and fraternity to the entire world. Such is the vision of Relgis, who dreams of the renaissance of European culture by way of this hemisphere. This is the essence of the message contained in this work : “Through the neohumanism which we believe to have discovered in some American cultural centers, and above all in our refuge which is Uruguay, it is possible to return to Europe at least a part of its own ancient values, falsified or destroyed by its national, civil and imperialist wars, by all of its authoritarian, absolutist, anticultural and antihuman regimes. . . Paying our debt to Europe, we serve, through her, all of Humanity.” (p. 101- 2). And Relgis recalls in this regard the prophecy of the German biologist George F. Nicolai, now a professor of the University of Santiago de Chile, made to him in Berlin more than thirty years ago: “The new Europe will return to us by way of South America!” (p. 56). But Relgis also sees several dangers which could cause the development of an authentic American and universal culture to fail. Of these dangers the most apparent is the plague of dictators and the political mentality, in the sectarian sense of the word : “Politics, with its petty, utilitarian mentality, and its oppressive and arbitrary procedures, infiltrates every area, even slipping under the doors of those social and huma- 115 [pageend115]nitarian institutions that proudly proclaim themselves to ho autonomous.” (p. 68). In order to counteract the pernicious influence of this tendency and avoid the disasters which Europe has suffered, intelligent social action is necessary to create conditions favorable to free research : “We only point out that the first condition for freedom of conscience and all of the practical freedoms which spring from it, is to avoid the errors of fanaticism, the oppression of all political and ecclesiastical, educational, ethical or even esthetieal dogmatisms. . . The superstitions and fetichisms from above, created and sustained by the ruling classes, are more tenacious and harmful [than those of the people].” (p. 96-7). Another danger that the author points out is the tendency toward the mechanization and dehumanization of life, analyzed already by Ortega y Gasset and many other modern thinkers, with the consequent destruction of all the values prized by Relgis. In order to combat this tendency, as well as the traditional evil of authoritarianism in all of its aspects, a new humanist and dynamic ideology capable of making the intellectuals an effective force in the struggle is imperative. And Relgis considers that the ideas of the Uruguayan writer José Enrique Rodó are fundamental in the elaboration of this philosophy : “We can consider Rodó a precursor of humanism in his country, and place him among the greatest humanists of our time, because he has given his concept an extension which embraces ethics and esthetics at the same time, without forgetting that the point of departure of all idealism is the individual who develops himself, freely, on the double plane of knowledge and action.” (p. 38-9). Relgis believes that this neohumanist philosophy based on the individual is already being elaborated in Latin America, and that it parallels his own philosophical concept, “integral humanism” : “To us, this neohumanism means integral humanism, which is based on the consciousness which man should have of his position in the whole of nature; of the relations between the individual and his species, in time and space ; of the interdependence of social groupings ; and, in short, of the peaceful means which should he employed in an atmosphere of solidarity to foment his own creative evolution. These means, these ‘arms’ of combat are : freedom which has 116 [pageend116]no other limits than those of the freedom of others, and love which knows how to discern, which in the diversity of the manifestations, of the forms and degrees of development, searches always for that which unites harmoniously and not that which divides and impels us toward an abyss of hatred and slaughter.” (p. 92-3). It is especially in Uruguay that Relgis feels that he has discovered the most propicious ground lor this cultural elaboration. The process has begun, but the dangers are many. Therefore, Relgis advises prudence to Latin America in the road it has undertaken: “Don’t europeanize yourselves, that is: don’t adopt the bad habits of intolerance and of violence of our unfortunate Europe. And on the other hand, don’t americanize yourselves excessively, that is : don’t become slaves of the mechanization of the North, and of that false moral based on Profit that counts the minutes of commercialized time and judges the value of a man by his material possessions. ” (p. 65). Such is, in brief, the message which Relgis, fleeing from the persecutions and dogmatism of his beloved Europe, has brought to the Spanish-speaking peoples of this hemisphere. Clearly it contains much which we, perhaps more than they, need carefully to consider as we try to devise a valid set of values in opposition to the negative currents of our civilization. William Rose 117 [pageend117]SADEQ TSCHÜBAK *) *) See Arena No. 12. for his short story : The Toy Horse. Der zeitgenössische persische Prosaist Sadeq Tschü- bak wurde im Juni 1916 in Buschehr geboren, kam dann nach Schiraz, der Heimatstadt seiner Mutter wo er die Volksschule besuchte. Ab 1930 lebt er in Teheran und absolvierte dort das American College. Zur Zeit ist er Direktor des Bibliothek der Staatlichen Iranischen Öl-Gesellschaft (National Iranian Oil Company) in Teheran. Tschübak ist verheiratet. Seine beiden Söhne gehen in Wellington (England) zur Schule. Er selbst weilte von Juni 1959 bis Juni 1960 in England und war auch vier Monate long Gast der Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass., USA, wo er den dortigen Iranisten Richard N. Frye zum Freunde gewann. Aus diesen Daten geht hervor, dass Tschübak zu jener Schichte junger intellektueller des heutigen Iran gehört, denen sich die Welt des Westens in ihrer angelsächsischen Prägung erschlossen hat. Schon im Alter von zwölf Jahren begann er, sich schriftstellerisch zu üben. Literarisches Ansehen errang er dann durch seine 1945 zu Teheran erschienene Novellensammlung Kheime-je schebbäzl (Marionettentheater), die 1955 eine zweite Auiflage erlebte. Ihr entnommen ist die Erzählung Mard dar Quafes (Der Mann im Käfig),d ie unter dem Titel „Der Aristokrat und das Tier“ von Rudolf Gelpke ins Deutsche übersetzt worden ist (St. Gallen, Tschudy-Verlag, 1961). Im Jahre 1950 erschien (Druckerei des Institut Irano-Français zu Teheran im Jahre 1328 sch.) der nach einer darin veröffentlichten Novelle benannte Band Antarï ke Lütisch morde büd (Das Aeffchen des toten Gauklers). Dieses Buch enthält neben der Titelnovelle noch die Erzählungen Quafes (Der Käfig) und Tscherä Darjä tüfäni schode büd (Warum ist das Meer stürmisch geworden?) sowie einen Einakter Tüp-e lâstïkï (Der Gummiball). Wie so viele junge Perser, denen die erstarrten Formen des schiitischen Islam nichts mehr zu sagen haben, 118 [pageend118]auf die die skeptische Haltung eines Teiles der grössten Dichter der persischen Klassik ihre Wirkung nicht verhehlt hat, deren Herz aber voll Mitgefühl für die breite Masse des in Elend und Armut lebenden persischen Volkes brennt, neigte Tschübak in seiner Jugend jedçn Idealen zu, von deren Erfüllung man sich eine nationale und soziale Wiedergeburt erwartete. Es ist kein Wunder, dass viele Intellektuelle und Literaten überzeugt waren, ihre Ideale auch auf politischer Ebene durchsetzen zu müssen, und sich daher solchen politischen Strömungen und Gebilden zuwandten, die noch am ehesten Erfolg zu erringen fähig erschienen. Es wäre nun falsch, alle diese Sozialreformer und Sozialethiker zu Kommunisten zu erklären. Zwischen diesen Intellektuellen, die auf dem durch den nationalen Liberalismus der zwanziger Jahre unseres Jahrhunderts vorbereiteten Boden stehen, gibt es eine Unmenge kleiner Unterschiede. Neben linientreuen Marxisten parsischer Prägung gibt es solche, die eine weltanschauliche Weiterentwicklung und Wandlung in sich erlebten und Sozialisten und Liberale im besten und ursprünglichen Sinne wurden. Man darf den Ehrlichen und Anständigen dieser Generation Irans, die, von Macht- und Besitzgier umtobt angesichts der erschreckenden sozialen Spannungen einen geistigen Mehrfrontenkrieg führen muss, die gegen die Korruption, die darin liegende Versuchung und gegen eine tatenlose Resignation zu kämpfen hat, Anerkennung und Verständnis nicht versagen und muss sich vor voreiligen Urteilen hüten. Es wird daher nicht erstaunen, dass wir Sadeq Tschübak zunächts unter den Mitarbeitern der literarischästhetischen Monatsschrift Mardom (Das Volk) der Tüde-Partei finden, von wo er jedoch bald zu dem undoktrinären. politisch ungebundenen Literatenkreis um Sädeq Hedäjat (1903-51) stösst. Tschübak verehrt Sädeq Hedäjat ausserordentlich, dessen Einfluss auf ihn noch heute unverkennbar ist und sich sogar auf Dinge erstreckt, die manchem als Äusserlichkeit erscheinen mögen, auf die Liebe zum Tiere und das sich daraus 119 [pageend119]ergebende Vegetariertum. Auch die Haltung Tschübaks zur Sprache verrät, wenn nicht Abhängigkeit, so doch Gleichgesinntheit mit Sädeq Hedäjat. Die junge Literatengeneration des heutigen Iran will die Fesseln sprengen, die ihr die Dichtung der persischen Klassik und vor allem deren Epigonen mit starren Formen und überbetontem Ästhetizismus angelegt haben. Die persische Dichtung der Vergangenheit, möge sie noch so erhabene Blüten getrieben haben, scheint mit ihrer traditionellen Thematik und ihrer Ueberbetonung der äusseren Form dem Zeitgefühl der Jungen nicht mehr zu entsprechen. Neue literarische Formen, wie Novelle und Roman, treten auf den Plan, Naturalismus im Inhalt und Realismus in der Sprache setzen sich durch. An der Spitze dieser Bewegung steht zweifellos der überaus fruchtbare Sädeq Hedäjat, den so mancher Vertreter der älteren Generation noch nicht recht anerkennen will. Gewiss, Sädeq Hedäjat schreckt in seinem literarischen Schaffen vor keinem Abgrund menschlicher Armseligkeit und Unvollkommenheit zurück, ja er betont vielleicht gelegentlich zu sehr das Negative, das Kranke, die Ausweglosigkeit. In seiner Darstellung benutzt er vorzüglich die Umgangssprache und sogar die Sprache des städtischen Proletariats bewusst und vielleicht auch unbewusst. Der bekannte Herausgeber der Zeitschrift Sokhan Parwiz N. Khänläri sagte mir, dass Sädeq Hedäjat sprachlich gelegentlich sogar Fehler mache, ein Dienstboten-Persisch schreibe, weil er als Kind aus gutem Hause, viel den Dienstboten überlassen es eben von diesen gelernt habe, was dem künstlerischen und literarischen Wert seines Schaffens allerdings keinen Abbruch tue. Aber Sädeq Hedäjat geht über den Gebrauch dieses Umgangspersischen hinaus, wenn er die Leute des Volkes Mundart sprechen lässt mit all den Eigenarten der Wort-und Satzlehre. Er scheut auch nicht davor zurück, Bauern in ihrer heimatlichen Mundart ohne irgendwelche Glättungen, reden zu lasen, auch auf die Gefahr hin, von der grossen Mehrheit seiner intellektuellen Leser nicht verstanden zu werden. Darüber setzt sich eben Sädeq Hedäjat hinweg, ohne zu be120 [pageend120]denken, dass selbst der Durchschnittsperser bei der Lektüre einiger seiner Erzählungen ein Dialekt oder Argot-WÖrter buch benutzen müsste, um alles zu verstehen. Inhaltlich und formal folgt Tschübak dem von ihm verehrten Sädeq Hedäjat fast zu sehr. Vera Kubicková schreibt (in J. Rypka, Iranische Literaturgeschichte, Leipzig 1959, Seite 397: "Nach Hedäjats Vorbild bedient sich Tschübak der Volkssprache, doch finden wir bei ihm oft Uebertreibungcn, z. B. wenn er Leute in vulgärer Sprache sprechen lässt, die sich in Wirklichkeit einer solchen niemals bedienen würden. In seinen späteren Novellen findet Tschübak manchmal an grobem Naturalismus Gefallen, was seiner literarischen Entwicklung keinesfalls nützlich ist.” Soweit Vera Kubicková. Wir sehen hier zweifellos die Verbindungslinien, die von Sadeq Tschübak zu Sadek Hedäjat führen. Vielleicht liegt in diesem Verhalten die Absicht umschlossen, neue Wege der Betrachtung und des Ausdruckes mit Hilfe einer Schockwirkung der jungen Generation nahezubringen. Man erinnert sich dabei unwillkürlich des Stiles moderner Maler des Westens, die den Spiesser schockieren wollen, „pour épater le bourgeois“. Doch all das ist eine innere persische Angelegenheit, und es wäre an- massend, als Ausländer hier hineinzureden, zumal man überzeugt sein kann, dass auch bei Tschübak, dem vielversprechenden Schriftsteller sich der gärende Wein klären wird. Es war ein strahlender Herbsttag, der 20. September 1961, als ich in den gegen das Gebirge zu liegenden Vorort Teherans. Golhak, fuhr, um Sädeq Tschübak zu besuchen. Es ist, wie immer in Teheran, nicht ganz leicht, in den Aussenbezirken dieser schnellwüchsigen Stadt eine bestimmte Strasse und ein bestimmtes Haus zu finden. Da öffnet sich ein grosses Gartentor in einer nicht zu breiten, wie üblich in den Wohnbezirken der Umgebung, von Mauern umsäumten Gasse. Es ist das Haus Tschübaks. Ein entzückender, mittelgrosser Garten liegt hier vor dem Hause. Er sieht ganz europäisch in der Anlage aus mit seinen Früchte tragenden Zwergobstbäumen. Hier ist der Garten nicht ein Teil des vor dem 121 [pageend121]fremden Auge verborgenen eigentlichen Wohnbereiches. Es kam mir fast symbolhaft vor, dass Tschübaks Garten frei und offen den Gast begrüsste, offen für den. der in die Welt Tschübaks eintritt. An der Rückseite des Gartens steht des Schriftsteller geschmackvolles Einfamilienhaus, dessen Vorderseite aus einem vom Boden bis zum Dache reichenden grossen Fenster besteht. Vor dem Hause empfängt: mich Tschübak. Er ist von kräftiger, untersetzter Gestalt. Sein lebhaftes Mienenspiel kann der graumelierte kurze Volbart nicht verbergen. Tschübak trägt ein dunkelblaues Buschhemd mit kurzen Aermeln. Höflich, bestimmt und sportgestählt tritt mir Tschübak entgegen. Er ist kein orientalischer Typ er erinnert etwas an einen Künstler, der einen in seiner Villa an der Côte d’Azur empfängt. Dieser Eindruck wird noch verstärkt, wenn man das hohe Gartenzimmer betritt, wo man Tschübaks charmante junge Frau be- grüsst. Fast die ganze Rückwand dieses Zimmers wird von einem Kamin eingenommen, die Wand selbst besteht aus Klinkerziegeln. Eine Decke besitzt das Zimmer nicht, es ragt hinauf bis in das steile Dach. Sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet und geschmückt macht der Raum den Eindruck eines Künstlerateliers. Es wird von der Hausfrau Tee gereicht. Dazu gibt es eine Art Weissbrot, dann herrliches Obst und schliesslich Whisky-Soda. Tschübak lässt den Plattenspieler leise Chopin spielen, den er besonders liebt. Ich sehe, hier bedarf es nicht langer Einleitungsformein. Das Gespräch kommt schnell in Gang. Er schildert in Kürze den äusseren Ablauf seines Lebens, erzählt, dass er früher gerne Anatole France und André Gide gelesen habe. Seine ihm zur Zeit liebsten Schriftsteller des Auslandes, die ihm zum Teil über des Englische zugänglich geworden sind, seien aber Dostojewski], Tolstoj, Thomas Mann, James Joyce, William Faulkner und Jean-Paul Sartre. Grossen Eindruck habe auf ihn Alfred Döblins Werk „Berlin Alexanderplatz“ gemacht. Mit der Nennung dieser Namen hat Tschübak viel von seinem wahren Wesen und Streben offenbart: Gesellschaftskritik, die soziale Frage und die nach der 122 [pageend122]Existenz, das sind die vorzüglichsten Probleme der jungen Generation Persiens. Hierzu passt die Antwort Tschübaks auf die Frage, welche Dichter der persischen Klassik ihm besonders nahestünden: der Satiriker und Gesellschaftskritiker des 14. Jahrhunderts Obeld Säkänl und der als Dichter eigentlich vom Westen für Persien neu entdeckte Omar Khajjäm (12. Jahrhundert). Das für seine Zeit erstaunliche Freidenkertum und die tiefe Skepsis, die sich in seinen Vierzeilern kundtun, scheinen dem Geschmack der junger Generation Persiens besonders zu entsprechen. Das Bedenkliche daran ist, dass die Skepsis der Wurm ist, der an der Tat und Schaffenskraft nagt und die hellsten Geister zur Untätigkeit verleitet. Tschübak gesteht, dass er zu den zeitgenössischen persischen Schriftstellern eigentlich kein rechtes Verhältnis finden kann, ihn kein einziger mitzureissen vermag. Nur Sädeq Hedäjat ist ihm teuer, zu dessen Kreise or gehörte, ebenso wie Bozorg Alawi, der heute als politischer Emigrant im sowjetzonalen Deutschland lebt und an der Humboldt-Universität in Ost-Berlin wirkt. Tschübak gibt zu verstehen, dass er von Alawis literarischer Begabung viel hält, und sagt, dass es ihn tief berühre, wie Bozorg Alawi in Berlin an Heimweh leide. Wir kommen nun auf Tschübaks eigene schriftstellerische Tätigkeit zu sprechen. Er verfasste neben den europäischen Literatur, übersetzte auf dem Umweg über das Englische auch Carlo Collodis Kinderbuch Pin- nocchio. Tschübak, über seine nächsten literarischen Pläne befragt, erklärt: “im Manuskript liegt druckfertig vor ein Roman, an dem ich vierzehn Jahre gearbeitet habe.” — Er holt und zeigt mir das dicke Manuskript. — “Der Roman trägt den Titel Sang-e Sabür (Stein der Geduld). Ich will ihn aber zur Zeit nicht veröffentlichen. Habe ich doch darin meine innersten und echtesten Gefühle und Gedanken ausgesprochen. Die gegenwärtigen Zeitläufte lassen es aber nicht zu, diese preiszugeben. Doch ist auch ein weiterer Roman fertig, der im Veriag der Zeitschrift Sokhan erscheinen soll.” Nun kommt die Rede auf die Sprache. Tschübak [pageend123]sagt, dass er ganz bewusst die Umgangssprache verwende, die Sprache, die man wirklich spricht. Er müsse allerdings zugeben, dass es für einen Ausländer schwierig sein müsse, davon alles zu verstehen. Die Höflichkeit verbot es mir, zu erwidern, das auch manche Perser nicht alle Ausdrücke dieser Umgangssprache oder wie sie scherzhaft sagen, dieser Unterweltsprache verstünden. Tschübak erzählte aber mit einem gewissen Stolz, dass der englische Philologe J. A. Boyle zu seiner Novelle Antari ke Lütiech morde büdsich ein eigenes Glossar habe anlegen müssen. Die Rede kommt auf die Religion. Tschübek erklärt sich ein Atheist. Schon als Kind seien ihm der Islam und jede konfessionelle Bindung ein Greuel gewesen. Kurz darauf zeigt er aber seine Verehrung für den grossen muslimischen Mystiker und Dichter des 13. Jahrhunderts, Dschaläloddin Rümi, Moulawï wie ihn die Perser nennen. Mag sein, dass Tschübak in Moulawï einen Kämpfer gegen das Althergebrachte erkennt, dass er in der historischen islamischen Mystik ein Rückzugsgebiet des Menschen vor der staatlichen Tyrannei und dem damals herrschenden Feudalismus sieht, eine Deutung, die der bekannten ‘‘gesellschaftswissenschaftlichen” Ideologie nicht fremd ist. Als er aber voll Entzücken die Szene aus Moulawis Diwan erwähnt, wo der Freund an der Türe des Geliebten pocht und ihm, als er auf die Frage : ‘‘Wer ist es?” mit „Ich” antwortet, die Türe verschlossen bleibt, und sie ihm erst geöffnet wird, als er auf die gleiche Frage antwortet : “Du”, da glaubt man doch, dass den “Atheisten” Tschübak ein Hauch der Unio mystica umweht haben muss. Er blieb auch die Antwort auf die Frage schuldig, wie er seinen Atheismus mit der Verehrung der Ideenwelt dieses Heiligen und Dichters in Einklang bringen könne. Tschübak ist eine kämpferische Natur, er reizt zum Widerspruch und verlangt auch nach ihm. Er bedarf seiner und wächst an ihm. Ich hatte den Eindruck, einer starken künstlerischen Persönlichkeit begegnet zu sein, als ich ihm dankbar die Hand zum Abschied drückte. Herbert W. Duda 124 [pageend124]NOTES AND REVIEWS THE MODERN POLISH MIND, an anthology, edited by Maria Kuncewicz. Little. Brown and Co.. 1962. The anthology is the least satisfactory kind of book that reader or reviewer is likely to meet in what are supposed to be his hours of leisure. It has, generally speaking, at least one compiler. And, as a general rule, compilers are merely human beings like you and me— no inspired ‘artists’ with visions of beatitude or what have-you: plain mortals, they are no less prejudiced than we readers. And : more often than not, we readers cannot divest ourselves of the vestiges of humanity left to us in the process of reading someone else’s work, our prejudices rise and clash with those of the compiler— even though we are no experts as they are. We like to have opinions on everything under the sun; the book in the hand contributes a dangerous sense of superiority : we think we have a right to an opinion, and act as if we had. Verification cannot, of course, exist in such matters. There is confirmation (of suspicions, or presumed knowledge), there is enchantment, there is the occasional revelation—or;the disappointment and anger, concomitants of injured precognition. These are the extremes; in the middle territory there are the infinite variations of shaded responses, all of them personal, difficult to defend and, apart from demonstrable quantities, difficult to defend. Mme Kuncewicz’s concern is with the Modern Polish Mind: and judging by appearances, she is scholarly, comprehensive and judicious as well. Her translations are businesslike, readable, compelling even in small, irregular doses. If there is trouble (and mentioning it demonstrates the reviewer’s inconstancy) it is her comprehensiveness. The book gives you what it promises— a picture of the Modern Polish Mind. I must be humble 125 [pageend125]and speak in the first person : I think I have had an image in my mind when these words first cast themselves into my consciousness by glaring at me from the dust-wrapper: I have had my expectations confirmed. Newspapers, the Sunday highbrow variety, created what was an expectancy,—reports on the radio, talks with friends and “experts” suggested shadowy images: Mme Kuncewicz confirms. The evidence arrives in snippets and chunks, in carved up bits and in small units. The picture that emerges is the picture of a Nation : as an historical document, centuries hence, this will be an invaluable book. But is it a book? It is not what I expect when I sit down to read: the continuous excitement from cover to cover that meeting men means. Her book is without men. The individuality, the obsession of the single individual does not emerge from her pages: instead, you have the community and the communal obsessions. Now : these—being part of my days— do not interest me at all when expressed in the terms of communities. And this is highly personal. I go to the printed word because it permits my worm-mind to gnaw to the apple-core of the dead, the great, or the familiar. When I read Propertius, I am meeting ghosts he saw in his mind. When faced with Mme Kuncewicz’s anthology I meet the faces of men—hidden by newspapers they hold up to cover their features from me. They cannot reveal themselves : they travel in the hurried train of history—some bored, some afraid of mingling with their fellow-passengers—some merely hidden by the crowds, but: all of them visible through headlines only. And there have been so many headlines in the twentieth century. This is a book, for the time being at any rate, for students of head-lines—one, however, that is true (and that is a rarity): this saves it. It will live. There are not many true books. J. C. Arkay 126 [pageend126]THE WINE OF ETERNITY. Short stories by Knuts Lesins. Published by the University of Minnesota Press, U.S.A. Knuts Lesins was born in 1909. Both his parents were artistically inclined, and he himself soon developed his two dominant interests : music and literature. After graduating from the Latvian State Conservatory in Riga with a degree in music, Knuts Lesins taught at the State School of Music and later held the post of Assistant Director (Dramatist) at the National Opera, Riga. He has written numerous musical compositions and taken part in many concerts. Now, in exile (Minneapolis), he earns his living by giving piano lessons. Along with his interest in music there has always been his interest in literature. He read widely the German, Russian, French, and English classics. He worked as a literary and art critic for various Latvian papers. His first story was accepted for publication in 1929, and from then onwards his work was much published in Latvia. His first volume of short stories came out in 1938 and was followed by his first novel in 1943. Since then, 5 more volumes of short stories, 2 novels and a volume of poetry have been brought out by Latvian publishers in Germany, Sweden, or the United States. Until The Wine of Eternity, none of his work had been translated into English. The 15 short stories in this book have been selected from various volumes of his short stories; 12 of them have been translated by Ruth Speirs and 3 by Haralds Kundzins. Knuts Lesins had put down firm roots; he had become established in the Latvian literary world as a writer of considerable promise. Then everything was cut short by the war. In 1944, when the Russians invaded Latvia for the second time, he went into exile. He had to start life all over again. That is a 127 [pageend127]very difficult thing to do, and one requires great inner resources to do it. Knuts Lesins has these resources. There is no hint of bitterness, resentment, hatred, or self-pity in any of his writing. There is no emotional distortion. Instead, there is a balance, a quietness, a tranquil acceptance of life. This acceptance of life might be illustrated from two stories in the present volume : One-Day Land and, on a much serious level, The Dove. The story One-Day Land may perhaps best be called a fable for grown-ups. A student, working hard for his examinations, is overcome by such desperate loneliness that he falls in love with a beautiful young lady depicted in a cheap oilprint which hangs on the wall. He calls her Iza and conducts imaginary conversations with her. Suddenly, one morning, he wakes up in a beautiful strange town. Soldiers march by, a band plays, people cheer. The soldiers are going to war. but they carry antiquated weapons and are clearly no match for anybody. Yet a young lieutenant cries confidently: “Tomorrow we shall win a great victory! Right is on our side!”—A poet exclaims joyfully: “My new book of poems has come out today!” The student looks at them. They are pretty poor, and he asks about reviews. Reviews? Tomorrow! “The critics can’t possibly fail to realize that I’m a genius!”—And there is Iza, lovely and affectionate. “Tomorrow,” she says, “after you’ve passed your examinations, we’ll celebrate our engagement!” They kiss . . . He wakes up, in the same town. There are the soldiers, the lieutenant, the poet, Iza; the day passes exactly like the one before.—In the end, he again wakes up, and everything happens all over again. Eventually the student discovers that he is in One- Day Land where people perpetually re-live the happiest day of their lives. It is the land of dream and evasion, where hopes and expectations run high and achievement is just round the corner. One-Day Land is a rejection of life itself: a rejection of loss as a counterbalance to gain, 128 [pageend128]a rejection of suffering as a counterbalance to happiness, a rejection of struggle as a pre-condition to achievement. The young student who had, as it were, flirted with escapism, flirted with Iza, is horrified when his daydream threatens to become lasting reality. No thinking person can remain in such a fools’ paradise for long. The story, thus stripped to its bare bones, may sound rather slight. But it is quite a longish story, full of delightful detail, written with a very pleasing sense of humour—though with underlying seriousness throughout. The Dove is a very serious story, written in Lesins’ typically quiet, unspectacular manner, yet full of delicate nuances and psychological insight. The hero’s character is built up so unobtrusively that we are hardly aware of how it was done. But it was done with such sure mastery that when the climax comes we completely believe in its inevitability. The Dove goes much further than One-Day Land. In One-Day Land we see a man who prefers his. precarious existence to a state of happy non-existence. In The Dove we see a man who actually finds the meaning and purpose of his life in the midst of disaster, destruction, death. And, even more: he not only assumes responsibility for his own life, but takes upon himself the responsibility of protecting the broken lives of others—of strangers whom he has never seen, and never will see. The time is August 1944. The war is again sweeping across Latvia, with the Russians driving the Germans before them. In the midst of chaos and destruction, we meet the hero of the story: uprooted, alone, utterly bereft. I do not think it accidental that he has not even a name in the story. He is “a man” or ‘‘the man” or “the man with the bandaged foot”. Seldom has there been a hero so ordinary, so unpretentious and unheroic. The man comes upon a beautiful old farmstead which 129 [pageend129]has escaped destruction. But he finds it deserted. Everything is in disorder. The owners have left in a great hurry. A clock is calmly ticking on the wall. There still is some food in the larder. Smiling, at peace, the man finally covers himself with the farmer’s sheepskin coat and sleeps in the farmer’s own bed. It is not safe to stay on the farm. Yet he stays. His sense of belonging increases; he discovers roots to which he can attach himself. Out of a first vague feeling' of gratitude for the shelter the farmstead has afforded him, there grows his feeling of responsibility for the deserted farm. German soldiers arrive, looking for loot; when they start rifling the bee-hives the man is impelled to interfere, to protect life from destruction. He assumes full responsibility. He does not contradict the Germans when they think he is the master of the farm. He stays another night. By now he looks an even less heroic figure: not only does he limp, but his face is ridiculously swollen with bee-stings. Russian soldiers arrive. Again, he does not contradict them when they assume he is the master of the farm. Here is a very brutal experience. Yet, again, the man feels impelled to interfere, to protect life from destruction. By the irony of fate, it is not a human being he saves but a dove. In saving life, he loses his own. But he has found himself; he has found the meaning and purpose of his life. Several stories in the present volume have then- setting in the Latvian countryside, and some of the characters behave in what might seem a paradoxical fashion. Yet these actions are natural and logical to the person concerned: they are anchored in all that makes him what he is. With a very sure touch, Lesins renders those country people entirely convincing. He shows their lavish, stubborn hospitality (The Fiery Descent of Old Koris), their shrewd humour and buffoonery in the face of danger (The Tailor and the Wolves), their dark, tragic entanglements (The Secret; A String of Beads), and their pride (In the Blizzard). The theme of In the Blizzard is particularly interesting. 130 [pageend130]Here, a farmer, motivated by overweening pride and a craving for spectacular revenge (having an audience in the apprehensive members of his household, and the prospect of amazing- the whole neighbourhood), decides to hand his wife over to her lover, and to do so in style. He not only lavishes a “dowry” on her but provides her also with his best sleigh to which his own favourite mare is harnessed. A pathetic, frightened human creature, she huddles in the sleigh as he whips up the horse and drives her through the blizzard towards her young lover’s farm. The moment of truth comes to the husband when he despairingly realizes he is driving his own happiness away. But, caught in the trap of his pride, no freedom of action is any longer possible to him. Pride is a theme Lesins has used as convincingly elsewhere. In the story An Ordinary Man — published in Arena No. 4 — a student makes a practice of feigning to be a potential suicide in order to get sympathy and money out of people. He has the misfortune to employ this ruse with a man who happens to have criminal tendencies. There comes the terrible moment when, out of pride (and having an audience in the man who is to push him off the parapet), the student cannot go back on his word and drops to his death in the river below. The best story in this volume, apart from The Dove. is the title story, The Wine of Eternity. Indeed, I would go so far as to call it Lesins’ masterpiece. It is a tale of olden times, and the dated, ceremonius dialogue fits it like a glove. Everything in The Wine of Eternity — dialogue, lyrical passages, sad or macabre happenings —is tempered with a finely poised, benevolently ironical humour. The fusion of humour and serious purpose is entirely irresistible. Nebeda, the central figure of the story, constantly seeking to fathom the purpose of life, is unable to take pleasure in anything whatever. He gets involved with rather startling characters, some of them wonderfully funny, and is caught up m fantastic situations as he searches for the purpose of experience, not realizing that the purpose is the ex131 [pageend131]perience, and that experience has its own validity. In the end, having gone full circle, he finds what he has sought. For this story (and The Dove) it would already be worth buying the whole book. Ruth Speirs Paul Tabori: THE ART OF FOLLY. Prentice-Hall International, Inc. London. 21/- In his preface, George Mikes recounts that Paul Tabori was known in Budapest before the war as “a most prolific translator of poetry from English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Greek, Latin and Persian.” This, in itself, is most impressive. But it is only the beginning. What follows is quite staggering. George Mikes informs us that in twenty years Paul Tabori has written “twenty novels, a book of short stories, three books for children and some ten volumes ranging from biography to psychic research and from history to sociology. This list, however, leaves unmentioned several hundred film and television scripts; several thousand articles; some original and translated poetry; and a religious drama.” And now he has written yet another book: The Art of Folly. If it were a slipshod, sketchy piece of work one might understand how it is that Tabori gets so much done. But he never is slipshod, he never is sketchy; and the phenomenon “Paul Tabori” will ever remain a mystery to ordinary mortals like myself. Even the bibliography is formidable: his researches into the “art of folly” have led him to consult no less than 120 books. (Some of them sound absolutely tantalizing, and one envies Tabori for actually having read them—such as G. W. Corvinus’ Useful, Curious and Amorous Women’s Encyclopaedia of 1719, and Dr. C. T. 132 [pageend132]E. Reinharďs Untersuchung der Frage: Ob unsere ersten Uraltem, Adam und Eva, einen Nabel gehabt, of 1752.) Tabori divides his book into three parts, three aspects of human weakness: Fad, Fashion, and Folly. A fad may be a passing craze, a harmlessly foolish mania, but it may also bring untold misery and even death in its wake. Among the fads, Tabori lists duelling—which has cost many lives, and which even spread to “a field near Paneras” where two distinguished London ladies, having quarrelled at cards, fought a duel with pistols on August 12th, 1774. And in 1812, General Thornton and Theodore Hook fought a duel over that new-fangled dance, the waltz: Thornton doted on it, but Hook opined that it led to “the most licentious consequences.” Tabori describes a pre-war Mensur, a students’ duel, in the gymnasium of the Friedrich Wilhelm University, Berlin. Naked to the waist, the students slashed at each other’s faces and bodies. “Soon all six were covered with blood; one of them fainted and was removed, accompanied by contemptuous laughter.” The purpose: to test courage and to acquire scars, “the highest symbol of virility”. It is disturbing to compare Tabori’s description with a recent article in the Sunday Times (10. 3. 1963). Student duelling was re-introduced in West Germany in 1953; West Berlin Free University has its own duelling chamber; 25.000 students already belong to duelling fraternities. The article describes the 3-foot swords ground to razor sharpness to give deep cuts; the gashes must be taken without flinching “while the blood from the wound covers the floor.” The purpose : to strengthen the character by "overcoming the inner pigdog.” Let us pass on from flowing blood to flowing tears. Tabori is delightfully commonsensical about the fashionable craze (started by The Sorrows of Werther) of lovers shedding torrents of tears—over letters, over books, over each other, over locks of hair. Lotte dissolved in tears, reading Ossian; Werther, “not to be outdone, 133 [pageend133]was wracked with sobs.” Tabori peacefully remarks: “Their tears mingled, which perhaps would not have happened had they known that Ossian never existed and that his laments were forged by James Macpher- son.” After suicides and “Mammon’s maniacs”, Tabori deals with “quacks and quests”—and here he gives us the benefit of Dr. C. T. E. Reinhard’s scientific findings in Untersuchung der Frage : Oh unsere ersten Uraltem, Adam und Eva, einen Nahei gehabt (1752). No, they did not have a navel. (This had been satisfactorily established also by Sir Thomas Browne in his Pseudodoxia Epidemica, or Enquiries into Vulgar and Common Errors, 1646). Adam was not begotten but created; Eve was made from his rib. Therefore : no navels. Make no such vulgar error! Furthermore, thundered Dr. Reinhard, “whoever doubts this, is declared an unworthy member of the Church and is hereby handed to the Devil.” Tabori passes on to the fads of kings: Mahomet II who practised archery on his subjects; Victor Emanuel II who let the nail of his big toe grow and annually presented it, set in gold and diamonds, to his favourite mistress; Frederick William I who collected Lange Kerle, giant grenadiers; Charles William of Baden who kept a harem of 78 Gartenmägdlein, Garden Maidens clad in Hussar uniforms; etc. etc. — We come to the Roaring Twenties in England and, at that same time, to unspontaneous vice in Germany. “Germans took everything very seriously,” Tabori notes, “even in sexual excesses they had to remain tiefsinnig.” (What a wonderful word to use in this context: tiefsinnig'. It is typical of Tabori’s quiet wit and felicitous asides throughout his book.) In his Introduction, Paul Taboii recalls seeing in the Louvre a 4th century B.C. terra cotta statue of a Greek girl—and seeing, a week later, Parisiennes at St. Tropez wearing the same hair style, the identical hat, and scarves draped around the head in exactly the same manner. Nothing new under the sun!—Dealing very amusingly with fashions in “intimate and most inti134 [pageend134]mate” apparel and aids to beauty, Tabori eventually reaches the subject of trousers and has some astonishing things to tell. For instance, in 927 A.D., Archbishop Adalbert of Rheims had good reason to complain about the clergy : priests wore “trousers” six feet wide but utterly transparent. Dr. Faust, in the early 19th century, wrote a solemn pamphlet of 72 pages on the subject of trousers leading “to the degeneration of the human race and to the decline of population.” As Tabori succinctly puts it, “Dr. Faust’s recipe for improving the world and the general happiness was simply the abolition of trousers.” At the opposite end of the scale, there is Mr. G. Clifford Prout who has recently won supporters in New York, Dallas, Boston and Los Angeles for his campaign to provide decent clothes for naked animals such as horses, cattle, dogs, cats, etc. (Tabori notes that Mr. G. Clifford Prout has not yet disclosed his ideas of decent apparel for cows.) We may lightheartedly laugh at fads and fashions, but lolly is a different matter. We are none of us immune from folly, neither from that of others nor from our own, and the consequences are often disastrous. Tabori examines the follies of the wise and the not so wise, of spiritualists, dabblers in the occult, mediums, astrologers, politicians, and of the Orwellian world of Communism. Here, laughter ceases. There is nothing funny any more even in absurdities such as, for instance : “The most evil enemy of creative freedom is individualism” (Pravda) and “The possibilities of literary works are unlimited: they can freely praise our new society or freely criticize the old one” (Chang Hen- shui). Fads and fashions come and go, but folly—“the most cruel and most dangerous enemy of Man”—is deeply rooted in the human heart itself. “My prayer is not for heavenly grace,” says Paul Tabori, “but for a little understanding of our follies, yours and mine, so that we may gain a little wisdom and, through it, a little happiness.” Ruth Speirs 135 [pageend135]INVENTING THE FUTURE. By Denis Gabor. (Seeker & Warburg. 21s.) Mr. Gabor is a “physicist, engineer and inventor” and a Fellow of the Royal Society who is now a professor of “applied electronic physics” at London University. A Hungarian refugee, born in 1900, he takes his views from the progressive thinkers, from Russell and Haldane to Huxley and Koestler. Applying the “lines of index” test, we get Aldous Huxley 12, Koestler 7, Russell 7, Haldane 6, Keynes 6, and there are quotations from “Brave New World” and from “Island,” which I am glad to see he rates so highly. His book consists of a series of essays which read like articles in “Encounter” or “Polemic” but which when put together achieve both force and consistency and represent a diagnosis of what is really going on in the world today and what are the perils and possible satisfactions that lie ahead. It is because so many of us are vague about the nature of political, scientific and economic reality that I think we should read this book, which simplifies everything for the normally interested observer. Huxley, to whom the book is dedicated, could have done it better, but many others might have done it worse. What are the realities of the world in which we lieve? 1. The Threat of Nuclear War. 2. Overpopulation. 3. The problem of leisure (consequent on solving 1 and 2). Mr Gabor, incidentally, admits the militant adolescent nationalism of new countries as a problem, but only because these countries are exploited by the two rival Powers for strategical reasons. In other words, if America and Russia could agree, then both could apply the remedy to adolescent nationalism—which is capital investment in and technological development of the poorer countries—without delay. A graver problem is China, which has the determination and man-power to become a Great Power without as yet the industrial potential. China is the most dangerous of the “have-nots” and may develop an equal 136 [pageend136]hostility to both the great “haves”, or even drive them into each other’s arms, although this could be a very slow process, as we can see with India. What has Mr Gabor to say about the cold war? On the whole he is reassuring; he believes the two great Powers are like two large dogs each with a bone growling and snarling at each other but undisposed to fight, because each must know of the terrible retaliatory power they possess even after a surprise atomic attack. What a poor consolation it is to know that we shall sting though we be dead! Let us call this the after-kill to match the new word over-kill. Here I think Mr Gabor makes a mistake. He assumes that the rising birthrate in France and Italy is a proof that the ordinary people of the West are not upset by sabrerattling speeches from East and West. (This was not the case in 1939). But I do not attribute this to heroic self-confidence, only to the total lack of imagination of most people about the Bomb. What really happens when the Russians detonate a bomb of more than fifty megatons in Nova Zemlya? How very few of us have the faintest inkling or can imagine what is really entailed by Khrushchev’s estimate that three of these would suffice for Britain and five for France. As Mr Gabor points out, it is only the complexity of the atomic device necessary as a fuse to the hydrogen bomb which prevents the latter being made by many more nations. However, as Russia becomes more prosperous and as it catches up industrially with the U.S.A., it cannot fail to become less aggressive, argues Mr Gabor, and so less ideologically bitter. So far, Mr Gabor’s views might have been expressed by many other publicists; but as he tackles the more scientific problems, such as over-population, food supplies, the dwindling fuel sources on the planet, with oil and coal on their way out and iron and copper disappearing, he is more original if only because he is so lucid. This leads him on to “The Challenge to Technology.” “Men and Machines” and his last two chapters, “The Paradise of the Common Man” and “The Future 137 [pageend137]of Uncommon Man ” His argument is that the machine must eventually create a world of leisure in which the real problem is how to repel boredom and give humanity a sense of purpose. He looks back longingly to the large family living in a large house, to the age of gifted craftsmen and dedicated scientists, inventors and artists. His Utopias make stimulating reading because they follow logically from his earlier analysis. For this reason “Inventing the Future” is a heartening book. It enables us to see how ephemeral the world’s present troubles really are. If the American lamblion could only lie down with the Russian lion- lamb the world could get on with the job of removing privation and inequality. This would not automatically produce happiness but, by minimising poverty and hate, it would provide the conditions for happiness for the many while still encouraging the few to surpass themselves. The detailed notes which follow are also full of interest. We learn of the brilliant Soviet writer of science fiction, Yefremov, whose “Andromeda Nebula” sounds as if it ought to be translated; of the difference (according to the McCords) between the homes which produce alcoholism and those which engender criminals; we read the forgotten traveller Mansfield Parkyn’s idyllic description of kyef, of Gödel’s theorem, a long wonderful argument which is a pride of the human mind. I particularly like Mr Gabor’s idea that the astronaut’s discovery of the Pascalian loneliness of other planets may eventually lead mankind to settle their differences. I personally would like to found a new secret society, “Cissies unlimited,” whose object is to place cowards in high places. The only qualifications are to fear death, to hate pain, not to want to inflict death or pain (or receive them) under any circumstances. Acts of outstanding cowardice to be made public when and if we ever dare to come out in the open. By the way, tired of being prodded in the ribs and asked what is the second law of Thermodynamics, I am glad to find “Parkinson’s Law” correctly quoted: 138 [pageend138]“Work automatically expands to fill up the available time,” i.e., however much productive work the machines can do there will always be found enough paper work to go round.

Born in 1909, in a village, 10 miles away from Hanoi, capital of North-Vieinam. Has spent all his childhood among peasants he has learned to understand and to love. Educated first in what was called ‘Franco-Vietnamese Schools’, where most was taught in Vietnamese, and a minor part in French, till the age of 18, he finished his secondary education in a French School. At the age of 20, he went to France, learning Science and Technology in a great technical School of the Industrial North. At 23, he became an Engineer and at the same time got a degree in Mathematics. Then he returned to his country where he worked for more than twelve years in a French factory. By the end of the second world war, he became a teacher in the Civil Engineering School in Hanoi, and also taught Thermodynamics in the University of that town. In 1945, during the bitter fight for power between Communists and Nationalists, in Hanoi, as his sympathy went to the latter, he was kidnapped and taken away from his home for three months. He was released when a compromise was made between the Communists and the Nationalists. Two years later, he became Director and Editor in Chief of a Vietnamese Paper in Hanoi, and since then he has become a journalist claiming for Vietnamese Independence and Social Reforms. At one time he became a Governor of North-Vietnam, but did not remain long in office, because he did not share the political views and methods of some French officials, the end of the war in Europe had brought back to Hanoi. Then he came to England, where he stayed for about 2 years, studying English Literature, History, 148 [pageend148]Politics and Institutions. A fervent admirer of Western culture, he wants to assimilate the “two aspects’’ of it : the literary and the scientific ones, and his sympathy goes to the French and the English Cultures that have formed him. Back in Hanoi in 1952, he kept reading French, English Literatures, Histories; Modern Physics, History and Philosophy of Science. In 1954 after the Geneva Conference for a cease-fire in Indochina, he went to Saigon, and since then has been living there. In 1957, he was Director and Editor in Chief of a very popular Paper, THOILUAN (Comments of the Day), the circulation of which had reached the figure of 100,000, unknown in the history of the Vietnamese Press. But as his paper expressed some criticism of certain government action or policy, his printing press was smashed, and a few scores of thousands of his papers were burned in the street, and finally he was sued by the Court of Saigon, and sentenced to the closing of his paper, a suspended 10-month imprisonment, and a heavy fine. The charge was that some articles published by his paper were either favourable to the Communists or harmful to the national activities. This was in the beginning of 1958. In 1961, as he did not pay the fine which constituted part of the sentence against his paper, he was put in a “Reeducation Camp” in Saigon, for a whole year. Released a few months ago, he intends to write some short stories about his country and the Vietnamese culture. His ambition is to be able to become a journalist again, because, he is convinced that one of the best ways to serve his country, is to have a seriously minded paper, helping mass education and promoting democratic institutions necessary for the protection of the citizens’ interests and rights in underdeveloped countries, where dictatorship leads inevitably to corruption and social injustice, both dangerous to the Free World. Joseph WITTLIN—see Arena No. 2. 149 [pageend149]ARENA NEWS We regret that because of the illness of Tayar Zavolaní, the editor of the projected Albanian anthology, we have been unable to publish in our present issue the work of Albanian exiled writers. Mr. Zavdlani is making a good recovery and we hope to present his anthology in a later issue. * * # ARENA now circulates in seventy-three countries. Our subscription is still £1— or $3.00 annually and once again we ask those who have been receiving our issues for the past two years to let us have this sum by cheque or money order. These should be sent to the P.E.N. Centre for Writers in Exile, 8 Egliston Road, London S.W.15. Some of our friends have asked us about life- subscriptions and we have decided to be optimistic enough to set these at £20.— or $56.00. We hope there will be a good many of them. Our next issue will be a Spanish anthology edited by Julian Gorkin and his associates and will include contributions by Unamuno, Blasco Ibanez, Ramon Sender, Don Salvador de Madariaga, Arturo Barea, E. Salazar Chapela and many other outstanding Spanish writers in exile. This will be followed in September by the special drama issue edited by Algirdas Landsbergis which is making excellent progress. We expect to publish Chinese, Yugoslav, Portuguese, Slovak and Catalan anthologies in addition to several special issues. These are to include one devoted to scholars of foreign origin in the United States and Britain (to be edited by Prof. John Kosa of the University of North Carolina) and one to unpublished work by exiled writers in the form of extracts and synopses which is being edited by Thomas Aczel. Manuscripts and letters for this issue should be addressed to him at Flat 2, South Hill Mansions, South Hill Park, London, N.W.3. Still later a complete issue will be devoted to the film, TV and radio work of the exiles and another to an anthology of humour edited by K. G. Werner. 150 [pageend150]NEWS OF THE P.E.N. CENTRE FOR WRITERS IN EXILE The three day conference held in London from May 24-26 discussed in detail the plans for the Centre’s future activities and especially the development of Arena. It was attended by Dragomir Nenoff, the Honorary Secretary of the American Branch; by Ladislas Gara, K. A. Jelenski, Pavel Tigrid and Tibor Meray from our Paris Branch; by K. G. Werner, the organizing secretary of our Branch in the German-speaking countries; by Raymond Kolk and Gunars Irbe from Sweden and Tibor Dénes from Switzerland. Ivan Jelinek, Michael Prawdin, Gerd Helbemäe, Peteris Aigars, A. R. Kenedy, L. Cs. Szabó, Theodosya Lisiewicz and Paul Tabori represented the London Centre with Ruth Speirs, Marianne Kunvari, L. Hervey and several others also taking part in the lively discussions. We hope to publish a detailed report in an early issue of Arena. * * * The International Executive of P.E.N. met at Brighton on May 27-29. Our Centre was represented by Dragomir Nenoff and Paul Tabori, our official delegates and Ladislas Gara, Pavel Tigrid and K. G. Werner as observers. Professor S. T. Tung, member of our American Branch who lives in California joined the conference a little later. The most important result for the Exiles was the formal ratification of our new Branch in the Germanspeaking countries of the Federal Republic, Austria and Switzerland. This Branch has now chosen, by postal ballot ,a temporary executive and the following officers : Eaghor G. Kostetzky, Chairman; Ernest Halász, Vice- Chairman; K. G. Werner, Honorary Secretary. The Executive (not quite complete yet) includes Dr. Ivan Bankovsky (Frankfurt), Vladimir Stedry (Munich), Georg Molnar (Vienna), Zeltita Avotina (Aurick), Janos Bardi (Hamburg), Eva Schönhuber-Kolar (Einsie- deln) and others. It is hoped that the Branch will hold 151 [pageend151]its first meeting somewhere in Germany before the end of the year. The International Executive has accepted the French invitation to a meeting and round table conference at Rheims, probably between October 17-20. The theme will be the translation and adaptation of plays and we hope to send a full delegation to it, including the Vice- Chairman of our American Branch, Mr. Algirdas Lands- bergis. The 1964 International Congress of P.E.N. will be held in Oslo in the third or fourth week of June. We hope that several of our members, especially those from Scandinavia, will participate in it. The International Executive accepted an invitation from the Hungarian P.E.N. to hold its 1964 autumn meeting in Budapest. Istvan Sôtér, the Hungarian President, made it clear that this invitation included the exiled P E.N. Centres. The Brighton meeting, organized by David Carver, the International Secretary and the English P.E.N., was a delightful and fruitful gathering. Two important resolutions were passed; one congratulated the Writers in Prison Committee on its successful three years’ work and called on it to continue its efforts on behalf of Wolfgang Harich and other writers still in jail; the other supported the South African writers and intellectuals in their fight against racial discrimination. * * # Organized largely by our member and friend Ladislas Gara, Honorary Secretary of our Paris Branch, a four day meeting between Belgian, French and Hungarian poets was held in Brussels May 31-June 4 to discuss problems of translating poetry. It was a highly successful meeting which paid deserved tribute to Gara’s selfless and heroic work in producing the first comprehensive anthology of Hungarian poetry in French, covering a thousand years and involving the cooperation of almost fifty outstanding French poets— many of whom were present in Brussels. 152 [pageend152]The American Branch of the P.E.N.
