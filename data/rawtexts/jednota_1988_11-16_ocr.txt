Augustin Navratil, a 60-year-cld railway worker and father of nine, was removed by force from his home Oct. 28 and placed in an asylum in Kromerice. in the region of Moravia, the radio said. It based its report on information from a Zurich. Switzerland, rights organization. International Christian Solidarity. Navratil was an author and chief promoter of a 31 -pojnl petition calling on the communist government to relax a wide range ol religious restrictions, considered among ihe harshest in Eastern Europe. The peitition, which began circulating last December, gained more than 500,000 signatures, church sources sald. Il was sent to the government some time ago. bul no changes have been made. Some government officials have called the petition "confroniationaJ.'' The petition said Navratil, who had previously served time in menial hospitals, was informed Cot. 27 that the appeal ot his case had been rejected In September, a court ordered him Io be placed in Ihe hospital after hearing testimony by psychiatrists The stale psychiatrists declared Navratil should be interned but two outside experts argued against the measure Vatican Radio said Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek, primate of Bohimia, had written to Navratil saying hfs condemnation was solely the result of his work for ihe petition. Re petition, which was supported strongly by Cardinal Tomasek. called for separation ol church and state, government permission to build churches, state restoration of confiscated property, the return of religious orders and ihe right to criticize Marxist-Leninist ideology publicly.

NOVEMBER 16. 1288 - f FROM OUR JEDNOTA HISTORY By Anthony X. 8nthei*limd( Ph.D. Washington Letter United States — 6I5.OC All other countries — 320.00 TRUTH AT MY TABLE BY JOSEPH C. KRAJSA. KSCG DISTINGUISHED SLOVAK FRATERNALIST LET’S FORM A COMMITTEE equality Is expressed mathematically by the unusually high glnl coefficient of .455. By contrast, the glnl coefficient among whites is a much lower.379. This figure expresses the fact that top and bottom among whites are much closer. The bottom 20 percent of whites receives 5.1 percent of all white income, while the top 20 percent receives 42.9 percent. In brief. Inequality between the “two nations" of blacks Is a full .076 points higher than among whites. This disparity among blacks accounts for nearly all the so-called "growing inequality" in the country as a whole. Married-couple blacks with two householders working have benefltted a lot from the Reagan years- The percentage of black families with constant-dollar The great opportunity beckoning the Republican Party Is to become, as under Abraham Lincoln. the party of black Americans who seek emancipation from poverty. Courtney Milloy, the distinguished black columnist of the Washington Rost said it best. The continued allegiance of black people to the Democratic Party after the Civil Rights Revolution of the 1960s has been "fruitless." he said- "instead. black people should be about shaking off their plantation and welfare mentalities. Black people should be about building confidence, self-esteem and savings accounts. This requires an attitude change, and frankly it is the Republican Party that embodies it." As a Democrat it pains me that Democratic leaders have not embraced for black .Americans the same emancipation that has worked for Immigrant Americans of all races. The creative forces of family, work, and neighborhood have liberated 200 million Americans from poverty. They have liberated 13 million blacks, too. from poverty. Committees are part of any organization. They are needed to study and solve problems, to form recommendations, or to get -a-speclffc task accomplished. But committees seem to have had a special significance in the history of our Society. Jozef Husek. editor of JEDNOTA to 1936. once satirically remarked that if you want to kill an idea or proposal in the Jednota Society. Just form a committee. At a convention or a similar occasion, three or four people would be appointed to study something. Thereafter nothing else was heard on (he subject, or else the committee came back and gave endless reports at the succeeding conventions or annual meetings. Eventually, the committee was disbanded or disappeared. and the subject was completely forgotten, with nothing having been accomplished. Several times in the history of the Society, good proposals simply disappeared in committees. This is not to say that committees never accomplished anything. There were many good committees that did their job well in the Society. At conventions there might be twenty committees. covering everything from sports to elections. A few are worth noting just to show the uniqueness of Jednota committees. At the 21st Convention held in Trenton. N.J.. in L924. the so- called Krausky Vybor or Cow Committee was formed. On the committee were several Individuals Including one of the most distinguished Slovak-Amerlcans of the day and the Society's chief counsel. Michal Matta. The committee was charged with going to the Jednota Farm in Middle- Moreover, the fact that the Dukakis campaign was perceived as slighting blacks, and taking them for granted, has creeled a new political opening- America Is “becoming two nations. separate and unequal." the Kenner Commission reported two decades ago. Left-wing columnists repeat that slogan today. But the "two nations" are not divided by race. The “two nations" exist within the black community. The poorer of these two nations desperately needs liberation. Only Republican economic policies address this need; Democrats, sadly. Ignore It. This serious split in the black community divides blacks in intact married-couple families from those In single femaleheaded families. This split Is widening. Since 1950. the Im come Inequality Index among blacks (showing the distance between the top 20 percent by pretax Income and the bottom 20 percent) has grown by a whopping 17 percent. The bottom fifth of all blacks now earns only 3.2 percent of all black income, while the top fifth now earns 48.3 percent. This in town. Pa., counting the cows, and determining exactly how much milk Jozef Husek and other employees there consumed daily. There was always someone afraid that there was mismanagement or some irregularities taking place on the Jednota Farm. Thus, there was Interest in the milk drinking habits of the Middletown employees. This committee would have gone to Middletown had it not been for Joseph F. Krajsa of Branch 567 in Allentown. Pa., who got up at the convention and pointed GUt how ridiculous such a project would be. The ludicrous Idea was then dropped. Sooner or later, most people in Jednota — and in other organizations — realize that committees do nothing, only individuals do. At the 19th Convention in 1920 it was decided that the history of the Society had to be written. Thus, a committee was formed to prepare such a history. On the committee were Rev. Jozef Kasparek. Rev. Andrej Pavco. former president Jozef KJesek. and Jozef Husek. Because of the great amount of work the history Involved, it was decided not to publish the Society's Kalendár Jednota tor two years. But at the end of the two years only Husek had really done anything on the project. He received no or little help from the others on the committee and the entire project was eventually abandoned. These few examples help to Illustrate how Jednota committees have had aspecial Impact In our history.

Roussel-Uclaf. said 1t would pull the drug off the market because of.public protests. That decision was reversed quickly by the French government, which owns 36 percent of the company. Proponents of the pill say it will alter the debate on abortion, making the decision to abort a t totally private matter for a woman and one day eliminating the need for abortion clinics. They predict that the more, U.S. women learn about the con-'' troversial pill the more they will demand it. possibly creating a black market. its opponents; Including the U-S- Catholic bishops.

They also said not enough research has been conducted to show what harmful side effects are possible and claimed that the more people know about it and the dangers to women and children the more alarmed they will be.

He served as president ofhis society's Pittsburgh District for 14 years, from 1961 to 1975. In 1962 he became office manager of the society and attended 13 conventions as a delegate and officer. In 1974, he was elected Supreme President of his society and was re-elected in 1978. In 1982 he was elected as the National President by acclamation, being the first president in the93-year history, at that time, ofhis society to be so elected. Then in 1986. it was a repeat performance at the Quadrennial Convention. “Under his leadership, the decline of membership in his society was halted and with the infusion of new products, modern marketing procedures and prudent management. the society is showing growth in all phases of its operation. “In addition to his duties as president, he serves as editor of the NÁRODNE NOVINY (National News), the official organ of his society.

Nobody in his or her right mind ought be doing that" he said. He added that another "very dangerous' ’ aspect of making the drug available to induce abortions is that "It takes the abortion question out of the government's control, makes It a completely non-scclal affair." That, he said. Is more significant than people realize. If the drug is found to be good for other uses, such as treating certain forms of breast cancer, reducing the need for Capwarcan- seetion births and treating Cushing's disease — as some researchers have discovered — then It should be restricted to that, said Father Russell Smith, director of education for Pope JohnXXJH Medical-Moral Center in Braintree. Mass. HeTaid RU-486 had been put on the market "without adequate testing," and he said the drug has been "hailed as a cure- all," which should never be done, he said, even with new cancer treatments. Frances Kissling of Catholics for a Free Choice, which opposes church teaching on abortion, said opponents of RU-486 would like to constrain "critical re- search" on such compounds at a time when women "have too few options for good contraception and for safe and effective methods of abortion." In developlngccuntries alone, she said, half a million women a Incomes above $50,000 has jumped from 8.2 percent in 1981 ’ to 13.2 percent In 1987. But the bottom 20 percent of blacks are today In anguish. In many urban areas, the traditional structure of married- couple families has virtually broken down: single femaleheaded households outnumber married-couple households by 4 to 1 ■ More than 68 percent of all children In such households live below the poverty line. The median Income of these black female-headed families in 1987 was $9,7IO(only 36 percent of black married-couple Income). The median income of black married-couple families j was $27,182. The growing number of single female-headed families among blacks means tremendous dependency on welfare. There is no way that one-parent households can compete with married- couple households in Income, the disciplining of children, and mutual psychological support- In effect. Uncle Sam must play the Impossible mlé'ôf bands and fathers. Decades ago. most well- known black leaders entrusted the future of the black community to big government. Later they entered freely into coalitions of the left that included certain feminists, gays, and others who assaulted the fundamental values of the husband-wife family. These choices have had tragic consequences. Among black leaders. Ideological second thoughts are tn order. By 1987. 2.4 million more blacks were employed than in 1981. While white employment rose 13 percent, black employment rose 26 percent. Average real family Income for non- whites rose about 12 percent (having fallen 7 percent under Jimmy Carter). The Republican Party ought to fight hard to liberate the bottom 20 percent of black families, especially long-suffering single female-headed families. The Democrats ought to Tight equally hard. Both parties ought to compete on a three-point program promoting family, work, and neighborhood: (I) Promote married- couple families. (2| Insist upon work rather than welfare. (3) Build creative, safe, and productive neighborhoods. Emancipation from dependency Is the current Lincolnian theme. Lincoln is now the model for both parties.

NOVEMBER 16. 1986 Page 5 LIGHT ONE CANDLE H is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness. [Christopher Motto) By Father Jahn Catoir Director of The Christophers TO BE A CHRISTIAN Jesus spent most of His public ministry trying to persuade His followers that the Father wants us to love one another. His j most powerful teaching along these lines was the parable on the Good Samaritan (Lk. 10:29 et seq,| In answer to the question. "Who Ismy neighbor?" Jesus tells the story of three men who passed by a wounded stranger. The first two ignored him. almost as though he were an enemy [Jesus Insists that even an enemy deserves our love). But the Good I tj Samaritan (at that time all Samaritans were thought of as low-life I types not worthy of much respect) treats the stranger as a brother. Jesus praises the Samaritan as one who is wiser and better than I the Pharisees. I This teaching puts a high value on the virtue of compassion: I Jesus teaches us that true faith should open us to the needs of I others. The lesson applies not only lo individuals but to communities as well. Religious communities, parishes, and lay groups of all kinds are also called to be carriers of the love of Christ. Christians are called to be a living testimony of God's loving presence. "By their fruits you will know them." But Christ calls us to more than personal virtueor community social action. He also challenges us to go forth and teach others. The four words of Jesus are: love. pray. go. teach. I .. Since no ooeis tlie slightest bit interested in the commands of a stranger who lived 2000 years ago. it means that someone here and now has to present Jesus as the Lord of Life to tbe next generation. Priests and religious are dwindling In number, we need you, the laJty, to help. In other words, evangelization is a basic Christian duty. I Perhaps the word evangelization is too "churchy" a word- Maybe I it would be better to say: to be a Christian is to Christianize others, I That might mean reminding nominal Catholics that they are liv- ľ ing like seml-pagans. or it may mean saying nothing, depending I on prayer. 11 We are asked by Jesus to proclaim Him as Lord and Savior I and to be signs of His love, each in our own distinctive way. fn [i our "prayer life" we unite with the Holy Spirit as Mary did. and I as Jesus did when He accepted the cross. II God‘s plan in your life is a glorious one. You have a Job to I do in this world that nobody else can do. The goal of making Christ 11 better known and loved in the world is part of your mission and L spirituality.

In most instances, however, the question often heard was. "Where do I start and whom do I contact for help?" The answer is in the founding of a Slovak Genealogy Research Center, a project under the direction of the newly created Genealogy Commission of the Slovak World Congress, and the initial attempt at the development of a common clearing house for Slovak researchers- The project is under the direction of a Slovak. Ray Piutko. the Chairman of the Slovak World Congress Genealogy Commission. He has developed a Slovak Genealogy Kit. one designed to point you in the right direction and at ihe same time, encourage the use of common forms for Slovaks in their research. This is the first-ever such tool developed solely for Slovaks, one which not only assists the researcher, but algo places such individual's data on a special Ľomputer program that matches participants by last name-5, regions of Slovakia and. more Importantly. matching individuals from identical villages, even though they may have different surnames. The Slovak Genealogy Kit is available by writing to Ray Plutko, Slovak Genealogy Research Center. 16455 E. Prentice Place, Aurora. Colo. 80015. The cost is only $5 which covers the kit. postage, and free entry data and use of the computer files- By this method a person can document his Slovak ancestors.

"Ad Limina" represents an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase, "ad llmina Aposialoruni" and Is translated "to the thresholds of the Apostles. ' Diocesan bishops the world over are required to make these visits every five years While ihcre they must pray at the tomb of St- Peter In the Basilica of Si.

They also visit with lire Pope, thereby showing their union with him and ihofr allegiance to hfm as the Successor of St. Peter, the Vicar of Christ Another requirement of the "Ad Limina" Is that they submit to the Congregation of Bishops, a department of the Holy See. what is called their Quinquennial Reports. These reports represent a detailed account of the condition of a bishop's diocese, covering a variety of aspects such as: Statistics, various programs being carried out for the spiritual and temporal welfare of his people, and its financial condition, among others. Hopefully, time permitting they will also find time to visit the many historic churches and monuments in the Eternal City.

Proposed Lay Preaching Guidelines By Cindy Wooden WASHINGTON (NC) - Guidelines tor lay preaching id be voted on by ihe U.S. bishops grvs examples of situations where lay preaching wixid be per- m^ed but retain the centuriesfong ban on lay people giving homilies a Mass. The U.S. bishops are scheduled to vole on the guidelines during ther Nov. 14-17 general meeting in Washington. According to Ihe proposed guidelines, lay people may preach at prayer services. Communion services and cttier liturgies outside ol Mass, especially when a priest or deacon is nor available. The pudaknes also describe ctcum- stances when ley people may preach during Mass, as tong as they do not give ihe homily — a function reserved lo bishops, priests and deacons The gipdetines were prepared by the bishops’ Committee an Pastoral Research and Practices in consultation with (heir committees on bturgy, tarty and canonical affairs. Passage of lbe guidelines requires approval by two-thirds of Ihe bishops and confirmation by ihe Vatican. The Code of Canon law authorized bishops'conferences lodeveop guidelines for times when it is "necessary" or "advantageous" lor a *ay person to preach. Permission lor a lay person to preach must come from (he diocesan beshop or hi$ de<egate, (he guidelines state. Individual dioceses would develop more specific poftoes based on local needs and resources. With a shortage of priests and the growing numbet of parishes administered by a deacon. Religious or Lay person, many US dioceses have cem- munrties where Sunday worship services have been held without a pnesl presiding The "Directory tor Sunday Celebrations in the Absence of a Priest." issued iNa yeat by the Vatican Congregation tor Divine Worship, discussed Ihe role of a "a lay person who leads the assembly" and urged bishops' conferences to apply and adapt the norms put forth in the directory. The proposed U S. guidelines slate that when lay people preach during Mase, they "should not speak at Ihe time designed tor Ihe homily, lest ihe impresston be given Unai ihe person is giving a homily in the Sind sense." They suggest that lay preachng during Mass take piece after the greeting at the beginning of Mass or lollowing the prayer after Commulioh. Cases -where lay people may be allowed to preach during Mass indude liturgies with children, cases when the ordained minister is not capable of giving a homily, or cases whan “arcum- stance and the good of the church te quire that they (lay people) supplement ihe preaching at ordained ministers." according to the guidelines In liturgical cetebrations ou&de of Mass, the preaching would take place at the time designated by the Irturgtcsf text, usually after Ine Gospel reading. "The preaching or explanation of the Word ol God is integral to those rites, and should not be omitted except for serious reasons." according to the guidelines. The guidelines said that people designated to preach should be. —Persons of good standing who live good Christian lives —Persons who Ere active members d the church lam kar with (he needs of rhe community, and faithful to Ihe leadership and teaching erf the magistenum, or church leaching authority. —Persons who have appropriate knowledge of sacred Scripture, theology.

(Accredited Mernbara HH3C) (Continued from Page 1) yond its borders. The point being . raised these, days — by church scholars, missionaries and the pope — is that care of the earth may be one of the most sarious moral issues of our age. Dr. Carlos Chagas, recently re- bred president of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, told the pope bluntly in an address at the end of October: "The destruction of the environment is the result of a progressive and obstinate'acUon. nearly invisible in the beginning, driven by greed, economic pdwer and- ignorance. "You alone, with your »voice, can stop ecological disaster, and the academy is at your service." Chagas said. The academy's report last year on disappearing species — some 35,000 are facing extinction by the year 2000 — raised an alarm'in the scientific community. Five years ago. the academy issued early warnings about the depletion of the ozone layer and the global build up ci carbon dioxide, as well as the en vironmental disaster that would follow nuclear war The pope has made ecology a recurring sub-theme of major documents. His latest encyclical. "So/- fidtudo Rei Sooalis" ("On Social Concams"}, was immediately hailed as an ecological breakthrough for its tough ianguaga on the environment. In it. the pope went back lo the Bible and said the dominion granted humankind over the natural world has biological and moral limits that cannot be violated in the name of development. In speeches, the pope’s language has been evan sharper. Eartier Unis year, he told farmworkers that economic exploitation of resources was threatening to nun the earth into an "abandoned desert." He told a group of scientists last fall that he was concerned about the "uncon- trolled discharges" of waste products into ihe earth's atmosphere, lano and seas Part of this "irreversible damage." he added, was caused by economic practices "aimed only at profit" On hrs frequent tnps. the pope has seen environmental damage dose up: from rampant pollution in the Rhine River to "desertification" in parts of Africa. Ibose who know the pope say •that as a hikerand outdoors withu- sřast, he has a natural concern about damage to the environment. It is a growing issue among churchmen in his native Poland, where widespread industrial pollution has threatened whole regions and is eroding, among other things, the facade of the pope's former cathedral in Krakow. But while he has spoken about general causes, the pope has been cautious about assigning blame for specific damage — whether for disasters like Chernobyl or for longterm problems like deforestation Among Vatican agencies, too, there is hesitation about making sweeping pronouncements on ecology because it often involves the complicated interaction ol Fust and Third World economies, population migration and international regulation. "There’s certainly a tot of reflection going on about the issue. But I don’t think we have developed a theology on this yet." said Msgr. Diarmuid Martin, secretary of Ihe Vatican's justice and peace commission. Several ecology-minded churchmen in Rome have high hopes for a papal document on environmental respect,.but there is no evidence lhal one is in the works. "Actually, if he'd put all his pre vious statements under one cover, it would make a beautiful docu- mani," said Capuchin Father Bernard Przewczny. Father Przewozny is the mover behind the Franciscan Center for Environmental Studies In Rome, a new institute expected to open this fad. He hopes within two years to obtain Vatican approval tor the program and have it raised lo the level of a pontifical academic institute. "Deforestation, chemical pollution, uncontrolled urbanization — ihese are going to be major issues in the coming decades, and the church needs people qualified to speak on them." he said. The priest sees a strong tradition of ecology running through church history, beginning with Sts. Benedict and Francis and their spiritual perspective on production and work. Likewise, he thinks the church today should be in the thick of the environmental movement to give it a religious orientation. But, he noted, there is some reluctance a1-,eng church leaders to form alliances with groups that, for example, promole birth control as a solution to environmental preb- tems. Father Przewozny said his hope is that the "Franciscan viewpoint’’ will rub off on these groups. Some pl Ihe larger international organizations. such as the World Wildlife Foundation, have recently held major meetings in Assisi. Italy, tire birthplace of St. Francis An ecological movement is also developing among missionaries. In early November, about 100 mission workers gathered tn Rome to discuss approaches to the environmental problems they encounter daily — ranging from multinational corporations that eschew safety norms to the ladt of firewood in Third World countries Party because ol urbanization, the missionaries have seen many local cultures lose their connection to the land in a single generation. Several of them present at Ihe meeting said environments! studies should be part of a missi’dňäry s training program. Kenyan Father John Mutiso Mbinda. an official of the Vatican’s Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity who spoke at the meeting, called missionaries "firsthand witnesses" to environmental abuse. As one example, he died the extensive sale in Africa of fertilizers that are banned in Western countries. Father Mutiso Mbinda noted that the Vatican has not yet decided whether to fully participate in the 1990 World Convocation on Justice, Peace and the Integrity of Creation, sponsored by the Worid Council of Churches. That is disappointing to some, but the church ts helping to prepare for the convocation. which is expected lo cover environmental topics in depth. Father Mutiso Mbinda said that, in his experience, government agencies often view the church and its missionaries as environmentally guilty, as the original bearers of a Western development mentality. It is time io convince them that "we are taking a fresh look at the question." Father Mutiso Mbinda said. COMING EVENTS NOVEMBER NOVEMBER 30 — Annual meeting of the Msgr.

(NG) — We want Priesl’ We want Pries)! We want Pnesli’ The wresting fans' chart filled the Jacksonville Naitxef Guard Armory Inside the ring Super Destroyer paced, tugging on the ropes and firing verbal assaultsal the (ans On has shirt, in big block letters, was the taunt: 'Priests are sissies.'" Super Destroyer wanted revenge. A week earlier on the "Florida Champion ship Wrestling"' show, thousands of television viewers had seen him get decked by one blow tram Iha iron Priest s lamed Iron Ettww "We want Priest1 We want Priest1" Some fans around Ihe ring tapped their elbows to lernind Super Destroyer what was in store lor him. The 6-fCot, 225-pound Iron Priest. Father Joe Whitehead, was stiE in the dressing room. The match was al 0:30 p.m.and he had rushed lo thearrnory aller a 7 odock Funeral Mass at St. Matthew Church three mites away, where he is associate pastor. As the 29-year-oldpri5St came out ol Ihe dressuig room and made his way through the fans to |he ring, he was bombarded with high fives and handshakes. Like Super Destroyer, he had a mes sage 0(1 hiSShirt.il said "Mt 25 31-46" He pulled the shirt off and threw it to a young girl al nngsds. ''I always give it io some kid.“ he sard in an interview wrlh TheFtanda Catfroffc. newspaper ol live Florida dioceses "Hopeiully ha ll look al [ho shirt and try to find ouI what the verse means." Father Whilehead reales headlocks and body slams are a strange way Io preach. Bui he only finds it odd, nd ccntradiclQry. "As long as I’m wrestling in a way that’s consisleni with my values, 1 don't think anyone should find anything wrong with ii," he said. "i Iry to be nice to people, shake a lew hands. .1 try to be totally dilierent ihan the neckless sweat hogs with loud mouths. • you have the ears of a toi ol people. This Is a chance lo 90 out there and give them a good gospel message. I want them lo leave with more than a licker siub." he said. Among Iron Priest Ians al Ihe armory was Maryann McGuire. vrbo is to be married by Faiher Whilehead next year. She had acodentaily caught his previous maich with Super Destroyer on TV. "I couldn‘1 believe it when I turned ontheTV .. and saw him." she said. "I called my mom and said, "Turn'on thetetevision Fame» Joels on there and he's wrestling.' i was shocked." After she got over her surprise she liked Ihe idea. "I Ihink Unis 19 good for the community." she said. "Faiher Joe • relates welt to Ihe common man." Father Whitehead started wrestling two yeais ago whan a parishioner convinced him lo do it for a fund-raising event Now Ihe money he earns es a pro wrestler goes to Si Francia Soup Kitchen, which feeds some ol Jackson vine's poor. In the nog ihe iron Priest offered a handshake to Sups» Destroyer. His hand was swelled away. He olfered ii again Slapped away again. A ihird time. Seme result. Twenty minutes and <1x iron albows laier. Ihe maich was ow Super Des- irpyer was disqualified lor throwing ihe Iron Priest over Ihe lop tope. Father Whitehead says the way he acts m the ring gives a message about values. "I try to be a positive role model." he sad. ’ Í wiestla by ihe rules and do what I can within those rules I won't do something heinous like go out and get a chair. "By not tweaking the rules. 1 think theie's a valuable gospel message." The question everybody asks him: Is wrestling real or take? "Sign on the dotted line. Let's go wrestle, and you'll lind out " O And the gospel message his shirt refers lo? Look it up. Christmas Eve Dinner (Stedry Vecer] Scheduled in Oak Forest, III.

Yes! The First Catholic Sovak Union invites you to open an IRA or make new deposits to your ex- . isting IRA. * Regulations enacted in 1987 provice that employees covered by their employer’s qualified retirement plan receive no IRA deduction if they earn more than $50,000 per year for a married couple, filing jointly; or $35,000 for single persons. Married couples earning between $40.000 and $50,000 and single persons who earn between $25,000 and 35,000 receive a partial deducation if they are covered by their employer's qualified retirement plan. DEPOSITS TO IRA^ TAX DEFERRED Benefits received from an IRA are taxable income when benefits are received. However, this is usually some years after deposits have been made and probably at a time when the fndividual'sjncome is smaller, so it is taxed at a lower rate. Also, after age 65. the personal exemption is doubled. Individuals may deposit into their iRA an amount equal to 100% of their earned income or up to $2,000 whichever is less each year. A non working spouse can establish a spousal IRA and deposit up to $2,250 a year or 100% of their earned income, whichever is less Under a spousal IRA situation, both husband and wife will have separately owned IRA certificates. (At least $250.00 must go into a spoasal IRA.) The maximum contributions for any individual IRA cannot exceed $2.000. This annuity deposit is deductible as an "adjustment to income, ’ and the individual can take advantage of the deduction whether t using the standard deduction or itemized deductions on Federal Income Tax forms. These annual deposits and the earnings on them accumulate on a TAX DEFERRED BASIS until the time of retirement. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Annually, each member with an IRA certificate will receive a Statement of Account of Participants in Individual Retirement Accounts or Annuities- This statement will be mailed from the Home Office not later than January 31st of each year. Your IRA annuity is a no-load policy. Premiums deposited are credited 100% toward your accumulated values. The IRA annuity does have a surrender charge which applies to amounts withdrawn during the first three full years. This surrender charge permits us to recover the expense of setting up and administering the annuity account and it further enables us to credit maximum interest to all accounts. There is no sur- render charge for any annuity withdrawal after three years Írom the date of issue. DON’T QUALIFY FOR AN IRA? You Can Still Earn 9.0% (Compounded 9.2%) Interest, Tax Deferred THE TAX-DEFERRED ANNUITIES offer the member a way to save additional money while saving on taxes and still earning our high current 9.0% interest rate. On a compounded basis, the interest rate results in 9.2%. This annuity plan is r designed to supplement your IRA savings forthose who qualify for an IRA. while it is a major investment advantage for.those who are retired or who are no longer efigib/e for fRAs. It can also be used for parents looking to save for their children’s education. At all times, no matter what you use the annuity plan for, you will be earning among the highest rates around and deterring the tax on your interest earned until such I times as you start withdrawing the money. I DEPOSITS Into an annuity are flexible with respect to the 1 amount you may put into your account. However, the minimum | deposit in a given month is $25.00.

BOOK REVIEW Reviewed by Mary Kenny, NC News Service HOMEWARD BOUND, by Elaine Tyler May. Base Books Inc.

Ms. May approaches her subject from a feminist point qf view. She observes that the great Depression and World War II brought changes in roles in marriage Dunng World War 11 thousands ol women took paying jobs. After World War 11 job end educaironaf opportunities expanded. Wilh this expansion and tha changes in traditional male and female roles, why. Ms. May asks, did these men and women wholeheartedly embrace traditional family values? While the reader who experienced these decades might regard tnem as the norm for Western Judeo-Christian ervilixaton. Ms. Mayd sagrees Urothe youth of the '60s. the youth of the early 20lh century "challenged the sexual norms of their day. pushed the divorce rate up and the birthrate down, and creeled a unique youth culture, cem- plete with music, dancing, movies and other naw forms of urban amusements." They also developed "a powerful ’em- Inst movement. strong grass roots activism on behalf of social justice, and a proliferation of radical movements... it is the generation in between — wilh ils strong domestic ideology, pervasive consensus politics, and peculiar demo- graphic behavior — that stands oU as different." Ms. May's answer is that m the era «|he Coto War. the fear of communism and ol the atom bomb prompted Americans to "create a home that would ful hit virtually al) ns members' personal needs through an energized and expressive personal life" Americans would find the security in their families that they could not find in the world around them.

NOVEMBER J6. 198S Page 17 * f ť JEJ AMERICKÁ SVOKRA Napísala MÁRIA K. SINÁKOVÁ fPofcračotMinieJ Ľudské práva nedodržiavajú medzinárodné zmluvy A pán učiteľ tu, v tejto knihe, tak pekne a dojemne opisuje dedinské zvyky, Tak verne a vecne môže písať Leu ten, kto za dlhé roky býval medzi ľudom. A pán učiteľ je na to povolaná autorita. A čo sa Katke veľmi páčilo, bol ľahký sloh spisovateľov, všetko podáva jednoduchými, nevyberanými slovami. Píše tak, ako keby hovoril rovno z duSe ľudu, ktorý nevyhľadáva nijaké filozofické frázy, ale jednoducho, rovno hovorí podľa osvedčeného príslovia: “Hovor tak, ako ti zobák narástol." A veľmi ju povznieslo, ako pán učiteľ opisuje, že hoci na každej dedine nebola škola, lebo Maďari sa usilovali o to, aby čím menej slovenských škó! bolo po dedinách, jednako ľud sa navzájom prebúdzal, učil. Materinská reč mu bola nadovšetko. A preto aj proti všetkému útlaku a nátlaku slovenskú reč ai udržal ako svoj najdrahší poklad. A ako to autor knihy polene a dojemne opisuje, že mladšia Bohom požehnaná e vyvolená chvíľa, keď malé národy v Európe sa vymanili z otroctva a teraz ako slobodné vo svojom národnom a kultúrnom vývine ničím hatené sa môžu vyviňovať. Aj slovenský národ dosiahol y novom štátnom útvare viac slobody. Pán učiteľ sa vrátil zo záhrady. Bol zvedavý, čo Katku asi bude hovoriť a jeho knihe. Prisadol si k nej oproti manželke, ktorá síce vedela takmer celý obsah knihy, ale jednako to bolo pre ňu zvláštnym potešením, že túto perlu, dielo svojho manžela mohla teraz listovať stranu 2a stranou. Katka sa radovala, že aj pán učiteľ sa atal spisovateľom, jeho Úspech bude súčasne úspechom aj jeho manželky. Predstavili sa jej prvé roky učiteľovcov, ktorí tiež museli zápasiť s drsným životom. V duchu porovnávala aj svoje zamieňajúce sa roky manželského zväzku. A v túto chvíľu jej ardee bolo oslobodené od ťarchy a myšlienok, ktoré po tieto dni stále zabehávali k Dávidovi, jasnili Ba. Začala voľnejšie dýchať. Kniha mala viac ako 400 strán. Minulú nedeľu Katka nešla do kostola, učiteľovci sa dosiaľ ani slovom nezmienili o učiteľovi R... On bol posledný človek, b ktorým by sa chcela stretnúť a preto chcela ešte pred nedeľou odcestovať domov. Nechcela tu stráviť ešte jednu nedeľu. Tichosť prerušila pani učíteľová tlmeným hlasom: "Ako sa mi vidí, budeme mať hosťa." Odložila knihu, vstala s nakukla von, pričom šeptala Katke: "Pozri, kto k nám Ide,” Katka vedela, že áiel od ulice, ale slova nemohla dostať zo seba, Poznala ho hneď, ako otváral dvere. A teraz? Stál tu pred ňou. Ona hľadí naňho. Všetko sa jej mení pred očami. Cíti, ako jej horia Uca. Mechanicky vstala, že niekto niečo povie. Milo jej zazneli v ušiach slová pani učiteľovej, ktorá bola tiež v rozpakoch. No hneď sa spamätala a utraievavo vítala hosťa: “Pekne vás vitam, pán učiteľ! Teší ma, že ste nás navštívili," vystrúc pravicu na privítanie, videla., že aj hosť má v nike knihu. “Hádam poznáte pani Vantalovú, našu susedku Katku zo &alanu. Už rok minul, ako prišla na návštevu z Ameriky. Ale u nás je prvý raz.” Obrátila sa ku Katke a povedala: "ľhiž myslím, Katka, Že aj ty poznáš pána' učiteľa. Chodieval k nám do Salauu. Teraz sme blízki susedia.” V hrdle jej vyschlo a hlas bol chrapľavý. Oči jej behali z jedného na druhého. Uhla ea na bok a núkala hosťa: ."Nech sa páči sadnúť. Môj manžel bude tu o chvíľu. Už dosť dávno je kdesi v záhrade, zaiste sa baví s kvetmi. Ako vidím, už viete o jeho prekvapení, ktoré vám sľuboval na tento týždeň.” Len teraz pán učiteľ vydoatal so seba slovo. V jeho očiach bolo plno úžasu. Potriasol obom paniam pravice a ozval sa: “Daj Bože, dobrý den! Tak sto nás prišli navštíviť," hovoril nesúvisle, udivene hľadiac na Katku. "Ako počúvam, už ste tu rok. Ci ste prišli samotnú, alebo s pánom manželom a deťmi?” Katka razom s pani učit eľovou ponúkli hosťovi stoličku. Všetci sa usadili Katka bola trocha rozochvená, snežila sa udržať rovnováhu. Začala 5 rozechvělým hlasom, ktorý potom ovládala: “Ano, prišla som asi pred rokom. Nie síce s manželom, ktorý ostal doma pracovať, ole prišla som s dietkami. Ako vidím, aj vás prekvapil náš starý pán učiteľ, hoci sme to od neho očakávali. Umienll si, že nás tskto prekvapí e novým literárnym dielom — a to sa mu aj podarilo." “Odpusťte," ospravedlňoval sa hosť, “hádam vyzerám cälý zdesený, ale chcel som byť prvý, aby som zablahoželal pánu učiteľovi. Akú však vidím, predbehli ste ma. A ešte raz odpusťte, hľadím na vás s úžasom, lebo sum nemal ani len tušenia o takom milom postretnutí. Rozbehol som sa sem a ako vidíte, cd tých niekoľko rokov, ako ste nás.zanechali, pribral som niekoľko tuctov. Preto som se tak zadychčal." “Ale tie kilá a či fünty vám dobre priliehajú,” zažartovala stará pani. “Ktože by sa v takej horúčosti nezadychčal! Preto neprijímam vaše ospravedlnenie. Ale kdeže je ten náď autor? Aspoň dnes by mal dať pokoj kvetom/' “Áno, rád by som ho videl. Počul som, že ste mali včera veľmi vzácnu návštevu, zriedkavého hosťa.” "Mali sme, pán učiteľ,“ hovorila stará pani a rozpačito sa pozrela na oboch. Odbočila od predmetu a vravela: “Vari Idem zavolať manžela. Vy budete prvý muž, ktorý mu zablahoželá." Pánu učiteľovi aa zdalo, že tieň na Katkinom obličaji je tajuplný. Katka roztvorila knihu položenú na svojom lone, prelistovala niekoľko strán nevedomky, potom pozdvihla hlavu, zachytiac hosťov zrak. Jej oči neietým pohľadom hľadeli naňho a hoci sa všetko kolísalo v nej, ovládala sa. Prvý náraz strachu a prekvapenia sa už minul, začínala byť celkom normálna, “ÖO poviete na dielo starého pána učiteľa?” pýtal sa jej “Len toľko, čo sa mňa týka," odpovedala ostýchavo, "prečí- g tajúc už asi jednu tretinu tejto Itrásnej knihy, môžem povedať, že náš pán učíte? má znamenité pero. Veľmi krásne a výstižne opísal zvyky nášho dedinského ľudu. Je to namáhavá práca niekoľkých rokov Verím, že aa dožije skvelého úspechu.” Pán učiteľ vedel, že Katka začala rozhovor, len aby niečo povedala. Hlboko ea zahľadel na ňu. Keď sa odmlčala, trhol sebou; “Zaiste, zaiste. Obaja mu želáme všetko to najlepšie. A plne al to zaslúžil, aby po tom dlhom trude a námahe bol zaslúžene odmenený. O samom diele môžem sa vysloviť pochvalne. Veď kým rukopis bol oddaný do kníhtlačiame, niekoľko ráz som ho čítal. A dovolim si ešte dodať k tomu, že keď veľmi zblízka poznáme autora, tým sa to lepšie a zaujímavejšie číta. Áno, starý párt ■' učiteľ zaslúžil si plné uznanie za dielo, namáhavú to prácu mnohých rokov. Viem, že dielo mu zabezpeč! budúcnosť. Obaja manželia e! to plne zaslúžili." Pán učiteľ nevedel, ako tie slová vyšli z nebo. “Starý pán učiteľ mi povedal, že bez vašej a manželkinej pomoci dielo by nebol vládal skončiť,’1 poznamenala Katke. “0, to preháňa,“ skromne povedal hosť. “Naša pomoc bola taká akromná a malicherná, že to nestoj! za reč. Veď od svojej mladostí ako začal účinkovať ako učiteľ, zaoberal sa myšlienkou napísať literárne dielo. A veru je od toho Sug už štyridsať rokov.” Tu ho prerušilo veselé detské pokríkovanie. Katka vstala a hoať ju nasledoval. Deti dobehli k matke. Až teraz sa zháčili, keď zazreli neznámeho pána. Avšak naučené slušnosti a zdvorilosti, obe odrazu pozdravili neznámeho! “Dobré popoludnie prajeme!” “Prečo sa tak predbehujete?" trocha káravé, ale vľúdnym hlasom sa prihovorila matka. Obe deti zvedavo pozerali na neznámeho pána, ktorý sa im zdal byť dôstojným. "Pán učiteľ, toto sú moje deti, Karol a Betka.” Pán učiteľ mal roztvorené náručie, sadol si na stoličku, tieto k zebe privinul Deti placho pozerali raz na na matku a raz na mladého pána, ale ich pohľad sa hneď vyjasnil, keď mladý pán sa im prihovoril anglicky: ‘'Well, well... Did you come to stay for good in Slovakia or just for a visit?” Pritom sa usmieval, čo deťom dodalo odvahu. Keby sa bol učiteľ pozrel v tej chvíli na Katku, bol by videl úžas na jej tvári. Katka sa divila, ako dobre hovoril anglicky. “Počuli ste, ako pán učiteľ dobre hovorí po anglicky?” Práve vtedy vošli dnu učiteľove!. Starý pán sa dobrosrdečne usmieval, keď videl svojho mladého priateľa, ako sa bavil s deťmi. Hosť vstal a srdečne potriasol pravicu svojho starého priateľa. Úprimne mu blahoželal k jeho literárnemu úspechu: "Vďaka za knihu, pán učiteľ. Had je prelomený. Onedlho všetky časopisy budú prinášac prajnú kritiku o vašom diele. Všetci máme z toho neskonalú, radost. Duiam. že nezastanete vo vašej podnikavosti ako spisovatel. Teraz rozhodne by ste mali vytvoriť zase nové dielo, aby čim skôr na našom knižnom trhu sa zjavila vaäa nová tvorba, mjtažšie len začat, ostatně už ide ľahšie. A tu mi prichádza na um,’ pozrel na Katku, ‘kedyže budeme takto môct blahoželať pani Vantalovej?” Katka sa Očkom skúmavo pozrela na mladého učiteľa. Zdal sa jej byt v tej chvíli neuveriteľne zmenený. "No, patů Vantalová,” pokračoval hosť, “dosiaľ ste sa mi ani slovíčkom nezmienili o vašej literárnej tvorbe. Musím sa vám zdôveriť, že hľa, títo šľachetní ľudia, učiteľove! ma informovali, že ate usilovne pracovali na nádejnej knihe. V duchu sme sa tešili vašej podnikavosti. Nemyslím, že by ste nám preto zazlievali. • Katka ea začudovala, ako vie tento človek pekne vysloviť jej meno. Teraz si všetci sadli. A keď sa uvelebili, mladý učiteľ pokračoval: "Dozvedeli sme sa, že v Amerika ete vyhrali cenu v literárnom súbehu, napísali ste zaujímavú rozprávku. Ale viac mi stará pani učiteľovi, nechcela vyzradiť. A od tých čias nemám nijakú vedomosť, ako ďaleko ste pokročili e rukopisom na vašej nádejnej kniha Prosím, mohli by Ste mi povedať, či ste už dokončili rukopis, alebo či vás písanie ešte zaujíma?”--- • "Ja myslím, že áno,” zamiešal sa starý pán učiteľ. “Prečo nie? Zo srdca si želám, aby naša Slovenka v Amerike stala sa spisovateľkou. Veď vari nebudeme im len my vždy zasielať knihy do Spojených štátov, myslím naším krajanom. Naším želaním je, aby aj oni nás poctili svojou literárnou tvorbou, zasielali nám ich knihy. Verím, že moja žiačka Katka niektorý den nás milo pre- kvapj svojou knihou- No a či by aom potom nebol hrdý, že jedna ž mojich žiačok stala sa spisovateľkou v ďalekom novom svete?" Hrdo n povedome hovoril, vypnul prela; “Z Ameriky sme Čakali knihu od Katky, a tu hľa, došla k nám ona sama! To nás tým väčšmi rozveselilo. Nuž s či s! nemôžem myslieť, že nás aj ona prekvapí ? Verím, že áno..." Pani učiteľovi prerušila manžela, žartovne hovoriac: “Ale Katka ta bude nasledovať, práve má na to ešte dvadsať rokov času. Öi nie tak, Katka?” Všetci sa chutne rozosmiali nad týmito žartovnými slovami. Katka pri vinula svoje diötky k sebe & presvedčivo povedali: "Tento raz viem, že môj starý pán učiteľ, môj dobrodinec sa nebude môcť vystatovať so mnou. Keď sum sa stala matkou, pre- atala som snívať o spisovateľstve. Aspoň nateraz niet na to výhľadu. Priznám sa, že som sa kedysi kochala v písaní." Mladý pán učiteľ v neporozumení pozrel ns Katku a riekol: “Dúfajme, že pani Vantalová nás nenechá tak dlho čakať na svoju kolbu, ako to urobil náš pán učiteľ." Pani učiteľovi navrhla, že teraz by mal nasledovať olovrant, po zakončení ktorého sa zase bude môcť pokračovať vo voľnom priateľskom rozhovore. Ale hosť odrádzal od toho, že hoci sa chce ešte pobaviť v prostredí milej spoločnosti, na olovrante sa však nezúčastni. Lebo od istého času na radu lekára musel sa zriecť popoludňajších zákuskov, olovrantu. No stará pani e Katkou nebrali výhovorku v?*»*, ale prichystali čaj a chutnú bryndzu. Až do siedmej večernej hodiny všetci sa bavili srdečným rozhovorom, keď potom hosť opustil pohostinný príbytok. Katka okúpala dietky a po večeri, keď ich uložila na nočný ^odpočinok, zišla dolu do prízemia. Tam na ňu čakala pani učiteľovi, ktorá ju oslovila: "Moja drahá Katka, dnešný deú bol pre mňa radostný, ale čosi ma aj vzrušilo, necítim sa sama so Bcbou.” "Ani jedno, ani druhé,’1 súcitne povedala Katka. "To je uaa- venosť, vysilili ste sa dnes. Dnes pôjdete skór ako inokedy na odpočinok Odpočiniete air keď si ráno trocha dlhšie poležíte, aby ste dobehli zmarený odpočinok." ''Nie, Katka moja! Nie som tak unavená. Myslím, že to bude tá kniha, ktorá ma tak nečakane ’'prichytila '. Možno mi ani neuveríš, že pán učiteľ sa mi ani len slovom nezmienil, že kniha je už v tlači?' Stará pani si tak vďačne vzdychla, ako keď človek dôjde svojho cieľa. ‘‘Viem, prečo ml nič nevyzradil, Hádam sa pamätáš, keď ha priatelia dobiedzali s knihou Hoci to bolo zo žartu, jednako ea pritom rozčuľoval. Preto o knihe nechcel viac ani spomínať. Vedela som, že kníhtlačiareú Účastinárskeho spolku v Turčianskom Svätom Martine urobila s ním zmluvu ohľadne knihy Ale nevedela som, že kniha tak ekoro vyjde z tlače, Co Bom ti však hovorila o tom prekvapení, netýkalo sa to knihy, ani oáz, ale týkalo sa to len teba. Áno, len teba som chcela prekvapiť." Priznávala sa ako vinnička. “C! tušiš, na So narážam?” "čosi som cítila,” nadhodila Katka prívetivo. "To jest, myslela som, že som bola na pravej ceste, podozrievajúc vás... Teraz som sa presvedčila, že som sa mýlila." "Nie, Katka, nemýlila si sa. Prezradil ma náš sused. Teraz vieš, kto bol náš hosť," presvedčivé povedala. sú pre nich zdrapom papieru Výbor solidarity s Ivanom Polanským vydal nasledovné vyhlásenie: "Ivan Polanský 52- ročný katclí eky aktivista z Dubnice nad Váhom, bol nedávnu odsúdený na 4 roky väzenia za rozmnožovanie a rozširovanie publikácii a písomností väčšinou s náboženskou a historickou tématikou.

Stachanw, ktorý' v auguste 1935 vydoloval 105 ton ISBfjťv septembri to ^výsíľna^T ton, bol poctený Leninovou cenou roku 1970. Zomrel roku 1977- Toto odhalenie pravdy o sovietskom hrdinovi je isto nepríjemné aj Gor- bačovi, ktorý 20. septembra 1935 pri prfleätoBti 50, výročia stacbanovského hnutia povedal, že toto hnutie je symbolom iniciatívy a boja nového proti starému", a že “ukázalo morálku krásu človeka novej spoločnosti" Sovietska "glaa- nosť", ak bude ďalej pokračovat, iste vynesie na svetlo ešte mnohé iné pravdy, ktoré v minulosti boli zatajované, a prekrúcané. — Sovietske združenie psychiatrov a neurológov požiada- *-xlo Medzinárodné psychiatrické združenie, aby ho aiova prijali za člena.

Medzinárodné psychiatrické združenie je ešte stále ustarostené o osud asi 70 pacientov, ktorých držia v sovietskych väzeniach pre ich politické presvedčenie. BELEHRAD — Prof. Slobodan SeleniČ. predseda Združenia spisovateľov v Juhoslávii, v rozhovore, uverejnenom v talianskom denníku ÍL GIORNA- LE, medziiným hovorí, že v Ju- hcslávii je teraz väčšia dobodá, čo vidno aj z toho, že bol zvolený za predsedu, hoci nie je členom strany.

Povedal, že vürianeka katedrála, ktorú změnili na múzeum neveriacich (ateistov) po včlenení Litvy do Sovietskeho zväzu roku 1940. bude znovu slúžiť k cirkevným službám Vymenovanie nového gen. tajomníka sa dáva do súvislosti so založením v Litve organizácie Litvizaké hnutie pre pe- restrojku.

VÝCHODNÝ BERLÍN — Berlínska biskupská konferencia, ktorá združuje 11 diecéznych ordinárov a pomocných biskupov východného Barifan a Východného Nemecka, povzbudzuje nemeckých katolíkov, žijúcich pod marxistickým reft- mom, ku konštruktívnej spolupráci bo všetkými osobami dobrej vôle. Ale biskupi pritom podčiarkujú v spoločnom liate, ktorý sa v nedeľu 16. októbra čítal vo všetkých kostoloch, že materialistické chápanie sveta nemôže byt pre ‘katolíka základom jeho služby blížnemu. Nemeckí biskupi v liste tiež poukazujú na súvis s dokumen-x tom “Katolícka Cirkev v eo* cialistickom štáte", vydanom v septembri 1086, ktorý bol ad- refiovaný iba kňazom a diakonom z príležitosti prvého národného stretnutia katolíkov v Nemeckej demokratickej republike v Drážďanech v júli 1987, V najnovšom pastierskom Ľste biskupi Východného Nemecka znova zdôrazňujú spôsob, akým sa miestna cirkev môže stať '‘zárodkom nádeje a spásy“ pre krajinu, v ktorej žije a pracuje.

HOLANDSKO — V holandskom hlavnom meste Haag sa konalo stretnutie katolíckych liturgiatov nemeckej rečovej oblasti, s to 2 Holandska, Švajčiarska, Nemeckej spolkovej republiky a Rakúska — spolu 60 osôb. Ústrednou témou tohto stretnutia bolo "Liturgia a priestor dnes". Išlo hlavne o štúdium vzťahov medzi liturgiou a umením, od architektúry po hudbu a tanec. Výsledkem stretnutia je zintenzívnenie rozhovoru medzí umením a Cirkvou.

BRITSKÝ MINISTER zahraničných vecí Sir Geffrey Howe varoval, že sovietske ohrozenie Európy trvá a nesmie sa toto podceňovat. Bolo by nemúdre ‘'reality” v Sovietskom zväze zabudnut. Realita je, povedal Howe, že ‘'Sovietsky zväz zostáva pri jeho ofenzívnom vo- jenskom stanovisku. že každých 36 dni je odoyzdaná do služby nová ponorka a že SSSR sleduje úplné modernizovanie strategických medzikontinen- tálnych vojenských sú”.

JEHO KRÁĽOVSTVO "Moje kráľovstvo nie je stadiaľto" (Jn 18.36) Svojho času vraj na Slovensku žil brat benediktinskej rehole, menom Vavřinec. 211 a zomrel v chýre svätosti. Svojim milým zjavom vraj viac kázal, ako svojimi slovami. Aj v tom najväčšom zhone denného živote, si vraj vždy zachoval svoju duševnú rovnováhu. Zvedavcom, čo sa ho pýtali po tajomstve. Čo ho udržuje v Jeho duševnom pokoji a šťastí, vždy mal odpoveď, že je to Ježíš, Kráľ jeho celého života. Vraj si vždy živo uvedomuje Jeho prítomnosť, ske každého povoláva do svojho kráľovstva šťastia a pokoja... Cirkev katolícka dnes, s celým nebom oslavuje kráľovstvo Krista Kráľa úprimne sa mu podrobme, aby bol Kristus aj našim Kráľom. 1. Kristovo kráľovstvo. Neverecký tzv. pokrok a premudrovaná filozofia našich časov nám už toho mnoho nasľubovali. Vraj už vedia vysvetliť aj tie najväčšie tajomstvá života a preto vraj pre Človeka tžv. pokroku Je ponižujúce, aby ešte veril v Boha, aby sa riadil Sv. Písmom, aby sa ešte modlil, atď. A výsledok? .Vlády sa’ topia v nedôvere svojho obyvateľstva, inflácia na svete nevešti nič dobrého, počet vrážd a samovrážd sa množí, ľud. najmä mládež sa oddáva alkoholu a iným otravám, manželstvá sa rozvádzajú, rodina sa rozpadáva a krv nenarodených tečie celou zemeguľou. Teda zúfalstvo sa Šíri na všetkých stranách a utopia neve- rankého pokroku krachuje na celej čiare. Len kráľovstvo Kristovo stojí, je pevné, víťazné a bude víťaziť na veky. O sláve Kristovho kráľovstva hovoria aj cirkevní otcovia II. vatikánskeho snemu vo svojej konštitúcii o Cirkvi (3í). Hovoria, že Kristus, poslušný až na smrť, vstal, bol povýšený od Otca a vstúpi! do svojho kráľovstva (Flp 2. 8-9). Jemu je pod- riadané všetko, kým On sám nepodrobí všetko stvorenie Otcovi, aby bol Boh všetko a vo všetkom. íl Kor 15, 21-28) Vi aj prorok Daniel íDn 7, 13-14), ako čítame v prvom čítaní, predvídal večné kráľovstvo hudúceho Vykupiteľa, ktorý donesie nádej každému, kto sa s dôverou obráti na Všemohúceho Pána neba l zeme. Daniel tu píše v zajatí, keď pravé náboženstvo bolo prenasledovaná a vyznávači viery v pravého Boha boli likvidovaní Daniel posmeľuje veriacich, aby neklesali, lebo veď, že Pán príde: “Ako Syn človeka... Jemu bude oddaná vláda t Kráľovstvo, takže lemu budú slúžiť všetky národy, kmene a nárečia... Jeho vláda nezahynie.’* V príbehu dnešného evanjelia (Jn 18. 22-37) Syn človeka. Pán Ježiš, Pán neba i zeme, stoji pred Pilátovým súdom. Ide mu o život a predsa svoje vyhlásenie, že On Je skutočný Kráľ, neodvoláva. Podotýka ale, že Jeho Kráľovstvo: “Nie je stadiaľto“. Uisťuje tým Pitáta, aby sa nebál, že nestratí svoje kráľovstvo, lebo Kristovo Kráľ-Yvstvo není polltlnkfyani národné, ale duševné, pre všetkých žijúcich, je večné. Teda, Ježiš je Kráľom neba t zeme a každého srdca, ktoré Hc vo viere b v láske príjma. Tí. čo ho príjmu, sú "priateľmi Pravdy, lebo počúvajú na Jeho hlas". »-<<*«» sa Jeho večnými zásadami a žijú novým životom, životom díetok Božích. 2. Úprimne sa aj my podriaďme Kristovi, aby bo! aj naším Kráľom. Tým. že nás Pán Boh stvoril z prachu zeme, nám dal najavo, že zem bude podnožen nášho pozemského života. Tým ale, že nás stvoril na svoj obru*', nám povedal, že patríme do Jeho kráľovstva. Cieľom nášho života teda není tento pominuteľný svet a teda ani tma a zúfalstvo hrobu na cintoríne. Keď sme sa odbočili zo svojho večného cieľa, Ježiš. Syn Boha živého, Kráľ neba i zeme, sa pokoril na svet. Vzal biedu nášho hriechu na seba. vyniesol Ju na Kalváriu, zomrel a vstal z mŕtvych, aby nám zas otvoril bránu svojho kráľovstva. Pri sv. krste nás vzkriesený Kristus Kráľ posvätil svojou milosťou, dáva nám potrebné sily, aby sme vládali žlť z lásky k nemu a ako pútnici, dôjsť do Jeho večného Kráľovstva. Preto sv. Ján v druhom čttani (Zjav 1, 5-C) líči Cirkev, ako kráľovstvo Ježišovo. Cirkev Je Kristovou nevestou, ktorá žije len Janu a očakáva Jeho druhý, víťazný príchod. Kristus Kráľ: "Ktorý nás miloval a svojou krvou vykúpil z hriechov, si nás urobil Kráľovstvom a käazml Boha Otca svojho. Jemu sláva a vláda na veky vekoví Amen." Mv, ktorí sme boli pokrstení vodou a Duchom Svätým, stali sme sa právoplatnými členmi Kristovho Kráľovstva, Cirkvi svätej. Sv. Ján nám tu opisuje naše večné poslanie, ako členov Cirkvi, ktoré ľudsky ťažko vyjadriť. Sme údami Kráľovstva, ktorého sláva sa začala Kristovým zmŕtvych vstáním a bola aj nám zaručená. Už teraz máme len Jej žlť, aby sme plnosť jej ovocia zažívali, keď uvidíme Krista Kráľa, ako svojho Spasiteľa vo večností. Pilát neroaumel Kristovi, keď sa vyhlásil za Kráľa kráľov. Nerozumejú ho ani terás tí, čo si počínajú, ako Piláti našej doby. Kristus ale aj trvá na svojom Božskom práve, ktoré mu od večnosti patrí. On má p!né právo panovať v našich srdciach, ktoré si stvoril b svojou predrahou krvou vykúpil. Kristus ale nehodlá pttoovať žiadnou politickou alebo vojenskou mocou. On chce, aby sa Jeho Pravda šírila svetom, aby svet prijal Jeho lásku a spravodlivosť a aby Ju každý z nás uviedol do života. Kristus Kráľ chce vládnuť naším celým srdcom bez výhrady. Za svoju nekoneční! lásku očakáva našu nerozdielnu lásku. Tak, ako zakusujeme Jeho lásku, Jeho milosrdenstvo a Jeho súcit s našimi slabosťami, Kristus očakáva, že sa tou istou láskou, tým istým súcitom a milosrdenstvom budeme deliť s tými, ktorých nám pošle do cesty živote. Tým vlastne dokazujeme, ako si vážime, alebo nevážime Jeho dobrotu, Jeho lásku a milosrdenstvo. ak milujeme nielen priateľov, ale i nepriateľov. Od časov Kristových sa už mnohí pokúšali a sa ešte aj teraz pokúšajú zničiť Kristovo Kráľovstvo a všetci zničili, vždy samých seba. Kristus Kráľ ešte aj dnes vládne a bude vládnuť m veky, lebo* "Jeho Kráľovstvo nie je stadiaľto "■ Obnovme s! teda dnes svoju vernosť Kristovi Kráľovi a urobme to najmä pri sv. prijímaní, veď On Je ešte vždy: “Pán, ktorý kraľuje, ob lečený vo svojej velebnosti" (ž 92) hovorí medzlspev tejto sv. omše, život bez Krista Je hotové hynutie, kým s ním je život skutočný... áno. aj záruka večná!

Prednášali sa básne, ktoré napísal kňaz Martin Rázus a ktorého nazývali “svedomie národa". Antónia Vlčková z Wlndsoru, Vladimír Machajdík z Washingtonu a Sylvia Galvňnkovú, Milan Jakubec a Dušan Tóth f z Toronta prispeli recitáciou. Majster Štefan Gal vánek obohatil tento večer výstavou svojich posledných výtvarných prác. V nedeľu predpoludním bolí slávnostné služby Božie, na ktorých odznela kázeň, ktorú povedal Martin Rázus 21. septembra 1923 ako moravsko-lieskovský farár pri inštalácii senihra Ia sendorálneho dozoru Trenčianskeho seniorátu. Kázeň ktorá bola založená na texte z NehemiAŠa 2. kapitoly "Obhliadajme naše múry“, aj po 60. rokoch bola Živá a neobyčajne aktuálna. Po slávnostnom bankete, ktorý bol v hale kostola, program bol venovaný dvom významným výročiam, a to 140. výročiu -od Štúrovej revolúcie a tiež 100. výročiu od narodenia Martina Rá- , zusa.Milan Jakubec, bývalý major letectva mal prednášku k 140. výročiu slovenskej samostatnosti, kde povedal: “Štúrovci začali svoju revolúciu v septembri 1648, keď na Myjave smelo vyhlásili: "My týmto, za nesúvislých od Maďarov sa vyhlasujeme" a potom veľmi pekne zhodnotil toto významné výročie v dejinách slovenského národa, ktoré podoprel výrokmi samouiého Štúra a slovami Andreja Hlinku: "Naša bitá,, žalářovaná, prenasledovaná pravda zvíťazí a zvíťaziť musí” a v TuriSauskora sv. Martine 30. októbra 1918 ^ase vyhlásil: "Tisícročné manželstvo s Maďarmi sa nevydarilo, musíme sa rozísť." Tým boli kocky hodené a Slovensko sa prihlásilo do Československého i &tátu, Vstúpilo tam ber dohody, ale skúsenosti Slovákov s Mb- i tfarmi boli také zlé, že už nič nemohlo byť horšie", povedal na I záver Milan Jakubec.

Lojze Beree prispel svojou plesňou "Ako chlieb fé je sloboda". Sylvia Galvánková zarecitovala báseň "ô, buď tí chvála" a nakoniec Rev. Dušan Tóth povedal nasledovný prejav k storočnici od narodenia Martina Rázusa: L Buď ti chvála... Kňaz, básnik, ipUcvateľ, Martin Ráaus, zanechal v plesni "ó, buď Ti chvála" takéto vyznanie: "Pred tvárou Tvojou, Pane, sľubujeme, že v otcov viere pevne vždy stáť chceme.

Tieto slová vypovedal v rannej plesni “Keď slnko vzcho Narodíl sa vo Vrbici dňa 18. októbra 1888 v rodine garbiara, ktorý svojou rozvahou, prísnosťou vzbudzoval rešpekt nielen vo svojej rodine, ale aj v Širšej pospolitosti. Martin zdedil po otcovi mnohí spomínané vlastnosti a i dokonca aj krstné meno. Matka, T Mária, rodená Petříková, jemnocitná a hlboko veriaca žena, vyprevadí]» do sveta šestoro detí, a to Martina, Michala, Jána, Mateja, Ondreja a jedinú dcéru Má" riu. Zdravú prísnosť, skôr bieda ako hojnosť, výrazná zbožnosť formovala Život mladého Martina, ktorý po svedomitom štúdiu doma 1 v zahraničí zameral svoje celoživotné úsilie na bo j q spravodlivosť svojho ľudu, kto- * rámu chcel verne slúžiť. Jeho zriedkavá bystrosť a pohotovosť F“’'"" 1888-1937 ho piedur&l k tomu, aby hľadal vždy cesty zmierenia a krajšej budúcnosti svojho národa. Doba, v ktorej žil a tvoril, bola veľmi zložité. Nebál sa ľudí, lebo miloval Boha, jeho nebojácnosť vyrástla s viery. Po skončení teologického štúdia ako kňaz odišiel na dlhšiu študijnú cestu do Londýna. Edlnburgu, Švajčiarska, Francúzska, Palestíny a tak si rozšíril obzor svojich vedomostí. Keď sa vrátil domov, nešiel svojho otca na smrteľnej posteli a vyprevadil si ho na večnosť 2. marca 1913. V tomto roku bol inštalovaný za farára v Pribyline, kde rozvinul svoju literárnu tvorbu pížuc verše, ktoré uverejňoval v cirkevných i svetských časopisech. Od začiatku svojho účinkovania bol obklopený kruhom priateľov i neprajníkov, ktorí strpčovali Jeho život. Jeho sestra, Mária MartákováJ_x^pisala o ňom v Národných novinách v roku 1941 toto: "Martin bol vždy sám, ale nikdy nie tak strašne sám, ako ku koncu svojho života. Tí, ktorí mu mali najvernejšie pomáhať, tí ho nenávideli, vylúčili i Jeho knihy z knižnice a vyniesli na poval. Dôveroval a všetci jeho dôveru sklamali." A v tých najkritickejších chvíľach, deň pred smrťou si takto zavzdychal; "Pochopia ma azda, keď ma viac nebude." A toto jeho proroctvo sa s'čosti naplnilo. Rázus si bol vedomý, že Jeho služba cirkvi je aj službou národu, & preto zdôrazňoval, že táto služba musí byť kvalitná, Cirkev musí dať národu farárov, ktorí budú stáť vždy verne v službe lásky. A celej slovenskej inteligencii adresoval tieto slová: "Nielen chlebom Je iivf človek, ale každým slovom vychádzajúcim skrze ústa Boäe." V Pribyline vydal verš?: "Z tichých a búrlivých chvil’’*, "Hoj zem drahá", 'To je vojna" a iné. Keď odišiel z Prlbyllny do Moravského tfeskcvého, napísal tam štvordielny román "Svety”, "Kameň na medzi'', “Šípy duša" a iné. Tu sl získal úctu a obdiv ako kazateľ, ktorý svojimi kázňami priťahoval do chrámu Božieho húfy ľudí, pozorných poslucháčov. Medzi jeho veľkých obdivovateľov patril aj prof. dr. Štefan Adamovíč, ktorý o ňom napísal: "Keby Rázus pisci svoje kázne a vydal ich tlačou, prekladali by Ich ako cenně perly do emulzích jazykov." Po 9 rokoch odchádza z Moravského Lieskového do Brezna, kde aj katolíci prichádzali na Jeho kázne, ktorých hlavné myšlienky zhrnul vždy do výstižných veršov a tie si poslucháči zapisovali. A tak sa zachoval' nmehé Jeho propozície aj zásluhou Jeho najobľúbenejšieho kaplána Pavla Pivku a Juraja Kevlcké- ho, ktorí zachytili mnoho cenného materiálu 2 jeho káařtových myšlienok. Rázusbvé kázne nebolí dogmatické, ale praktické. Etazus vedel do kázne vložiť výstižné obrazy z každodenného života. Od starších kňazúv sa odlišoval tým, že svojsky riešil problémy. Nebál so odkryť zlo a vždy ho odhalil ako hriech proti Bohu. Vracal sa cez Písmo k žtvotť.. Každému stavu hovoril jeho re čou a vedel sa pohybovať v knihu ich predstáv a myšlienok, vnášajúc do nich svetlo evanjelia. Nezatváral oči pred verejným životom a vždy sa cez chrám pozeral do života. Veď sám, takto hovoril: "Úlohou kazateľa ja Otvárať cestu k šťastiu dietok Božích na zemi, s pokračovaním tam za hrobom," Casto svoju činnosť usmerňoval do Šírky a potom mu neostávalo veľa času na tndsijnú prácu, dôkazom toho sú aj slová jeho veršovaného vyslania: “Ty vieš, Pane, ako som Ta hľadal bez ustania, za bielych dni. Jak za nocí čiernych. Ty vieš, ako lkala duša zbědovaná v bolestiach tvrdých, prenesmiernych... Ty vieš, že keď som sa k nohám múdrych vrhal, čo mi dsü, čo mi povedali, uzrieť som Ta chcel sám, Majstra, z tvári v tvár 1 zachodíl som zem tú svätú, aby som Ti vrátil všetky Tvoje dary " Rázus vo svojich kázňach často zdôrazňoval, že sa v chráme Božom stretávame akc rodina a rozchádzame sa potom rôznymi smermi. Nutná je v našom živote stála reforma, s to "in capíte et in membris", v hlave a údoch. Kládol veľký dôraz na modlitby a náboženské piesne. Vytváral nové formy modlitieb a piesní, a to nie preto, že si nevážil dedičstvo po otcoch, ale že každá generécia sa musí raz prezentovať pred budúcnosťou. Modlieval sa naspamäť ?. zdôrazňoval silu modlitby, z ktorej musí prýštiť sila ducha a presvedčenia veriacich. Bol v rokoch vrcholnej aktivity a bol by z tých Jeho duchovných darov zanechel ešte veľa veršov, plesní a literárneho odkazu, keby nebola zastavila jeho búrlivý život predčasná smrť. V Březne teda dokončil svoju plodnú prácu. Na knižných pultoch sa objavili romány, ktoré čerpali z dávnej histórie, ako »Odkaz mrtvých“. "Júlia" "Krčmársky kráľ", "Bombura“ a hlavne veľmi obľúbený “Maruško" a "Marcško študuje", v ktorých zachytil svo|e detstvo. Okrem týchto diel v Březne napísal "Ahasfér", “Bača Pútera", “Pred tvárou Božou" a mnohé iné. Siahal k postavám mŕtvych, aby ich staval za vzor živým, lebo takto sám tvrdil: "Predkovia dieto započali, my v ňom pokra- čujeme'«vy ho midtP-diTvŕSť.* Drv kanca života aktívne tvoři),- priam chrlil nové myšlienky, ktoré keď už sám nemohol, zaznamenával spomínaný kaplán Povel Pivko a jeho zať Gäbe Rapoš- Vo vedomí. Že čas jeho života sa veľmi kráti, nadiktava1, ešte tieto verše na rozlúčku: “Keď rty moje zamlknu a z rúk bezodkladne zvučí nástroj na zem osirelú padne, zvíria všetky struny disonantným praskom ako posledný ston, po živote tvrdom po živote ťažkom.

A keď dójdú vďační hrob môj pcpollevať, precítim to, že predsa hodno holo trpieť, hodno bolo spieval'," A tak dňa 8. augusta 1937 osirela rodina, brezniansky cirkevný zbor a široká evanjelická rodina n v predzvesti smrtí sa naplnili slová jeho sestrv Márie, ktorá vyspievala takúto elégiu: ’■ Raz pretúboko pokloním sa zemi s nikdy viac- z nej nevstanem a vtedy teplé lôžka ustelie tni, čarovná moja zem."

Jozef Cíncík, dr. H. Bartek, dr. F. Hrušovský a celý rad ínvch. Nečakali sme to z. dvoch príčin. V zborníku Slováci v zahra- nfči 4. 12 <1987) František Bielik vo svojom referáte dáva do výhľadu určité zmeny postoja k Skjvákom v zahraničí. Po druhé preto, že Slovensko má dnes dostatok kvalifikovaných historikov, aby seriózne zachytili históriu Slovákov v krajinách slobodného sveta. Sú síce zavretí dc marxistickej kazajky, čo treba ľutovať, ale ich práce to celkom neznehodnocuje. é:as odvete marxistický balast a ideologickú nenávisť a skutočný vedecký výskum, ktorý ss roztescd do hĺbky aj do šírky, zostane pre národnú kultúru historiografiu prínosom. Ich zásluhou líž doteraz historio^rafia o Slovákoch v slobodnom zahraničí sa rozrástla a mi predpoklady, podľa Bieli- kovifôyeferátu. rozvíjať sa aj d alej, ak režim sa bude odteraz držať správneho postoja, že "Dejiny nášho národa niežeby neboli neúplné, ale sú neodmysliteľné bez dejín nášho vysťahovalectva ..A samozrejme budú sa rozrastať, ak sa rozprestrú na všetky vlny emigrácií5 a budú sa zbierať a objektívne interpretovať nielen materiály o pomerne nepatrných "robotníckych spolkoch“, alebo len o Slovákoch v "socialistických" krajinách, ale v celom sveta, a bez ideologických předpojatosti. Početne aj významom s'AI? ešte Slováci na amarickom kontinente sú najdôležitejšou časťou Slovákov v zahraničí. Ako Bielik správne píše, dejiny amerických ŕ vrátane kanadských! Slovákov možno "v podstate začleniť do troch hlavných etáp. Prvá siaha od začiatkov masového vysťahovalectva do skončenia prvej svetovej vojny. Druhá zahrňuje medzivojnové obdobie 8 druhú svetovú vojnu, Tretia rdapa sa v mnohom Odlišuje Od predchádzajúcich. Začína koncom druhej svetovej vojny a siaha až do súčasnosti". Hoci "hospodárske, sociálne, političke a kultúrne dejiny" týchto Slovákov boli a sú najvýznamnejšie, iste by nebolo fair ko dokázať, že dosiaľ sp. o nich napísalo v pomere ich významu a počtu k emigráciám v "socialistických" krajinách veľmi málo a ešte menej pozitívne; že pramálo starosti venovali zbieraniu a zachraňovaniu materiálov, osobných archívov, novín a kníh: že noviny a knihy nemali ani prístup na Slovensko a posledné zadarmo sa šrotovali; a bibliografia. ktorá sa na Slovensku tiež rozrástla do nevídaných rcxmerov, neodvážila sa dosiaľ ani zaz- namenať ich existenciu. Pritom nielen pracovníkom Odboru Matice slovenskej pre zahraničných Slovákov, ale aj režimu v Bratislave musí byť jasné, že sa z týchto materiálov málo zachová, ak sa to ponechá na spolky & rodiny kultúrnych, spolko vých a politických pracovníkov medzi americkými a kanadskými Slovákmi. Podľa BJeltkovho referátu je dnes na Slovensku inštitucionálna báza aj dosť kvalifikovaných odborníkov pre seriózny výskum a záchranu archívnych materiálov dejín zahraničných Slovákov. Jaswuje aj vedomie, že do "mozaiky našich dejín vkladali svoj« časti aj naši vysťahovalci" ... a že z týchto dôvodov boli & sú Dredraetem niíbo výskumu, aby sme poznali Ich vklad do našich dejín a tr vp všetkých oblastiach .. Zaiste správny postoj. J? však aj sprívna prax? A prejaví aa tento postoj aj pri tých plánovaných "syntetických dejinách o vysťahovalectve Slovákov ako pri príprave Encyklopédie zahraničných krajanov'’? "Je všeobecne máme — píše Bielik — že priebehom desaťročí života našich vysťahovalcov v cudzine ťu vznikli ich nové kultúrne prejavy, literárne diela, pričinili sa o všespoločenský a technický pokrok, vydávali sí vlastnú tlač, zakladali spolky- .

In his talk on cale- ches«, the pope said the church cannot expect today's culture lo provide its members with frame work for religious growth He said society today is dominated by a "civilization of images" as seen through TV. films and magazines, and by the rapid spread of scientific and cultural inlormalion. "transmitted in glib and caichy language" "in this context. God is not discussed, Religion is considered a private lact. or is presented from a critical or negative angle." he said. By John ThaviS Catholics' religious education, the pope said, usually stops at first Communion or confirmation This means that their faith can end up being dangerously weakened, he said. Yet today's adult believer has "hunger and thirst lor a Irving God’’ and is orty apparently indifferent" toward religion, the pope said. He recommended that <he church, first ol all, go back lo these adults and "explain ail the reasons lor ihe rational credibility that Christianity expresses." The "hisloncaJ aspect" should be emphasized, he said. The church should also make sure catechesis touches tne lives of its members bv drawing from everyday experiences and stressing ihe faith's openness to science and culture. In this way. he said, "(he contemporary adult, who is deval- • ued by a materialistic and con sumeristic society, gradually and with satisfaction regains his human dignity and value." The pope added that Ihe language end media of modern cate- chess should also catch people’s interest. That evening, ihe pope spoke to leaders of many larths who were meeimg in Rone on the Second anniversary of the ^orld day of prayer in Assisi, tha iřterreligicus encounter called by Ihe pope. The pope said that although the threat of conflict has not disappeared from tne world^and although some people still iety on the force ol weapons to solve disputes, the prayer movement began al Assisi was making a real difference. He said dialogue, encounter and iriendship among religions, along with the commitment to prayer, was giving binh to a "new language of peace " "This new climate breaks, or at least calls into question, the fatal chain of divisrons inherited from ihe past Or generated by modern ideologies: it has inaugurated a season in which Ihe voice of wisdom ts making rtseif heard." Ihe pope Said. The pope pledged that the Cath- ofic Church inlands to ‘share in and promote" such ecumenical and in- lerreligious cooperation. The Mass Oct. 30 to mark the first decade of this pontificate was celebrated by West German Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, head cl the Vatican's doctrinal congregation. The ceremony was sponsored by the West German Catholic community and featured the chorus and orchestra of the Munich Opera Theater in a performance of one of Beethoven's best-known religious works. Afterward in an Angelus blessing. tha pope recalled Pope John XXIII. praising his paternal concern for the church and his "wise and faithful leaching." Oct. 28 marked the 30th anniversary cl Pope John's electron. Laier Oct. 30. the pope visited the pansh of Torre Angela in a densely populated Rome suburb with serious social problems, including drug use among youths, and homelessness among young couples and Gypsies. “Your parish is called on to be an open community,' in other words. 1 ■ placed at (he generous service of all those who ask tor yriur help, " Ihe pope said in a sermon.
