SOKOLSKY VĚSTNÍK Bulletin of Gymnastic Association Sokol San Francisco j i 847 North San Mateo Drive San Mateo. CA 94401 Sokol Hall: 415-347-2033 VOLUME XXIII NOVEMBER - DECEMBER, 1989 ISSUE 6 In Czechoslovakia, the Christmas season begins on December sixth and ends on January sixth. The Czech Christmas tree usually has gaily colored pinwheels that look Eke snowflakes and twinkling stars. Gilded walnuts and egg shells are decorated as the bodies of strange-looking fish. Many children still believe that St. Nick descends from a golden cord led by a white-clad angel. The children go to bed early on Christmas Eve, hoping St. Nick will stop at their home and leave a present for them. They often sleep beneath the Christmas table on straw bedding, reminiscent of the humble birth of Christ. The Christmas menu includes caraway cabbage, roe soup, and Bohemian koiache. In former days and probably in many Czech homes today, party fun was of the homespun variety, and many games and customs were directed at discreet pairing of the young. The young girls had a variety of schemes to get the young men of their fancy in the mood for marriage. For example, little boats were made of walnut shell halves and were floated, holding lighted candles, in a tub of water. The girl whose candle burned the longest could expect to marry in the next year. Christmas, to the people of Czechoslovakia, means the ending of quarrels and beginning a new year among friends. It is the custom for people to visit each other and forgive any misunderstandings that may have arisen during the year.

From the basic ideals upon which it was founded, has grown the present American Sokol Organization, which unites the member organizations located in almost every part of the United States. The Sokol idea has stemmed from the spirit of the Czech nation. The Czech national heritage, includes democratic feeling, moral earnestness, and a yearning for liberty. A Sokol values strength and fortitude, fulfilled by brotherly love, beyond the wealth of the world. Sokols are unalterably opposed to every ideology—regardless of the name—which deprives people of the right of free choice in their own land. The Sokol movement has evolved from the great idea that bodily health produces mental and moral health. The Sokols strive for physical improvement, moral purity and nobility, concord, equality and sincerity. In the gymnasium, the Sokols instill in adult and junior members the ideals of directness, manliness and self-respect. Toward the United States and its citizens, they feel a bond of loyalty which nothing can alter. The Sokols have never hesitated to sacrifice their possessions or their lives when the welfare, freedom, and prosperity of the United States has required it. They have defended the priceless ideals of independence and the American way of life against the covetous hands of selfish interests. They have shielded these ideals against all attacks. The annals of two World Wars are replete with their deeds, and the graves which mark the far-flung battlefields of the world attest to this fact. The Sokols require one obligation of all their members—that they live their lives honorably, be faithful to the truth and be proud of their citizenship in this great and just country, the United States of America. The Sokols have pledged themselves to help in the creation of a better world, peopled by an improved and more united humanity; to aid in bringing about an age of good faith which would guarantee democracy to all men and women—an age in which life would be free from disturbances so that men and nations would be convinced that it is impossible to build prosperity and happiness on the unhappiness and suffering of others. The Sokols pledge themselves to help in the mobilization of all the energy of men and machines for useful production, and are prepared to make all sacrifices. Thus have the Sokols progressed in the past, and thus they intend to advance till the end of time.

It was good to see you all in good shape and unhurt after the big earthquake. During this stay, the Fresno and Los Angeles officers got a better picture of how Sokol San Francisco is doing. All of us are confident that through more contacts and cooperation of planned events and actions, we can help each other much better. According to the election held on October 28, I was elected president of the District; with sis.Blanche Duffy as vice-president, bro.Liska Secretary, sis.Pelc ireasurer, sis. Nekuda educational director, sis.Riddle director of women, bro. Procházka director of men, We are happy to see that Sokol San Francisco and it^s executive board is ready to keep Sokol up. As in other units of the District, there is a need of more instructors and of a wider space for the Sokol activities, especially gymnastics. These two tasks must become our priorities in the next year. Please study the article written by bro.Riha in the Slet Program Book. Enclosed you will find a review of this article applied to Sokol Los Angeles. As far as all your improvements are concerned, the District would be more than happy to give you advice or help with making important decisions. So please do not hesitate to contact the District Board. We also would like to express our joy and admiration to sister Mary Frances Meier who is editing regularly your Vestnik, for her excellent work. Nazdar! Joseph Zelenka President Secretary [pageend3]SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO VĚSTNÍK NOVEMBER - DECEMBER, 1989 PAGE - 4 THE TRUTH HURTS - TRUE OR FALSE - We have announced that we are celebrating our 85th Anniversary. THAT DIDN’T HURT! We sent a letter in-forming everyone that a program commemorating this memorable event was being planned, and asked Sokol members and friends of Sokol to support this effort. THAT DIDN'T HURT! Here is another truth. It takes only one hand to count the wellwishes and/or ads that we have received from our Sokol members. Now, I'm talking about ONLY Sokol San Francisco members. We have had response from outside businesses. We have had response from Vestnik subscribers, and we have had response from other Sokol Units and Districts. THAT HURTS!! Because I believe in Sokol and try to live by Sokol Ideals I find it hard to understand that out of over 100 members we have so few that choose to do no more than to pay their annual dues. THAT HURTS!! We have a handful of people who are holding our Unit together. People who volunteer many hours to keep the hall in good order, to put on dances, to prepare delicious dinners, and to do all the business necessary to running a Sokol Unit. Is there such apathy among San Francisco Sokols that they don't care what is happening. One would think under those circumstances that Sokol in the Bay Area might have a tough time surviving on the 1900’s. THAT HURTS! Still, we are a small vital group that could very well succeed in the future promotion of Sokol Ideals in the Bay Area. We are currently studying plans to remodel the hall: to study the possibilities of applying for a grant to further the understanding and teaching of Sokol Ideals, and our letters of response from government officials have not only offered their congratulations on our 85th Anniversary, but assistance in promoting the Sokol Ideals. AND THAT'S THE TRUTH! I HE TRUTH—Are you going to help Sokol grow to new heights in ■1990? [pageend4]SOKOL SAM h-RANCIbCO VLSI NIK NOVEMBER - DECEMBER, 1987 ťHUt - I The Following was prepared by Edmund Teyrovsky from various historical books. Excursions into Czechoslovak Distant Past From the Beginnings of Czechoslovak History The earliest human inhabitants in Czechoslovak countries seems to appear some 500,000 years ago. There is one unusual find of very old tooth possibly from Homo Erectus on Golden Hill at Predetice close to Brandýs Nad Labem not far from Prague (“Na Zlatém Kopli v Prezleticích u Brandýsa nad Labem"). If this tooth (left lower molar) can be verified, it would be the oldest human remain in Europe still older than Heiderlberg1s man that is estimate to live 900,000 years ago. It maybe of interest to review classification of oldest cultures: 1. Osteodentokeratic culture meaning bone culture left remains simple tools, sticks, bones from long mammals, animal teeth left by Australopthecantropus. 2. Olduvai also called Oldowan, old paleolithic culture with very simple stone tools by Homo Habilis. This was investigated by Professor Leakey in Olduvai,Tanzania Africa. 3. Abbevilian, better stone tools were used, they made handles, sharp points, cutting edge, etc. These people were called Pithecantropus and particularly Homo Erectus. 4, Acheulian time was of more advanced Homo Erectus. Tools were more advanced such as knives, drills, scrapes etc. 5. Mousterian (about 35-40,000 years ago) was culture of Neadertal .Men. They lived in Europe, Africa, Asia. They left large variety of tools. Krapina finds in Yugoslavia is from this period. 6. Szeletian was culture of hunters. They used rich variety of tools also from bones, horns and mammoth tusks. Here we find first known artistic objects, statuettes, carvings in bones/ beautiful cave paintings. Finds near Brno are from this time. 7. Arignacian (4 stages) culture has large assortment of arms and tools. This culture was work of already true man, Homo Sapiens Cro-Magnon is about from 25,000 B.C. Finds in Predmosti in Moravia belong to this period. 8. Glavettian period is more advance stage after Aurignacian left us with variety of tools and arms. Inhabitants main occupation was hunting for mammoths and reindeers. Excellent finds were in M°ravia under Pavlov's Hills. This find is so important that archeological textbooks classifies whole period (later z Leptolithic) by name Pavlovian with finds in Predmosti, Doln/, Věstonice, Pavlov; From this period is the world famous Venus of Věstonice, discovered in 1925: it is a remarkable statue some 11cm high made from mixture of powdered mammoth ivory, clay and fat; the horizontal groove on the hips may indicate a belt. 9. Solutrean (about 18,000-14,000 B.C.) is from younger Paleolithic culture. It contains well made tools with thin edges.

The Muscovite viewers audibly relished the erotic humor and vigorously applauded the anti-Communist dialogue. They stayed with it until 3 a.m. (although the Metro subway system closes at 1 a.m.) and gave San Francisco director Philip Kaufman a standing ovation. Publicity for the “Sex in American Cinema” series at the Moscow Film Festival here was so vague that the majority of ticket holders must have had no idea they were going to see a love story set in 1968, immediately before and after the Russian invasion of Prague that crushed Czech hopes for “socialism with a human face.” The audiences’ astonishing reaction unmistakably demonstrated how keenly they still felt the intertwined fate of the Russians and Czechs. Scarlets Secret Pion A “confession” preceded the screening. A beaming Peter Scarlet, executive director of the San Francisco International Film Festival, which arranged for the "Sex in American Cinema” series to be shown here, told the audience that the program was a pretext “to get you to see Kaufman’s film.” “Many of us have dreamed for a long time of showing this in Moscow,” he said. Kaufman — who based the script on the novel by Czech dissident author Milan Kundera — recalled that he and the largely European cast had often speculated on “whether this film would ever be shown here in our lifetime.” It was something of a miracle that the film was approved for this event. The film, produced by the Saul Zaentz Co. of Berkeley, focuses on three lives: Tomas, a womanizing Prague neurosurgeon; Sabina, a free-spirited artist who enjoys playing sensual games, and Tereza, a winsome country girl. They don’t care about politics, but they all share a quiet stubborn streak of nonconformity, the kind that alarms the bureaucracy. Stunned by Invasion Segment The audience, which had chuckled at the light-hearted opening scenes, fell silent during the seven-minute invasion episode that integrates documentary footage with shots that put Tomas and Tereza into the action. (For the first time, only a few weeks ago, Soviet television showed film clips of the actual event. The official line had been that Russian tanks were garlanded with flowers by welcoming Czechs. According to those who saw it, the recent TV program showed angry Czechs chasing the tanks and Soviet soldiers hiding their faces in embarrassment, a scene that eerily paralleled recent events in Beijing.) In the film’s key nightclub scene, paunchy officials interrupt the pop Czech music to demand a patriotic Russian song. A casual observation made then by Tomas returns to haunt him. Referring to Oedipus Rex in a conversation and later in a monograph printed in a dissident publication, he says, in effect: “At least when Oedipus learned that he had unknowingly killed his father and was sleeping with his mother, he couldn’t stand the sight of plagues ravaging his city as a result of what he had done. He plucked out his eyes and left the kingdom. He did not feel innocent. He felt he had to punish himself, but our leaders, unlike Oedipus, felt they were innocent. When the atrocities of the Stalin period became known, they cried, ‘We didn’t know. We weren’t aware of what was going on. Our conscience is clear.’ The difference, the important difference is that they stayed in power.” Continued on Page -7- Laughter at a Sellout It was still the “Prague Spring,” a time of liberalization, and another doctor urged the reluctant Tomas to have his remarks published. After the Soviet invasion, Tomas and Tereza briefly es- cape to Switzerland but decide to return to Czechoslovakia. The former colleague is now the hospital administrator in an office decorated with photos of Lenin and Brezhnev. The audience’s wry laughter acknowledged the administrator’s sellout and applauded Tomas’ decision not to recant his article under career- threatening pressure trom government officials. The viewers also clearly enjoyed the confrontation between the neurosurgeon Tomas and a sly, unctuous official who demands, “Do you really think Communists should pluck out their eyes? Do you think a politically questionable person should be allowed to operate on brains?" After the screening, George Kapralov, chief film critic for the official newspaper Pravda (Truth), told me, “There were rumors that it was a ‘sex’ film, but it was not. I was so impressed by the artistic values and the poetry, at how deep the human relations were, how simple and spontaneous. It’s astonishing for the Soviet people to see sexual relations that are not like those in American mainstream movies. I was completely amazed to see the invasion by Russian tanks since the official Soviet legend is different.” May Not See Print He said he intended to write a favorable review and added, “But I don’t know if it will be published.” (Pravda, some Russian friends noted, still does not necessarily publish the truth, the whole truth, glasnost notwithstanding.) Because the Czechoslovakian state is resisting glasnost, a Czech professional woman at the screening talked to me on condition that her name not be used. Kundera’s novel is not published in Czechoslovakia, but she read it abroad and loved it. “I didn’t know about the [pageend6]SOKOL LAN Fh ANO i bC O VtL i Na k ímu v u ■- lítuL 'Xcr< > IVav rAbc. - 7 Continued from Page -6- 'Unbearable' Is a Hit film until I came here. At first I was afraid that this event of great importance would be shown superficially, but I am satisfied that the film is done profoundly from both sides. The love story is sweet and tender and the documentary side is very professional. I was so moved because I saw the tanks come into Pilsen. I cried when I heard the pop song by Marta Kubishova in the scene where we saw the dead bodies. I haven’t heard that song since 1968. Now it’s known as the ‘Prayer for Marta’ because she has not sung since that time. It was like a cry. There were other Czechs in the audience who began to hum the tune. Some of us were crying.” She disagreed with a Czech film maker who thought the movie was “too black and white.” “It has many shades,” she said. “I never dreamed I would see such a movie in the Soviet Union. It describes one of the most important moments in our relationship. I have a lot of Russian friends but I never talk with them about that time. It is too delicate a subject. From the psychological point of view, Czechs should know about the Russian reaction to the tnovie. It would improve our relationship.” How Lucky Can You Get? Stop and think for just a minute, About your life and the good things in it. We are blessed to live in the land of the free, With so many advantages for you and me. Where else in the world can you speak as you please, With no fear of beating you down to your knees. We have the right to worship our way, And none can take our freedom away. Our land of plenty has more than the rest, This country of ours is still the best. Just stop and think and I’ll bet, You’ll wonder, how lucky can you get? Ed. Note: Thank you, Betty Svaty. Our life in a free country adds to our Christmas joy. Pope Names 4 Bishops In Czechoslovakia Pope John Paul II, in another step toward normalizing relations between the Catholic Church and the Eastern bloc, appointed four new bishops in Czechoslovakia yesterday. In Czechoslovakia, where there are 15 million Roman Catholics and only 3,000 priests, the Communist government refused until last year to permit the pope to appoint new bishops unless they belonged to the Pacem in Terris (Peace on Earth) state-backed church, which is not recognized by the Holy See. The Vatican statement said the Pope had appointed Monsignor Jan Sokol, 55, as Archbishop of Trnava; the Rev. Josef Kouki, 65, as bishop of Litoměřice; and the Rev. Frantisek Tondra, 53, as bishop of Spis. Harvard will establish Czech/Slovak Studies Harvard University is planning to establish a Chair for Czech and Slovak studies.
