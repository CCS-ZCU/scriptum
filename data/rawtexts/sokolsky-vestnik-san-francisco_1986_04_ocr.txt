WE THANK YOU, Sister President, for making the transition an efficient one. There have been problems to overcome, and a crooked path in need of straightening is in the process. Our meetings are better organized and a planned agenda is followed making our Sokol meetings more effective. They certainly seem to be more enjoyable rather than an ordeal. It is difficult to get back in the harness when rules, by-laws, etc. have fallen by the wayside, and we understand a gentle "hand slap" is sometimes necessary. We will do our darndest to cooperate to make our unit a more enjoyable and efficiently run Sokol.

[pageend3]Sokol San Francisco Vestnik September-October, 1986 Page -4- SPECIAL REPORT - SOKOL INSTRUCTORS' COURSE For the past year, I have led the Children's Gym Class at Sokol as an instructor. In order to get more education about teaching, my unit sent me to Omaha in July to attend Instructor School. I spent 10 days there which consisted of concentrated Sokol instruction. There were about 95 instructor-students and seven teachers. I flew into Omaha airport and was picked up by Br. Benak and Br. Milan. With others, we went to Sokol Hall which quickly filled with other students. In the evening the teachers introduced themselves and explained to us everthing about the school. We were then divided into three classes - beginners, intermediate, and advanced. They then mixed us up into eight groups for special work after regular classes. Saturday was the beginning of instructors school. We arose at 7 am each morning. After the pledge, warm-ups, and breakfast, we started lessons. Our first class was at 9 am, and every lesson lasted 55 minutes with five minutes in between. We learned about Sokol history, terminology, spotting, safety, judging, and working with kids. We also practiced on ourselves the skills we were learning. After one hour for lunch we were again in classes for the afternoon session. Half an hour before dinner, we had singing where we learned songs in Czech and English. There were two more classes after dinner, then we had half an hour for free time, then it was off to study for another hour. We then had another 30 minutes to prepare for bed, and at 11 pm it was LIGHTS OUT!! Every second evening instead of lessons after dinner, we had to prepare special numbers. We had about ten minutes to come up with a special performance - marching, pyramids, or dance number. This certainly helped me learn something quickly, and made me use my imagination - a lot! On Friday evening each groupprepared their own number for the final Talent Show. All of Saturday was filled with tests of all that we had learned during the week. In the afternoon we had a picnic and had great fun swimming, relaxing and playing games. Sunday was Graduation Day. After graduation we glanced, for the last, time at the flag, said our good-byes and headed for home. I would like to mention the names of our instructors who spent a week of their own vacation to teach at the course. Sisters Jolene Dalton, Omaha and Norma Zabka, New York. (Editor's Note: I attended a course with Norma Zabka many years ago) Brothers Bud Benak, Omaha, Bob Liptak, New York, Frank Michalek, Illinois, Jerry and Rome Milan, Texas, and Joe Vrsalik, Maryland. Though it was a pretty tough week, I have come home with lots of ideas as to what we can do in gym classes. During the two weeks of classes starting this fall I have already introduced some new exercises, and the kids loved them. I very much wish we had more children so that the classes can be divided according to age, and not have it necessary to include tots and teens in one class. It is very difficult to find exercises which are good for different age groups exercising together. I would really appreciate your help. If you know of anyone interested in sending their children to classes please bring them to the Sokol Hall any Friday evening. The hall is open EVERY FRIDAY at 7 pm. We are also interested in organizing Adult Classes. Please pass the word along. We need your participation. By Sylvia Prossr Instructor [pageend4]Sokol San Francisco Věstník September-October, 1986 Page -5- INTERNATIONAL SLET REPORT BY Sylvia Prossr In July brothers and sisters from Sokol Organizations all over the world met in Zurich, Switzerland to perform together in the VI Sokol Slet. The Slet showed two opposite faces. On one side spontaneous conversation, friendship, and kindness of people who had never met before, and on the other side, lack of uniformity and ability of organization which caused some troubles. It started the first day. Our official papers said that the first meeting was July 4th - a welcoming party. There was no announcement of the opening of the Slet on July 3rd with a special theare performance. Perhaps they overlooked the fact that most participants did not arrive until the afternoon of the 4th. Friday morning volleyball matches were held and attended mostly by Swiss, Austria and France. Friday evening was the party opening with welcome speeches, a short program and a dance. Saturday was totally confusing. Part of the participants and visitors left for a trip to Lucerne, others enjoyed competition in gymnastics while others were rehearsing gymnastic calisthenics at the stadium. People who were supposed to be rehearsing were watching the gymnastics and no one seemed to know where the right location was for Sunday's performance. That evening busses drove everybody to Kongusshaus where musicians and singers performed famous opera arias and music pieces.' It was a great experience for all! That same day Zurich celebrated their 2000th birthday. They had a huge fireworks display, lasting 30 minutes. Along with the fireworks was more music by famous composers. I recognized music by A. Dvorak and B. Smetana. Sunday morning did not get off to a good start. We woke up to rain which continued until late afternoon. It was impossible to rehearse in the stadium so we practiced our calisthenics in the covered runners' course..... as best we could. At last the VI Sokol Slet opened with everyone marching onto the field. After the national anthems, the Slet Committee Chairman, F. Svoboda gave his welcoming speech. The program progressed with performances by small girls and boys, folk dances, and a special number done with Indian clubs. The strong rain continued, and at one point, a group of young Czech dancers were forced to leave the field because their music could not be located, and their beautiful costumes were getting ruined in the rain. the rain stopped!!! The sun began to shine!!! And the VI Sokol Slet ended with the men and women's mass calisthenics performed by Sokols from all over the world. It was beautiful and touching, and the performance at the Slet created a spirit, a hope, to once again see a free Czechoslovakia. That evening, everyone met for the last time at a Good-bye Party — telling everyone of their new found friends "See you in 1990 at the next Slet!" San Francisco sent three representatives: Sister J. Vrana, Sister Z. Bursik, and me. It was really a big and exciting experience for me, and I was inspired by the Czech folk dancers so much that I decided to get young people together and start a dance group. I asked Sister Bursik for help, and she really has done a great job. We have rehearsals every Tusday at Sokol Hall at 7:30 pm. You can see our first performance at Sokol's October dance on the 25th. Come see us. You may wish to join the group. * * * * * * * £ ft * ft * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ********** * * ********** * * * SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT AND REQUEST We are looking for Czech National Costumes (Kroj) that you might lend to our dance group, or perhaps you have one you would like to sell.

[pageend5]HAPPY BIRTHDAY MISS LIBERTY Chairman Lee lacocca spoke and then introduced President Reagan who gave an impressive speech on the liberty and freedom in this land of ours with the Statue of Liberty in the background. I could not help but reminisce on my parents. My father, Frank Pesek, was a bricklayer by trade and arrived here alone at the turn of the century. After he established himself, he sent for his wife and two very young sons. I was the third son born here in the United States. Since my father knew his trade well, he soon was building homes in a small Czechoslovakian community known as “Winfield” in Queens, Long Island. At the age of 44, my father suddenly died of a heart attack leaving his widow with three children. 1 was the youngest at the age of 11 years. We grew up during the great depression and were very poor but did not know it. My brother Bill at the age of 14 years was our greatest asset. He was hired as a butcher boy by a Czech butcher shop-owner, Frank Solar. We were fortunate to always have meat on the table, even a roast on Sunday. Today Bill is a retired head-meat cutter. Returning to the celebration, we watched in the afternoon the parade of the tall ships with the battleship Iowa (over 900 feet long) leading them in. At 10 P.M., we witnessed the largest firework spectacular ever assembled in the history of the world. Over 20 tons of projectiles (14,000 in all) exploded in the harbor around the 100 year old Lady Liberty climaxing with pride, patriotism and joy the greatest birthday party in our country. Julie and I were overwhelmed with emotion to be a part of it and wish to thank the officers, Board of Directors and especially all our members for giving us the opportunity to represent our CSA Society at this gala affair. It was tremendous; it was inspiring; but most of all it was JUST WONDERFUL! In closing, I would like to leave these comments with you: This country was built by immigrants who had to learn the English language upon arrival. Today there is a movement in the U.S.A, to make this a bilingual country. I say emphatically, “No!” If you agree, please write your senators and congressmen. Graiid Old Flag The 4th of July, this year was very special as we celebrated the 100th anniversary of the Statue of Liberty. The television coverage for the benefit of millions of people who couldn’t attend these festivities in New York in person, was just spectacular. Everywhere we looked we saw a sea of flags, “Stars and Stripes Forever”, just like in Sousa’s march, the most patriotic piece of music ever written. We were all proud and happy and especially for us, immigrants from Czechoslovakia, as we had a special sense of belonging. It wasn’t always like this. I remember way back in my borne town Prague, where I was born, the flags were some- :imes different. There were flags with hooked crosses during World War II and we seldom saw our red, white, and blue flag. When the war was over and thousands of Czechoslovakian flags reappeared, we had a good feeling in our heart. At that time after so many years, we saw the American flag for the first time again. Those beautiful stars and stripes represented freedom in America where most of us would like to be, but so very few could reach it. When U.S. soldiers came from Pilsen to Prague, they were mobbed and admired and kissed, because we knew there was something very special west of us across the ocean. The American flag was flying again over the U.S. Embassy in Prague. 4th of July celebration in Prague 1945, Czech Boy Scouts, Vladimír Jirák on the left. As a member of the Czechoslovakian Boy Scouts I was privileged as a delegate to help to celebrate the first 4th of July holiday after the war in Prague. That was the first time I saluted the American flag. The American flag was looked up to, admired, and most people had a secret wish to be able to live in America one day. After the unfortunate coup in 1948, I escaped over the border and found myself outside Czechoslovakia with a firm desire to emigrate to the United States. It was difficult, there were too many of us. Quotas were low and restrictions many. I was rejected and advised to emigrate to Australia, a country with less rigid immigration laws. I did just that with the vision of the Stars and Stripes slowly fading. However, I didn’t give up, and after some 9 years of intensive work and correspondence with my sponsor, I reapplied, was successful and finally landed in San Francisco. I just wasn’t lucky enough to be greeted by the Statue of Liberty like many others, because coming from Australia I actually “sneaked in the back way”. Now that the vision of the American Flag was near, I called myself extremely lucky to be finally in the United States and able to admire the flag from close by and have the feeling that “this is my flag now”. The U.S. flag was finally mine. How proud I was, and still am. Each holiday when I go in front of the house and hoist the American Flag on top o* the mast, I remember the days when I wasn’t able to do it and how long it took to get here. How I think back to those days when 1 saw the U.S. flag flying only on top of the U.S. Embassy in Prague or in the window of U.S. Information Service, Národní třída, Praha. Somehow, 1 don’t mind the [pageend6]delay caused by immigration laws when I had to go through Germany, France, Luxembourg and Australia to finally arrive here. Somehow I can’t understand, that after all the patriotic festivities some “bom Americans” don’t lift their hats or stand up when the Flag is carried by in the parade. It happened many times and again this very festive 4th of July in Brookfield, and in other parades. Are people immune to the flag, symbol of patriotism? Are they indifferent, lazy? Why? Apparently the Flag is nothing new to them. They grew up seeing the flag in every class room, every business office, on top of every business or government building, even gas stations. Sure they were taught the “Allegiance to the flag” in grade school, but are those just words? The flag became a part of the scenery, a part of the furniture. NOT TO ME! Old Glory reminds me of the struggle we all had to enter the United States and how grateful we are to live in “the land of the free”. The soldiers hoisting the U.S. flag on Mount Suribaschi on the island Iwo Jima in 1945, where 4000 Marines died, must certainly have felt something for the flag. Yes they earned it. I must say, many of us earned it too, to admire the Stars and Stripes and stay in attention during the parade, and have tears in our eyes when pulling the string and hoisting the flag to the top of the mast on holidays. Biit how many take the Flag for granted? Vladimir Jirák yoa'fte not ^eeitng mM. to headt Ue A end to Ba . Estnte Cnuegen and Esl . Petodv l/stana. GET UELL QUICK!!!!
