This month, I would like to dedicate my report to' the new Czechoslovak president, Vaclav Havel who was nominated by the Helsinki Commission for the 1990 Nobel Peace Prize. Vaclav Havel, an internationally renowned playwright, has dedicated himself to the cause of peace and human rights for over a decade. His dedication to democracy has remained steadfast even though the personal costs to him have been great. His numerous writings were banned in his own country for years, and he suffered relentless harassment by the authorities, including imprisonment, repeated detentions, house searches, and confiscated property. President Havel was one of the original participants in Charta 77, a citizens’ initiative organized to monitor human rights in Czechoslovakia, and to promote compliance with international commitments in this field. In addition, he was an early activist in the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Persecuted (VONS), which documents and publicizes individual human rights cases. In 1988, Vaclav Havel became associated with several new Czechoslovak human rights initiatives. In particular, he signed the manifesto of the Movement for Civil Liberties which was established in order to promote political pluralism and democracy thru peaceful means, and joined the newly formed Czechoslovak Helsinki Committee. One year ago, Vaclav Havel was in prison because of his struggle for human rights and fundamental freedom. The ideals he espoused were those that have given courage to freedom loving men and women for generations. The peaceful methods he sought to achieve his goals are those which will inspire generations to come. Today, Vaclav Havel is President of his country in a region which has been transformed almost beyond recognition over the last twelve months. The changes still taking place in that part of the world may prove to be among the most momentous of this century. Yet the challenges that remain are as great as those that have already been met, and Havel’s visionary leadership will continue to play a critical role as he guides his country to free elections and on to genuine democracy. His selfless dedication exemplifies the contributuion to humanity that one person can make. I am sure, we, as American Sokols stand behind him one hundred percent, and are looking toward free Sokol movement in Czechoslovakia. Nazdar!

Sokol was officially reinstated in Czechoslovakia in January of this year, and all of the Sokol Halls are once more becoming the home of Sokol. We have learned from various sources that there are many Sokols in Czechoslovakia who are learning the calisthenics for the Slet, and are planning on travelling to Paris to participate. We have heard many rumors that the official Slet will be held in Paris, but that participants of the Slet will be invited to participate in a Sokol Exhibition - not a Slet - at the Sparta Soccer Arena in Prague. NOW as soon as we hear about travel tours, participation wherever it may be, etc., etc., we will make the announcement. In recent conversations with officers of American Sokol in Chicago they have promised that up-to-date information regarding tours, programs, etc. will be sent as soon as they are available. IT IS ALL VERY EXCITING - ISN'T IT? ! ! ? This photo was featured in an article appearing in the San Francisco Chronicle "Style" section of the paper. The story mentions the art collection of John Gutmann and his art exhibit at the S.F. Museum of Modem Art in November, 1989. It is seems like yesterday that we were participating in the Treasure Island World's Fair Czechoslovak Day. THAT WAS FIFTY YEARS AGO ! ! ! ! ! These Czechoslovakian gymnasts were, captured by Gutmann inSan Francisca in 1939.

The following excerpts appeared in the San Mateo Times "Time Out" Section January 31, 1990: Despite difficulties home is here now For hundreds of years, people have immigrated to America for a variety of reasons — and they are still coming. With world attention turning to Eastern Europe, The Times has turned to some of those immigrants who are making their home on the Peninsula. Despite their concern over the upheaval in their own countries as democratic reforms are revolutionizing governments that have been Communist since World War II, these new immigrants are decidedly American. Like others before them, their home is here now. "I am a very happily adapted American," says Dan Ionescu, a Romanian-born transplant. While not every one is perfectly adapted, many professional people who arrived here are finding personal success although they have left much of their culture behind. Otto, Kate and Jaroslavia Prossr By DALE MARTIN Times Staff Writer They are from faraway places like Bucharest, Prague, Timisoara and Warsaw, these immigrants, but they are, in every other respect, pure American. With their countries in turmoil these past few months. Eastern European immigrants here on the Peninsula have been keenly attentive to the unfolding events from Romania to Poland. Some are raising money and sending supplies — just as they have been for years. Others are taking heart that for the first time since they left, they are able to speak freely on the telephone with those they left behind. Yet, while they are experiencing a variety of emotions over democratic reforms in their native countries, thev are also very aware that they are American now. As professionals who arrived here from Czechosovakia in 1984 with two teen-age daughters, it was also difficult for Otto and Jaroslavia Prossr. Without knowledge of the language, Jaroslavia Prossr had to give up teaching and was re-trained to work with computers at Spectravest in South San Francisco. Otto Prossr was an electronic technician who was able to find work at the Academy of Science in San Francisco. "We are American now," Otto Prossr acknowledges. With families and friends left behind as well as entire cultures, food and familiar ways, it is remarkable these recent immigrants have been able to do so well in their new country. Otto and 'Jaja" Prossr of Millbrae and their daughters are also American, now, though they have still to become citizens. Their 18- year old daughter, Kate, is a senior at Mills High School and another daughter, Sylvia, has joined the Air Force. They were part of a wave of Czechoslovakians that emigrated in 1984 by traveling to the Olympic games in Yugoslavia. Mrs. Prossrs mother arrived here in 1965. But the Prossrs were unable to leave until five years ago because they found it too difficult to obtain necessary permits. Still, with growing children, it was a difficult decision. "I have a father there. 1 was a teacher and I liked my job," Mrs. Prossr says. But she was also fed up with the Marxist curriculum that she had to force upon her pupils. The year 1968 was very exciting to them when democratic socialism flowered briefly under Alexander Dubcek. They had great hopes. It was like a thunderstorm when the Soviets came in," she says. . When it came time to leave, Otto and Jaja Prossr couldn't even reveal their plans to their children for fear that others would find out Once they got to Yugoslavia, the way was cleared to emigrate to America. Settling in to a new country wasn't easy for the Prossrs with language and job problems besetting them. But they have come a long way in five years. And they have continued hope for the changes in Czechoslovakia. For the first time in years, they can call friends in Prague and have open conversations without the fear of government retaliation. "When we talked to my grandmother, the first thing she said was, We won't die with Communism,' " reports their daughter, Kate. While the Prossrs don't miss the food shortages, lack of toilet paper and police state, there are things about their country for which they long. "What we miss is culture. The theater, concerts, churches, galleries. Czechoslovakia has a very old history," Mrs. Prossr says. In addition, life in America is a little too fast-paced for them at times. "We are so busy here. Everything is such a distance. We don’t have time to visit all our friends," Jaja Prossr says. [pageend5]^uhOL bHIM hřXÁNUxSCu vEbíAÍK JANUARY - FEBRUARY, 19'7'0 PAGE - 6 Instamatic History Prague YESTERDAY we were talking about a momentous evening in this brilliant and beautiful capital — the first public performance here since 1968 of a play by the new president of Czechoslovakia, Vaclav Havel. Havel, who spent years in Communist jails for writing plays that offended the regime, objects to being described as “a dissident playwright,” a favorite media label. “All I do is try to write the truth,” he has said. “Does that make me a dissenter?” Nor does he like his plays to be called “absurdist” when “everything that has happened here for the past 40 years is absurd.” The Havel play selected for the historic moment was “Audience,” a 50-minute one-act two- character play done in English by two young American actors, Kevin O’Connor and Lou Brockway. The action, set in a state-owned brewery, starts out with a Saroyanesque flair but soon turns serious and very European: the ideological conflict between worker (O’Connor) and intellectual — Brockway playing a character based on Havel himself. Both actors were dazzling and letter-perfect: just two weeks earlier, they had been doing this and other Havel plays in New York. We were there courtesy of the U.S. Ambassador to Czechoslovakia, Shirley Temple Black of Woodside, and her husband, Charles Black. “Shirley Temple was in the audience?” gasped O’Connor after the show. “My God, that play is full of rough language — awful. I hope she wasn’t offended.” Shirley, with a laugh: “I have two teenagers. There isn’t a four-letter word I haven’t heard,” and she proceeded to offer several examples. ★ ★ ★ SMALL TOWN, small world: Next day, strolling through the Old Town square, we ran into O’Connor and Brockway. Old Town is not to be confused with New Town, which is only six centuries old, nor with Lesser Town, which is actually greater in a way because it’s across the river and on the slopes below Hradčany (“Chrod-chonny”) Castle, the seat of government and overpoweringly grand. Typically, President Havel refuses to live there, preferring to stay in his small apartment. Nor does he like to wear neckties. AT THE AMERICAN Embassy, Shirley Temple Black’s eyes are dancing. “He’s going to see me at 2 o’clock today for an entire hour!” “He” is Alexander Dubcek, who, as president, tried to show “the human face of socialism” during the 1968 “Prague spring” that was crushed by Soviet tanks. It was 21-plus years ago — on August 17,1968 — that Shirley Temple and Dubcek had a date to meet in Prague at 4 p.m. She’d been attending an International Multiple Sclerosis Foundation conference in Vienna and came here to enlist Czechoslovakia as the 20th nation in the group. At 3:45 p.m., in Hradčany Castle, an aide said grimly, “President Dubcek cannot see you — he is tied up.” When they finally met, last week, Shirley asked, “Were you tied up literally or figuratively?” “Bitter memories,” sighed Dubcek, now back in government. “I was held in an armored car for 15 hours while they decided what to do with me. Finally they put me on a plane to Moscow. A few minutes later, the invasion began.” Shirley,, who fled Prague that same day, said to Dubcek, “I have a favor to ask. May I give you a hug?” The ambassador and the ex-president embraced. “That was very nice,” he said, tears in his eyes. ★ ★ ★ WE CONTINUE to walk for miles around this incredibly ornate city, an architectural smorgasbord — Gothic, baroque, Renaissance, rococo, trompe 1’oeil, art nouveau and deco. There are enough caryatids and telamones to hold the world on their shoulders (a telamon is a male caryatid, something you knew all along but I just learned). Oversized stone ladies in various stages of undress decorate the entrances to apartment houses whose corner niches generally show a scene of violence — St. George killing that same old dragon, or an apostle goring an infidel. Lots of violent scenes in the ornate churches I call “barococo” for want of a better word. Charlie Black, who speaks excellent Czech and could hire out as a guide any day, led us across the 14th century Charles bridge with its 30 huge statues, including one (local angle) of St. John of Nepomuk, patron saint of the S.F. Bohemian Club. As a priest, he had heard King Wen- ceslaus IV’s wife confide that she was having an affair, but when he refused to name her lover, Wenceslaus had John’s tongue cut out. Bohemian Clubbers who talk about their affairs and those of their brothers would be well-advised to hold their tongues in honor of St. John. ★ ★ ★ [pageend6]SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO VĚSTNÍK JANUARY - FEBRUARY, 1990 PAGE - 7 What Haye You Done for Us Lately? As soon as the Czechoslovak regime grants one reform, the people demand another ] HERB MEN I There to Here Prague-Paris-San Francisco SWANS SWIMMING queenlike along the Vltava River, crowds gathering each hour at the 15th century astronomical clock on the Old Town Hall (Christ makes an appearance, death rings a bell, a cock crows), and the winter light reflecting off a thousand gilded sunbursts. Ornamentation everywhere. The Czechs have a gift for it, and thus unspoiled Prague (not even a T-shirt for sale on the streets) reigns unique among the beautiful cities of the world. Wenceslas Square, scene of “the velvet revolution” that nobody can yet quite believe, is not a square but a boulevard, almost 200 feet wide, only about 30 feet shy of the Champs-Elysees. We stand in line at a kiosk for a bramborák, the famous potato pancake served on a sheet of waxed paper. It is so greasy we take one bite and throw the rest to Prague’s fat pigeons. Three pigeons take one peck each and strut away haughtily. Caenfucius say: Poor people starve but pigeons always get fed. HEADING WEST: Unless you’re mad for dumplings, you don’t go to Prague for the food. The city is a feast for the eyes. We’re on our way back to Paris, filled with warm thoughts of Shirley Temple Black, the American ambassador, one of the most famous women in history, worldwide permanent celebrity, still the dimpled child that Bill (Bo- jangles) Robinson said was “the best I ever danced with,” always the woman, strong, determined, dedicated. I watched her write autographs in Czech for shining-eyed waiters. At the American Embassy cafeteria, we order trays of cheeseburgers and fries, made by a jolly Czech cook. Afterward, who gathers up the trays and takes them out to the garbage can to scrape off the leftovers? Shirley, of course. Then she is off to greet a congressional delegation (they never stop coming). I don’t want to embarrass her with fulsome praise, but Shirley Temple Black has it, that’s all. She simply has it and we’ve got her. Lucky for us. BY JILL SMOLOWE Al 10:55 a.m. Iasi Tuesday, Va- teal clav Havel siepped from a sil- ver Volkswagen Golf and, trailed by eight fellow members of the Civic Forum, proceeded io a second-floor conference room in the cream stucco building. Prime Minister Ladislav Adamec opened the talks with a seven-minute statement outlining the gov- crnmenl's concessions. In rciurn. Adamec said, "please terminate your strikes. This is my wish and my plea." Havel was in no mood to be conciliatory. For the next 18 minutes, he listed the Civic Forum's demands. all of which, he said, must be met by Dec. 10. “I know that looks like an ultimatum," Havel said. "Il doesn't kxik like one." Adamec spluttered. "Il is one." Havel quickly called for a recess. After consulting with his delegation for 25 minutes. Adamec reconvened the group and agreed to virtually every request except the call for the immediate resignation of his government. Next day Czechs watched in amazement the first ever live-television broadcast of a session of the national parliament. By a vote of 309 io 0. the legislators struck down infamous Article 4 of the dreds of bnterprises, from huge steelworks to the local Fiat service agency. Not only was the astoundingfumout a sharp rebuke io ihe country’s leaden, but it was a warning that a few cosmetic changes within the Politburo would not satisfy the demands for a more democratic system. The brisk rate of change has already created stress fractures between the students, who have their own strike committee, and the Civic Forum, whose leaders are drawn largely from Charter 77, an umbrella opposition group set up in 1977 to defend human and civil rights in Czechoslovakia. The students, who were faster to draw up a concise list of demands, have been irked by the Civic Forum s failure to include younger voices in its deliberations. "The Qvic Forum ts more experienced," says Monika Pajcrova, 23, "hut we are more radical." Some within the Civic Forum regard the students as "children of Communists" who led privileged lives while older dissidents spent years in jail for their views. T here are also hints of potential rifts within the Civic Forum. Until now. the organization has striven to encourage consensus and avoid partisan affiliation. “The Civic Forum's purpose," says Havel, “is to be a bridge between the totalitarian system and true pluralistic democracy." But popular heroes are already emerpng. One is Valtr Komárek. 59, director of the official Institute of Forecasting of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences. An academic with a magnetic speaking style. Komárek seized the nation's imagination last weekend with a nine-minute televised address that detailed Communist incompetence in economic management. By the Monday strike, posters had already been printed reading k o már ek in t o t h e GOVERNMENT. According to some Civic Forum supporters. Komárek is furious that Havel and his colleagues are banking on the political survival of Prime Minister Adamec instead of supporting Komárek for the position. When asked by Time if he was a candidate for Prime Minister. Komárek responded. “I leave this open. My position personally is very modest. I don't think a well-brought-up person should say, ‘I want to be Prime Minister.'" Komárek feels that the Civic Forum tends too heavily toward compromise and should instead mount a radical assault on the existing order. “What's needed," he says. "is the establishment immediately of an interim government of experts, democratic experts." For their part, the Civic Forum leaders fear that what they perceive as a hid for power by Komárek might upset the delicate consensus that has given the opposition the upper hand in negotiations with the government. Even so. the Civic Forum is a model 42 constitution, which enshrines the "leading role" of the Communist Party. Like a video tape on fast forward. Prague was racing through a revolution so quickly that even the participants could barely keep track of developments. The opposition never stopped to bask in celebration. Since its inception three weeks ago. the Civic Forum has emerged as the most single-minded and uncompromising opposition force in Eastern Europe. Last week, as the Communist leaders tried to mollify their countrymen, the Civic Forum kept up the pressure, meeting each new concession with more demands and deadlines. Havel and company had been emboldened by the response to their call for a two- hour strike last Monday. Al the stroke ol noon, millions of workers and students look to the streets, shutting down hun- WHATTHE GOVERNMENT HAS DONE O Abolished constitutional guarantee* ensuring the Communist Party's “leading role" In society Q Pledged to form a new Cabinet that Includes non-Communist ministers © Admitted that the 1968 Soviet Invasion was a mistake 0 Eliminated mandatory Marxist-Leninist education © Started to dismantle the Iron Curtain and removed all travel restrictions © Retaxed cenaorohlp of the new* media, book*, film* and ptay* WHATTHE OPPOSITION STILL DEMANDS O The resignation of President Gustav Husak © Laws guaranteeing freedom of the press and assembly © Regulations spelling out procedures for free elections O Abolition of the People’s MIIHIa, the party's private army © The release of aM remaining political prisoners © An open, market-oriented economy TIME.DECEMBER II.19KV of unity when compared with the Communist Party. Under attack nol only from citizens but from rank-and-file members as well, the party seems to be desperately reshuffling its players in hopes of appeasing the public. Adamec must strike a careful balance between party hard-liners and the Civic Forum's relentless pressure for swift action. Last week several Communist legislators apologized for failing to respond sooner to the popular mood. Even ousted party leader Milos Jakes supported the abolition of the party's constitutional right to lead the country. Other unexpected triumphs have attended the revolution. Last Tuesday two Civic Forum representatives delivered a letter to the Soviet embassy asking the Supreme Soviet to disavow the 1968 invasion. The two were assured the letter would be telexed to Moscow promptly. "We are very happy with the way events are going." embassy counselor Vasili Filipov told them. "Especially that there is no bloodshed, because we feared bloodshed." How times have changed. —Reported by Devid AJbmefi and Jtemwte W. Banta/Prague The Conscience of Prague "Seldom in recent times has a regime cared so little for the real attitudes of outwardly loyal citizens or for the sincerity of their statements." —Vaclav Havel, an open letter from Prague. 1975 Can any of Czechoslovakia’s 15.5 million citizens have more cause to be astounded by the events of recent weeks than Vaclav Havel? Since the Soviet invasion in 1968, Havel has been the conscience of Prague, a world-famed playwright who n.^ht have exploited hi- ■ l-’us .is an intellectual superstar to emigrate to the West, but refused to do so. Instead. Havel. 53, stayed behind, suffering censorship, intermittent police surveillance and repeated jailings so he could continue to give voice to Hevei: aretani to compromise the frustrations and yearnings of a frightened—and until now mute—populace. A sharp-witted, courtly man who tends toward diffidence. Havel seems an unlikely folk hero. He was (he son of a well-to-do builder and restaurateur, and his early years were filled with governesses and chauffeurs. With the Communist takeover in 1948, the family's wealth became an albatross. Havel was denied the opportunity to attend high school or college. While working as a taxi driver and then in a brewery, he pursued his writing and in 1963 saw his first play, The Garden Parry, mounted in Prague. In April 1968 Havel traveled to New York to see the Public Theater's production of his second play. The Memorandum. Four months later, the tanks rolled through Prague, and one of the new regime's first acts was to censor Haul's writings. For his work on behalf of Charter 77, a human-rights organization he helped found, Havel spent more than four years in jail. His latest internment ended last May; he had served half of an eight-month sentence after speaking on Western radio. The charge: inciting antigovernment demonstrations. It seemed no small irony that last week, largely through Havel's efforts, the street protests were halted to give ihe government and oppoailion some breathing space to pursue negotiations. Newly relaxed censorship restrictions now open the way for distribution of Havel's essays and plays, which are often likened io the absurdist works of Ionesco and Beckett. What Czechoslovaks will discover is a painstaking attention to the elaborate web of falsification that for so long enabled a despised leadership to maintain its grip. Havel's work depicts the idiocy of entrenched bureaucracies and the power of language to twist and distort ideas. Il also highlights the unwitting complicity of ordinary citizens in the maintenance of totalitarian regimes. "Everyone is in fact involved and enslaved." Havel once told Time. "Each person is capable, to a greater or lesaer degree, of coming to ternu with living within the lie." Almost alone in his quest, Havel has refused to compromise. TIME.
