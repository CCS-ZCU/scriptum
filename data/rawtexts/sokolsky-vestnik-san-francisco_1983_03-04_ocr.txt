MASARYK The New Man, HOMO EUROP AEUS, Will be the result not merely of external politics, but principally of internal. The political tasl{ of the democratic reconstruction of Europe must be attained and actually made possible by a moral reeducation of the nations— either democracy or dynastic militarism, either Bismarckism or rational and honest politics, either force or humanity, either matter or spirit! T. G. MASARYK The New Europe: The Slav Standpoint, 1918. On March 5th- 1983 Sokol San Francisco celebrated the 133rd anniversary of T.G. MASARYK birth. The Sokol Hall stage was artistically decorated by, three volunteers who assembled very tastefully our great coat-of-arms and the president’s portrait beautifully painted by our renown artist Mr. Lumír Maňásek. This, and a simple flower arrangement transformed the stage into a very fitting place for two speakers who delivered addresses in English and Czech.about this giant of a man. [pageend1]Strana-Page 2. Věstník Sokola San Francisco. Březen-Duben,March-Apr Especially heartwarming was the speech by our Vice-president who was born in the U.S. and who managed - through her perseverance and research - to deliver a speech which was warmly received by the audience. After a brief intermission our own Sokol band - rejuvenated and enlarged by three musicians - took over to entertain the guests . It would be appropriate here to express our thanks to all members of the band for a lively rendition of our old pieces and to all workers who worked so hard to make this evening a memorable one. V.F.B. Uctění výročí narozenin T.G. Masaryka v Golden Gate parku: V neděli dne 6. března o druhé hodině odpolední položil bratr Eric Lenhart květiny k pomníku presidenta Osvoboditele T.G. Masaryka v růžové zahradě Golden Gate parku. Obřad byl velmi krátký. Bratr Lenhart řekl; "Pane presidente, věrni jsme zůstali".Pak položil květiny na pražské dlažební kostky kterými je vydlážděn malý prostor kolem pomníku, postál v pokorném tichu, hluboce zamyšlen a my s ním. Skoda, že se sem památce našeho velikána přišlo poklonit jen čtrnáct duší. Pietní akt položení květin opakoval bratr Lenhart opět v pondělí 7.3. Bratru Lenhartovi, který dvakrát do roka /28. říjen je oním druhým dnem/ bez jakýchkoliv okázalostí zde pokládá květiny a tak připomíná kolemjdoucím že jsou ještě lidé kteří nezapomínají, patří naše upřímné poděkování. Díky Ericu! v v u Zemřel vzácný Člověk - bratr Mle^nek, dlouholetý člen Sokola San Francisco, původním povoláním pekař, který se poctivou prací a obchodním talentem domohl založení továrny na na výrobu krmivá pro psy. Bydlel dlouhá léta v Piedmontu a jeho dům mezi nesčetnými hosty také hostil v roce 1945 československou delegaci vyslanou k založení United Nations v San Francisku. Jeho štědrost, pohostinnost a obětavost byla známa široko daleko. Sokol San Francisco vyslovuje touto cestou pozůstalým po br. Mlejn- kovi hlubokou soustrast. [pageend2]Hřezen-Duben, March-April 83. Věstník Sokola San Francisco, Page-Str.3. The election committee dilemma. The election committee, formed to choose the slate of candidates faced an almost impossible task. A frightening percentage of members considered capable of holding positions, refused to accept nomination. One member who used to hold one of the highest positions in our unit told me: "I have to think about it and I’ll let you know this Monday." That Monday came and went and fifteen Mondays later I am still waiting for that call of a man who always acted as a dedicated member whose word should be as good as gold. Reasons for refusal to accept nomination varied. Those members who accepted - we knew - had the same reasons for refusal but found in their hearts something the others already cast by the wayside, i.e. patriotic enthusiasm and devotion to the Sokol idea. Out of that number of officers to guide our unit in 1983 only five were born in Czechoslovakia . During the annual meeting we failed to see any of those newcomers who, last year, so generously dispensed the ideas of what to do and how to mm this Sokol unit. Clearly their goal is purely egoistic and we are not missing anything by their non-involvement. It is deplorable that the burden of leadership of our unit is again in the hands of longtime members who didn’t shy away when the call for help went out and that our endeavour to bring in young blood into the leadership was minimal. What is perhaps most distressing is the fact that very few from the recent waves of refugees come forward to help or take part in our gym classes. Think about it. It is not late - yet! v p h Congratulations Sister Kubíky Sister Marie Kubik, mother of sister Helen Murphy celebrated quietly her 87th birthday on February 22nd. On behalf of all members and many friends I would like to wish her many many happy returns of her birthday. Sister Kubik, that pleasant, quiet lady who often sat near her daughter who usually sells tickets at the entrance, is still interested in our activities and happenings around the Sokol Hall. Sincerely V.F.B. Little Bavaria restaurant invitation. nd Come for dinner and have fun Saturday April 2 1983 with Karl Lebherz live music.

Liska prepared a few examples of gymnastic activities for little children. [pageend4]Continued from last month Simultaneously with Tyrs' interest in armed preparedness there existed a passive resistance of the Czech deputies to the Austrian Reichsrath. Tyrs joined this opposition and thus came about the change of the attitude of the Sokol towards Austria and the dynasty. Although in the year 1866 the Sokol welcomed the emperor during his visit to Prague, two years later Sokol ostentatiously left the city and returned to his own interests in Kolin. In this manner was created by Tyrs himself the negative attitude towards Austria and the Czech nation's preparation for its independence. Tyrs' successors accepted this position as the founder's legacy, nurtured it among the Sokols and continued to prepare for the struggle which was not yet in sight, but which seemed to all of them unavoidable. Their attitude towards the authorities is characterized by proud defiance. The planned but forbidden Slet is transferred outside of Prague. When the authorities forbade the Sokol's visit to France, leader of the Sokols, Podlipny, answered the high Prague officials with a self-confident "We will go in spite of you." A colorful poster for the third Slet prepared by Preisler depicted a gymnast standing before mother nation and tearing his fetters. In the Bohemian Sokol Union its director Josef Scheiner refused to invite the emperor to the sixth Slet, despite the emperor's specific request. And disregarding the clearly expressed orders the Austrian hymn was not played at the Sokol Festival. In fact not one single Austrian flag was seen waving amid the deluge of Sokol banners. (3) The Sokol Slets speak clearly, unmistakenly both in the ostentatious frateraalizing with the visitors from countries openly unfriendly towards Austria as well as in the underlying significance of the elaborate scenes prepared for each Slet. Thus the subject of the Sth Slet in 1907 was a scene depicting Zizka's victory against King Sigismund in the battle near Kutna Hora. Then at the sixth Slet in 1912 the colorful scene depicted the Victory of the Athenians a- gainst the superiority of the Persians at the battle of Marathon. In both these scenes the nation was given an opportunity to witness the victory of a small but morally strong nation against a numerically far superior enemy. The sixth Sokol Slet in 1912 was already labelled as a highly treasonable venture by the Austrian authorities. Even the foreign visitors detected readily its tremendous political significance. Foreign journalists spoke of the Sokols as the Czech National Army. French journalist Andre Cheradame wrote that in the center of Europe there was beginning to rise a marked change effecting deeply European continental equilibrium and approaching closer to the French interests. The Czechs were able by their Slet to spiritually mobilize fifty million Slavs, who from then on will have marked influence on -5- Continued on next page [pageend5]European decisions, something which, did not exist before. That is why in Cheradame•s opinion the Slet had assumed such significance in the history of Europe. The Sokol preparation for the coming struggle took two directions: in addition to the internal preparation of the Sokol membership, Dr. Scheinei' was acquiring allies for the nation among nations. The unification with other Slav nations, the majority of whom shared our common destiny, was solidified by the formation of the Organization of Slav Sokols and by frequent mutual visits. Special attention was given to France because of its genuine friendship. Not only its gymnasts but its political leaders as well kept emphasizing the true affiliation of France against the common enemy. Scheiner also realized the importance of the Czechs in America in the event of a conflict, and therefore continued to cultivate the friendly contacts originally begun by Tyrs. He was thus preparing the Czech Americans for the possibility that their homeland might call upon their help when needed. At the sixth Slet Milan Getting declared that the American Slovaks were ready to solve the vital question of their nation by fighting. At the same time Ludvik Fisher, representative of the American Sokols promised that Czech America would be cooperating in everything that the old country would undertake for the greater glory and honor of its name. Following the sixth Slet the internal preparations assumed the character of direct preparations for revolt. The author of the play "After the Battle of Marathon" declared in his poem "The Sound of the Olympic", that everything the viewers can see is merely a preparation for early conquering of our own Czech Marathon. He explained that the nation is merely looking up toward the accumulated stormy black clouds with the question "When?". The general mood of the Slet resembled a volcano whose underground rumpling points to an inner glow ready to explode. The final touch to the burning incendiary threat was added by the Žižkov Sokol Unit in December 1913* This was the presentation of the gymnastic poem, "Fall of a Tyrant"., The author Karel Domorázek resorted to powerful attacking verses, challenging the slaves to revolt. His terse command "Knock him out" inflamed and excited the listeners. It was under this emotional mood that the last review of the Sokol strengths was held in Brno in June 1914. Pluhař, the deputy governor, declared in his ceremonial address that the Czech Nation understood the deeper mission of the Sokol in solving the nation’s battle of past hundreds of years. He reiterated that the nation is decided to once again assume the position it had held in the past, that it now had a strong arm whith which to break all violence and the strong will which will guide this arm. That is the Sokol. Pluhař’s conclusions sounded that challenge: "We are here once again, and we want to be unfettered, powerful and free." Just a few hours after the bold declaration came the shattering news about the Sarajevo assassination. (4) -6- Continued next month [pageend6]DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN????? .....You were asked Whát i s Sokol? .............And you carefully and with much knowledge replied -- Sokol is a world-wide organization, which trains both the youth and the adults so that they may become physically, morally, and mentally fit. The training is carried on in the patriotic and brotherly spirit. ................DO YOU REMEMBER?????? .....Was there more to that question What is Sokol? ................There certainly was, and in those "good old days" you probably remembered what i t was. Everyone belonging to the Sokol must be an honorable man or woman, so that, as good citizens of the United States, they may be devoted to their country and be doing their best for its welfare. Religious and part differences play no part and have no effect on the membership. The basis of the Sokol Idea is proper physical development and moreal, patriotic, democratic and forward looking education. ........IS THAT ALL THERE IS TO IT?????? .....Certa inly not!1 All members willingly submit to the discipline and the rules of the Sokol organization to which they belong. They take part in the physical exercises as much as their age, health, and employment will permit, as well as in all the educational projects, entertainments, excursions, meetings and Slets. They always work for the welfare of their country, and endeavor to lead an exemplary life--as brothers and sisters. ....................... ...AND TO COMPLETE THE PICTURE --- "Sokol" is an original name for the organization; it is not translated into other languages. In English it means "Falcon", a bird known for its courage, endurance, lightning speed, sharp eyesight and its love of the heights of blue skies. Thus it symbolizes the ideals of the organization: fitness, power and high aims. Members of the Sokol call each other "brother"--"Si ster" and use the familiar "thou". The Sokol greeting is "nazdar!" meaning "On. to success!" The - symbol is a flying falcon. The Sokol emblem is well known. Although anytime is a good time for reviewing our Sokol Idea. Right now seems a particularly good time. There have been some incidents in our Sokol Unit that should be "unhappening". Let's all do a little self-examination of our Sokol ideals, and see if we can't all become better Brothers and Sisters to one another. PLEASE - THINK ABOUT SOKOL - NOT SO MUCH ABOUT YOURSELVES!!
