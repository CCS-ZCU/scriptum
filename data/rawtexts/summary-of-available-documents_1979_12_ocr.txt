Dr.Trevor Roberts D.Phil.M.A. J. M. David. Registered Office 48 Hillbrook Road London SW17.Registered No. 2002047 PalachPressLimited [pageend1]SUMMARY OF AVAILABLE DOCUMENTS 1. Trial of Petr Uhl, Vaclav Benda, Vaclav Havel, Otta Bednářová, Jiri Dienstbier, and Dana Nemcova, 22-23 October 1979. Full text of the official indictment. approx. 8, 000 words This unique document spells out in detail the charges against the six members of VONS. It illustrates beyond doubt how the Czechoslovak authorities violated both the international covenants ratified by Czechoslovakia and Czechoslovak law. One of the prosecution's main arguments is that any protest on the part of Czechoslovak citizens which is used by the mass media in the West makes these citizens guilty of 'subversion', regardless of whether or not they are in contact with 'hostile forces' outside the country«. This and other points are elaborated in the verdict«, 2. Transcript of the trial proceedings. approx. 13, 500 words This report of the cross-questioning of the accused and their final speeches to the court is based on the accounts of some of the relatives who were allowed to attend the trial. 3. Full text of the official verdict. approx«, 8, 000 words This document presents in detail the justification for the sentences passed on the six accused. 4, Report on attitudes towards the trial of the VONS members, approx«, 1,200 words This report was compiled by someone who, at considerable risk, interviewed a number of people, chosen at random in the street, in cafes etc., in Prague on the first day of the VONS trial. It gives the responses of about ten people of different ages to the question: '1 am from Palach Press«, How much do you know about the trial of six courageous people taking place near here today?' The responses ranged from sympathy and cautious support to the justification of indifference. 1 [pageend2]5 Three reasons for six convictions approx. 1,600 words This essay, signed ’’Jan”, analyses the main reasons for the arrest and persecution of some of the Chartists. It draws attention to the importance of Charter 77 Document No. 26 on corruption, consumerism and problems of consumption, and to the impact on the population of the price rises announced during the summer. It discusses the importance of VONS’ work, particularly its activity on behalf of unknown people prosecuted for their political beliefs. 6. Notes from prison by Jiri Dienstbier. approx. 2, 100 words At the end of July 1979 Jiri Dienstbier, one of the VONS members awaiting trial, wrote some notes for his friends which illustrate the spirit and position of those human-rights activists in prison. He first reports on the extraordinary number of documents shown to the accused, together with the indictment: ’Twenty-eight volumes of recorded statements by the accused and witnesses, reports on house-searches, graphological and other expert reports ... in all, up to 7,000 pages. ’ Dienstbier shows how much effort the security police had put into the case: 'The security service possesses detailed information ... down to ludicrous details from our meetings, which only a couple of people, perhaps sitting next to each other, could have noticed and which were not recorded in any of our minutes or other documents. ’ He draws the conclusion that the flats where the meetings were held must have been bugged and warns people to look out for such bugging. He also warns against police tactics of trying to sow mistrust between the defendants by implying that some of them have made statements incriminating the others. Dienstbier then goes on to note that Vaclav Benda and Petr Uhl are in the worst situation of all those detained: ’There is the greatest amount of evidence against them and the greatest number of documents was confiscated from their homes and elsewhere (for example, Uhl’s letter and notes about Jarmila’s (Belikova) and his views on the need to give VONS a firmer structure). There is also a great deal of evidence that the majority of the meetings took place at Benda’s flat. ’ He says that during his interrogation he was threatened with a prison sentence of eight years, although he regards this as an exaggeration. Dienstbier notes that the police have been able to document practically the entire activity of VONS: ’No one person was to blame for this, everyone has made some mistakes in keeping papers, notes about this or that meeting, lists of cases with the names of those who monitored them, and tens of other bits of paper with instructions and messages’ which were found during house searches. In addition, there are 200 pages of ’lengthy and well-meaning testimonies'. Dienstbier was originally one of the defendants who refused to answer questions during the interrogation but he explains why, after three weeks, he changed his mind: 'Everything was documented several times over and all that was left was to attempt to counteract misinterpretations. I was in 2 [pageend3]great doubt as to whether I was right but, after reading twenty-eight volumes, I am on the whole happy about my decision ... I made it a principle not to testify about other people, nor about the venue of meetings • 0<, But I have acknowledged authorship of VONS statements .□., attendance at VONS meetings, and I have added my own interpretation of some well-documented discussions within VONS. ’ Dienstbier concludes with some observations on prison conditions: ’the food ranges from the moderately bearable to the distasteful', the VONS members are segregated from other prisoners, they are allowed to sit, but not to lie down, during the daytime, and they get about twenty minutes’ exercise a day in concrete booths. ’Being inside’, says Dienstbier, ’has so far been more of a bore than a horror: more a waste of time which could be usefully employed or spent chatting to a friend, to relatives, or to one’s dear ones, than despair«. After all, one meets decent people everywhere. I do not know to what extent this feeling will outlast the verdict and the sentence ... We shall certainly not escape it — unless they are only trying to frighten us, or unless our friends manage to get us out of this mess — and that would take a lot of doing«, ’ 7. Zdenek Jičínsky, ’After the trial’. approx. 2,500 words This analysis was recommended to Charter signatories and the broad public by the three official Charter 77 spokesmen in their announcement of 12 November 1979 which, together with this essay, is published in Infoch No. 15. The essay is a supplement of a short letter by Dr Jicinsky addressed to the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly, written on 1 November 1979. In this letter, Jicinsky notes that the trial and the verdict aroused extraordinarily strong criticism of Czechoslovakia’s violation of basic rights and freedoms at the same time as the Federal Assembly was discussing Czechoslovakia's foreign policy. Jicinsky observes that the implications of the trial were not part of this discussion, despite the fact that it raises problems closely related to Czechoslovakia's attitude towards its international obligations, particularly the Final Act of the European Conference on Cooperation and Security and the preparations for the Madrid Conference in 1980«, Jicinsky argues that the trial also had implications for internal political and legal relations. For these reasons he is sending the Federal Assembly his essay which deals with the international implications of the political trial as well as giving a legal analysis of the arguments used. Jicinsky compares the decision of the Czechoslovak government to hold the trial with Brezhnev's offer to reduce the number of Soviet troops in Central Europe; given the strong links between the policies of the two governments, he suggests that there are strong grounds to doubt the sincerity of Brezhnev's Berlin proposals. Jicinsky’s essay complements his earlier essay, 'Before the trial' (See PP Summary of Available Documents, No. 11, Document No«, 10)«, 3 [pageend4]8 Helen Klimova, 'A friend in neeď approx. 2,000 words In this extremely well-written and highly readable essay, Helen Klimova, writer and former editor of Literami Listy, and wife of well-known writer Ivan Klima, describes her own friendship with Otta Bednářová. A number of examples illustrate Bednářová’s attitude towards people, chiefly her friendliness and helpfulness. She discusses the ethical values which govern Bednářová's behaviour and her preoccupation with struggling against injustice, however petty«, Among the many examples she includes Bednářová’s encounter with an epileptic woman whom she met in prison in 1977«, (Bednářová’s account of this encounter and the plight of the woman, published in Listy, was used against her at her trial.) Klimova attaches a letter which she wrote to Evzen Erban, Chairman of the Czech National Council, on 15 August 1979 in which she asked him to open an investigation into Bednářová’s unlawful detention and secure her immediate release. In the letter, Klimova recalls an earlier letter which she wrote to Erban, concerning the fate of three young men imprisoned in Brno (see Bulletin No. 11). Klimova expresses her fear that Erban’s failure to answer itself constituted a reply, a fear strengthened by the fact that after sending her letter the mothers of all three men were interrogated by the police. 9. Special Issue of Information about Charter 77. approx. 6,400 words ’Information about Charter 77’ (Infoch) is published by ’an independent group of Charter 77 signatories' and edited by Petr Uhl and Anna Sabatova, Anglicka 8, Prague 2. This special issue deals exclusively with the trial of the six VONS members in October. Contents: Letter from Charter 77 spokesmen to the Supreme Court, 24 October 1979 (See Bulletin No. 12); Reports on the first and second day of the trial; VONS statements 142 on repression before the trial, 143 on the verdict, 144 on the trial, including two appendices giving a list of all those detained for up to 48 hours during the trial, and the final statements of the defendants (See Bulletin No. 12 for all these statements); VONS letter to the International Federation for Human Rights (See Bulletin No. 12); Announcement of hunger-strike during the trial (See Bulletin No. 12); Report of French delegation who visited Prague during the trial and who, with one exception, were expelled from the country after 24 hours and a statement issued on 23 October, The group consisted of P. Dieubonne from the French Academy of Sciences, representing the Mathematicians’ Committee; Catherine Samary from the Committee of 5 January for a Free and Socialist Czechoslovakia; Patrice Chereau, representing the Association for the Protection of Unjustly Prosecuted Artists (AIDA); Jean-Pierre Faye from the International Committee Against Repression; Daniel Ouaki from the French Communist Party, and Alain Challier. The delegation asked to be allowed to attend the trial and Dieubonne to see Benda, Chereau — to see Havel, and Samary — to testify at the trial because her committee had published VONS statements and expressed solidarity with VONS activity. 4. [pageend5]10 Julius Tomin, 'Life in a Security State approx. 5,300 words In this essay, Tomin opens up with a description of the arrest of twelve men on 2 November, under suspicion of preparing to commit a terrorist act. They included his friend Ivan Dejmal in whose flat the philosophy course of the parallel university takes place. Those among the detainess who had attended these courses were asked if the problem of terrorism had ever been theoretically analysed. Tomin reminds his readers that 'terror' is a Latin word meaning 'fear', 'horror', or 'fright' and goes on to show how the word is used in an arbitrary way. (Tomin's discussion hinges on the fact that the Czech equivalent of 'terrorism' is 'terror'.) The Security Service accuses young people of terrorism in order to induce in them a feeling of fear and horror and also to induce such feelings in all those who hear about it. This, Tomin argues, is an inversion of the relationship between words and actions. He quotes a Greek philosopher to show that such an inversion tells us something about our reality. Tomin then discusses at length the problem of the arbitrary use of concepts accompanied by the arbitrary treatement of reality, especially human beings. He takes examples from his own life of the arbitrary use of the word 'fascist' and recalls that this problem of the arbitrary use of concepts was raised by Havel in his final speech at his trial. Tomin goes on to analyse the origin of the word 'security' and its meaning today. Drawing on the philosophy of Plato and Marx's theory of knowledge and of the state, Tomin shows how 'security' once denoted a situation in which a person felt safe but now it has come to signify a branch of the state apparatus which renders the individual highly unsafe. He then illustrates the impact of the security apparatus on the every-day life of the individual today and he describes his own confrontation with the Security Service when he was visited by Catherine Samary and Alain Challier from France. To show the role of the Security Service today, he compares the present situation with that of the 1950s when the country was ruled by a communist party, a party which wanted to influence and control the thought of every individual. According to Tomin, since 1977 Czechoslovakia has been what he calls a Security State. The Security Service no longer wishes to control and direct thought because it doesn't have enough strength to do this and, in any case, it is contrary to its essence. The Security Service binds people from the outside by physically manipulating them, their time, their role in society, their relationships with friends and those they love, their hobbies, and so on. Through this manipulation, it binds them internally and thus affects their thought. People even begin to choose whom to include among their friends and what their behaviour towards them should be and are prepared to ditch them when the Security Service wishes them to do so. This brings him to the conclusion that such apparently small things as stepping outside the boundaries imposed by the Security Service and shaking hands with a friend can be one of the genuinely free moments which an individual experiences. The best of such moments are free encounters between friends. An accumulation of such encounters can lead to growing awareness of the manipulation of unfreedom by the Security Servica Tomin asks whether it is possible for this Service to reconcile itself to such free human encounters, can it return to the social function that belongs to it — to make life safe for the individual, can it become the defender of laws? If this were the case, this would be the end of the Security State. 5 [pageend6]11 Charter 77 Letter to ILO, approx« 1, 500 words The Czechoslovak Government was asked to submit a report to the International Labour Organisation in October 1979 on its implementation of Convention 111 on the prohibition of discrimination at work, on the basis of a complaint lodged by the ICFTU in 1977. In connection with this, Charter 77 has issued a special statement. ’Discrimination at work and in professions, although in contradiction to the Czechoslovak Constitution, the Labour Code and Convention 111, nevertheless continues in Czechoslovakia and is directed against citizens holding critical political views ... Court proceedings in labour disputes with Charter 77 signatories is a mockery of justice. In its verdict the Courts accept one sole piece of ’evidence', namely a statement by the Prosecutor General’s Office of the CSSR according to which the Charter 77 Declaration is directed against the socialist state and social system in Czechoslovakia ... All Court hearings are held virtually behind closed doors, the courts refuse to hear evidence by the plaintiffs, or to examine witnesses and evidence ... In such disputes citizens do not have legal protection against employers and in most cases the courts merely rubber-stamp the violation of labour legislation by employers. ’ The statement then criticises the behaviour of the trade unions which do nothing to protect their members. The statement then notes that, ’the Courts have lately been abandoning their purely uniform ruling ... there have been a few isolated cases when employers have withdrawn their notices of dismissal after a court hearing. A number of Charter 77 signatories, especially those employed in manual jobs, have even won their case at the first or second hearing. ’ However, 'even though there has been a certain shift in tactics, there has been no genuine remedy of all the unlawful practices which occurred between 1977 and 1979. Unlawful verdicts have not been rescinded, employees dismissed on unlawful grounds have received no moral or material compensation, those who have been transferred to worse and lower paid jobs or dismissed from certain posts have not been allowed to return to their original jobs, even though this had been feasible. Those expelled from the trade unions have not been reinstat ed. ’ In conclusion, the statement pointed out that, 'The Supreme Court of the CSSR has resorted to an interpretation of Art. 46 paragraph IE of the Labour Code which in fact sanctions all unlawful verdicts passed against Charter 77 signatories and, indeed, confirms that any employer can dismiss anyone on political grounds. This interpretation in fact makes the Labour Code an instrument of political pressure. Signed by: Dr Jiri Hajek, Zdena Tominova, Dr Ladislav Hejdanek. Prague, October 1979. Charter 77 letter about Pavel Kohout, addressed to the Czechoslovak government, the Federal Assembly, and the Czech National Council. Copy to the Government of the Austrian Republic, 16 October 1979. approx. 900 words In this letter, the three Charter spokesmen react to the government's decision 12. 6, [pageend7]of 1 October 1979 to deprive Pavel Kohout of his Czechoslovak citizenship. They argue that law 39 of 1969, which allows the Ministry of the Interior to deprive a citizen of his nationality, is contrary to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ratified by Czechoslovakia«, In particular, it violates the clause concerning the individual's right to live in his own country. They also expose the emptiness of the official justification for the government's act — that Kohout's activity while in Austria had harmed state interests abroad and they argue that, in fact, he is being punished for his political activity during 1968. In conclusion, they draw attention to the fact that, on the one hand, the security service is exerting pressure on some Charter signatories to leave Czechoslovakia while, on the other hand, many people, especially the young, are serving harsh sentences for attempting to leave the country without permission. (For Charter 77 policy on freedom of travel, see Charter Document No. 24 in Palach Press Summary No«, 11.) 13. Report by Rudolf Battek on his detention. approx. 900 words In a report dated 10 October 1979 Rudolf Battek describes the details of his arrest on 1 October and his subsequent interrogation. He describes how the security forces planted on him a manuscript entitled 'On Freedom and Power' and draws attention to a number of violations of the law during his detention. In a separate letter, sent on 15 October to the General Public Prosecutor, Battek complains of police violations of legality and demands the return of his typewriter and other items confiscated during police searches of his flat conducted on 10 April and 29 May. (See also VONS statement 140, Palach Press Bulletin No«, 12.) 14. Full text of the verdict against Jan Zmatlik«, approx«, 5,800 words On 10 July 1979 Charter 77 signatory Jan Zmatlik, 31, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years' imprisonment. On 25 October the Supreme Court heard his appeal and reduced the sentence by one year. Zmatlik, a former employee of the Institute of Criminology attached to the General Public Prosecutor's Office, was charged with preparing to commit subversion of the Republic. He was accused of copying and distributing written materials in which 'the policy of the Communist Party and the state leadership, and the foreign policy of the Republic was attacked and abused'. His activity was described as 'dangerous to society' and consisted of 'acquiring means to be used to subvert the Republic out of hostility to socialism, although the criminal act of subversion, or attempted subversion, was not actually committed'. The verdict includes a list of 204 items confiscated from Zmatlik's flat, chiefly Charter documents, reports, and letters«, 7 [pageend8]15. 16. Letter from Michal Dymacek to the World Trade Union Federation and the Confederation of Free Trade Unionso approx. 2,400 words In this letter Dymacek, president of the Union of University Students of Bohemia and Moravia between 1968 and 1969, firstly analyses the general situation in Czechoslovakia and attempts to place it in the context of current European and world problemso He then goes on to discuss his own conflicts with the authorities, which have resulted in him losing his job, and points out that, at a time when Czechoslovakia suffers from a shortage of skilled labour in almost all fields, numerous experts are being dismissed from their jobs for political reasons. Dymacek himself is an expert in computer sciences, a field in which the country lags far behind the West. In an appendix, Dymacek describes the way in which he has been discriminated against at work. This began in 1977 when he signed the Charter and when he was first dismissed from his employment in a factory producing office equipment. At that time the factory management was embarrassed by the political motivation behind the dismissal and therefore told Dymacek that he was being sacked because of overmanning in the factory. Dymacek took the management to court and, because he was able to get hold of documents from the personnel department revealing that there was no truth to the overmanning argument, the court quashed the decision to dismiss him. He then describes how the management offered to reinstate him if he withdrew the case, thus obviating the need for an appeal to be heard. Dymacek agreed to the offer on condition that it was confirmed by the court. An hour after the court had acknowledged this settlement, signed by both parties, the factory trade-union committee gave its consent to a second notice of dismissal and two days later Dymacek was sacked for the second time. This time, the grounds given by the management were clearly political. Dymacek again took the management to court, but without any result. In his statement to the court he showed how even the second dismissal was unlawful. Dymacek encloses with his letter the court’s verdict which states that 'the plaintiff does not fulfil the conditions for the exercise of any function adequate to his high qualifications’; in other words, because of his political convictions, Dymacek is not employable anywhere in his field. In effect, he is banned from his profession which is in itself contrary to a number of laws and trade-union regulations which he then lists. B. Ackermann, ’The role of the village in Czechoslovak society’, approx. 2,400 words In this article an author using a pseudonym ’Ackermann’ discusses the role of the village as a stabilising factor in Czechoslovak society. He takes for granted such well-known factors as relative affluence and traditional conservatism and concentrates on a third factor, the role of what he terms the ’agro-mafia'. The origins of this he traces back to 1945 when, for opportunistic reasons, some sections of the then strong Agrarian Party joined the communists. Now there exists a combination of local village bureaucracy and a local ’mafia’ which effectively run a society of their own in the countryside. This is based on the close social networks of the countryside. Ackermann gives a number of examples to show how difficult it is for the central authorities to exert control over the 8 [pageend9]village and counteract the tendencies towards local autonomy«, The close social relations of the countryside mean, for example, that the security services cannot function effectively: either their officials become completely ostracised or completely drawn into the local networks. The 'parallel economy' operates more or less independently of the town. It is only now that the 'mafia' has begun to set up local industrial cooperatives which are linked with the town that the village is becoming more controllable«, 'Ackermann' shows how corruption becomes institutionalised, how the party secretary inevitably gets drawn into the networks, and how it enables certain sections of the economy to survive«, Punishment is meted out only in extreme cases and only to unimportant people«, 17o Gertruda Sekaninova-Cakrtova, 'Memories for today'«» approx«, 1,400 words Sekaninova-Cakrtova was deputy foreign minister during the 1950s and a deputy to the Federal Assembly during the 1960s. In this essay, provoked by what has happened to Dr Josef Danisz and 'ten of my friends', she recalls how similar people were treated before and even during the war. She gives a number of examples, drawn largely from the experience of her husband who before the war defended a number of communists against their governments, including Nazi Germany«» (Sekaninova-Cakrtova's husband defended, among others, Dimitrov. He was eventually killed by the Nazis and is presented in Czechoslovakia today as a communist hero.) She compares the possibilities given to defence lawyers now and then, the length of prison sentences, prison conditions, and the possibilities of attending political trials, even abroad«, Before the war, Communist deputies in Czechoslovakia usually received prison sentences of between two and four weeks for incitement, and four months for subversion. She gives examples of international solidarity, including cooperation between defence lawyers of different nationalities, and the actual presence of foreign lawyers and observers during proceedings before the war, even in Nazi Germany. She concludes that her long experience has taught her that it is essential for people to be able to count on democratic criticism, openness, human interest and solidarity, especially at the time of political trials«. 18. Portrait of Jiri Nemec: 'A clergyman without a collar' This anonymous essay, clearly written by a friend of Jiri Nemec, discusses the latter's role in the Czech underground and the great respect which Nemec enjoyed among the young, particularly from the mid-1970s onwards«, The writer lists some of the philosophers whose work Nemec helped to introduce into Czechoslovakia, among them Heidegger, Teilhard de Chardin, and Martin Buber. During the 1960s Nemec took part in the dialogue between Christians and Marxists and he has written a number of works on psychology and phenomenology. He was one of those singled out for attack in a pamphlet "Zpravy", produced by the Soviet occupying forces. 9 [pageend10]19. A fatal car accident still unsolved«, approx. 1800 words plus approx. 6600 words of supplements This report is compiled by Tana Holečkova, widow of Luboš Holeček, a former student leader. Holeček died in hospital on 7 May 1976, two days after being hit by a car driven by Dr Jiri Sidlo, an employee of the Public Prosecutor's Office. Holeček was one of the main student leaders during the years 1963-1969 and was well-known for his consistent opposition views«, This report, dated 13 April 1979, is addressed to 'a friend of Luboš Holeček'. The report goes through the findings of ten different court sessions attempting to establish whether or not Sidlo was guilty of causing the accident. The circumstances of the accident are still unclear. On 24 March 1977, a District Court in Prague 2 sentenced Sidlo to 14 months' imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, and he was banned from driving for two years. Sidlo appealed against the sentence, as did the prosecutor who asked for him to serve his prison sentence. On 6 June 1978 the Prague Municipal Court quashed the verdict and returned the case to the District Court, demanding a new verdict and making a number of comments critical of the prosecution and favourable to the defendant. On 19 February 1979 the District Court in Prague 2 announced that, following a new investigation, the defendant had been fully acquitted. The prosecutor appealed and the case is currently once more before the Prague Municipal Court. Tana Holečkova encloses the various verdicts on the case. Her report lists a number of facts which give reasonable grounds to suspect that the accident was inadquately investigated by the court, that there were serious shorcomings in the police investigation at the scene of the accident, and she shows that there are some contradictions between the statements of the defendant and those of some of the witnesses. She sent the report and the enclosed documents to a close friend of her husband, now living in the West, as 'representative of the public' who should be informed of the fact that even three years after the accident the crucial circumstances remain unclear and the authorities appear unwilling to punish the person responsible for Holeček's death. 20. Jiri Rumi, 'Report on Incitement to Commit a Criminal Act', approx. 500 words Tn this short essay Rumi describes his encounter with two policemen who camped outside his door during the VONS trial and prevented the majority of his visitors from entering his flat. They informed Rumi that he could make an official complaint about their behaviour. Rumi lightheartedly discusses how such complaints could lead to a conviction on charges of subversion of the Republic and imprisonment. 10 [pageend11]21e Karel Kyncl, 'The Creator of History: Colleague Jiri Svic This satirical essay describes Kyncl’s experience with his former radio colleague, Jiri Svic, currently Press Attache to the Czechoslovak Embassy in Austria«, After the Czechoslovak government's refusal to readmit Pavel Kbhout to the country, the Czech embassy in Vienna issued a statement in which it asserted that Austria had greater need of Czechoslovakia than vice versa and warned Austria not to risk the friendship between the two countries in the interest of subversive activists. This statement, which evoked an angry protest from the Austrian government, was subsequently repudiated by the Czechoslovak government who claimed that it reflected only the views of the Vienna Press Attache, Svic«, Kyncl recalls other occasions on which Svic has made serious blunders — in the mid-sixties he reported falsely that North Vietnamese patrol boats had sunk an American destroyer, and concludes by speculating on the possible impact of people like Svic occupying influential positions. 23 October 1979 22. Eva Kantůrkova, 'Punished solidarity' approx. 1, 200 words In this general essay on the situation in Czechoslovakia, Kanturkova takes the recent VONS trial to discuss the role of solidarity in a socialist state and the attitudes of the public in a country where all major events are determined by the state. 23. The case of Zuzanna Richterova Many Chartists have been sacked from their jobs or expelled from schools and universities for having signed the Charter. Richterova's case is one of the most recent but it well illustrates the expulsion of students solely for their political beliefs if these are contrary to those which the authorities think that their graduates should have. Richterova's expulsion from the J. E. Purkyne University in Brno was justified on the grounds that she hadn's informed the university authorities that she had signed the Charter. (A photocopy of the official correspondence can be made available on request.) 24. Ekonomická Revue No. IV (Summer 1979), 56 pp. The fourth issue of the samizdat journal Ekonomická Revue appeared in the summer of 1979. The contents include an article by Dr Vladimir Kadlec, an economist and former Minister of Education, entitled 'Are we facing an economic reform?'. Kadlec speculates on whether Czechoslovakia is now witnessing a slow and covert return to at least some aspects of the economic reforms of the late 1960s and criticises the economic parts of Mr Brezhnev's election speech of 2 March 1979. There is a translation of an interview with two distinguished Polish economists, Karol Szwarc and Jozef Pajestka, reprinted 11 [pageend12]from the Polish economic weekly, Zycie Gospodarcze, in which they discuss ways of increasing initiative and improving the efficiency of industrial enterprises«. This is followed by an anonymous contribution dealing with the shortage of medicines and the problems facing the pharmaceutical industry in Czechoslovakia, a long article by a number of authors on the state of Czechoslovak agriculture, an analysis of the construction industry and the problem of unfinished housing construction, and an article by Jan Jizl on the general economic situation and the prospects for the Czechoslovak economy» Palach Press can supply the following issues of Informace o Charte 77 (Information about Charter 77) which have reached us since the last issue of our bulleting and Summary: No. 10, 12 June - 4 July 1979 No. 11, 5 July - 15 August 1979 No. 12, 16 August - 10 September 1979 No. 13, 11 September - 30 September 1979 No. 14, 1 October - 18 October 1979 No. 15, 19 October - 24 November 1979.
