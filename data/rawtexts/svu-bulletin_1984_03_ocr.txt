Fischmann Box 134 Corona, CA 91718 SVU Activities THE TWELFTH WORLD CONGRESS OCTOBER 25-28, 1984 THE ROYAL YORK HOTEL TORONTO, ONTARIO The Twelfth World Congress in Toronto was the first one organized outside the United States, though intercongress conferences had been held in Ottawa and Montreal, in Los Angeles twice, in Switzerland five times and once in Vienna, Austria. This year, SVU availed itself of the hospitality of Canada after the summer festivities, celebrating Ontario’s Bicentennial and Toronto’s 150th birthday, were over. All organizational meetings and academic sessions took place in the comfortable convention rooms of the Royal York Hotel. This made the “circulation” among various rooms easier and facilitated contacts of all participants. The heart, of course, was the registration desk, unselfishly attended by the members of the local arrangements committee. The nearby display of books for sale also became very popular and, for one afternoon, hand-made textiles of the type of Czechoslovak national costumes were also available. ★ A NON-PROFIT CULTURAL ORGANIZATION [pageend1]GENERAL ASSEMBLY - THURSDAY, OCTOBER 25,1984 The President of the Society, Leopold Pospisil, Yale University, greeted all present SVÜ members and asked for one minute of silence to remember deceased members. After the invocation, pronounced by Rev.Fa. Blazek, last General Assembly meeting minutes were approved, and reports of the officers followed. Dr. Pospisil summed up his four years as the President and stated that it was a satisfactory, but tin and energy consuming, task. He commented on the initial difficulties of Kosmas (see below) and expressed his satisfaction with the solid financial basis of the Society and the increase of membership (243 new members during the last four years). He mentioned with appreciation the work of the publication committee, Zprávy and Bulletin, and of the Vice-Presidents in charge of specific tasks. He had the final responsibility for two world congresses and four conierences (ivionueal on energy, Boston on Robotics, Vienna and Bern;. The number of local chapters recently reached twenty-one, with Perth, Hartford, Pittsburgh, Edmonton and München. Some changes in the bylaws were accomplished, and the procedure for elections by written ballots is functioning. He also informed the audience that the legal negotiations, concerning the building in New York, are progressing; this would finally give the Society its own office and the much needed space for its archives. Anthony V. Krondl, M.D., University of Toronto, Chairman of the local arrangements, explained some of the special events: the Art Exhibition, a piano and flute recital at the Royal Conservatory of Music, and a Czech theatrical group’s presentation, as well as the customary banquet. He also called attention to other Toronto attractions, such as: Royal Ontario Museum (ROM), world-renowned Ontario Science Center and the Art Gallery of Ontario. Igor V. Nabelek, University of Tennessee, Vice-President in charge of local chapters, had the news about a possibility of a new chapter in Frankfurt/M. He mentioned that the London chapter lost by death some of its key persons and is trying to reorganize. So far the Czechoslovaks in Norway have not been able to establish their local chapter. The Los Angeles chapter is still the only one that produces a local Bulletin in English. The next speaker was Thomas G. Winner, Boston University-Harvard, Program Chairman. He specifically thanked all who took responsibility for the academic program (see all names in Documents). This was a somewhat different approach to the programming as the chairman closely worked with this panel of experts who then made up their particular sessions. Special thanks also went to Zdenka Salivarova-Skvorecka, Sixty-Eight Publishers Corporation of Toronto, who was in charge of the printing of the Abstracts. Bulletin, edited by Zdenka E.

Kucera, Secretary General, read a letter from Jaroslav Nemec from Washington, D.C., editor of Zprávy, who could not come to Canada. Dr. Nemec reported that he has produced eleven issues since he accepted the editorship in 1983 and that he needs more news from the members. Jan Jiri Oppit, M.D., President of the Cleveland local chapter, gave a report on their activities and asked for more contact between chapters and some exchange of available programs. Dr. Pospisil then announced that a special session was arranged in honor of the poet Jaroslav Seifert who was just awarded the 1984 Nobel Prize for Literature. A congratulatory telegram was sent to Seifert who is in a Prague hospital. Another resolution was also approved, referring to the merits of the late Sir Cecil Cuthbert Parrott, a great friend of Czechoslovak culture, translator of Hasek’s Svejk and a dedicated Slavist at the University of Lancaster, England. Next, the proposal of the Board of Directors, to award SVU honorary membership to three Czechoslovak writers - Jaroslav Seifert, Vaclav Havel and Milan Kundera - was put for discussion and vote, and was approved (see Congress Documents for all these actions). Josef Stasa, Treasurer, briefly commented on the Financial Statement he distributed. As both Auditors of the Accounts, Frank J. Marlow from Los Angeles and Frank Meissner from Washington D.C., approved tne statement in writing, it was unanimously accepted by the audience. After an absolutorium was given to the 1982-1984 Board of Directors -and all were thanked for the work done — Miloslav Rechcigl, Past President and Chairman of the nomination committee announced the results of the election. THE NEW BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR 1984-1986 Jiri Nehnevajsa - President Igor Nabelek - Executive Vice-President Anton Novačky - Vice-President (Sciences) Emil S. Purgina - Vice-President (Arts) Vera Borkovec - Vice-President (Student Affairs) Cestmir Jesina - Vice-President (Local Chapters) Josef Skvorecky - Vice-President (Publication Committee) Vladimir Μ. Kabes - Vice-President (Press and PR) Milos K. Kucera - Secretary General Josef Stasa - Treasurer Also elected were the members of SVU Council, Auditors of the Accounts and members of the Conciliation and Arbitration Committee. The editors of all four periodicals are the same. The new President, Jiri Nehnevajsa, professor of sociology, University of Pittsburgh, then addressed the audience. He stressed the good morale and financial security of the Society, acknowledging the merits of the past Board headed by Leopold Pospisil, who was last May elected member of the prestigious National Academy of Sciences for his work in the field of anthropology. He also expressed satisfaction that Vera Borkovec, American University, Washington, D.Č., is the first woman Vice-President of the Society, not as a token but for her professionalism and valuable, long 3 [pageend3]term work for the Society and Czechoslovak culture. Another change in the composition of the Board is the very pleasing fact that we have three Vice- Presidents who are Slovakian born. Dr. Nehnevajsa stressed that he wants more moral and spiritual importance for SVU and more cooperation between the Board and the membership. Any projects, proposed by local chapters or individual members, have to be self sufficient, for the Society can financially support only a few things at a time, in addition to its periodicals and regular expenses. However, the Board will continue coordinating significant efforts that are of interest for the whole Society. ★ kCADEMIC PROGRAM As to the academic program, it seems everything went well. There were thirty sessions, mostly averaging some six papers. Anthropology, Philosophy, Economics, History of Art, Women’s Studies, Political Science, Film, Poetry Reading, Psychology, History of Science and Church History had one session each. Natural Sciences, Musicology, Sociology and Czechs & Slovaks Abroad had two, History and Linguistics three, and Medicine five sessions. The Film Session consisted of viewing of “The Wind in the Pocket” (Vitr v kapse) and discussion. Such concurrent riches made for difficult choices and repeated apologies for missed lectures. ★ TRIBUTE TO JAROSLAV SEIFERT A ioint session was held Saturday noon, October 27. to oav tribute to this Nobel laureate. Rene Wellek, professor emeritus, Yale University, and Past SVU President, chaired. Thomas G. Winner, Boston University-Harvard, encapsulated the main facts of Seifert’s life and traced the evolution of his artistry from the proletarian poetry of the early twenties - before Seifert broke with the Communist party and was expelled - through the poetism of the Czech avantgarde and French influences of dada and surrealism, toward becoming the voice of his nation at the times of President Masaryk’s death and of Munich, and during the Nazi occupation. His work as cultural editor of Prace newspaper from 1945 to 1949 was followed by his silence, except for children’s verses, while he freelanced as writer and editor of poetry. This silence was interrupted when Seifert was elected as President of the Writers Union during Prague Spring. After the Soviet occupation and especially after he signed Charta 77, his poetry was not published at all in Czechoslovakia. His collection The Plague Monument (1977), for example, first appeared in the exile publishing house Index and in the bilingual edition in 1980 (SVU Press, New York). George Gibian, Cornell University, analyzed in more detail Seifert’s style. He suggested that one could characterize Seifert as a combination of Robert Frost and Apollinaire. Seifert’s allusiveness is difficult to convey in translation, as he refers to Czech history, familiar stories, places, flowers and other specifics or symbols which reflect the attitudes of his Czech readers. He may be conversational, “homey,” or subtly irreverent: he understates as a skillful minimalist; he exudes sensuality, charm and eroticism in his euphonious and melodious verses; melancholy, love of Prague and 4 [pageend4]preoccupation with death are strong components of his poetic palette. How to make these verses comprehensible and impactful in translations is a problem. Dr. Gibian then read several of his translations of Seifert’s poems he is working on and kindly sent two of them, never translated before, for this publication. I A Conversation /She/: Were you kissing my forehead or my mouth, 1 don’t know I only caught the sound of a sweet voice and thick darkness Encircled my frightened eyelashes. /He/: I kissed you hastily on your forehead, because I was benumbed by the fragrance of your streaming breath, but I don’t know — I only caught the sound of a sweet voice and thick darkness encircled my frightened eyelashes, were you kissing my forehead or my mouth? II You have skin pale like a snowdrop. but a mouth fragrant like a rose. The words of love are monotonous, what shall I do with them, now, when I am waiting for your reply and in confusion hurrying for it. You have skin pale like a snowdrop, but a mouth fragrant like a rose. Only don’t deceive me in the end, but let the fear that screens your eyes vanish quickly, please, look — like the snow that fell last year. You have skin pale like a snowdrop, but a mouth fragrant like a rose. Jaroslav Seifert Translation Copyright George Gibian 5 [pageend5]The third speaker was the writer Josef Skvorecky, University of Toronto and Sixty-Eight Publishers. He shared personal reminiscences of Seifert, his neighbor in Břevnov, whom he visited in the hospital when the poet was ill but spiritually unconquered. He remembers well Seifert’s public defense of people incarcerated in the fifties and his anger after August ‘68. Though usually gentle, Seifert has been courageous and at times radical in his indignation. To make Seifert more familiar outside of Czechoslovakia, as had happened with another “unknown” Nobel laureate, the Polish poet Czeslav Milosz, good selection and quality translations of his most significant poems are needed. The titles of his poetry volumes also have to be standardized. ★ MENDEL MEMORIAL MEETING Another very special part of the academic program was the “Mendel Memorial Meeting, at the Occasion of the Centennial of J. G. Mendel’s Death.” This session (Sunday afternoon, October 28) was organized in conjunction with the Mendel-Frimmel Society for Applied Genetics, Freising, Federal Republic of Germany, Dr. Oldřich Konvička, President. A Mendel Exhibit accompanied the symposium in which four speakers from West Germany and one each from Sweden and the United States participated. Gregor Mendel (1822-1884), crossing varieties of garden peas in the garden of the Augustinian monastery in Brno, discovered the laws of certain dominant and recessive characteristics (today called genes) and thus is celebrated as the founder of modern genetics (see Documents for Leopold Pospisil’s introduction to this symposium.) ★ Organizational Meetings of Librarians of Czech and Slovak Descent and of an Interest Group in History and Genealogy of Czechs and Slovaks Abroad also took place (see Documents for the outline, details next time.) ■ *· ★ ★ SPECIAL EVENTS We reprint in full the information about the Art Exhibit whose opening on Thursday evening served as the customary cocktail party.

Josef Skvorecky, in his role of an M.C., first introduced the guests of honor, members of the Board of Directors and the editors of SVU periodicals. He informed those present about the awarding of honorary memberships, the telegram to Seifert and the resolution concerning Sir Cecil Parrott. 8 [pageend8]George Ignatieff, Chancellor of the University of Toronto, welcomed the Congress. He explained that, as a refugee himself, he feels particularly in sympathy with our Society. He mentioned his meeting with Jan Masaryk in 1948 during his -diplomatic service, and his efforts, as a member of the Security Council in 1968, to combat the idea that the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia was by invitation. His message was that “we may lose the country but not our identity.” He omitted to say that the day before he received the annual Pearson Peace Award from Governor-General Jeanne Sauve for his lifetime contribution to peace, in a ceremony at Government House in Ottawa. Past President Leopold J. Pospisil, once more thanked all who cooperated so well with his endeavors and passed the speaker’s lectern to the new President, Jiri Nehnevajsa, who spoke both in English and French. For the Czechs and the Slovaks abroad, he used the image of raindrops, scattered all over the world, and expressed gratefulness to the United States and Canada for giving so many people from Czechoslovakia the opportunity to live in freedom. He told some about his background, underlining it with a recorded traditional Moravian-Slovakian song, reminding us of our roots. He emphasized the function of SVU and of each one of the members as carrying the torch of Czech and Slovak culture and history. Our task as builders and not destroyers is to work for decent human future. Helping each other, and especially the young people, is an important aspect, if we want to have an impäct on the future in this endangered world of 1984. The last speaker, Jiri Corn, President of the Czechoslovak Association of Canada, brought the greetings from the Canadian Minister of Multicultural Affairs who could not attend. He briefly stated that there are eight million refugees and immigrants among the twenty-two million born Canadians. He hoped that SVU will come again to Canada with some of the future meetings. A very short musical program consisted of two arias sang by the soprano Bilkova, one of them being Rusalka’s “Moon Aria.” After this official part of the banquet, all enjoyed socializing ahd dancing until late hours of the night. ★ The 28th October Celebration in Toronto, was held on Friday, October 26, in the St. Vladimir Institute. The Principal speakers were Jiri Corn, President of the Czechoslovak Association of Canada, and Leopold Pospisil. The New Theatre in Toronto (Nove divaldo v Torontě), founded in 1965, then presented a witty adaptation of Thornton Wilder’s The Skin of Our Teeth. A CZECH VERSION OF THORNTON WILDER’S “THE SKIN OF OUR TEETH” The New Theater (Nove Divadlo) in Toronto prepared for the Twelfth World Congress of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences a Czech version of Thornton Wilder’s famous play “The Skin of Our Teeth,” under the title (quite a successful translation) “Jeh vo chlup.” 9 [pageend9]The play was well attended, and those who came to see it were well rewarded· The production was delightful — admirable direction, skillful cast and interesting, stylized sets which changed as the projector flashed different patterns upon them. Director Tomas Masek, who also acted and helped design the sets, adapted the play (originally produced in New Haven in 1942) to our times in Czechoslovakia, 1939 and August 1968 (The Ice Age — a mountain of ice is moving in from the East). Staying very close to the Wilder text, director Masek easily transported us from New York to Prague, as Zdenka-Sabina opens the play with the familiar lines: “Six o’clock and the master not home yet. Pray God nothing serious has happened to him crossing the Vltava (Hudson).” Since this is a play about Man (Mr. and Mrs. Antrobus and their children) and the eternal circle in which he turns with his good intentions and his shortcomings, it can be adapted to any time. That is why Director Masek saw the opportunity to update the play. In 1942 the play had antiFascist overtones; now Masek puts the son Cain-Ivan, coming back after The War, into a uniform with a red star on the cap. Ivan lives up to Wilder’s notion that this young man is a “representation of strong unreconciled evil.” Mr. Antrobus (Ferda Culik) and Mrs. Antrobus (Irena Culkova) gave very polished performances. Zdenka-Sabina (Zdenka Novotna) was delightfully pert and handled the difficult part to perfection. Much credit goes to the director for keeping up the spirited tempo of the play. The play ended as it began, followed by Sabina’s advice: “You go home. The end of this play isn’t written yet...” The audience stayed for quite a while applauding the good cast and the very successful production by the Nove Divadlo, convinced that they would like to see this group perform again. vb In the recital. Thursday, October 25 at the Royal Conservatory of Music, two artists performed. Linda DiGiustino Gamble, Associate Professor of Music at West Virginia Wesleyan College, did research on Czechoslovak piano music. She has a doctorate in piano performance and literature. Among other performances, she played in 1983 on Capitol Hill for a celebration of Czechoslovak Independence Day. She performed Smetana’s works, as she also did during the Smetana Centennial in San Diego. We welcome her as a new SVU member. Peter Kotik, SVU member, teaches flute at SUNY, Buffalo Center for Creative and Performing Arts. He graduated from the Conservatory of Music and The Academy of Music Arts in Prague, and also studied at the Academy of Arts in Vienna. Besides concert work he is a composer and performed one of his compositions in this recital. He is well versed in contemporary styles, both as a flutist and composer. ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ 10 [pageend10]CONGRESS DOCUMENTS English Translation of the Telegram Dispatched on October 27 to Nobel Prize Winner Jaroslav Seifert The Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences values the honor bestowed upon you by the award of this year’s Nobel Prize as an important recognition of the Czechoslovak literature as well as a well deserved appreciation of your life-long striving for the poetic expression of beauty, justice and humanism. We congratulate you sincerely and wish you good health and more success. Signed: Professor Jiri Nehnevajsa President Dr. Milos Kucera Secretary General Resolution of the 12th World Congress of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences, held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on October 25-28, 1984 Professor Sir Cecil Cuthbert Parrott who died on June 23, 1984, left an indelible trace in the modern history of the people of Czechoslovakia. As a man of courage and honor, while he worked at HM Legation in Oslo and in Stockholm in 1940-45, and later at the British Embassy in Prague, first as Information Officer in 1945-48 and eventually as Ambassador in 1960-66, he never swerved from helping Czechs and Slovaks endangered by the two dictatorships which have oppressed them in this century. As a man of letters, he gave the English speaking people the first complete and artistically superb translation of the classical novel of Czech literature, The Good Soldier Svejk (1973), and of its author’s short stories The Red Commissar (1981), wrote a comprehensive book about Jaroslav Hasek, The Bad Bohemian (1977) and a book-length analysis of his Hasek, The Bad Bohemian (1977) and a book-length analysis of his magnum opus, Jaroslav Hasek: A Study of Svejk and the Short Stories (1982). As a scholar, he founded the Comenius Centre at the University of Lancaster where he built up the largest collection of Czech books in the West and which for many years was the heart of Czech studies in the Free World. As the head of the Centre he educated several generations of English Bohemicists and wrote numerous essays on Czech literature and theatre. His memory will endure as long as Czech literature stays alive. * [pageend11]Press Release For Immediate Distribution — October 27th, 1984 The General Assembly of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences, held on the occasion of its Twelfth World Congress in Toronto on October 25-28, 1984, decided to confer its Honorary Membership on three renowned Czech writers. JAROSLAV SEIFERT, 83, who has just been awarded the Nobel Prize ior Literature, is the most important living Czech poet. He began publishing poetry in the early 1920’s and succeeded in combining the tradition of Czech lyricism with experimental modern forms. Throughout his literary career, he has consistently upheld the ideals of humanism, democracy and patriotism, which he shared with the first President of the Czechoslovak Republic, Thomas Garrigue Masaryk. However, his work spans also the three eras of totalitarian rule in Czechoslovakia - namely the Nazi oppression (1939-1945), the Communist domination (1948-1968) and the military occupation by the USSR since 1968. In all these trying periods, he repeatedly showed great courage raising his voice in defense of political prisoners, persecuted writers and other victims of intolerance. Jaroslav Seifert is a ‘true poet of his people. VACLAV HAVEL, 47, is a holder of honorary degrees from York University in Toronto (1982) and from the University of Toulouse, France (1984), as well as recipient of the Austrian State Prize for European Literature (1969). In 1968 and 1970 he received the Obie Award for his plays staged in the United States. His courageous behaviour earned him a four- and-a-half year jail sentence which he barely survived. For all of the past 15 years, he has been living under constant police surveillance and harrass- ment. Havel, whose plays were produced all over the world to great critical acclaim, has become known and appreciated as an incorruptible voice of the moral conscience of his peoples. MILAN KUNDERA, 55, recipient of the French Prix Medicis Etranger (1978) and of the Italian Premio Letterario Mondello, is the presently best known self-exiled Czech novelist in the West. In a series of works, he pioneered new methods of story-telling and demonstrated that the novel, far from being dead, can still be a vehicle of innovative forms of expression. In his essays, he dispelled the unfortunately widely held notion that Czechoslovakia is a part of Eastern culture, and stressed the deeply rooted tradition of Western thought in his native country. By conferring Honorary Membership to these three eminent literary artists, the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences wishes to emphasize the indivisible unity of Czech literature, whether written in Czechoslovakia or in exile. * ★ ★ 12 [pageend12]Honorary Committee Dr.George Ignatieff, Chancellor, University of Toronto Tomáš J.

What he could not explain was how the mechanism of heredity worked, how it was possible that advantageous traits inherited from one parent would not simply blend with the less advantaged ones received from the other progenitor, and thus be able to dominate a new organism and allow natural selection to take place. Lamarckism, cherished by Darwin as well as Marx (and more recently by contemporary Marxists, as for example in the Soviet Union Lysenko and Michurin), which believes in inheritance of characteristics acquired during the life of the parents, was already contradicted in the nineteenth century by massive empirical evidence. And yet in those days in his monastery in Brno (Moravia) Gregory Mendel performed his nowadays famous experiments with peas, whose results provided a true solution to the problem. His stupendous discovery that units of heredity did not blend in the progeny, but survived so to speak intact to show themselves in the following generations in a ratio that we today call Mendelian law, laid foundations to the discipline of genetics. For me as an anthropologist, it is interesting how this discovery, which put Darwin’s theory on a solid genetic basis, was ignored until the turn of the century. Mendel had not lived to receive laurels of recognition. Yet in a sense he was still lucky if compared with people like Vavilov, who paid for his scientific work with his life, because his achievements did not conform with the prevailing thought — with the dominant - ism. The history of science, then, teaches us an important lesson: that the objective truth, — that means the scientific truth, — is nondemocratic. One man, like Galilei, Montesquieu, Einstein, or Mendel can be right, and the howling multitude of quasi-scientific disciples, who follow the thoughts of their mentors as dogmas, are wrong. Our Memorial Meeting is dedicated to one of these great men who moved forward the frontiers of human knowledge, yet whose work brought him as the Czecii motto says: “ni zisk — m stavu,” — neither profit, nor glory. ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ KOSMAS. JOURNAL OF CZECHOSLOVAK AND CENTRAL EUROPEAN STUDIES By now, Kosmas Vol. 2, Number 2, has been expedited to the subscribers. The changes of editors and the need to reorganize the whole publishing process - moving it completely to the United States - caused delays that will now be corrected. According to the editor Zdenek L. Suda, Volume 3/1 is ready and will be sent out in January 1985. The next issue will publish selected contributions from the 12th Congress. It will then be possible to dedicate some issues to particular specialties. One number will be in part dedicated to Seifert; another will be prepared by H. Gordon Skilling, concentrating on history, to be followed by a musicological issue. 15 [pageend15]Going back to the Kosmas in our hands, several improvements have been made. There is more information about the journal itself and the current Editorial Board, with instructions to contributors; very helpful are the concise profiles of the authors of the essays. The editor, in his introduction, “Central Europe -- Lost and Forgotten?,” advocates for that area, today apparently “lost” between the West and the East as rigidly delineated by the Iron Curtain.. He gives historical and cultural reasons why such simplistic, geo-political thinking, most clearly embodied by the almost forty years old Yalta agreement, does harm to all Europe. The pages of the journal are open to writers who háve not forgotten the “Heart of Europe.” The first three essays contribute to the knowledge of the sometimes uncomfortable Slovak-Czech relationship. The late Branislav Stefanek (see Bulletin V/2), in his “The Political Culture of the Slovaks and the Czechs,” specifies some differences in the development of democratic ideas in the Czech lands and in Slovakia; he follows them from pre-independence times of visualized “amalgamated” Czechoslovak Republic, realized in 1918 by T. G. Masaryk and his Coworkers from both ethnic groups, to current divisive positions within the exile. Owén.V. Johnson’s “Slovak History Reconsidered: A Sociocultural Perspective”.offers many data on Slovak schools, census results, cultural life and ethnic press in the 19th century, up to 1918, as indicators of national awareness under often very strongly imposed Magyarization. The results suggest that “the future for the Slovak people was not as bleak as the publicists said it was.” Extensive notés are very helpful. Victor S. Mamatey, in “The Czecho-Slovak Agreement of Pittsburgh (May 30, 1918) Revisited,” takes an objective and dispassionate look at various European, American, Czech and Slovak organizations and groups involved in the struggle to dismember the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. He consigns the controversies about such documents as the “Cleveland agreement” of 1915 and the. “Pittsburgh agreement” of 1918 to history, though they have influenced the political coexistence of the Czechs and the Slovaks during the First Republic, and in some respects even in our days. “Anthropology and Science” by Leopold Pospisil is a thorough exposition of: The Discipline of Anthropology and Its Scope, Nature of Science and Anthropology, and Subdisciplines of Anthropology. With his vast field and academic experiences, in Europe and in this country. Dr. Pospisil made the essay highly interesting and instructive. One wonders what he could say about the “complex and sophisticated, mostly urban, tribe of SVU, ” after his four-year stint as the “headman” of the Society. Clinton Machann summarizes some of his research in “Slovo a slovesnost and English Studies in the Prague Circle.” He analyzes the Czech journal Slovo a* slovesnost from 1935 to 1938, but also gives the history of the Prague Linguistic Circle, often called Prague School in English sources, that counted such personalities as Roman Jakobson, Rene Wellek, Jan Mukarovsky, Milada Souckova, the Anglicist Vilem Mathesius, and many- others. The author comes to the conclusion that there had been a more intensive study of English language, literature and culture than has been known. He brings proof in the text and in the extensive bibliography. 16 [pageend16]The last part of H. Gordon Skilling’s “Letters from Prague 1939” offers sympathetic eyewitness impressions of the events and moods in Prague, after the Munich crisis and during the anxious months before the March 15 Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia — while he was working on his dissertation centering on “the Czech-German national conflict in the nineteenth century, although the contemporary version of that conflict all around me seemed much more real and important.” His wife was “fully occupied with refugee work at the Friends Service.” Dr. Skilling eventually finished his thesis in England and left Europe for his native Canada in July 1940, “just before the Blitz on London began.” Especially the postcard of March 15 and a long letter of March 20, both to his parents in Canada, are most eloquent. “The White Mountain” is an excerpt from the memoirs of Ivan Jelinek -poet, diplomat, journalist and officer of the Czechoslovak army corps in England during WWII. He describes his return to post-war Czechoslovakia and the discontent of his co-fighters who could not come to terms with the country for whose freedom they shed blood and found it coming closer and closer under the Soviet influence. Various prominent politicians figure in this narrative. In 1947, when the American offer of the Marshall Plan was rejected by Czechoslovakia, under pressure by Stalin, Ivan Jelinek decided to go back to London where he still lives. He concludes this chapter of his forthcoming book: “The tragedy of the White Mountain repeated itself after all - all but the battle.” In 1620, the battle on White Mountain marked the end of the Kingdom of Bohemia and the beginning of three-hundred years of Hapsburg rule. A delightful confrontation of an American student who innocently enrolled in a class “named something like Modern Central European Writers of the 20th Century,” taught by a Czech refugee professor, is the subject of Daniel Leizman’s “Portrait of a Being as a Young American.” His feelings at the end of the class were anger and resentment “that my innocence was lost through this literature. That at only twenty, I was forced into an awareness of the reality of the 20th century.” Yet he learned a lot of what he did not want to face and even felt some affection toward the “strange” professor. The reviews section has Frank Meissner’s evaluation of Jozka Pejskar’s Poslední pocta (The Last Honour-I: Memorial for Czechoslovak Refugees 1948-1981; Zurich, Switzerland, Konfrontace Publishers, 1982); Zdenek Suda’s report on Acta Creationis: Independent Historiography in Czechoslovakia 1969-1980, presented by Vilem Precan to the XVth International Congress of Historical Sciences in Bucharest, Rumania, August 1980 which was published in Hannover the same year; and -kls-s’ analysis of studies No. 1-4, published by Research Project “Crises in Soviet-Type Systems” in Vienna, Austria, 1982-1984. ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ 17 [pageend17]SVU BULLETIN So far this Bulletin has been distributed to all members as an English Supplement to Zprávy SVU. In the Board meeting in Toronto, the decision was made that, starting with the first number in 1985, SVU Bulletin will be coming out four times per year and will be distributed independently. Consequently, all membes are urged to kindly mark whether they want Zprávy only, Bulletin only, or both, when they get their next dues statement from the Treasurer. Also, addresses of English speaking persons or institutions where SVU news would-be appreciated, are needed. The primary reason for having an English periodical has been to reach people - members and friends — interested in Czechoslovak culture who do not read Czech or Slovak and wish to know more about the Society and related issues. Using this opportunity, the editor asks and suggests: 1) All Ww officers, please, send your vitae, preferrably in English, and, all members tell us something about yourselves and your activities from time to time, and about such events that could interest the readers from other areas. Newspaper clippings, journal articles and similar sources in English are welcome and all will be eventually used. 2) Could the chairpersons of the academic program send short resumes of their Congress sessions? There always are interesting speakers, ideas and discussions that never reach those who did not attend particular sessions. Unless all papers were published, the majority of members, in fact, remain ignorant about the most essential part of the Congress. 3) Books for reviews (even as a loan) are welcome, unless they are too technical and specialized. Send copies of reviews of the books by SVU members or other writers on Czechoslovak issues. The editor simply cannot “read everything” and has no avycss to every book or journal of interest. 4) In the past, Stanley Marsik tried to organize a Speakers Bureau. As the need for closer cooperation among the members and of some exchange of programs between local chapters has been periodically discussed as highly desirable, we could start to pyblish a list of Available Lec- tures/Programs in English. Zprávy perhaps could do the same for lectures/programs held in Czech. To make it very simple, send just the minimal information: Presented where - title indicating the contents - who to contact. This might at least help to localize those who are willing to share their expertise with others. This SVU Bulletin will go into its sixth volume in 1985. So far, enough material was collected or produced each time but there is always place for improvements and more variety. If everybody who has promised to send some material does so, the Bulletin will be in clover indefinitely. However, “think Bulletin” between the issues and share your knowledge with all of us. Zdenka E. Fischmann Box 0134 Corona, CA 91718-0134 18 [pageend18]What’s Your Thing? Here is the continuation of “our things” for your interest. We plan to enlarge this section in terms of both categories and information. The Secretary, all officers of the Society and the editor of this Bulletin (all of whose addresses appear on the first page) will be glad to serve as liasons between SVU members and interested readers. Communication is one of our main aims. LITERATURE On Translating Seifert’s Poetry All of a sudden everybody is translating Seifert. We are doing it in good faith, no doubt, incensed by the articles which appeared in the New York Times and in the Washington Post in which the question was raised as to whether our beloved poet is really the genius we Czechs think he is. The Washington Post, more generously, placed the blame at the doorsteps of the translators, saying that perhaps something is lost in translation between Prague and New York. (Not only New York, I would add. I know of some very inadequate translations into Russian - and that, after all, is a related Slavic language). We do have Lyn Coffin’s capable translation of The Plague Monument, published by the SVU, and perhaps some other lovingly written translations will follow. Like Lyn Coffin, we will probably stay with Seifert’s unrhymed verse, because only a poet of his caliber should tackle Seifert’s rhymed poetry. Yet, as Skvorecky says, if his rhymed poetry is not translated into rhymed verse, we will have lost a very great part of Seifert. Alas, great poetry is always very difficult, if not impossible to translate. I know of no good translation of Pushkin’s Onegin (no, not even Nabokov’s) and it occurs to me that Pushkin would be Seifert’s best translator, if only we could bring him back through a time machine. I have before me a published Russian translation of that poem most of us know by heart, “Píseň o rodné zemi” (Song of the Native Land). The translator kept the pattern of the rhyme, but missed everything else. Indeed, when you look at the first stanza: "Krásna jako kvítka na modřanském díbánku je tážeme, která vlastí je ti, krásné, jako kvítka na modřanském džbánku, sladká, jako střída dalamánku, do nějž nůž jsi vnoril k rukojeti." you realize the many pitfalls these five lines present and that to deal with them in translation is to sail between Scylla and Charybdis. These are only a few of the problems: 1) The use of diminutives like kvítka, džbánek, dalamánek, which did not even occur to the Russian poet, nor perhaps would to an American poet who thinks of his own native land as “beautiful for spacious skies:” 19 [pageend19]2) The originality of the rhymes: džbánku with dalamánku, vlastí je ti with rukojeti; 3) The down-to-earthness of the metaphors: “sladká jako střída dalamánku” - and mind you, he does not use the triter symbol of bread, but dalamánek, a hard-crust roll, which despite its etymology of “pain d’Allemagne” carries within it the smells of home and halfforgotten childhood joys, an image as rounded as the syllables that make it up; 4) The alliteration of sounds, particularly those beautiful large rounded vowels, as in krjfstiiä, modřanském, džbánku, vlastí", sladká", dalamánku.. . The Russian poet, trying to save the rhyme and to some extent meter, changed the little jug to “ancient goblets,” lost the beauty of the word dalamanek-” smell of the bread”- and added the image of “peasant hearths.” One shouldn’t add to Seifert. In his poetry less is more. Simplicity of imagery and the brittle lightness of his verse are the hallmarks of Seifert’s poetry. This is what makes him so difficult to translate. Can it be done at all? Seifert deserves to be known to a larger public. Perhaps a great poet can be found who can translate his rhymed poetry. In the meantime we can try to translate more of his unrhymed verse — but let us be selective and publish only the best of these efforts. vb ★ SEIFERT’S PROSE The only sample in English ot Seifert prose seems to be the short chapter 69 from his memoirs Všecky krasy sveta (All the Beauties of th< World; Sixty-Eight Publishers Corporation, Box 695, Postal Station “A”, Toronto, Ont. M5W 1G2, Canada). The Czech edition was published in cooperation with Index Publishers and the Charta 77 Foundation, in September 1981, to remember Seifert’s 80th birthday. The excerpt, in the translation by Mark Suino, appeared in Cross Currents 1983. A Yearbook of Central European Culture, edited by Ladislav Matějka and Benjamin Stolz as Michigan Slavic Materials, No. 23 (Michigan Slavic Publications, Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures, 3040 Modern Languages Building, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109). The chapter is called “Russian Bliny” and describes how Seifert was introduced to this ethnic variety of pancakes by his friend, the world renowned linguist Roman Jakobson, who lived and worked in Prague in the twenties. This particular Seifert’s rememberance was apparently chosen as a part of the module dedicated to Jakobson who died in Boston on July 18, 1982. It is followed by two of Nezval’s poems, “Letter to Roman Jakobson” and “Roman Jakobson;” “The Mad Scientist” by Mac Hammond and “In Memoriam: R. J.” by Dell Hymes, as well as “The Czech Comenius” by Jakobson. 20 [pageend20]in the “Russian Bliny” both Jakobson and Nezval play a role. It would seem that the translation of Seifert’s prose style should not cause such problems as his poetry. Indeed, it reads very well. Yet two instances of “cultural distance” have to be pointed out. The translator says that “you pour hot butter over it, and spread thick sweetened sour cream over it.” Seifert talks about a rather common culinary ingredient and says: “polijeme [to]... nustou sladkou smetanou.” Well, the fresh, natural cream, before it sours — or before it is churned into sweet butter — is a pourable commodity, while the American sour cream (kysela smetana) isn’t. Such a detail, at first reading, would probably not catch my attention, had not a newspaperman recently translated the name of Bedrich Smetana as: “it means sour cream.” That Seifert would wax poetic about “sweetened sour cream” over bliny, filled with caviar, smoked salmon, herring and similar things, is improbable. Later on Seifert talks about “the old Villa Theresa in Zizkov, - na rozmezí mezi Rajskou zahradou a Riegrovymi sady - between the Rajsky and Rieger gardens.” Somehow, for any Prague native, the imagination stimulating “Paradise Garden” and the public-minded “Rieger Park,” named after the 19th century conservative politician, would evoke more topical associations. These are nitpicking minutiae, of course, yet they add authenticity to Seifert’s work in translation. The whole Cross Currents 1983 will be reviewed next time, but the first article of the volume is also very timely. Vaclav Havel’s “The Power of the Powerless” (Czech original published in London, 1979, under the title Moc bezmocných,” translated by Paul Wilson) explains how the behavior and thinking of Soviet sphere citizens is currently molded, and what “the specter of what in the West is called dissent” means in such an environment. A short monologue, written by Arthur Miller for performance at the International Theatrical Festival in Avignon, “I Think About You a Great Deal,” complements Havel’s quest of “living within the truth.” ZEF ★ BOOKS The second volume of Jožka Pejskar’s Poslední pocta (The Last Honour) will come out around Christmas and will be available soon thereafter. ★ The third volume of The Jews of Czechoslovakia, produced by the Society for the History of Czechoslovak Jews, is expected to appear in the near future. 21 [pageend21]1984 LOS ANGELES TIMES BOOK PRIZE WINNERS The end of 1984 must be a year of Czechoslovak literature. In addition to the Nobel laureate Seifert, Milan Kundera’s The Unbearable Lightness of Being was selected. The honor goes also to his translator, Michael Henry Heim of UCLA, SVU member. FICTION MILAN KUNDERA "The Unbearable Lightness of Being" (Harper & Row) JUDGE'S COMMENT: “Encyclopaedic and epigrammatic, profound and playful, Kundera explores the intersection of the sublime and the ridiculous to give us an important chapter in the moral history of our time. " In the category ot Biography, another Prague writer was honored in a different way, when the book The Nightmare of Reason. A Biography of Franz Kafka by Ernst Pawel was selected. The work is dedicated to Ottla Kafka and Milena Jesenská. BIOGRAPHY ERNST PAWEL “The Nightmare of Reason” Straus A Giroux) JUDGE'S COMMENT: "With a historian's care, a devotion to detail, Ernst Pawel writes of franz Kafka's life, but it is as a novelist that Pawel pays Kafka the highest compliment one writer can pay another, turning the life^the ‘nightmare years'— info a work of delicate art." (The Book Review / ros Angeles Times, Sunday, November 4, 1984 Illustrations by Hank Hinton) 22 [pageend22]News Received The Slavic Department of Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana offers every year two two-semester courses in Czech and one two-semester course in Czech and Slovak Literature and Culture.
