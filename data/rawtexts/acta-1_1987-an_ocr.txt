Nonetheless, these can be matters of fundamental importance, because independent litera ture undoubtedly plays a crucial role in pre- serving and maintaining Czechoslovakia's threa- tened cultural continuity and asserting the spiri- tual identity of Czechs and Slovaks. Hence the need to deal in greater detail and more methodi- cally not only with the history and present deve- Iopment of independent Czech and Slovak lite- rature but also with matters related to archival treatment, scholarship and the dissemination of book and magazíne output, either in the original language or translation. Accordingly, our quarterly is intended not just for Czechoslovak readers at home and abroad but also for other interested parties throughout the world , from the general reading public to specialists working in universities, academic in- stitutions, libraries, editorial boards and publis- hing houses. In an effort to make independent Czechoslovak writing accessible to the broadest readership, ACTA is published not only in Czech but also in an English version, and a Ger- man edition is also planned. A part from news of the CSDC's activities, ser- vices, library and archives, the ACTA will also provide systematic information about indepen- dent publishing in Czechoslovakia. lts aim is gra- dually to publish comprehensive bibliographical surveys of the various series of samizdat books and journals, together, where possible, with brief descriptions of individua! volumes or is- sues. An example of what we mean is the survey of the samizdat book series New Thought Trails in this present issue. Similar surveys will be pu- blished in subsequent issues. In addition , these surveys will be supplemen- ted with news of recent samizdat publications as information becomes available. It is also plan- ned to publish brief reviews of new titles. Elsew- here in this issue you will find reviews of new books by Hana Panická and by Zdeněk Rotrekl. The idea is to provide not only Czechoslovak readers, but also foreign subscribers who do not understand Czech or Slovak, with information about books or journals of possible interest, which are not otherwise available. ACTA also plans to publish regular studies dealing with general problems of independent li- tera ture and publishing activity in Czechoslova- kia. As a foretaste we are including in this issue two excerpts from articles seeking to define some of the terms and concepts used by Czecho- slovak independent literature. Where possible, ACTA also aims to tel1 its readers about foreign reactions to this literature, in the form of news about published translations or even informa- tion about foreign-language studies of the phe- nomenon. However, for ACTA and its publisher, the CSDC, this vital work of recording and informa- . tion is not the be all and end all of its activity. We l [pageend3]will also seek to play an active role in promoting projects and assisting their implementation. One of the first and most urgent of these is the scheme to publish Jan Patočka ' s collected works, news of which is to be found elsewhere in this issue. Even from this brief survey of its plans, it is clear that our quarterly cannot hope to fulfil its various tasks unaided. We therefore count on the assistance of all those at home and abroad Vilém Prečan who are truly concerned about the fate of inde- pendent culture in Czechoslovakia. P.S. The easiest way to assist is by becoming are- gular subscriber to A CT A which is published Jour times a year. The price of each issue is 11 DM for non-members. For an annual subscription of 40 DM, readers may receive allfour issues num- bering some 200 pages. THEDOCUMENTATIONCENTREFOR THEPRO- MOTION OF INDEPENDENT CZECH OSLOV AK LITERATURE: Purpose, Aims, Activity The Documentation Centre for the Promotion of Independent Czechoslovak Literature (CSDC) was founded in the Federal Republic of Germany in early March 1986. The Centre is re- gistered under German federal law as an "asso- ciation pursuing publicly beneficial aims" . Ac- cordingly it has its own constitution and gover- ning bodies: an AGM, a Board of Management and an Academie Council. The association's chairman is the writer Jan Vladislav, its vice-chairman, writer Jiří Gruša. The CSDC Academie Council , with its much broader international membership, is chaired by the Canadian historian and political scientist Professor H. Gordon Skilling. The Centre's cu- rator is the historian Vilém Prečan who admini- 2 sters the CSDC on the basis of AGM resolutions and guidelines from the Board of Management. His tasks also include building up, allocating and managing the collection. A group of indepen- dent writers in Czechoslovakia, including Václav Havel and Ludvík Vaculík, are honorary CSDC members. Since November 1986, the Centre has had sui- table premises for its work, thanks to the assi- stance of Karel Jan Schwarzenberg, one of the founding members of the CSDC, who h.ad rooms in his castle adapted for the Centre's purposes and rents them to the association. As a result, the CSDC now has space enough for the expert storage and systematic processing of the collec- tion and can even offer scholars the opportunity - albeit limited - to study in situ. [pageend4]THE AIMS OF THE ASSOCIA TION The aim of the CSDC is to support scholarship in the areas of Czechoslovak culture, history and politics, in particular through collecting mate- rials that document independent Czech and Slo- vak thought since 1948. Special attention will be given to Czechoslo- vak self-published (samizdat) materials, i.e. all writings, both fiction and non-fiction transcribed in Czechoslovakia by individuals or groups and distributed through their own devices, which, for reasons of censorship are banned from official publication or distribution . In the same way, lite- rary works and non-fiction by exile writers are collected for study purposes. Enshrined in the constitution of the CSDC is the principie that the collections form part of the cultural heritage of the Czech and Slovak na- tions, and other ethnic groups in Czechoslova- kia. The holdings will be handed over to legiti- mate Czechoslovak institutions as soon as these come into existence and when political condi- tions allow the collections .to be made accessible to all members of the Czechoslovak public. MAIN LINES OF ACTIVITY It is not the intention of the CSDC to duplicate or replace the activity of any existing exile orga- nisation , institution, body or group. Instead it seeks to perform those tasks which have not been undertaken so far, as well as to offer a range of services which to date have been provi- ded solely through individua! initiative. It also seeks to facilitate or promote every activity of every kind that makes independent Czechoslo- vak litera ture more accessible to the widest pos- sible international public. The CSDC is ready to co-operate with all sections of the exile commu- nity and cultural institutions world-wide, and furthermore it is committed to assisting indepen- dent literature in Czechoslovakia as far as it is able and in terms of its specific mission. The CSDC combines the functions of archive, library and study-cum-information body, wi- thin the framework of a wide range of activi- ties, including: - the systematic collection, preservation and ar- chival processing of documents, photographs, audio-visual materials and documentation in the broadest sense; - the planning, encouragement and , where re- quired, actual organisation of research work on its own chosen topics, involving the academic treatment of source texts, as well as the publica- tion of reference and inforination material and works of scholarship; - the regular distribution to all interested libra- ries, research institutions, editors, publishers and individuals of updated lists of the Centre's holdings, and publication of the quarterly ACTA, of which this is the first issue; - world-wide dissemination , for study purposes, of samizdat texts, as well as information and re- ports about academic work on samizdat mate- rials , among association members, interested professional organisations, individua! specialists and the general public; -co-operation with universities, libraries and re- search institutions, as well as with other inter- ested bodies and individuals, whom it supplies with information concerning its sphere of ácti- vity. 3 [pageend5]In furnishing its services, the CSDC takes care to safeguard the copyright of manuscripts of all authors, including those living in Czechoslova- kia. Any copies of samizdat-published texts which it supplies are intended solely for study and information purposes. The Centre joins with international authors' associations and the va- rious publishing and handling agencies in ensu- ring that the copyright of the writers mentioned is strictly respected in every case, including royalty entitlement. In this connection, it acts, where required , as an intermediary between au- thors in Czechoslovakia and various media in the rest of the world seeking to publish samizdat ma- terial. PRESENT ST ATE OF'HOLDINGS The CSDC possesses the most extensive collec- tion of Czechoslovak samizdat outside the home country and supplements it as new material be- comes available. Most importantly its holdings include hundreds of titles issued by samizdat "publishers" i.e. different series of typewritten editions known variously as Edice Petlice (Pad- lock Editions) , Edice Expedice (Dispatch Edi- tions) , K vart ( Quarto) , Ceská Expedice ( Czech Dispatch) , Popelnice (Dustbin), Renega , Kde domov můj ("Where is my homeland" - the Czech national anthem , trans.) , Nové cesty myšlení (New thought trails) , Edice SE, together with the samizdat edition of Jan Pato čka's Wri- tings, copies of the samizdat-distributed works of Egon Bondy, whole series of verse by Jaromír Hořec , and articies, essays and reportage by Ja- romír Hořec and others. Another important section of the coilection comprises samizdat journals and magazines of 4 every kind , such as Informace o Chartě 77 (News of Charter 77, otherwise known as !nf och), Kri- tický sborník (Critical Miscellany), Paraf(Paral-- lel Acta of Philosophy), R eflexe, Stlední Evropa (Centra! Europe) , Vokno (Window) , Historické studie , Ekonomická revue, Ze zásuvky i z bloku (From the desk-drawer and the notebook) , Ko- mentáře , Prostor (Space) , Pražské komunikace (Prague communications) , Revolverová revue Jednou nohou (Revolver Revue One leg in), O divadle (Theatre) , Informace o církvi (Church News) , Náboženstvo a súčasnosť (Religion To- day) and many others including certain titles that have disappeared for the time being such as Dialogy , Váhy (Scale) , Čtverec (Square) and Spektrum , as well as several lesser-known Slo- vak samizdat periodicals. The CSDC maintains a complete set of Char- ter 77 materials and possibly all of the extant do- cumentary evidence of the human rights and civil liberties movements in Czechoslovakia over the past tenor more years, not to mention other ma- terial from the post-1969 period, including hun- dreds of examples of samizdat journalism, many individua! literary, historicai, philosophical and theological manuscripts, and translations into Czech and Slovak made under samizdat auspices over the past fifteen years. The collections aiso englobe film and photographic material, musical recordings, recordings of conversations with lea- ding Czechoslovak dissidents, video recordings, sets of newspaper cuttings and much biographi- cal material. The CSDC can also boast a whole collection of source material related to Czechos- lovak developments in the 1968 -1969 period. The CSDC reference library contains the bulk of titles from the Czechoslovak exile publishing [pageend6]houses which have come into existence since the early seventies, as well as some of the exile publi- cations from the 1948-68 period, and entire sets of all the main exile journals. An important sec- tion of the Centre's book and magazíne holdings is made up of foreign-language literature and journals related to Czechoslovakia and those is- sues of prime interest to the CSDC, such as the history of the Czechoslovak Republic and que- stions of human rights and civil liberties in the Soviet bloc. One section of the library comprises transla- tions of the independent output of Czech and Slovak writers, including those living in Cze- choslovakia and authors domiciled abroad, and secondary literature dealing with independent writing in Czechoslovakia. The CSDC also has a collection of books and journals published in Czechoslovakia in earlier periods which are either rare or virtually unob- tainable, such as Václav Černý's Kritický měsíčník (Critical Monthly) , or certain magazines from the 1968-69 period and books that were printed between the years 1969 and 1970 but were either withdrawn from sale or were imme- diately pulped. Naturally there are still many gaps in the CSDC's collections, particularly as regards sa- mizdat literature and materials from the fifties and sixties. Moreover, that section of the library containing foreign-langu::ige editions of works by authors of independent Czech and Slovak litera- ture (particularly those living abroad) leaves much to be desired . In its efforts to overcome these deficiencies, as well as in its "archaeological delvings" into inde- pendent thought and writing, the CSDC is hel- ped by all those who furnish the Centre with such materials. Acquisitions come from donations or bequests, or are supplied in return for payment or for services rendered. Some of them take the form of permanent loans or are loaned for copy- ing. During its first year of existence the Centre received valuable gifts from many friends and supporters from the home country and elsew- here. (A list of donors living outside Czechoslo- vakia is published in this issue of the news letter.) Thanks to the support of the Centra) and East European Publishing Project (CEEPP) based in Oxford, England, work has now started on the unified systematic cataloguing and data proces- sing of the collections and library stocks. The aim is to produce a catalogue which will also be available in published form. However, even in the present provisional state of processing and cataloguing, the Centre's holdings are able to serve thé needs of a whole number of publishing houses and journals (e.g. Index on Censorship, Kosmas, Proměny , Svědectví, Studie, Roz- mluvy, Obrys, Listy, etc.), as well as leading li- braries in several countries (e.g. Harvard Col- lege Library, the British Library, the U ni versi ty of Toronto Library, Bibliothek des Herder-lnsti- tuts in Marburg, etc.), academic and research in- stitutions (e.g. Forschungstelle Osteuropa an der Universitat Bremen, Keston College, Institut Jur die Wissenschaften vom Menschen in Vienna) and individua! scholars and researchers in many countries who are in contact with the CSDS. s [pageend7]FINANCIAL SUPPORT The CSDC receives financial support in the form of donations from private foundations and indi- viduals, as well as from membership subscrip- tions. These sources of income are always fixed for a given calendar year, or are strictly limited to a particular project. The Centre is run on a non-profit-making basis and is not primarily in- volved in financial a cti vity on its own behalf. The charges it makes for its services ( e.g. copying materials, research, etc.) merely cover the over- head expenses involved. In these circumstances, the development of the Centre's activity depends on building up an adequate financial base. lt is aimed to do this through: a) contributions from European and American foundations , organisations and insti- tutions that pursue similar or consonant aims to the CSDC and are able to give financial support to the Centre or its individua! projects, and b) support from individuals who consider the work of the Centre to be important enough to warrant their financial support for the Centre or one of its projects. Since it enjoys charity status as a "pu- blicly beneficial organisation" ( Gemeinnutzig- keit) , donations to the Centre are tax-deducti- ble. (More detailed information about this el- sewhere in this issue.) CONDITIONS FOR USING THECENTRE The CSDC library and archives are not open to the public. Ali its services are rendered on the basis of individua] arrangements with the institu- tions or researchers involved. The Centre's mini- mal level of staffing is the main limiting factor on how fast or fully it can deal with requests outsiJe 6 the regular framework of services performed on the basis of long-term agreements or subscrip- tions ( e.g. the distribution of the quarterly news- letter ACTA and of updated lists, and the copy- ing of samizdat periodicals, etc.) Requests for in situ study need to be sent at least one month in advance to enable research visits to be co-ordi- nated . URGENTTASKS INTHE 1987-88 PERIOD Apart from the regular activity of augmenting the collections and the library stocks, and rende- ring services to those institutions and individuals having long-term co-operation agreements with the Centre - including the publication of the quarterly newsletter, ACTA, the Centre has set itself a number of specific tasks for the imme- diate future. Among these tasks is the cataloguing and data processing of the Centre's entire holding of ma- terials and books. The intention is to produce a catalogue to be available in published form , as well as a series of lists of samizdat production which will be gradually published in ACTA. With the support of the above mentioned Cen- tra! and East European Publishing Project in Oxford and in co-operation with highly-qualified translators, the CSDC is also preparing a collec- tion of samizdat texts in English translation: The Annual Survey of Independent Literature in Cze- choslovakia. lt chiefly comprises shorter texts ( an exception being Milan Uhde's new play The Annunciation or Freddy, You're an Angel) that appeared in samizdat journals during 1986. The Survey, numbering some 300 pages of typescript will be reproduced in several dozen copies and [pageend8]sent out to publishing houses and the editorial boards of leading magazines in different count- ries around the world as a sample of the texts that are available and which interested parties may publish in the press in translated form on the ba- sis of agreement either directly with the authors or with the copyright-holders. The CSDC fulJy expects that this experiment, which could mark the start of an ongoing an~ual series, will ensure wider publicity for independent Czechoslovak writing in translation. This issue of ACT A also contains news about the Centre's current major publishing project: the publication of Jan Patočka 's Collected Wri- tings. The Centre's AGM in March this year decided to mark the forthcoming twentieth anniversary of the 1968 events in Czechoslovakia by reprin- ting at its own cost the original version of Seven Days in Prague: 21st--27th August 1968, the do- cumentary account known as the Czech Black Book. It was also decided to co-operate with the Charter 77 Foundation in bringing out a book on the developments in Czechoslovakia from Ja- nuary 1968 to May 1969 based on documentary literature. In addition, ACTA will publish in good time a list of items in the Centre's collec- tions which come under the general heading of what is popularly known as the 'Prague Spring'. THE PA TOČKA PROJECT Nowadays, the name of Jan Patočka is chiefly as- sociated in the minds of Czechs and Slova ks with his civic stand in connection with Charter 77. Ha- ving been one of the first trio of spokesmen and a leading exponent of the movement, he has vir- tually become its symbol over the ten years since his death. None the less, the respect and grati- tude felt towards him must not obscure the fact that the main and fundamental reason for Pa- točka ' s importance in the history of Czechoslo- vak culture was his achievement as a thinker, most of whose output remains inaccessible for a whole number of reasons, and therefore largely unknown. It is therefore a matter of supreme importance to Czechs and Slovaks to ensure that these works are finally published, particularly since work on editing his legacy has been procee- ding over the past years and a number of volu- mes are virtually ready for printing, not to men- tion the fact that several of his works have even been published in French in the meantime and a German translation of his selected writings in se- veral volumes is shortly to be published, to be followed by an English-language collection. In view of all this, the task of ensuring the ear- liest possible publication of Patočka ' s legacy in a worthy form is not just a challenge but a duty. lt hardly needs stressing that in view of the complexity and extent of Patočka's philosophi- cal bequest, its publication is an extremely de- manding task not only in terms of editing, but also from the point of view of organisation and fi- nancing. For these reasons and in line with its particular mission, the CSDC has decided to 7 [pageend9]promote a discussion about all these aspects as a first step towards getting this urgent project fi- nally under way. The discussion is intended to serve two purposes: firstly, to finalise the ground-plan both of the entire collection and the individua! volumes, and secondly, to ensure op- tima! long-term material and technical condi- tions for their publication. This means alerting Czechoslovak cultural circles, but not them alone: we also need support in the form of sub- scribers, sponsors and publishers throughout the world. Only the widest support and co-operation can ensure the publication of Patočka ' s legacy in the foreseeable future and in the language in which they were written. As a basis for discussion of the different aspects of the project, we are publishing Dr.Jiří Němec's various proposals for the collected edi- tion. We trust that we will be able to publish furt- her expert suggestions of a theoretical and prac- tical kind, so that the project may be finalised Jiří Němec and under way in the autumn, and we may inau- gurate the subscription. Meanwhile, we issue a specific appeal to our exile publishers to consider assuming responsibility for practical aspects of the actual publication - i.e. printing, distribu- tion , etc. - either alone or in co-operation with others. The CSDC will gradually be able to make available expertly edited manuscripts of the indi- vidua! volumes, page-set and ready for printing. Regarding the question of subscriptions to the Collected Works , we are considering a two-tier approach. Thus it would be possible for specia- lists, libraries and institutions to subscribe to the entire set, while individua! members of the wider reading-public would be able to commit themsel- ves to buying only certain volumes of their choice. This would prove advantageous both to those subscribing to the entire edition and also to those readers ready to buy at least four volumes in line with their specific interests. The Editors A SCHEME FOR PATOČKA'S COLLECTED WORKS Introduction The linguist and literary scholar Roman Jakob- son, one of the worlďs most distinguished 20th century academics and a man with deep philoso- phical roots, once wrote: "There were three Czech philosophers of world importance and outstanding moral power and integrity: Jan Amos Komenský (Comenius) (1592-1670), To- máš Garrigue Masaryk (1850-1937) and Jan Pa- 8 točka (1907-1977). " The writings of the first two have been published in entirety, albeit inadequa- tely in some cases. Yet we have no edition of Jan Patočka ' s complete works. During his lifetime, only two (!) volumes of his extremely extensive output were published, as well as a couple of booklets and some very sporadic journal artic- les. Nevertheless, Patočka ' s works constitute a coherent entity to which every Czech and Slovak intellectual and student should have access. [pageend10]Another argument in favour of the publication of Patočka ' s complete output in unexpurgated form and free from any subjective interpretive editing is the fact that the personalities and work of Comenius and Masaryk figured prominently and even centrally in Patočka ' s work. In today's Czechoslovakia it is inconceivable that even one single line of objective information about Patočka should be published, let alone any of his writings. And even if we were to be wildly optimistic it would be hard to imagine any change for the better in this respect over the next three years. Meanwhile, time flies and new gene- rations are coming of age: young people in need of a trustworthy guide through the entire broad spectrum of Czech and world culture. The only Czech in our times to fit the bili is Jan Patočka. And his works can be .truly said to radiate deep erudition and a moral challenge. The complete edition of Patočka ' s works is conceived in such a way as to include all his texts, published and unpublished alike. Their entire publication could take three or four years. They would be divided into eleven volumes solely for ease of orientation, on the basis of the already existing bibliography of his output. The biblio- graphy would be included in one of the first volu- mes to be published. Ali we can do is appeal to everyone who has not given up all hope for spiritual life in that small centra) European country to contribute to the success of this project in one way or another. It is paradoxical that with the publication of many of his works in French translation, not to mention the five large volumes of German trans- lation and the extensive English version which are shortly to appear, Patočka either is, or shortly will be better known to foreigners than he is to Czechoslovaks at home or in exile. Hence our determination to publish as soon as possible Patočka's complete writings, which should also include translations of works he wrote in foreign languages. The scheme itself The following scheme for Patočka ' s collected writings (henceforth PCW) is based on already published works, both books and magazine ar- ticles, material published in Prague in samizdat and the virtually exhaustive Patočka archive in the Vienna Institut fur die Wissenschaft vom Menschen. Unlike samizdat practice, it does not draw a strict line between published and unpu- blished works (these details are included in the editorial notes). The underlying criterion is the- matic and to a certain extent chronological (par- ticularly within the individua) volumes) , as this best reflects the evolution of Patočka's views. Specialists have been aware for some time that the changes in Patočka ' s attitudes had chiefly philosophical causes. I will cite three by way of il- lustration: 1) His shift from Husserlian subjecti- vism to non-subjective phenomenology (not to be identified with Heidegger's position how- ever); 2) The changes in his attitude towards Ma- saryk , while always remaining loyal to him and retaining the greatest esteem for his basic posi- tions. 3) The post-1969 evolution of Patočka's at- titude to Czech history (the previous phase ha- ving culminated in the lecture A philosophy of Czech history and the subsequent discussion, So- ciologický časopis , Vol.S, No.S, pp. 457-472), in favour of a ruthless national (self)criticism. 9 [pageend11]Jan Patočka, Complete Works Vol. I: Vol. II: Art and philosophy The natural world as a philosophical problem Vol. III: The movement of human existence Vol. IV: Purephenomenology Vol. V: The philosophy of history Vol. VI: Comenius Vol. VII: Masaryk Vol. VIII: The Czech existence Vol. IX: History of ancientphilosophy Vol. X: A ristotle, his predecessors and successors Vol. XI: The history of philosophy Volume I.: Art and philosophy l.

Edited ready for printing. Length: cca 600 pp. ty- pescript. The volume still requires retyping in fair copy according to the latest orthographical practice and to eliminate minor errors of pre- vious samizdat editions. Volume II. First published 1936. Reprinted by Československý spisovatel, Prague 1970, together with the study '"The Natural Worlď in the meditat- ions of its author, thirty-three years on". Printed in 2200 copies, the new edition did not reach the bookshops, however, and only 300 copies were retained for the use of certain institutions. A number of printing errors crept into the second edition. 232 pp. Volume III. Edited ready for printing. Length: cca 500 pp. ty- pescript. Same situation as for Volume I. Volume IV. Foreign-language texts to be translated, whole text to be edited. Length: cca 450 pp. typescript. Volume V. In course of editing, practically ready for prin- ting. Length: cca 500 pp. typescript. An appen- dix will include doublets and variants, mostly in foreign languages, particularly "Europa und Nach-Europa" (1972) , which is 80 pp. long and not yet available in Prague, the only copy being in the Vienna archive. Volume VI. In both the volumes published so far, the for- eign-language texts still need translating for in- clusion in PCW. Otherwise, Study No. 4 (cca231 pp. typescript) is edited ready for printing, all that remains is to unify the system of notes. Volume VII. Edited ready for printing. Volume: cca 300 pp. typescript. Same situation as for Vol ume I. Volume VIII. Selection and editing still to be done. Charter 77 texts logically belong in this volume. The volu- me's structure would be similar to the above i.e. thematico-chronological. VolumeIX. Edited ready for printing except for the paper "Aristotle" which is currently being prepared. Volume: cca 900 pp. typescript. Although the main editorial work is complete it is necessary to clarify the system of academic references which is rather cursory in the constituent papers. Volume X. Originally published in Prague under the imprint of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences in a print-run of 1400 copies. That edition contains several printing errors. 415 pp. Volume XI. Selection and editing still to be done. It will be a more lengthy task since it is necessary to decide the order of texts and the criteria for the inclu- sion of Patočka's encyclopaedia entries and his almost endless number of reviews. 15 [pageend17]General Guide-Lines for Printing PCW A single format is recommended for all the volu- mes, namely, 21 cm high. (This was the height of the reprint of The Natural World - our Vol.II, Aristotle , his predecessors and successors - our Vol.X, and the pa per A synoptical history of phi- losophy. of course. Even with its 400+ printed pages, the Aristotle volume is only 2.5 cm. thick . Another possibility, naturally, would be to di- vide certain of the volumes ( e.g. Vol. IX) into se- veral parts. The external aspect of the publica- tion (i.e. typography, paper-quality and bin- ding) should be scrupulously uniform , in order that Pato čka 's Collected Works should bear all the hallmarks of a definitive edition . In my view, each of the volumes should be printed in at least 2000 copies. At all stages of editing it is necessary to consult wíth the Prague editors of the still unfinished samizdat version. The P a to čka archive in the Viennese Institut fur die Wissenschaft vom Menschen is virtually in a position to supply all the basic texts. We are wor- king on the assumption that a large part of Pa- točk a's foreign language texts would be transla- ted in Prague. Patočka 's Collected Works are primarily in- tended for Czech and Slovak scholars both at home and abroad. Nevertheless, it is assumed that subscriptions will also be taken out by philo- sophical institutions and libraries, not to men- tion the majority of the the worlďs centres of Bohemian and Slavonic studies. UN'ESCO CENSORS CZECH AND SLOV AK POETRY French readers had to wait over fifty years for a new anthology of Czech and Slovak poetry. The first of its kind appeared in a series of admirable anthologies of modem French, American and other prose and poetry published by the Parisian publishing house Kra in 1930. The works had been selected, translated and compiled by thein- defatigable translator and champion of Franco- Czech relations Hanuš Jelínek (Anthologie de la poésie tcheque, par H.Jelínek, Editions Kra , Pa- ris 1930). For its time it was a fine collection and ranged from the early 19th century (i.e. Kollár, the Manuscripts, etc.) to what was then the younger generation: Wolker, Nezval, Seifert, Biebl, Halas and Závada. And although the title only mentioned Czech poetry, Jelínek also inclu- ded several examples of Slovak verse by Hviez- doslav , Hurban-Vajanský and Ivan Krasko. 16 During the nineteen sixties repeated attempts were made to put together a collection of Czech and Slovak poetry as part of a new series of an- thologies of world poetry then being prepared by another Parisian publishing house. As I learnt from the poet Pierre Emmanuel who initiated them , these attempts came to naught, however, because of continual objections on the part of the Czechoslovak authorities, who apparently objected to the selection on the grounds that it ran counter to Czechoslovakia's cultural policy at the time, though in fact it was chiefly because it did not suit the persona! interests of some of its representatives. For these reasons the anthology did not get published in the end . An attempt to fill the gap at least partially was made by Petr Král with his anthology of one of [pageend18]the currents of modem Czech and Slovak poetry - surrealism (Le surréalisme en Tchécoslova- quie, choix de textes 1934-1968. Traduit du tche- que et présenté par Petr Král. Gallimard , Paris 1983). Although Král was far from restrictive in his selection, he could not make up for the lack of a wide-ranging anthology of modem Czech and Slova k poetry, and nor was it his intention to do so. lt was not until this year that such a collection was available to French readers. lt was brought out by the Parisian publishing house Messidor in co-opera ti on with UNESCO as part of a series of representative works of European litera ture, un- der the title Anthologie de la poésie tcheque et slovaque. The earliest selections in this 420-page volume are from the nineteenth century, the la- test are examples of verse by the youngest gene- ration of Czech and Slovak poets. The collection introduces French readers to almost sixty Czech and just over thirty Slovak poets by means of brief profil es and some samples of their work. So far so good . However, a quick look at the contents page is enough to discover that it is is not the representative picture of Czech and Slo- v ak poetry which the title and the publicity on the back cover leads us to expect. Instead, it is a graphic illustration of Czechoslovak censorship and its notions of how Czech and Slov ak poetry ought to appear. lt is not merely a question of a few missing names ( every anthology leaves so- meone out) , but the omission of entire groups of poets, i.e. those banned from official publication in Czechoslovakia, as well, of course, as all those • poets living in exile. In addition, the anthology passes over whole areas of Czech and Slovak verse, not only by contemporary poets, but also by those of the recent past. Among those syste- matically excluded in this way are catholic poets from Jakub Deml and Jaroslav Durych down to Ladislav Dvořák and Zdeněk Rotrekl, and in- cluding Bohuslav Reynek, Jan Zahradníček and Václav Renč , Klement Bochořák , Josef Kostoh- ryz, Jan Dokulil, F.Lazecký and Vladimír Voko- lek among others. Also ornitted are members of Group 42, including Jiří Kolář , Ivan Blatný, Jan Hanč and Jiřina Hauková, not to mention their latter-day continuator Emil Juliš. The same fate is shared by all the poets belonging to the post- war wave of Czech surrealism, particularly Vra- tislav Effenberger, Karel Hynek, Zbyněk Hav- líček, Stanislav Dvorský, Petr Král, etc. Howe- ver, this does not by any means conclude the list of groups of writers and individua! poets comple- tely neglected by the new anthology. Without being exhaustive in any way, mention should at least be made of Jaroslav Kolman Cassius, Josef Palivec, the late and much underrated Josef Le- derer, Ladislav Fikar, Josef Hiršal, Ivan Wer- nisch and Ivan Diviš. Missing from the groups, both large and small, which the anthology deci- mates without mercy are not only the writers as- sociated with Mladá fronta in the post-1945 pe- riod, such as František Listopad, Jaromír Hořec, Ivo Fleischmann , Oldřich Kryštofek, or, in later years, Karel Šiktanc, etc. but also those young poets who made their debut in the sixties, such as Jiří Pištora , Pavel Janský, Zbyněk Hejda, Petr Kabeš, Josef Brukner, Pavel Šrut, Jiří Gruša, Antonín Brousek and others. In line with official Czechoslovak attitudes to literature the collection also ignored singer-po- ets like Karel Kryl, Jaroslav Hutka or Vlastimil Třešňák , among others; and of course no place 17 [pageend19]was found for the most recent underground po- etry of Egon Bondy, Ivan Jirous, etc. It is neces- sary also to point out the anthology's blatant mi- sogyny: the only woman writer in the Czech sec- tion , for instance, is J.Urbánková, even though many are worthy of inclusion such as Ludmila Macešková, who published under the name of Jan Kameník, Jana Štroblová, Olga Neveršilová and Vladimíra Čerepková . Women did not fare any better in the Slovak section, which, moreo- ver neglects a whole lot of men writers as well, but it would take an expert in Slovak literature to identify them all properly. This list of writers systematically excluded from the French anthology has no pretensions at being exhaustive: that was not my aim . I merely wished to indicate the ground-rules the compi- lers of the volume clearly observed in making their choice, or rather, in deciding whom to ex- clude. The disinformation conveyed by this an- thology does not end there, though. On the con- trary, it is evident in all the biographical profiles, as well as in the choice of poetry and the size of the samples, of course. A poeťs importance is not to be measured in numbers of poems and pa- ges, naturally, but it is none the less puzzling that a representative collection of Czech poetry should devote only three pages to Otakar Březina , four to Josef Hora , six to František Halas, seven to Jaroslav Seifert and eight pages to Jan Pilař , a poet who accommodated all regimes. The explanation for all these effronteries is quite simple. A glance at the introduction tells us 18 that the choice of authors and verse was the work of Messrs. V.Rzounek and S.Wollman and that the introduction was the joint achievement of Messrs. M.Pohorský, M.Zeman and M.Tomčík , and Prof. Rosenbaum, not to mention that the volume was "authorised by the Czechoslovak National Committee for UNESCO". Thus, by courtesy of UNESCO and its willing collabora- tor, the publishing firm Messidor which has close ties with the French Communist Party, the Cze- choslovak censor has widened his field of activity to include France. And the French readers, with their traditional aversion to all censorship, have not the faintest idea. So French readers will have to wait a while longer for a genuine anthology of Czech -- and maybe Slovak -- poetry. At least they can al- ready see an outline of it in issue No.149 of Li- berté, a French-language joumal published in Montreal. That issue, which came out in Octo- ber 1983, was devoted to Czech poetry and pres- ented readers with a total of twenty nine Czech poets and one Slovak author of this cen tury. Most of them belong precisely to the large con- tingent neglected by the Paris anthology. It was a remarkable collection which , albeit small, may justly be described as truly representative. The selection and translation were once more the work of Petr Král, who, though this was not his intention at the time, effectively prevented the Prague censor scoring a total victory over the French public. J.V. [pageend20]QUESTIONS OF TERMINOLOGY IN INDEPENDENT LITERATURE New phenomena and new realities logically give rise to new terminology. However the na ture of such terminology does not seem to follow quite such a logical pattern. This is because new terms often come into existence haphazardly, fre- quently without any real linguistic sensitivity and sometimes without regard for the natural logic of the language into which the new terms are intro- duced and in which they take root. It would take a linguist to provide a detailed explanation of this phenomenon, but even an expert would have difficulty in explaining how it is that in Czech the term "rádio" is being increasingly su- perseded by the expression "rozhlas" , and why, in the case of television, Czechs have remained faithful to the word "televize" and almost no one recalls the - admittedly rather awkward - term "rozvid" which was once proposed. Meanwhile, German, for instance, successfully employs enti- rely home-grown expressions in both these ca- ses. lt is clearly not purely a matter of the origin of a particular newcomer or the circumstances of its creation or importation, but also of the overall potential of a particular language and the lingu- istic sensitivity of those who introduce a new term in the first place, not to mention its first users and the mass media. Moreover, there would seem to be a whole number of contin- gency factors involved. Take the very expression "samizdat" for instance. Quite clearly, it was ori- ginally a parody of the stereotyped abbreviations which serve as titles for the official Soviet publis- hing houses, and there is something of the same irony detectable in the title "Edice Petlice". The very nature of such expressions tells us some- thing about the linguistic environment at the time the phenomena described came into being. Independent literature in Czechoslovakia un- doubtedly has its roots in the nineteen fifties, even though at that time it consisted of timid ex- periments and the phenomenon itself still lacked a name. The advent of "normalisation" at the turn of the seventies served to swell the ranks of silenced writers and represented a watershed in this sphere, sparking off the unexpected growth of all kinds of defence mechanisms. One of the most widespread, and apparently most effective, of these has been the publication, in typewritten form, of manuscripts which are banned by the of- ficial state-controlled publishing houses. The development of such "unofficially publis- hed" litera ture has naturally given rise to discus- sions about how best to describe it. The concern has not been narrowly linguistic, however. The discussion about the terminology used by unoffi- cial literature has also considered its nature, meaning, intention, anóalso the practical aspects of its creation and dissemination. For this rea- son, we are publishing the following two contri- butions to the debate which deal with these que- stions in greater detail. We intend, where possi- . ble and appropriate , to publish further contribu- tions in future issues. 19 [pageend21]-TI SOME QUESTIONS SURROUNDING "INÉDIT" LITERA TURE [ ... ] We wish to address ourselves to the socio- logical aspect of the emergence and existence of literature described as "inédit" which readers originally came to know as "samizdat". The term "inédit" has not taken root either and in fact even many educated people are una- ware of what it actually means. In the countries of "existing socialism" in which this sort of litera- ture originated, the more commonly used ex- pressions are either "unofficial" or "illegal" lite- rature ( and the same expressions are used to re- fer to culture in general). Both these terms are unsuitable, however. (Regarding the first of them , I agree with the position maintained by P.Fidelius in Kritický sborník, Vol. 1, 1981, No. 3.) The term "illegal" is fundamentally unsound and directly conflicts with the law-abiding atti- tude adopted by inédit authors. In fact the latter regard their activity as entirely legal, since, in our country, no law exists banning anyone from making several typewritten copies of their wri- tings and lending them to others. Thus no illegal activity is involved. (The police make a further distinction: for them "illegal" literature is the sort whose content is unobjectionable, but which , for one reason or another - e.g. the poli- tics of the author - cannot be published here, whereas "unlawful" literature is objectionable from the point of view of content.) Admittedly the term ' " inédiť literature" is also not entirely satisfactory. Firstly, "inédit" 20 manuscripts are only "inédit" here; they can still be published abroad (and some of them occasio- nally are); further, in common with the term "unofficial", it draws a sharp distinction between published and unpublished Jjterature; and lastly, it can only be appropriately applied to literary production of the so-called "parallel cul ture" (it- self an imprecise term) , and fails to cover home theatrical productions, exhibitions, musical per- formances, etc., which are clearly not "publis- . hed". A part from that, though , it is quite a precise and clear description since it applies to all lite- rary works that cannot be published here for va- rious reasons. I t can apply to all fields of art orle- arning, to authors living here, to translations of foreign works, and to living and dead authors alike , whether or not they have the opportunity of being published. The fact is that there are cer- tain authors who are able to have some works published, but not others (e.g. Seifert and Hra- bal), and one could also mention those writers who could publish but prefer not to. There are also cases where a book exists in two separate versions - "édit" and "inédit" - which can be quite different from each other. It would seem, therefore, that, from the point of view of terminology, litera ture may These can include textual alterations they are obliged to make, publication delays, drastic cuts in print runs, difficulties over distributing a book once it [pageend22]is published , the hushing up of its publication, etc. Inédit literature was not dreamt up by some- body. It is not a strange whim of some individua! writer or literary grouping. Nor is it a foretaste of the exclusiveness of the literature to come, as V.Rozanov had in mind when he stated that fu- ture literary works would be distributed entirely in manuscript form among a narrow circle of ex- perts. By coincidence, "samizdat" (i.e. literature published by authors themselves, without the as- sistance of intermediaries - in other words wi- ' thout editing or censorship) may well have origi- nated in Russia too , but it certainly did not come into being out of any doubt the authors might have had of the mass interest in their works on the part of readers. In a certain sense it was the regime itself that gave rise to inédit litera ture, by having, through its network of control over prin- ting and publishing prevented (both as regards content and authors, wherein it differs from clas- sic censorship which was interested solely in texts not their authors) a large section of intellec- tual creation from being published. Strict Stali- nism , of course, did not countenance the crea- tion of any non-conformist litera ture, not even in manuscript form. It is not so long ago that Soviet poets kept their unpublished poems fixed in their memories and only recited them to particularly intimate friends, and out of earshot of any wit- nesses: in the woods, for instance. This should not surprise us if one considers the severe penal- ties paid by authors of various leaflets and home- produced magazines, or even of rashly formula- ted sentences in private correspondence. This is why it was only after Stalin's death, in the Khrushchev era, that samizdat could come into being and even experience a period of ex- pansion (though it would seem to be on the wane nowadays and restricted mostly to political science, or to sociological and historical texts, with samizdat fiction becoming more of a rarity). People in democratic countries must find the inédit literature phenomenon bard to compre- hend. After all, the typewriter is a typically American invention originally intended to speed up commercial and business communication and for many decades it did not occur to anyone that it might compete with Guttenberg's machine - particularly now that there exist, in addition to classic typography, a whole number of other re- production techniques permitting the rapid and fairly inexpensive duplication of any kind of text or illustration, and in any quantity. Except where it is linked to some other reproduction technique , the typewriter is now used solely for letters, short texts or originals for printing (in this respect almost all "pen-pushers" use a ty- pewriter nowadays). The fact is that samizdat literature is extre- mely impractical: it is expensive to produce, mostly of poor legibility and not very durable. In these respects, it compares unfavourably not only with printed literature, but also with old manuscripts, which were certainly expensive to produce, but otherwise very legible and , by and large , of aesthetic value. (Inédit literature ad- mittedly does have its bibliophile "impressions", particularly in this country, but so far they are extremely restricted since they involve pheno- menal costs and the consumers of inédit books tend not to belong to the better off sections of the reading public.) 21 [pageend23]Owing to these factors , inédit books have a specific feature that distinguishes them from pu- blished literature: in their case the economic aspect of literary production is fundamentally al- tered. In fact it completely reverses the practice of the entire 19th century and of the first half of the twentieth century. Although, from the very beginning, printing was a cultural undertaking it was mostly an activity conducted for reasons of financial gain. It was not long though before au- thors started, quite rightly, doing what they could to obtain a share of the profits, on the grounds that "the labouring man is worthy of his hire" During the nineteenth cen tury, most countries introduced legislation governing prin- ting and publishing and also instituted protection of copyright, first on a national scale and subse- quently on a world-wide basis. To a certain ex- tent, writers were freed from existential worries, wh~ch was positive, but at the same time, litera- ture came under enormous commercial pressure which increasingly forced authors to be success- ful rather than good: factors which seldom go hand in hand and often diverge. Socialists made a sport of attacking the publishers' exploitation of writers and promised that things would change after the revolution. As things have tur- ned out, in the countries of "existing socialism" writers admittedly do not endure the pressures of the capitalist market, but they do suffer the pi- tiless pressure of an exclusive ideology and re- pression in respect of their career prospects. Un- der capitalism, writers in search of success must frequently bow to the demands of a conservative readership. Under socialism, authors have to bow to the demands of the regime and the pres- sure of editors who can be notoriously conserva- tive. Neither group is free , but whereas, when 22 the worst comes to the worst, principled authors in capitalist society can bring out unpopular works at their own expense, in socialism, such writers lack that possibility. But in all Western countries there are plenty of publishers willing to publish an unpopular book, at least from time to time: on the one hand, to enhance their reputat- ions, and on the other, because of the existence of competition, and on the grounds that "you ne- ver know". In socialist countries, competition does not exist, because of collusion between the small number of similarly endowed centra! pu- blishing houses. Moreover, no editorial board will even talk to writers who are not positively vetted , let alone with those who have actually been rejected by the screening process. Naturally, even in the West there are writers who, for want of a publisher, cannot get their books published, and cannot afford to publish them themselves. But in those cases, it all de- pends on their degree of determination. I cannot believe that there are writers too poor to get their works copied out -- or copy them out them- selves -- and then get at least a hundred further copies run off by means of some reproduction technique or other. That is why the phenomenon of "' inédiť litera ture" does not exist in the West. (One critic in our country actually believes that the western countries, such as France and West Germany, should study samizdat here, on the grounds that the time is coming when, there too, real litera ture will be "published" solely in inédit editions.) Inédit literature negates the entire commer- cial basis of contemporary book publishing. Not only has no one ever made a fortune out of sa- [pageend24]mizdat literature, but neither could anyone even earn their living at it. Writers have come to take it for granted that they will receive no fee for their works -- regardless of whether they are two- page articles, thousand-page novels or philoso- phical treatises requiring years of research. Cle- arly they have lost much as a result; but they have also gained something as well: namely , a degree of creative freedom never before availa- ble to literature, either here or anywhere else. Not only are they free of any censorship and hence are able gradually to rid themselves of any remaining self-censorship, but they are also free of al! the sort of economic restraint that an editor can place on them. (Should writers fail to satisfy the requirements of an editor, the latter can threaten them not to recommend the work for publication, and hence deprive them oftheirfee. How many people are there strong-willed enough to resist pressure of that kind?!) Inédit litera ture is, I grant, also subject to edi- ting, but only of an overal! kind; the decision is made whether the manuscript is worth reprodu- cing or not. In this sense, "editors" may let au- thors know their comments, but the latter are not obliged to take account of their critics' re- marks in subsequent editions of their works. If, in addition to outlay on materials , typing and binding, the production costs of inédit books had to include an author's fees, however small, the price of the finished edition would be so high as to place it beyond the means of mere mortals. Thus, owing to its attitude towards banned au- thors the régime has found itself faced with two unexpected and inconvenient consequences: on the one hand it has enabled writers to create freely and on the other it has lost the control that it is normally able to wield even over those au- thors who, albeit non-conformist, have to bar- gain with editors and censors in order to get their manuscripts published. Ali this serves to display inédit literature in a very favourable light as a free and unmercenary activity carried on by writers of principie with honourable motives. It is free in so far as individua! writers have rid themselves of inner self-censorship. It is also un- mercenary, however much some writers may be accused of writing for their own glory-i.e. aut of vanity - or because they are incurable scribblers whose obsessive writings no one would publish anyway. Of course such cases exist, but they are few and far between. Much is often said about the high standard of inédit literature, particularly in this country. And the fact is that the best works of Czech lite- ra ture of the seventies were first published by Petlice, Expedice and Kvart. It was not entirely to the credit of inédit litera ture per se, but simply because the post-1969 "normalised" regirne had banned from publication the majority of the best writers, philosophers, historians , journalists we then had. At the same time, it put too much pres- sure on budding writers with any gumption and forced them to join the ranks of the inédit. However it cannot be said that everything in the realm of inédit litera ture is of a high standard or, conversely, that al! published boo ks are ne- cessarily bad. Far fewer inédit titles are "publis- hed", and it is easier to keep track of them, and 23 [pageend25]the fact is that they include a much higher per- centage of truly fine works than is to be found among the inflated figures of recent publications which the regime loves to parade, particularly for foreign eyes, as evidence of the rich develop- ment of contemporary Czech literature. Other- wise, there are good or even excellent published books, in the same way that there are bad or be- low-average "inédit" editions. What is far less represented among inédit titles is the average sort of mediocre writing which makes up a large proportion of published literature. In fact the average sort of book that gets published is a typi- cal product of commercial pressure, whether from an undemanding readership, or from the official ideology. lts author usually lacks any great talent, but has learnt the writer's trade and decided to reap all due profit from it. Of course such an approach is only viable in the realm of published litera ture for which royalties are paid. Nevertheless, inédit literature also has its drawbacks and grave problems. For one thing, it lacks that phase when a manuscript undergoes a final check, which is only really possible at the page-proof stage. However much writers hone down their manuscripts, they still remain manus- cripts i.e. fairly open texts which, by virtue of the very fact that they permit an number of subse- quent amendments and additions, can display a lack of finish or finality. Moreover, a printed text looks different from a typewritten one. It is a sort of psychological enigma that manuscripts ar~ ca- pable of containing errors that authors j ust never see until they are type set. Then there is the question of limited publicity in the sense of a greatly restricted readership. Of 24 course there is the odd exception where inédit texts are read by as many people as they would have been, had they been published in mass edi- tions (e.g. Seiferťs Plague Column). Further- more, the usage made of manuscript copies is much higher than of published books: a book I have just bought I might merely add to the other books on my bookshelf with the intention of rea- ding it "when I find the time" - which might be five years Jater, or never for that matter, whereas a manuscript borrowed for a week has to be read straight away. But that only partly compensates for the shortage of copies available to potential readers, most of whom can never lay their hands on inédit editions. Still graver is the matter of critical responses. Occasionally writers will learn the opinion of their friends by word of mouth, which is ob- viously not much of a guideline, since it is always difficult to comment on someone's work to their face , particularly when one's criticism is nega- tive. Apart from rare exceptions (e.g. Václav Černý , J.Rak and L.Dobrovský) written criti- cism virtually did not exist in the seventies, not within the country, anyway. Inevitably this me- ant that the other face of the inédit authors' unli- mited freedom started to emerge: i.e. they never really had any way of knowing what their rea- ders' thought of their works. Admittedly this also has its advantages, but they are extremely conditional. But the effect is mostly negative: Authors are left to their own devices. Their texts are not analysed or discussed and they themsel- ves are restricted solely to self-assessment, which is deceptive. Sometimes it keeps them buoyant on a wave of belief in their own genius (and it helps nicely to compensate for lack of re- [pageend26]cognition to be an unrecognised genius!): on ot- her occasions, they fall prey to nihilistic moods and the conviction grows that their creations are worthless. Of course it is possible to write for no one in particular. But there is no guarantee that this will give rise to a truly viable literature. Another effect is that inédit writers can lose their sense of belonging to one particular natio- nal litera ture -- or rather, they may retain it only nominally. Some writers live in total isolation, virtually without any contact with other authors. There are exceptions to this, of course, but even the other inédit authors associate solely in nar- row circles, their relations based more on friendship than on a common creative pro- gramme , as used to be the case among artistic and creative people. It is very rare for published writers to maintain relations with inédit authors for understandable reasons, since the latter ar~ frequently the object of surveillance on the part of the security forces , and such promiscuity · could cost the published authors - at the very le- ast - their right to have their books published. Whether we like it or not, two quite separate social phenomena have come into being in this country: published literature and inédit litera- ture. Of course there are those inédit authors who believe that the situation is no more than a passing anomaly, and count on their manuscripts being published somewhere some day; they the- refore regard the present situation as somehow temporary, even though it has lasted for more than ten years already. If only that were the case ! But what if inédit litera ture is actually a new phe- nomenon in the history ofliterature, which bases itself on the assumption, as Rozanov believes, of a permanently restricted readership on the one band and a constand rise in the cost of printing on the other? In America, they are already predicting that book culture as we know it will die out by the ni- neties to be replaced by microfiches, for reasons of utility and low cost, ifno other ( e.g. the micro- fiche of a thousand-page novel will fit into so- mething the size of a matchbox and cost a few cents instead of tens of dollars). Anything that still remains of inédit litera ture by that time, or is still extant, will just need photographing on to microfiche. What will be the point of setting it in print and laboriously turning it into a book first? (Of course there will always be bibliophiles ready to make sacrifices in order to pay the hig- hest prices for a classically printed book to place on their bookshelves. But they will be fewer and fewer in number, and in common with the biblio- philes of today they will concentrate on classic texts that have stood the test of time, as well as on curios.and shorter works. But let us set aside futurological forecasts. For the time being inédit literature continues to fulfil an important role in our country: that of ensu- ring that our literature and thinking goes on de- veloping as a continuation of the nation's cul- tural heritage and, where possible, within a glo- bal context. And this role is such an important and honourable one, that it merits the effort and the risk involved in the creation and propagation of inédit literature. Kritický sborník, Vol. 2, 1982, No. 4, pp. 29-36 25 [pageend27]-pf "INDÉDIT" LITERATURE: THEQUESTIONTHEYFORGOT The odd ha bit of describing any litera ture publis- hed in samizdat: as "inédit literature" has tended to become widespread of late. Maybe it is only a passing fashion . However, if in fact it is the ex- pression of a serious attempt to solve at last the long-standing difficulties of finding the right ter- minology to describe the free and independent literature evolving outside the realm of official control in a late-totalitarian communist-style re- gime, then it has to be pointed out that the use of the epithet "inédit" in this particular case is not merely inappropriate, but is actually a contradic- tion in terms. When the article: Same questions surrounding 'inédit' literature appeared in Kri- tický sborník 4/82, I thought the author was go- ing to point out this anomaly. Unfortunately, it was not to be the case. Even though the article specifically deals, among other things, with the suitability of the new term , oddly enough its au- thor ignores the main point at issue: having care- fully weighed the pros and cons, he concludes that "otherwise it is quite a precise and clear des- cription". Weil yes, one could agree with that statement, on the proviso that the term were un- derstood to express precisely and clearly the ex- act opposite of what the author intended. None- theless it has become quite a widely accepted term , which would seem to suggest that the au- thor (unwittingly) hit the nail right on the head when he expressed the view that "in fact even many educated people are unaware what it actu- ally means". 26 So if we are bent. on enriching our mother ton- gue with this foreign expression regardless, at le- ast let us be clear about how it may be used. Translated into Czech "inédit" quite simply me- ans "unpublished". "Inédit" therefore describes a manuscript that still lies in a desk drawer. But as soon as a manuscript is published it ceases to be "inédit", of course, and becomes "édit" (why not bless the Czech language with that expres- sion while we are at it?) At the very most, the word "inédit" may appear on the title page of a first edition , to indicate to readers that the text they have in their hands has not been published before. (But it is a practice that editors tend only to adopt in the case of posthumous publication). And with this we have exhausted the possibilities of the term's legitimate use. All else is just thoughtless over-use, and fundamentally no less absurd than if we went on calling meat "raw" even after it was cooked. At this point, many will undoubtedly object that they are already well aware of this, and as- sert that the copying out of a text on a typewriter as a means of samizdat publication clearly differs from the situation where it is printed in norma! fashion by a publishing house , or that it is even incomparable with it. Of course it is different; but is it really incomparable? What, may I ask then , are we doing with those texts in samizdat, if not publishing them? Why is it that we refer to various "editions" (e.g. Petlice and Expedice)? [pageend28]Isn't it the case that were we consistently to pur- sue such a line it would be inadmissible even to use the expression "sam-izdat" (Russian: self- publishing, trans.)? But it doesn't look as if the champions of the epithet "inédit" trouble them- selves with such considerations. This can be seen, for instance, in the fact that they have no trouble in uttering - like the author in Kritický sborník in question - expressions like "inédit editions". As a poetical oxymoron there is not- bing wrong with it, of course, but, if I'm not wrong, our particular concern bere is how . prac- tically. to describe a specific reality. It might help us a bit to clarify the meaning of the very concept of "publishing" ( or "editing") a manuscript: the question is to what extent this concept covers our samizdat activity also. If we take "publishing" in its broadest sense we may distinguish two main aspects: let us call them the technical and the creative. As far as the technical aspect goes, I see no reason why the concept of "publishing" should necessarily imply the use of printing of a certain number of copies. Of course the number of copies published does have a bearing on a texťs "publicity" (in the sense of its public distribution). And in this re- spect it is indeed trne, as the author of the article points out, that what is typical for samizdat lite- rature is its "limited publicity in the sense of a greatly restricted readership". That is no reason for us to describe it as "inédit", though. We are all aware of the fact that in periods of freedom in our country a whole number of impressions were produced for bibliophile or private purposes in very small print runs, but I am sure that we have no hesitation in regarding them as regular "pu- blishing" activity. Besides, "publicity" under- stood as "size of readership" is by no means di- rectly proportional to the size of the print-run. In this respect, certain titles published in truly mas- sive print runs, such as the Marxist-Leninist clas- sics that our publishing houses continue untirin- gly to churn out ( conceivably for the sole pur- pose of maintaining the metabolism between the pulper and the printing press) have extremely negligible "publicity". Even though it is clearly a futile and superfluous activity it would seem to be "publishing" for al! that. On the other band, it is obvious that, in technical terms, there is no fundamental reason why samizdatshould be per- manently restricted to typewritten copies: the present restriction is dictated by the present sta- tus quo. Where the situation permits, samizdat is even known to make use of printing techniques, as was once the case in Paland and continues to be (for the time being) in Hungary. What is decisive as far as the concept of "pu- blishing" is concerned, is the creative aspect. I am thinking specifically of the irreplaceable role played ( or that ought to be played) in this pro- cess by a publisher or editor. Even considered solely from the point of view ofthe writer and the development of his or her talent, good editors are as important as good literary critics. In one respect, perhaps, they are even more important. After all, it is precisely in the process of co-ope- ration between author and editor that a work fi- nally assumes its definitive form : the form in which it will then reach the critic. And I do not have to recall the not inconsiderable responsibi- lity that the editor bears towards the reading public. 27 [pageend29]Weil then , how does samizdat match up to this criterion at the present time? I believe that if one takes a dispassionate or even sceptical look, one cannot but acknowledge that, after an initial pe- riod of rather more extensive growth , samizdat in this country has displayed a growing concern about the standards of editorial preparation of published texts. Let us recall - to chaose some random examples - the publication of Patočka's Opera omnia, the translation of Sein und Zeit in instalments, the reappearance of the Kvart im- print and of course, last but not least, our own dear Kritický sborník. Can there really be the le- ast doubt that such achievements demand cons- cientious editorial activity? I believe that it is no more than a j ust appraisal of reality to declare that - all in al!- over these past years, slowly but surely the awareness has been growing within sa- mizdat in our country of the editor's vítal crea- tive role. I detect in it a welcome sign of progress from more or less haphazard ámateurism to re- sponsible systematic activity. I believe the time is not far off when it will be universally taken for granted that a samizdat typecopy should be edi- ted in such a way as to be "ready for printing" should the need arise. If contention still exists about how to describe this "unofficial" publishing activity (and the lite- rature published in this way) , I really fail to see why we should not stick to the term that is al- ready accepted i.e. "samizdat". Out of all eur- rent descriptions it is the only one about which no objections can be raised either in terms of ac- curacy or suitability, and one whjch is entirely untrammelled by misleading connotations. The word, I believe, best describes the fundamental reality: that in samizdat we quite simply publish 28 by our own means what cannot be published in institutions subject to state control. At the same time there are two different ways of considering this self-help activity. In material terms, it can be regarded as an emergency solution: an exceptio- nal and abnormal procedure imposed on us by exceptional and abnormal circumstances. It is a method of publishing appropriate to a state of emergency: a costly and inefficient process that must, compared with norma! conditions, appear to be fantastically wasteful in terms of physical and mental effort. On the other hand, in spiritual terms, this phenomenon may be regarded as a promising spark of normality, in that it provides us with a real chance (albeit very limited) to pre- serve for future generations - not only in theory but also in practice - an idea of what is meant by free and independent cultural institutions. If there is a reservation to be voiced about the term "samizdat", then it is solely on grounds of linguistic aesthetics: like every Russian abbre- viation it has shades of "kolkhoz", "politruk" and suchlike words which admittedly do not look particularly nice in Czech. But if, after all, we have come to terms with such a monstrosity as "khozrashchot" (the Soviet method of manage- ment and accountancy, trans.) an expression that most resembles a pig's grunt, aesthetically speaking, on what grounds are we to refuse are- sidence permit in our mother tongue to the irre- futably nicer-sounding expression "samizdat"? Anyway, it is only polite and j ust that the word itself should continue to remind us of the pri- macy which the Russians deservedly enjoy in this particular field.

Apart from listing all titles, these reports will, where possible, include brief descriptions of individua) books, or in the case of periodicals, details of annual collections and/or individua) is- sues. With the growing vol ume and variety of sa- mizdat production , our aim will be not only to provide a comprehensive picture of this pheno- menon from its origins until now, but also to act as a guide for readers and provide information on lesser-known or unknown series of books or NEW THOUGHT TRAILS The series concentrates on original Czech philo- sophical writings, mainly of a theoretical kind , but occasionally including some works in a ligh- ter vein. The series' philosophical framework is provided essentially by Patočka 's legacy of ideas, and it concentrates in the main on Chri- stian aspects. The series evolved gradually. Its li- kely antecedent was a collection of philosophical writings listed here as No .O which exceptionally included works by foreign authors. O) Filosofický sborník (Philosophical miscel- lany).

NEW BOOKS - PRO MEMORIA THE HIDDEN FACE OF CZECH LITERATURE Zdeněk Rotrekl, Skrytá tvář české literatury ne- jenom krásné (The hidden face of Czech litera- ture). Selected biographical chapters. Samizdat, 364 pp. + photographs. Brno, Easter 1985. Contents: Foreword; Otto František Babler; Ivan Blatný; Klement Bochořák; Josef Silvestr Maria Braito; Jan Čep; Rudolf Černý ; Reginald Dacík; Miloš Dvořák; Ivan Jelínek; Zdeněk Ka- lista; Josef Knap ; Josef Kostohryz; Antonín Kratochvil; František Křelina ; František La- zecký; Dominik Pecka; Suzanne Renaud; Vá- clav Renč ; Bohuslav Reynek; Zdeněk }3..ezní- ček; Nina Svobodová; Růžena Vacková; Timo- teus Vodička; Marie Rosa Junová-Vodičková; Jan Zahradníček; František Halas; Jan Tre- fulka; Afterword. As the title indicates and the author explains in the foreword, the idea of assembling this set of "encyclopaedic biographical chapters" was in- spired not only by the death of "many members of the older generation of writers and scholars", but also by the realisation that the names and works of many of them, as well as those of many other, younger authors have been systematically erased from Czech cultural history, thereby ( de- liberately, it would seem) aggravating the al- ready perilous discontinuity of Czech culture. Zdeněk Rotrekl is not the only one to realise this danger and write about it. He would seem to have been the first , however, to tackle the pro- blem in a practical fashion by editing these bio- graphical chapters devoted to authors whose na- mes we would look for in vain in today's encyclo- paedias or text-books. And on the rare occasions in the past when some of them actually were ack- nowledged, such as in the Dictionary of Czech Writers (Slovník českých spisovatelů) of 1964, the entries were incomplete, to say the least. This was because certain important biographical details, particularly concerning political perse- cution, imprisonment and (where applicable) rehabilitation, were taboo and have remained so. At best, sharp-eyed readers of that dictionary could deduce these details from the conspicuous silence about lengthy periods of writer's li ves, as well as from gaps in their bibliographies. Thesi- tuation has been remedied to a great extent by the Slovník českých spisovatelů published by Sixty-Eight Publishers, Toronto, in 1982. But even that collection fails to include some the wri- 33 [pageend35]ters Rotrekl recalls, partly, of course, because his book presents not only writers of fiction but also several scholars, specialist writers and pu- blishers, as is also evident from the contents. Most of the subjects were known personally to Zdeněk Rotrekl. His affinity with many of them derived from sharing the same or similar opi- nions, and like more than one of them, he too spent many years in prison for political reasons. In that sense, it is a book about Rotrekl himself, or more precisely about what has been the most typical fate of Czech scholars over the past fifty years. This is another of the book's strengths: that it is not only inspirational reading but also a testimony. On the other hand, the author him- self realised that it was beyond the means of any individua! to complete such a task, of course; the individua] chapters are of an uneven standard in terms of their exhaustiveness, the collation of data and Rotrekl's own comments. This is why the author sought to supplement some of the ent- ries in the afterword, and why, in the foreword itself, he describes his texts as a "basis for fu ture research". And in that respect, his book will cer- tainly prove useful . LUKA VICA NOTEBOOKS Hana Panická, Lukavické zápisky 1977 (Luka- vica Notebooks 1977). I--111. Samizdat, 332 + 226 + 262 pp. Lukavica 1985. Contents: I.Return from escape (Návrat z úniku) 1.The green butterfly (Zelený motýl'); 2.The blocked spring (Zastavený prameň) ; 3. "Le Monde"); II. Summer in Lukavica (Letov Lukavici) (1. The appeal (Odvolanie); A mill for guests (Mlyn hostí); The bitter-apple tree 34 (Horká jabloň); III. The stone guest (Kamenný hosť) 1. The trial (Proces); 2. No prosecutor's warrant (Bez príkazu prokurátora); Christmas card (Vianočná pohl'adnica). Although relatively few Slovaks signed Char- ter 77, its impact on Slovakia would seem to have been greater than we once supposed. Further evidence of this is provided by Hana Panická in her Lukavica Notebooks 1977, the minutely do- cumented story of how her conscience was quik- kened and her determined stand for the truth. The essentials of the story are in fact well known and it even attracted world-wide attention ten years ago; we have had to wait for these three vo- lumes of the Lukavica Notebooks, however, to discover the details of what actually happened. Basically there is nothing very complex about the story, and unhappily it is one that is all too common. In February 1977, the Slovak Writer's Union called on Hana Ponická to sign a resolu- tion condemning Charter 77, without giving her the opportunity to read the Charter's original text. Hana Ponická withstood the pressure on her and refused to sign the resolution. And she did not leave it at that. She also wrote a discus- sion paper for the 3rd Congress of the Slovak Writers' Union in March 1977, in which she set out the facts about Slovak literature, including that section of it which had been silenced, na- ming a score of authors who had been prevented from publishing for almost ten years by that time. She summed up the intention of her paper by quoting one of the speeches of the memorable 2nd Congress of the Czechoslovak Writers' Union in 1956. Recalling the fate of the then si- lenced writers and those in prison, the poet Fran- tišek Hrubín had declared from the rostrum of [pageend36]that congress: "Those ofus who happily go about our business, who go on writing and getting paid for it, who go to bed of a night and sleep untrou- bled as if unaware of what is going on - those of us who fail to say out loud: 'an injustice is being done here!' are selfish crypto-bourgeois, no less, and those of us who are content merely to hide their shame are arrant cowards!" Hana Panická was not content to go on hiding her shame. Even though she had given the prescribed no- tice, she was not allocated an opportunity to speak at the congress. She therefore submitted her paper in writing and insisted that it should form part of the congress documentation accor- ding to the union's rulebook. This resulted in re- newed pressure and when she refused to cjjmb down , reprisals began in earnest, including the removal of her manuscripts from the plans of pu- blishing houses, a ban on her writings, a cam- paign of silence about her works, etc., in other words, exactly the sort of methods her discussion paper criticised. When her text subsequently ap- peared in the Parisian daily Le Monde , unbrid- led repression was unleashed against her, inclu- ding police harassment, tailing, threats, interro- gations: in short, the usual treatment meted out to anyone in Czechoslovakia who has the cou- rage to think otherwise and stick to their guns. The reader will find all the details in the three vo- lumes of the Lukavica Notebooks. To those rea- ders who feel they have read plenty of similar things already, I would only make the point that the constant recurrence of such realities proves that we can never have too many testimonies of this kind . But it would be to underrate Lukavica Note- books 1977, were we to read it solely as a testi- mony, though even as such it is no mean achieve- ment. It is abov½ all a riveting s tory, and I'd al- most say a novel about one single- albeit fateful - year in the life of an individua! human being who decided to be trne to themselves always from that moment on. The individua! discovers that that dearly-bought, though liberating deci- sion suddenly endows everything with new mea- ning. So apart from being an exceptional testi- mony, as I have already indicated, Lukavica No- tebooks 1977 are a noteworthy literary achieve- ment, a book about love, marriage, friendship and the solidarity of ordinary people, in other words the good, though arduous, fortune of be- ing a human being among other people. 35 [pageend37]36 Acknowledgements The Board of Management wishes to ex- press its gratitude to those whose contribu- tions have permitted the enlargement of the Centre and its collections. t Dr. Johann Wolfgang Briigel, London Dr. Oldřich Dubina, Paris Milan Horáček, Frankfurt am Main Dr. Antonín Kratochvil, Munich Erich Kulka, Jerusalem Dr. Alexej Kusák, Cologne Milan Nápravník , Cologne Susanne Roth, Paris Dr. Jiří Sláma, Munich Dr. Ota Šik, St. Gallen Ludvík Veselý, Munich Financi al contributions are administred by „Kulturamt der Landeshauptstadt Hannover".

[pageend38]THE CORRESPON- DENCE BETWEEN CHARTER 77 AND K. J. VONSCHWARZENBERG Message of thanks to Karl Johannes von Schwarzen berg (Charter 77 Document No.6187) Dear Sir, Prague , 15 January 1987 We have learnt the glad news of the founding of the Cze- choslovak documentation centre whose aim is to record and preserve the works of our independent literature, and are gratified to hear that you have made available premises wi- thin your castle as a fi tting home for the centre . We believe that this act ofyours demonstrates the profound attachment you have to our national cause and your unflag- ging interest in the development of independent Czech and Slovak culture. We are sending a small gift to mark this occasion. With warm thanks and greetings, Jan Litomiský Charter 77 spokesman Dr. Libuše Šilhánová Charter 77 spokeswoman Josef Vohryzek Charter 77 spokesman Letter from K. J. von Schwarzenberg DearMadam, D ear Sirs, 27 February 1987 A 1030 Rennweg 2 Vienna 3 To te l1 you the truth , I am rather embarrassed by your letter and the fine tribute to Za hradn íče k by J .Jirásek which you sent me. The reason is that when I compare your work and the condi- tions in which you and your friends perform the tasks you have set yourselves with the opportunities that I happen to enjoy here , the fact that I was able to supply a few rooms fo r the establishment of an archive is not worthy of mention. lf my forebears were able to preserve Czech historical do- cuments of earlier centuries in their archives at Třeboň and Krumlov, then I can only hope that the new archive will serve a similar purpose today. In short, I would beg you in future to take such things for granted and hope that the archive in question may soon find a home where it belongs, i.e. in Prague. lt is my conviction above all that each work of art that helps maintain the continuity and tradition of our cultural life is of greater importance in our particular situation than in the case of larger nations or of those countries that do not hap- pen to be situated at historical crossroads. lt occurs to me that it is almost impossible to understand Czech history or our nation's leaders, let alone our failures* ·at fata! moments of our history without a knowledge of how our passage to freedom and self-reliance was repeatedly disrupted by truly unwonted reverses and Iosses, such as mark our endeavours to this very day. The wearisome negation, time after time, of everything that went before and the proclamation of new times to last for ever have restricted our view of history and caused us to lose our i"nstinctive awareness that realism, courage and truthfulness are a nation's essential foundation. It is for this very reason, that every endeavour to maintain continuity and prevent further losses is so important. But if we manage to preserve and develop everything that has come into being in recent years, then we stand at least some chance of achieving a breakthrough to new conscious- ness. I thank you with all my heart; you have made me very happy. Yours sincerely, Schwarzenberg • It's fascinating how in Czech the word for "fa iling" is derived from the word for "lying". [pageend39]I realise that we do not view the world from any prominent vantage point, but even so I get the impression that a miracle has happened: the miraculous birth of a free culture which started with ordinary carbon-paper, old typewriters and the be- lief - regarded so sceptically nowadays - that it is worth while, that it makes sense as an effective detence against lies, oppres- sion and stupidity. Milan Šimečka (Bratislava) What exactly is a 'parallel culture'? Not- bing more and nothing less than a culture which, for various reasons will not, cannot or may not reach out to the public through the media which fall under state control. In a totalitarian state, this includes all publis- hing houses, presses, exhibition halls, the- atres and concert halls, scholarly institu- tes and so on. Such a culture, therefore, can make use only of what is left -- typewriters, private studios, apartments, barns, etc. Evidently the 'parallel' nature of this cul- ture is defined wholly externally and imp- lies nothing directly about its quality, aes- thetics or eventual ideology.
