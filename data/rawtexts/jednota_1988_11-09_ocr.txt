Ihe Board of Directors o> which Brother George was a member, and from Ihe membership of our entire Society, as President, I would like to convey the deepest sympathy and condolences Io Marge Yakubisin. his wile, to his children, and to the entire Yakubisin family upon this great toss. It is difficult to find the proper words which can express what Brother George's death means to those whom he leaves behind, which he called "family," or to ihe town in which he lived which he called 'communiiy." or lo those with whom he worked and devoted the social and Iraierrtai part ol his life, whom he called "friends." I can speak with some authority on Brother George's contnbutions to our Society, in which By President Joseph R. Kristofik he was a Supreme Officer lor almost six years George held the office of Director of Fraternal Activities, which took him all over the country and made deep friendships for him both in the Unied Stales and Canada. George was always a team player, who devoted his energies for the benefit Of our Society which he loved He was the driving force in the ever successful Family Day affairs in Middletown, and was deeply interested in our Slovak National Museum He was highly instrumental in formulating bowling and gall tournaments, and all other programs which involved fralernalism Asa team playar he supported all the Society programs designed io move our Society forward, and to preserve its future lor pcslenty. It is somewhat unique but perhaps deserving, that we conduct this buoal and memorial service on a day which in our church is celebrated as ’ AH Souls Day.” In this day and age when many of our younger people seem to teel no need of "church.” was they call it "organized religion.” it is refreshing to note that Brother Jumbo lived and practiced hrs religion daily. At baptism we are all promised Me eternal through cur saviour Jesus Christ Lei Us pray that on this day the soul cl our departed brother. George Yakubism. will be pined with the souls of all mankind which have preceded h>m Let us pray lhal Brother George is now in the presence pl ins God, to whom he prayed, whom he worshipped, and to whom we now pray that Brother George will spend * and share his eternal Me.

A special breed ol horses known as huculs is an almost eximct speče® that was common in Slovakia lor centuries before the advent of the machine age. They were popu for not only in farming but In logging camps where work in the moun- tans called for sure-footed animals Fortunately, steps have been taken to preserve the remaining members of this equine family because the huculs are friendly, intelligent and gentle creatures that are noted lor iheir exceptional qualities of patience and endurance. Moreover, in equestrian circles they have proved to be safe riding horses, even tor children. The legendary Traversal and the Stano stallion of the species are known far and wide for their exploits and showmanship. Though almost blind. Travema astounded admiring crowds with her showmanship Stano, on Ihe other hand, was more than a watchdog in routing marauding bears and wolves intent upon raiding .flocks cl sheep and herds cl cattle in the law Tatra mountain ranges ol central Slovakia. When ihs extinction of the full- blooded hticul strain became imminent, veterinarians in Kosice formed an association to save this rare animal for posterity Immediate steps were taken after World War I to acquire full-blooded mares and stallions lor breeding purposes in Kavečany and Topofoianky. The new herd promises to increase in sufficient numbers in the near Mure after a good beginning in the 1920s Since their demand in agriculture has dedined noticeably because of the introduction of machinery, horses have been more or less displaced. Bui Ihe need tor riding horses* has made (ne huail a lavorile in a country that needs such a reliable and attractive animal' Slovaks have always loved horses, lor they were their companions in the farm fields and essential to their travels near and lar.

The celebrant of the Mass was her cousin from Louisville, Ohio, the Rev. Msgr. Joseph Krispinsky. The eoneelcbrants were Fathers Edward Del ler. John Suknaic. Stanley Launnfis. and Augustine Zan. Sister M. John Vlanney. Superior General. gave the final tribute to Sister Annunciate in the following eulogy: If anyone were limited to describing Sister Annunciate In one word, that word would be "resourceful’'... and a common substitute for the word resourceful is “common-sensed." Genuine common sense is not at al) common- Such a gift Is rare and highly valued. Sister Annunciata possessed that gift to an eminent degree It may well be that her position in her family — as the first of 17 children — accounts for it. During the three-quarters of a century that Sisler Annunciate lived as a professed religious in the Congregation of the Sisters of SS. Cyril and Methodius, she had many opportunities to exercise her resourcefulness. Most Of these years were spent mothering the orphans In the Jednota Orphanage. Those were years of great hardship and deprivation but somehow she always "made do" and things didn’t seem so bad. This generous, gifted, faith-filled Sister first saw the light of day in June of 1895 in Jessup. Pa- one of the suburbs of Scranton, where 18 years later she would surrender her life to God by vows. During her childhood, her family moved to Youngstown, Ohio, but the links with northeastern Pennsylvania were still strong. Her awn account of her Introduction to the Sisters Hot S&gCyrtl and Methodius is aa -follows: 'TrecefveJ my vocation from seeing the pictures and reading the KALENDÁR JEDNOTA about Slovak girls who became aspirants for the new Community of the Sisters of SS. Cyril and Methodius founded by Father Matthew Jankola. It was a great inspir aUon to me when I saw this group of girls preparing lo become the Brides of Christ. Something just drew me close to them. My father Erröte to Father Jankola and received a reply immediately to come to Mt. St. Mary Seminary as soon as possible because 1 missed two months of schooling. I left home for Mt. St. Mary on December 4th and arrived on the 5th. Mollier Cyril. I.H.M., welcomed me and I arrived there on a cold, wintry day. She served my grandmother. Mary Pelrik. my uncle and me a real hot cup of coffee. She sent for Mary Yuskanlc (Sister Cecilia) to'takecareofmeand. then my grandmother left for Jessup after she * saw that 1 was in safe hands." Sister had recounted that she thought she would be going home for Christmas, but Mother Cyril Informed her that she was no longer an aspirant, but a postulant. The generous and faith-filled parentsi-.j Mary and Joseph Filip, willingly allowed theft first-born to give her life to God even though her help with the younger children would have been more helpful. Sister Annunciata’s example of happiness eventually drew Sister Vincent to Join her a few years later. Sister Annunciata s "clalni to fame" was the fact that she was one of the first Sisters to arrive at the Jednota Orphanage in Middle- town. Pa., on May 8. 1914. It was most significant that she was also the last to leave in 1974. several thousands of orphans and thousands of hours of sendee later. For brief periods of lime she taught in Chicago. Plymouth. Whiting. Whitney, and Wilkes-Barre, but invariably she returned to work with the Jednota orphans. That ministry kept her busy from dawn to dusk, seven days a week, day in and day out . . . but she was always ready to do more. Her resourcefulness was evident insofar as she was a self-taught organist and choir directress. At the orphanage she organized boys' baseball teams, she taught, directed choirs, cleaned, planned processions and programs, and always made prizes for the orphans "out of nothing." Her creativity was exceeded only by the love with which she did all these things. If anything needed to be done she did not wring her hands and say she didn’t know how to do It — or had never done it before. She figured It out. saw it to completion, and didn’t say another word about it. but wenton to meet some other challenge. She conquered the obstacles she encountered and kept on moving- Sister Annunciata embodied what a Sister of SS. Cyril and Methodius is all about. She often recalled with gratitude the privilege she had had of being presem at Mother Mary’s deathbed- A happy blend of gentleness and strength, holiness and humor. Sister Annuii- clata planted the seed of her talents in the field of God’s Kingdom and for almost eight dec- ; ades — most of this century — grew in the ’ Lord, served His little ones, and was fiercely loyal to the congregation to which she had pledged her life. Her gifts multiplied as she shared them. As she now joins her parents, family members, our founder, and her contemporaries — our pioneer Sisters — she must ; acknowledge that while IL wasn’t easy, it was well worth It all! The good she has-done has gone before her and follows her into eternity. His light has shone among us and we give glory to the Father for all she has been, done, and given! Sister M.

Might we not. all together, tackle homelessness? The first task of most immigrants who came to America was to establish here a new home. This home would be their castle, their haven, their sweetness, their primary wealth. Family was In their mind the basic form of life, from whose strength and needs all other social structures radiate. Isn’t that why Americans in the '80s have been so touched by the plight of the homeless? Something should be done about homelessness - and be seen to be done about it - asa first item Of business in 1989. Homelessness, true, is not primarily a government problem. It Is a family problem. The first responsibility ol adults has for centuries been to make a home for their childicn. This is the primary skill expected of adults. When I was a child, many of us were from time to time homeless tn those poverty-stricken days (by today’s standards) of the depression and World War n. Yet somehow there were nearly always other family members somewhere to take us in for awhile. But families seem not to be "taking in" their homeless members as families used to do. This failure of many families to care for their own. as family failures always do. places a heavy burden upon other families. Duties to one’s own extended "blood" used to be solemn obligations. They no longer seem to be Another fact about homelessness in America stands out. Today’s crisis Is not literally a housing crisis. There Is more actual housing space per person in the latest reporting year than at any previous time in American history. Vacancies are the highest tn 30 years, and vacancy rates have grown dramatically since 1981- Moreover. nearly two-thirds of Americans own their own homes. Evon 41 percent of the poor do. GovcrnmenL could raise that proportion mightily if it trans- formed the ownership and management of public housing to current tenants. In this, the dramatically successful Kenilworth- Parkside project in Washington. D.O.. maybe a harbinger of a better future. Nearly 500 families In this project now own their own units and manage the whole. They have reduced welfare dependency in their mtdst from 85 percent to 2 percent. Housing is not the chief or on- A ly factor, then. Medical care is ’ probably more basic. A University of Chicago study a few years ago found that a large majority of Chicago's homeless had serious medical problems. A study in The Public Interest showed that large proportions of New York City's homeless in fact had a home they could go to. but far some periods during every year wandered away from them for. temporary [but often prolonged) sojourns upon the streets. a Indeed, the reality of home- ’ FROM OUR JEDNOTA HISTORY By Anthony X. Sutherland. Ph-D. JOZEF HUSEK’S LAST REPORT At the 1937 Annual Meeting. Jozef Husek announced that he was stepping down as editor of JEDNOTA. Husek had been associated with the Society’s organ for nearly 34 years. He had been the FCSU's philosopher. critic, and political spokesman, for so many years that it was difficult to believe that he was really leaving. His decision, however, was irrevocable. though he admitted that he would still work for the Society. He explained. "As editor. I am able to propagate good ideas but I am not able to realize them. It is futile to light with pen and word against widespread apathy. Nevertheless, if you think that my Ideas merit that a serious attempt be made to realize them, you must place the necessary authority In my hands.” At the Society’s 26th Convention held in Perth Amboy. N.J.. in September. 1937, Husek presented his last report as editor. His 15-page report remains a classic In Slovak- American literature, tn it he touched upon a variety of subjects regarding the present state and future of the Society and Slovak-American life In general. it begins: "I do not wish tobe sentimental. But standing be fore you today. Brother Delegates. and that, perhaps for the last time, and looking back over the long period which I spent in the service of the FCSU. I feel as If I were parting with my own life. "I was young, filled with beautiful dreams and firm courage, when, before more than one human age. I embarked on a long voyage which, as I then believed at least, would take me to the shores of the land of my ideals, the summation of which can be best expressed in a few words: To prolong the culrarol and naGonal life of the American Slovaks. But today, after so many trials, after so many struggles and spiritual sufferings. I cannot do otherwise than to admit the sad fact that the goal of my long travel still loses itself In the misty distance. “But no matter. I am not turning back nor do I seek a comforting asylum. I plod on. determined to persevere, because all hope has not yet died in my heart, although an oppressive fear often bums within me as I wonder whether God in His mercy will lead our people to the shores of the promised land, or whether we wilt perish -on the way." Husek s recommendations for the future included an enlarged paper, perhaps to a daily. an expanded athletic program. and especially the union of the Slovak Catholic fráter- nals. In this, his last report. Huseksaid Slovak fratemalism was ill because, "it did not evidence a deeper interest, an understanding of national cultural questions and does not show a systematic and consistent activity in their behalf." Financial solvency is not everything." he said. "Slovak organizations have other aims, more important Among these the most important is: to concern ourselves with the strengthening of our Catholic failh and our Slovak nationalism.” ___ . Husek then thanked his assistants and co-workers over the years al Middletown such as Stephen Matula. George Ml- chalcik. George Michalcik. Jr.. Frank Freislak. and Jan Lesko. Finally. Husek said the ideals of Jednota were Identical with his uwo. “Leave or stay. 1 shall remain loyal Lo the Catholic Jednota until my death. Love her. my brothers, work for her and if necessary, fight for her. because she is the greatest, not only in numbers, but in her deeds for the Church, the nation, and in her charily to her native people." lessness has many angles. We need to comprehend them all. and find effective remedies for each. It stands to reason that each urban center has its own peculiarities and special perplexities. both in the magnitude and in the character and angularity of its own task. For this reason, the new Prest dent should call for the formation of citizen groups (composed of leaders from the relevant professions: law. medicine, realtors and builders, the clergy and others) in each of the nation's 100 largest cities. The President should use his "bully pulpit" and his office of outreach at the White House to call together these "local presidential commissions." He should go public and highlight their work, and publicize their most promising initiatives. George Bush spoke of "a thousand points of light " In their first year, such commissions would constitute at least 100 such. The first task of each would beito analyze caytffully its cwr. areja: 4 the number and needs or 'its , homeless: its local resources: Its best local insight and willingness to act. The second alm would be to sei realistic targets for meeting the special needs and for reducing the number of the homeless In Its own area. By 1990. each area would have much better — and much more concrete — knowledge about its existing problem. Schemes of cooperation among local doctors, lawyers, and oř ficials could be worked out. Action would proceed from facts gathered, lessons learned, dif- ficultles encountered, successes registered 4 With concerted local help. 1 many of today's homeless people are probably capable of maintaining themselves at home. A perhaps much larger fraction needs some sort of institutional help, run and managed by others, to do for them what they cannot do for themselves. It would be useful to know exactly how many. Laws may have to be changed, and patterns of institutional (especially medical) outreach altered. A sound social policy that actually works must go far beyond a romantic heedlessness of fact. For that reason, first-hand local efforts are best. These should be promoted, supported, and given prestige by the President of the United States. Free citizens should not ask Uncle Sam to do what they can do for themselves. A people that lacks initiative and the virtues of local responsibility is not truly capable of self-govemmenl. The President should ask all citizens to form local "points of light" to , care for the needy in their midst. He should call all citizens to ever higher levels nf civic responsibility. It would be kind and gentle, indeed, for such a President to seize the chance to become the tribune of the -homeless, and to stir local professionals around the nation to help them on bls behalf. For most of the American people, home is still "home, sweet home." They also want the vulnerable among them to enjoy that sweetness.

I can only leel; their sense or this moment is so much more profound. However or whatever, it is this moment that seized me H ts this moment during the 45 seconds or so that it lakes for Taps to be played, that I feel like I am able to piece Ihe true character of your nature together from all of the fragments hanging out Ihere.

Also, true loyour character, you never told anyone you received the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star for valor. But then again, you were just a "gmnt" who got his orders, ted his men (nol directed them), and got the |Ob done down in the trenches. Your wile told me later that you could have been promoted many times, but you preferred to remain with your men Your established bonds with these men were earned with you ever since On more than one occasion you said tome.

I’ll be infora meeting on such and such a day Marge and I are going to stop and see the widow of an army buddy ol mine. ’ Marge told me Ihat last evening, al your viewing, a handicapped kid to whom you had given a bowling trophy said to her. "I'm going to miss Jumbo." Your character even followed through to ihe Jednota, where you were always successful al recruiting help because you always remained a G I. Joe and ted by example. At Board Meetings when the philosophical dialogue (you had another name for rt) became overwhelming, you remained true io character, cutting ihrough the rhetoric with a common sense "Lei s vote and gel the job donel" Yes.

A quote on Envy: Virtues of others grieve us because we want them sc much We're envious of their ways, talents, and special touch. There's no reason lo envy anyone for what they possess. Be it prestige, influence, health, wealth or happiness. God created us equal with body and soul tike anyone. Endowed with freedom to enjoy both tile rain and sun. We may not always enjoy the luxuries of a queen or king. Where there's character, integrity, there's no following. If we maintain a sense of decency and great self-respect. As a seed becomes an oak. goodness creates a good effect. Virtues make us richer than those who have money or gold, We have something monev can t buy and wallets cannot hold. As a shepherd who loves his own and deserts not Ins sheep. Justice and truth in the eyes of God are there for keeps. Matthew Bonk. O.S.B. By Father John Catoir Director of The Christophers LIGHT ONE CANDLE it ts better to tight one candle than co curse (he darkness. (Christopher Motto) ARE YOU A SAINT? All Saints' Day comes and goes before we have a chance to ask ourselves the question; "Am I a saint?" Frederick Beuchcr defines asalnt as a “Ufe-glver .. a human being with the same hang-ups and dark secrets and abysses as the resl of us . . . But If a saint touches your life you come alive in a new way." I like that definition and so I ask you. “Are you a saint?" If I had to answer that question 1 think I would have to say. "No." Mother Teresa is a saint. I know I m on my way. lalso know I am a sinner but sometimes I touch people's lives and bring them new life. I love God with all my heart and delight in saying It. However it discourages me at times. Were, it not for Christ's reassurance I would probably despair of ever becoming one. But the Lord tells me not to bother about my progress, so 1 turn It all over to Him and live in His strength and love. I know what St. Paul meant when he said. "I now boast of my weaknesses that humiliate me for weakness is my strength. .." Í2 Cor. 13 9) Our essential vocation is the call to holiness. My path to that goal is within (he context of the priesthood. Everyone travels their own specific Journey, but the vision Is the same for all. Holiness has two poles: God and the world. God is the source and content of all holiness, and the world is the place where human holiness is bom. develops and wages its battles. You don't become holy because of hard work (he way you train for an Olympic gold medal. Holiness Is not ihe result of a life of service. You give a life of service because you are holy. Holiness is God within us. The world is a place of division. Two cosmic visions of the world exist, one as God secs and wills it. Those who conform to His will arc in peace Others live in the slavery of sin. In today's drug-pom sub-culture, the signs of darkness are all too evident. There is no peace here When you ask yourself. "Am 1 a saint?" you have to ask "Which side am I on?" Jesus came to gather souls to Himself, to save them from a life of misery and ruin. Are you helping Him? Saints are people who share passionately in Christ's work of redemption Not everyone participates in His redemptive plan. Some are totally ignorant of it Some special souls suffer in Him and with Him. to an extraordinary degree. To be a saint is io practice heroic virtue. Most of us are not saints, but we have the seeds of holiness growing in us. "One Put the World on the Agenda ALBANY. N Y (NC) - Bishop Howard J. Hubbard c!

NOVEMBER 9, 1988 Washington Letter THE 100TH CONGRESS: ‘ADMIRABLE JOB’ FOR CATHOLIC SCHOOLS Father Joseph Murgas PROFILES . . By Stephanie Overman WASHINGTON (NC) - The 100th Congress did "a pretty admirable Jq£” ofassuring that Catholic school children receive the benefits to which they are entltled^aFft^ollc official Said in 4Q.e^?of-??rm evaluation Major education legislation passed included the reauthor* Izing and amending of the elementary and secondary school act. several school health hazard containment measures, and the Civil Rights Restoration Act. "Overall 1 have to compliment the 100th Congress. It had a huge task to perform and It accomplished it rather well,” said G. Patrick Canan, assistant director of the U.S- Catholic Conference Office of Government Liaison. Canan's assessment was that, "with what It faced." Congress did " a pretty admirable job" of assuring that Catholic school children receive the same benefits as public school children. Canan said in the reauthorization of the Augustus F. Hawkins-Robert T. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988, Catholic schools maintained benefits they already had, plus, "of the seven or eight new Initiatives, we arc written Into most of them.” However, he added, ‘Tew programs were fully funded" by Congress to meet public or private school needs. Richard Duffy. USCC representative for federal assistance to education, agreed that "we did quite well in the reauthorization. We got ourselves Into a number of programs.” One key program for Catholic schools is Chapter I. which provides remedial instruction for disadvantaged and low-Income children. Both public and private school children are entitled to remedial education, but since the 1985 Supreme Court Aguilar vs. Felton decision public school teachers have not been allowed to instruct students In Calholicand other religious schools. Students from religious schools have had to find neutral sites for their reading or math Instruction. Canan said the 1988 reauthorization bill "clarifies and strengthens provisions for participation of private school children." He said Congress considered two ways to make sure lhe needs of students from religious schools were met. One was a parental certificate or voucher program, but “the political reality was that neither the Returned to Exile ROME (NQ - Lithuanian Bishop Jul fonas Sieponavicus relumed io internal exile in Ns Baine homeland following a three- week veil Io Rone that included meetings with Pope John Paul 11 and Vatican officials. The bishop fell for Moscow on the tegular Aeroflot Airlines flight. a spokesman for the Lithuanian College in Rome confirmed. He relumed to Lithuania lhe day after his 77th birthday. Bishop Steponavicius came lc Rome wilh special permission given him by Soviet authorities this past summer. House or the Senate was ready to take it up.” instead members voted additional funds to cover the increased cost of transporting students to neutral sites or to set up mobile classrooms. Additionally, ways of assuring that private school officials would be consulted and that their complaints would be dealt with were incorporated into the law. Congress also passed laws calling for the identification and containment of asbestos, radon and lead in schools but appropriated Little money to the problem. Canan said "No one is arguing that we don't want a healthy, safe environment for kids." he said, but "Congress needs to assess the real costs" schools face in identifying and removing hazardous materials. For example, while Congress appropriated $40 million for asbestos removal, he said the Environmental Protection Agency has estimated it will take $3 2 billion to remove the cancercausing matena) from schools. Other estimates go as high as $6 billion or $7 billion. The problem "is going to be with us fora while and some are suggesting a one-time superfund to go after it. . . and clean up once and for all." Canan said. A superfund was set up to clean up toxic waste sites. "Our greatest resources certainly are our children." he said and ft makes sense to "clean up sooner rather than later." Another major education- related bill that padaed the 100th Congress was the Civil Rights Restoration Act. which over-turned the 1984 Supreme Court ruling In the Grove City College case. The court had ruled that only the federally funded programs tn Institutions, not the entire Institution, could be penalized for civil rights violations. During the four-year fight over the bill the USCC originally expressed concerns but later supported the measure after II was amended to include a provision to prevent it from being used to demand abortion coverage and a "religious tenets” exemption to prevent religious organizations from being unduly burdened. Catholic schools also will be able to receive grants to fight drugs through the omnibus drug bill, which provides funding for treatment and education programs. The USCC opposed a provision of the bill that would permit a federal death penalty for drug-related murders. Some Important battles were not resolved In this Congress, including the child care bill, which could have repercussions affecting education and social service programs. The bill was defeated but is expected to come up again. Duffy said the USCC hopes that changes in this year's bill removing sections that would have eliminated participation by church-sponsored child care agencies will cany over next year. Canan agreed that child care legislation "is going to come right back" in the next Congress.

LITURGY OF THE WORD THIRTY-THIRD SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME READING I At that lime there shall anse Michael, the great prince, guardian of your people: It shall be a lime unsurpassed in distress since the nations began until that time. At chat time your people shall escape, everyone who Is found written In the book. Many of those who sleep In the READING n Daniel 12. 1-3/159 dust of the earth shall awake; Some shall live forever. others shall be an everlasting horror and disgrace. But the wise shah shine brightly awake: like the splendor of the firmament And those who lead the many to justice shall be like the stars forever. Hebrews 10. 11-14. 18/159 Every other priest stands ministering day by day. and offering again and again chose same sacrifices which can never take away sins. But Jesus offered one sacrifice for sins and took his seat forever at the right hand of God: now he waits until his enemies'are placed beneath his feet. By one offering he has forever perfected those who are being sanctified. Once sins have been forgiven, there is no further offering for sin. GOSPEL Mark 13. 24-32/159 Jesus said Ip his disciples: "During that period after trials of every sort the sun will be darkened, the moon will not shed its light, stars will fall out of the skies, and the heavenly hosts will be shaken. Then men will sec the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory. He will dispatch his messengers and assemble his chosen from the four winds, from Che farthest bounds of earth and sky. Learn a lesson from the fig tree. Once the sap of its branches runs high and It begins to sprout leaves, you know that summer la near, in the same way. when you see these things happening, you will know that he is near, even al the door. 1 assure you. thia generation will not pass away until all these things take place. The heavens and the earth will pass away, but my words will not. "As to Lhe exact day or hour, no one knows it. neither the angels In heaven nor even the Son. but only the Father."

NOVEMBER 5. 1988* Vatican Letter Bishops Roman Diary Provides Rare Look at ‘Ad Limina’ Visit VATICAN CITY (NG) - One ol the most unusual and well read documents being passed around Rome in October was the diary of a Brazilian bishop's "ad Imna" visit to the Vatican. - The account drew immediate attention because it was written by Bishop. Pejlro Casaldaliga Pia. a self-described dissenter from some church policies who was recently told by säftcwLfittciais to adhere lo churctiite^pMing^nd stay out of other bishops dioceses. The bishop's "Roman dtary," published in the Italian Catholic magazíne U Regno, was a rare glimpse behind the curtain of secrecy normally pulled over such controversies. It oilers an interesting if one-sided view of Curia figures and methods, Irom the perspective ol a bishop who has been sharply critical of both. Bishop Casaldaliga incurred Vai- ican disfavor when for 17 years he refused to make ihe "ad lirnina" visi! required of heads of dioceses every five years During the last Brazilian visits in 19B5 he cited the high costs of travel and his doubts that such visits were worthwhile. As bishop of the Amazon Prelatuře of Sao Felix do Araguaia, he said, he had more pressing problems to worry about: persecution of his parishioners. Ihe economic injustice to the diocese's natives, poor transportation and communication. and the battle for land reform. Throughout his career, the bishop has made social justice the touchstone of his pastoral ministry. But when officially notified of the Vatican's displeasure, the bishop agreed to come lo Acme last June He was to meet with Pope John Paul )l. as well as wilh Cardinal Ratzinger. head of Ihe doctrinal congregation, and Cardinal Bernardín Gant n. head of the Congregation for Bishops. The bishop, a silver-haired 60-year-old native ol Spain, re- counted how he showed up at the bishops' congregation offices in a borrowed windbreaker. He said he was told by Archbishop Giovanni Re, secretary ol the congregation, that he'd better find something more appropnata to wear for his meeting with Cardinal Ratzinger that weekend. "It will be an encounter in foil smcenty, with full liberty, in full fraternity." Cardinal Ganlin told him. "It was then that I realized I would be subjected to a kind ol ecclesiastical examination." the bishop wrote. He borrowed a habit from his fellow Qaretians in Rome and. on the appointed day, went to meet with Cardinals Ratzinger and Gantin. His writings had been photocopied and sat on a table, anno- lated. Cardinal Ratzinger smiled frequently. he said, and the encounter was polite and "without aggr-es- ston " The bishop described some of Cardinal Ratzinger's questions and his answers The verbal sparring ran along Ihe following lines; Q: Do you accept the Holy See's documents on liberation theolog/? A: In their totality, yes. (Here he argued that the pope himseil had distanced himself trom the first, more negative, document, saying it was written by Cardinal Ratzinger. Cardinal Ratzinger replied: These are rumors that circulate.) Q: You write ol Ihe preferential option for the poor in terms of "class " This term is loaded with a meaning that cannot be ignored. . A: It is a vahd meaning. I think. The conflict between Classes is a reality Q: You have defined Archbishop (Oscar) Romero (ol San Salvador. El Salvador) as a martyr. A: I consider him our saint, pur martyr. But we distinguish between canonical martyrs and "martyrs ol Ihe kingdom." CONSTRUCTION Experienced serviceman, carpenter, laborers and crewmen wanted!

A: I might equaly have said, the church must be in constant renewal. Atone point, according to Bishop Casalrfalga. Cardinal Ganhr took over and. in a sencus lone, accused him of interfering In other dioceses. The bishop had made Irequent (rips to Nicaragua without the permission of Nicaraguan bishops. “This isa faci!" Cardinal Gap- lin is said to have shouted. « '' , Bishop Gasadaiga argued that there were Nicaraguan Catholics "on both sides'’ and thatthechurqh hierarchy had a duty to give them all pastoral care. Q; You said the "ad limine'' visit. was useless. ‘ ’ A: Isarditwas "aimostusefess " The last visit of the Brazilian bishops was done in a new way, with more open discussions. Q: You are being used — your words, your gestures, your writings A. We are ail used, even you. even the pope. We all need to understand clearly who is using us and how. At the end of Ihe meeting, the bishop was given a paper to sign. He refused, saying he would not sign anything without time to reflect The two cardinalsagreed, assuring him. "This is not a trial." The three rose, and the bishop suggested they offer a prayer to make the church more evangelical. "To revolutionize it. no?" Cardinal Ratzinger said, smiling. "Well, yes. to revolutionize it evangelically." the bishop said. They prayed together the Our Father in Latin and a shon invocation to Mary. On his way out, Bishop Casefda- liga was told by a congregation ol- ficial not to speak to journalists about bis The bishop replied that unless journalists are told the truth, they are forcred to invent. Hs 15-minute meeting with F’coe John Paul II came three day later, the bishop related. He found his way Io the pope's office after passing through courtyards, corridors and waiting rooms, after greeting eight guards and presenting his pass four limes. The pope, speaking in fluent Portuguese. invited him to sit down and chai He reminded the bishop trial "ad Hmina" visits are not pure formality. The bishop agreed, saying he appreciated the new style of meetings that were taking place now. He praised the pope’s encyclical on social concerns. "SoIlicitudo Rei Sociaiis " When he suggested that jhe pope bring pressure on the Brazilian president-to implement land reform, toe pope pushed aside a folder marked "Casaldaliga" to look at a map of the Brazilian region. They spoke about the pastoral » problems there. The pope wanted to know it lay oeop'e could read and write. Tne bishop suggested the pope visit their region dunng his next visit to Brazil, perhaps with a stop at a sanctuary at Trinidade. "Trinidade. Trinidade," the pope repeated the name aloud, as if Io mark it in his memory The bishop referred to the statement he had been asked to sign, saying he took it as a sign of mistrust The pope replied But it can also be a demonstration of trust. What happened next at first frightened the bishop, and later pleased him. He said the pope rose to excuse himself, (hen opened wide his arms and "in a tone between admonition and joking" said "You see, I'm not such a wild beast." “I never thought so." Bishop Gasaldaliga replied The bishop asked for a blessing for his people, especially the persecuted. "Above all. the persecuted," the pope said, giving it. The postscript came several weeks later when Bishop Casalda- liga announced he would not sign the Vatican's statement, calling it an attempt to pressure him. The Vatican officially said only that it had reminded the bishop of his duty to follow church teachings and to stay out of other dioceses unless he was invited.

"It is universally admitted — even by people with a critical attitude toward the Christian message — that in the eyes of his contemporaries Christ became a promoter of women's true dignity and of the vocation corresponding to this dignity." the pope wriles. The Latin title of the apostolic fetter is Mulieris Dignitatem. It is described as a letter on the dignity and vocation ol women on the occasion of the Marian year. The 25.000-word letter is the pope's response to one proposition of the 1987 world Synod Df Bishops, namely that "the anthropological and theological foundations for resolving questions aboul ihe true significance and dignity of each sex require deeper study." The pope explains that responding to this concern cl the synod IS "a question ol undemanding the reason for and the consequences of the Creator's decision that the human being should always and only exist as a woman or a man It is only by beginning from these bases, which make it possible to understand the greatness of the dignity and vocation ol women, that one is able to speak of their active presence in the church and in society." Pope John Paul M intends to discuss pastoral concerns ol Ihe synod regarding lbe place of women in church and society in the post-synod exhortation he plans to publish later. The theme of the 1987 synod was "Ths Vocation and Mission of Ihe Laity in the Church and in the World 20 Years After the Second Vatican Council." In his apostolic letter, the pope expresses the thanks of the church "for each and every woman: for mothers, for sisters, for wives; for women consecrated to God In virginity; for women dedicated to the many human beings who await the gratuitous love of another person; for women who walch over the human persons in me family, which is the fundamental sign of the human community: for women who work professionally and who at limes are burdened by a great social responsibility." * Tns pope adds the church's thanks tor '"perfect* women and for 'weak women — for ail women as they have come forth from the heart of God in an the beauty and richness of their femininity' as they have been embraced by his eternal love; as together with men. they are pilgrims on this earth, which is the temporal 'homeland' of all people and is transformed sometimes into a valley of tears'; as they assume, together with men, a common responsibility for the destiny of humanity according to daily necessities and according to that definitíve destiny which the human family has in God himself, in the bosom of the ineffable Trinity" One way in which the human "inheritance of sin" is expressed in the concrete, historical situation is by "habitual discrimination against women in favor of men." Pope John Paul II says. He discusses this in the context ol his exploration of the relationship of Jesus to women in the Gospels. Pointing to the story of the women "caught in adultery" in Chapter 8 of John's Gospel, the pope writes; '.‘In the end Jesus says to her 'Do not sin again.1 but first he evokes an awareness of sin in Ihe men who accuse her... Jesus seems to say to the accusers, Is not this woman, for all her sin. abovskí a confirmation of your own transgressions, of your 'male' injustice, your misdeeds?" The pope comments: "The episode recorded in the Gospel of John is repealed in countless similar situations in every period of history. A woman is left alone, exposed to public opinion with her sin,' while behind 'her' sin there lurks a man — a sinner. guilty 'of the other's sin.' indeed equally responsible for it And yet his sin escapes notice, it is passed over in silence." Then the pope adds: "How often in a similar way the woman pays for her own sin (maybe it is she in some cases who is guilty of Ite 'other’s sin' — ihe sin ot the man), but she alone pays and she pays all alone! How often is she abandoned with her pregnancy, when the man, the child's father, is unwilling to accept responsibility for it?" Each man, the pope concludes, must 'Took within himself to see whether she who was entrusted to him as a sister in humanity, as espouse, has not become in his heart an object ol adultery, to see whether she who. in different ways, is the co-subjeci of his existence in the world, has not become for him an object': an object of pleasure, ol exploitation." The apostolic letter is presented by the pope in “the siyle and character ol a mediation.” It is a meditation on Ihe place in salvation history of the Virgin Mary and the first woman. Eve; on the themes of motherhood and virginity: on the eucharist and the priesthood; on the dignity of women in "the order of love"; on the church as the bride ol Christ: on how men and women are images of God; on ihe unique gifts of women and of femininity. "The fullness of grace' that was granted Io Ihe Virgin of Nazareth with a view to the fact that she would become Theotokos also signifies me fullness of the perfection of 'what is characterisiic of women,' of 'what is feminine,' " the pope writes And with the Virgin Mary, he says, "aweman is to be found al Ihe center" of the salviflc event. Original sin. the pope indicates, is not Ihe sin of a woman alone. It is the sin of "man," of both the first man and woman. Furthermore, he suggested. the biblical Adam and Eve should not be looked upon only as sinners. but as signs of God's creation. Thus, ihe comparison of Eve. as first woman, and Mary, as sign of the new creation, "can be understood also in the sense that Mary assumes in herself and embraces the mystery of the 'woman' whose beginning is Eve. 'ihe mother of all the living."' "The personal resources of femininity are certainly no less than the resources of masculinity: They are merely different." the pope writes. He says that a woman "cannot become the object' of'domination' and male ■possession.' " But. he adds, women's rightful opposition to this "must not under any condition lead to Ihe 'masculinization' ol women, tn Ihe name of liberation from male 'domination.' women must not appropriate to themselves male characteristics contrary to their own feminine 'originality.'" The first reports on the pope's apostolic letter focused on the brief section in ft that discusses the priesthood. In that section, the pope rejects "the assumption that (Christ) called men to be apostles in order to conform wilh Ihe widespread mentality of his limes." This assumption. Ihe pope adds, "does not at all correspond to Christ's way of acting.” Reaffirming the 1976 instruction from the Vatican Congregation for me Doctrine of the Faith against admitting women to the priesthood, the pope writes: "ft is the eucharist above all that expresses the redemptive act of Christ, the bridegroom, toward the church, ihe bride. This is dear and unambiguous when the sacramental ministry of the eucharist, in which the priest acts in persona Christi, is performed by a man." At a Sept. 30 press conference on the pope's apostolic letter. Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, head of the doctinal congregation, said that restricting the ordamed priesthood to men is not a denial ol women's dignity and that the pope's statement on this is a reflection of church tradition. "The dignity ol women is measured by the order of love," Pope John Paul II writes. "The moral and spiritual strength of a woman is joined to her awareness that God entrusts the human being to her in a special way. Of course, God entrusts every human being to each and every other human being. But ths entrusting concerns women in a special way... and this a in a particular way determines their vocation." 7 A woman is able to be "an irreplaceable support and source of spiritual strength for other people." the pope indicates. "A woman is strong because of her awareness" that human beings are entrusted to her. he says. “This awareness and this fundamental vocation speak to women of the dignity which they receive from God himself."

Niečo sa v tej tichosti bráni, a líšky idú po svojom- Počuť ich naliehavý štekot, taký dotieravý a potom víťazný. Ráno vidíme svedectvo o tej nočnej tragédii na našich poliach. Jak sa časy menia a život beží! Zdá sa, že len nedávno dievčatko sa učilo od rodičov milovať a hcrlif za svoj národ tu V cudzine, a vo veku-nikdy nestrácalo tu lásku. Cím viac dievča rástlo, tým viac videlo krásu a dôstojnosť svojeti a tým viac si vážilo a cenilo čo je slovenské. Horlila láskou a neúnavne pracovala. Roky utekali, utekali a teraz Marienka Mravecová si vzala ten živý duch ale vyrobené telo na odpočinok. Odišla od n in do slnečnej Slovenskej aáhrady do Floridy. Vždy pozerala b obľubou a láskou na ten slovenský život tam —- u teraz je to jej čom. Marienka nech to slniečku ti je na zdravíš, odpočinok v tej tichosti & kráse a nech žije vaše láska k národu. Ďakujem ti Za tú dobro čo ei pre Slovákov tu v Chicagu urobila, a modlite sa aby sme rástli. Pán Roh caplať, Marienka. Nemôžem w dosť dočítať o Mariánskom roku. Pravda, tu v slobodných Spojených Štátoch Boli hojné Mariánske oaUvy-J—' všetko nádherné a tak sa patrilo!

A tak to bolo v Levoči, na Starých Horách, v Nitre Gaboltove a inde, kde vzdávali hold Kráľovnej nebies. Aj noviny písali, ie všade bola ponajviac slovenská mládec! Reportáž píše, že boli prečítané pozdravy od slovenských biskupov a kardinála Tomáška v Žastíne a skončil sa slovami .mládežníckej piesne: "Nech slnko svieti, kde si Ty”, všetci prítomní držali horiace sviečky nad hlavami, čo pripomínalo ohnivé jazyky na prvé Turíce. A chvála Bohu, že Čítame zo správ, že mestská správa sa zachovala voči púti veľmi ko- relrtne. V Nitre pod Kalváriou holi stánky s občerstvením. Verejná bezpečnosť riadila dopravu. Stalo sa dokonce, že autobus s pútnikmi z Oravy v Nitre zablúdil. Keď sa šofér pýtal policajta ako sa dostane ns Kalváriu, tento sadol do služobného auta a viedol autobus až na miesto! Zlatým klincom Mariánskeho roku bola celoslovenská púf v Nitre. Sotva jestvuje na svete krajina v ktorej by bol tento rúmoriadný Svätý Mariánsky rodí vyburcoval toľkých veriacich na púť a pohanil v nich rozhodnutie žiť nekompromisným kresťanským životom napriek rizikám, ktoré im hrošia v spoločnosti nepriateľskej voči kresťanstvu e každému náboženstvu.

BASIL BENKOVA, SSCM VO VEČNOSTI ,4i Keď al aa Sviatok Víeeh Svätých Cirkev uctieva všetkých hrdinov lásky Kristovej, ktorí dosiahli nebo. Pán si dňa 30. októbra 1988 povolal na večný odpočinok Sestru M. Ba- 8Ü Benkovú, n rehole Sestier sv. Cyrila b Metoda v Danville, Pa. Sestra M. B&sil, rodným me- oorn- Mária Klára Benkovi, sa narodila pred 32 rokmi na Slovensku, v krásnom Poprade. Po príchode do Kolumbovej Zeme, keď 8a dozvedela o sloven; akej reholi Sestier hv. Cyrila a Metoda, srdce jej zahorelo, lebo bola vždy hrdá na evoj slovenský pôvod. Do tejto rehole vstúpila v ruku 192^ a svoje rehoľné sľuby : chudoby, celibáty & poslušnosti slušila- dňa 12. júla 1928 Ako usilovná domáca pracovnica, v reholi pôsobila v biskupstvách v Scran- tone, HarrisbUTgU, Bridgeporte a New Yorku. Napokon aa u- tiahla na zaslúžený odpočinok do Ústavu Maria Hall v Danville, kde ju aj smrt zastihla. Pohreb Sestry M. Basil bol dňa 1. novembra 1983 z Ústavu Maria Halt Sv. omšu slúžil O. Azeton Pleho z New Yorku, prí- hnmý nebohej. S ním koneele- brov&lí: Megr. Jozef Hager PE, <1. Ján SuknaiČ, 0. Eduard Deller a O. Záá. O, Deller vo svojej homilii povedal, že už to, že pohreb Sr. Basil je práve na Sviatok Všech Svätých, už nás nabáda, aby sm« upreli svoje zraky na nebesia. No, a v. Jáo nám hovorí, že ‘'Večný život spočíva v tom, že poznáme pravého Boha a jeho Syna, ktorého nám poslal- Jetiš Kristus”. Poznat ich zna- mená, byť svätými, ako je aj sám Boh Svätý, ku čomu nás vedie Syn Boží a Duch Svätý. Vychováva nás, ako svoje dletJsy, lebo sme sa nimi stall bv krstom. Tým sme teraz, ale len vo večnosti sa ukáže čo to znamená, keď uvidíme Pána z tvári do tvári, lebo budeme taký, ako je Qn sám, hovorí av. Ján. V tomto mámení žila Sestra Basil, ako verné dieťa sv. Cirkvi. Teraz prosíme Pána, aby jej milostivé odpustil véet- ky slaboBti a dal jej odpočinok večný! Po sv. prijímaní Vel. Sešita Ján M. V í a n u e y, generálna predstavená rehole, krásne o- hodníia rehoľný život Sestry M. Basil. Jej život v reholi vystihla slovom: "nepredvida- VDBÜ”, čo prirovnala ku nepred- vídavosti Božieho riadenia celého sveta, tobôž každého človeka. Hovorila, že Sestra Basil bola hlboko voriaca duta, ktorá milovala svoju rehoľu, v čom sa vždy utiekala pod ochranu Panny Márie a sv. Jozefa. Svojou osobnou' dobrotivosťou priam očarovala vždy svoje prostredie, tam. kde zdarné ú- činkovala ako domáca pracovnica, Vo varení a pečeni bola vynaliezavá a často prekvapila každého svojou vynaliezavosťou. Tým zožala mnoho uznanie. či už medzi Sestrami, alebo a j medzi sirotami Vřele milovala svoj rodný kraj: SLO- VENSKO a rada by tam zabehla ku svojim súrodencom. Veď aj krátko pred smrťou ešte hútala, že by ešte tak rada šla na Slovensko navštíviť svojich. No Pán rozhodol inak. A teraz pro. j e j a me r ic k á s v o k r a Napísala MÁRIA K. SINÁKOVÁ fPôkračoounie I Pani Nováková bystrým zrakom pozorovala Katku, aký účinok v nej vyvolajú tieto slová. Horlivé ju posmeľovala: "Keby som bola na vašom mieste, rozhodne by som nezanedbala túto znamenitú príležitosť. Keď chcete písať — a ja verím, že vás písanie zaujíma — a chcete sa dožiť úspechu, alebo ako ste sa vyslovili, víťazstva a vašej práce, pokúste sa písať o tom. čomu rozumiete, čo vás zaujíma, čo ste skúsili. Tiež co sa odohrávalo okolo vás, číže z vášho života. A uvidíte, že dosiahnete úspech, lebo vaša práca bude korunovaná úspechom." Pán učiteľ sa chutne rozosmial a žartovne poznamenal: "Anna, to si aj mne odporúčala. Pamätáš sa? No, bohužiaľ, na mne éa to ešte dosiaľ nesplnilo, či i ja mám ešte príležitosť Pani učitelová sa usmievala, tiahla sa k sesternici a pozrela □a Katku, pričom víťazoslávnym hlasom zajasala: "Neverte mu! Hej. neverte, lebo aj on sa toho dožil. A nepotrvá dlho, dnes-zajtra, ako nám poštár donesie jeho knihu." A hrdo pozrela na manžela. dodala: "Už je čas, aby si sa aj ty preukázal s niečím. Dúfam, že Katka sa dočká tej knihy, ešte kým bude u nás. No, a ty. Anna, neponáhľajte sa tak. Ostatí u nás dva-trí dni. ak nie dlhšie." “Úprimne blahoželám!" zvolala prekvapená pani Nováková nad touto nečakanou novinou a vystrela ruky oproti pánovi učiteľovi. "Mnoho zdaru! Dúfam, že mi zašleš jeden výtlačok tvojej knihy. Budem ju očakávať doma, kam prídem asi o týždeň." Katka so zatajeným dychom podala chvejúcu ruku svojmu dobrodincovi, starému pánovi učiteľovi a dojaté povedala: “Prijmite aj moje blahoželanie! želám vám mnoho úspechov, môj dobrý' pán učiteľ! Ach, ako som šťastná, že vám môžem blahoželať k vášmu literárnemu dielu. A keďže očakávate vyjdenie knihy dnes-zajtra, ostanem u vás. aby som ju dostala prvá z vašej ruky e s vaším podpisom " Blažene sa usmievala, jej vyjasnená tvár žiarila, ako by odrazu všetky starosti a obavy zašli do zabudnutia. Srdce radosťou trepotalo, ako by v nej ožil celý svet. Radovala sa s učiteiovcami tak, ako by to bolo jej vlastné literárne dielo. Úplne zabudla na seba. Pozorne načúvala hovor domácich a pani Novákovej, ktorá nadšene hovorila a chcela vedieť podrobnosti o novej knihe. A obrátila sa s otázkou na pána učiteľa; "A akýže má názov tá tvoja kniha?" "Slobodná vlasť!" pani učiteľova predbehla manžela s odpoveďou. "Nechcel za nič odstúpiť od tohto názvu." "Znamenitý to názov,“ poznamenala pani Nováková. "Som istá, že kritika ju prijme pochvalne. Môžeš byť istý, že ťa úspech neminie. Vieš zaujímavo písať o povinnostiach človeka a o láske, lepšie, ako keď si písal o politike." “Vari ste čítali rukopis, kým bol oddaný vydavateľstvu?" zvedavo aa pýtala Katka. "Hej, Čítala som z neho hodnú časť. Pán učiteľ stal sa autorom v požehnanom veku, veď má už šesťdesiatpäť rokov," vysvetlila pani Nováková a žartovne poznamenala; "Pán učiteľ nevedel _ea nijako, rozhodnúť opustiť mládenecký život, tak zase sa nevedel ’ rozhodnúť vydať knihu — až keď sa našiel aa penzii, odhodlal sa k tomu vážnemu kroku." "Predsa som sa však rozhodnul, a to je hlavná vec," zue žartovne vravel pán učiteľ, s vďačným pohľadom pozrel na svoju družku a dodal; "Keby nebolo jej, vari dodnes by som nebol skončil ani rukopis. Nebolo by knihy a azda by som dodnes mládenčil." "Pravdou ostáva, že si dobrý manžel, bol si dobrý učiteľ a teraz sa stávaš zvučným autorom," prízvukovala pani Nováková. Katka zrakom upozornila dietky, aby odstúpili od stola. A tie porozumeli a hneď aj tak urobili- Pani Nováková pozrela na hodinky, potom na pani učiteľovi, ktorá porozumela, čo to znamená a preto povedala: "Nesmieme ťa tu zdržiavať, lebo druhý raz by si nás obišla. Preto ťa nebudem odhovárať od ďalšej cesty. Koľkože času máš ' sžte na vlak?" "Ľutujem, že aa musíme narýchlo rozlúčiť," odpovedala oslovená, "avšak môj vlak bude v Trnave o hodinu a päť minút." Spoločnosť ea rozišla c dvadsať minút Po odchode pani Nová* kovej, pani učiteľova az do polnoci rozprávala Katke c manželovej knihe. Udrela už tretia hodina, ale Katke ešte nespala. Rozmýšľala, že tá kniha musela byť tc prekvapenie, o ktorom jej pani učiteľovi písala. O pani Novákovej nechcela si nič namýšľať, vari zajtra sa dozvie niečo o nej. Sen ju naskrze minul. Dietky pokojne spia a ona tu leží, myšlienky jej zalietajú za ďaleké more Bolestne po- vsdychla: "Nie je možné, aby som bola tak ďaleko od nebo vzdialená. Pre mňa je všetko stratené, písanie, aj Amerika, ktorá mi nikdy nevymrime z myšlienok." Katka brala celú vínu na seba, čo sa odohralo medzí nimi Teraz nemá koho viniť, že je tu. Zastenala: ‘‘Keby sa mi aspoň pohovoril hoci len jedným listom. Mal by aa dozvedať o deťoch. Ale ani slovíčko od neho!" Ročná schôdza okresu Msgr. š.

Dlho s? však nemohla kochať v spánku, lebo ju, dietky zobudili. Pani učiteľovi aj dnes dychtivo čakala na poštára, ale ten sa nezastavil pri ich dome. Dnes ostali doma, nešli do mesta. Popoludní pani učiteľova povedala Katke, že predvčerom vydavateľstvo im listovné oznámilo, že zasielajú knihy, preto by už malí byť tu. Leu teraz sa Katka dozvedela, prečo pán učiteľ bo) v Turčianskom Svätom Martine, či azda to bolo to prekvapenie ? Rada by sa bola spýtala, ale ostýchala sa učiteľovcov. Namrzela sa. Ešte tento týždeň musí isť domov. Vari bude tam list od Dávida. Zatúžila po Dávidovi. Zacítila, že posledná kvapka nenávisti proti nemu sa roztopila v hĺbke jej srdca. Jej myšlienky zalietli k prvým rokom, ked ako dieťa chodievala k pánu učiteľovi, ktorý bol vždy zahĺbený v knihách, alebo v písaní. Ale čo ako by chcela pripisovať podnikavosť pánu učiteľovi, v srdci cítila, že to bola jeho manželka, ktorá ho pobádala, dávala mu vnuknutie, aby sa pustil do písania a konečne vydania knihy. Takto jej hovorievala pani učiteľovi: "Tí, ktorí vo svojom podujatí cheú dôjsť k cieľu, nezastanú na pol cesty, ale stále a vytrvanlivo idú napred, až kým nezvíťazia!" Pre ňu však to nemalo platnosť, vzdychla ubolene. Pre ňu písanie je skončené. Stratila sebadôveru, a to v ten deň, keď ju Dávid vypovedal z jej novej vlasti, z jej nového domova, bez ktorého jej život je prázdny. Bez Dávida jej p&dnikavosť k písaniu je nemožná. Minulú noc takmer celú prebdela. Dúfala, že táto noc ju vykúpi s ubíjajúcich myšlienok, ktoré chcela odpudiť od seba, aby si oddýchla. Ale spánok sa stal jej nepriateľom aj v túto noc. Očí sa nijako nechceli zatvoriť. Odrazu sa vzchopila. Sadia si na posteli. Ruky sa jej vzopnuli, ani So by sa modlila. Jej srdce akoby minulo každý druhý úder. ,rUž viem, kto je tá pani Nováková.. Skočila z postele a na prstoch prešla okolo detí, ktoré pokojne spali na veľkej posteli. Začala sa prechádzať po veľkej spálni. Zastavila sa pri okne, cez ktoré nakukoval mesiačik. Oči jej zažiarili iskreným pohľadom. Zatajila dych, oprúc pohľad na mesiačik... v duchu sa e nim zhovára, žalovala sa mu, a cn ako by ju tešil. Dýchanie sa stávalo normálnejšie, pokojnejšie. Ter&z už si bola istá, že jej pamäť nablúdi, oči ju neklamú. Dáma — táto pani Nováková — nie je nikto iný, ako vznešená pani Maróthy Soltésová, chýrna slovenská spisovateľka. Nie div, že jej čas je tak vymeraný. Teraz sa už nečudovala, že sa tak náhlila. či azda pani učiteľova narafičila vec tak, aby splnila jej daný sľub? A tak sa podarilo stretnúť sa jej ec vznešenou, chýrnou slovenskou spisovateľkou. A či by to bola len náhoda ? Vtiahla sa do postele. Hodiny utekali. Bola uverená, že to bola práca pani ijčiteľky, aby sa tu stretla s chýrnou spisovateľkou. Ale prečo ? čudovala sa guna na sebe a na tej náhode, či už schválne a čl nie vyplánovanej Prečo by aa pani učiteľovi bola podujala na také stretnutie, a to po toľkých rokoch? Ráno obriadila deti, obliekla ich. Pani učiteľová ako starostlivá a bedlivá matka sa postarala, aby si Katka odpočinula. Ona na tento deň vzala dietky pod svoju opateru. Darmo Katka protestovala, .musela si ľahnúť. Pani učiteľovi ostala dnes doma, čakajúc nedočkavé na balík s dvomi knihami, ktoré sa im majú doručiť z kníhtlačíame. Mal to byť ich sviatok. Ako každý iný deň pán učiteľ bol však zamestnaný aj dnes v záhrade pri kvetoch a potom vo včelíne. Do poludnia sa poštár neukázal. Popoludní manželia sa uvelebili pod stromami, čakali na poštára a dietky sa bavili na hojdačke, ktorú pán učiteľ dal uviazať susedovi na strom. Katka si prisadla k učiteľovcom. Solo na nej vidieť, že si oddýchla. Ani slovom sa nezmienila o pani Novákovej, obávajúc sa svojho prezradenia. Len čakala, či pani učiteľovi jej povie, kto je vlastne pani Nováková & prečo cestuje inkognito. Katka bola celá šťastná nad dokončeným dielom pána učiteľa. Hoci noci boli chladné, dni boli horúce. Všetci zatúžili po chladnej káve, ochladiť sa. Káva bola bohatá, lebo bola obohatená smotánkou. Sedeli okolo stola, keď prišiel poštár & zanechal pánu učiteľovi dva výtlačky kníh, jeho diela. Boli to prvé dve knihy so stroja, ktoré mu zaslala kníhtlačiareň. Pán učiteľ nechal knihy na starosti manželke, ktorá dychtivo po nich siahla a s Katkou ich hneď začali pozorne obzerať. Keď sa do sýtosti pokochali vystrojením knihy, dali sa do čítania. Už sám názov knihy "Slobodná vlasť" bol zaujímavý, veľa značiaci. Katka sa c niekoľko hodín oboznámila e obsahom knihy, ktorého hlavné body zvučne a významne opisovali výdobytky svetovej vojny: utvorenie nového štátu Slovákov a Čechov, v ktorom sa začali lepšie uplatňovať princípy demokracie. V školách sa slobodne vyučovalo v materinskom jazyku. Do zajrončenía vojny nebolo možné v školách na Slovensku hovoriť slobodne slovensky, vyučovať v materinskej reii. Vydávanie slovenských kníh bolo zakázané maďarskou vládou. Maďarská reč bola násilne natískaná Slovákom. A už sa zdalo, že násilná maďarizácia úplne zničí slovenský národ Maďarizácia zúrila najmä vo väčších mestách a mestečkách No. vďaka Bohu, slovenčina sa udržala — a udržala ju halena, teda na dedinách, kde ľud býval spolu.

WEDNESDAY- NOVEMBER'S. 1988 SPRÁVY Z VATIKÁNU POĽSKO — Edward Lorenz, poľský minister pre náboženské záležitostí v rozhovore e dopisovateľom talianskeho katolíckeho denníka AWENTRE vyhlésil: "Ako marxista musí připustit, Že sme sa mýlili, keď sme si v minulestí vysvetľovali náboženský jav výlučne z politického hľadiska. Mysleli sme, že stačí "podnecovať sociálne boje, aby sa rozriešila náboženská otárira^tev človekovi sú vnútorná požiadavky, ktoré treba brať do úvahy. Náš postoj voči náboženstvu sa mu« si zmeniť.'’ ' R1M —• Nemecký teológ Walter Kasper z Tübingen, ktorý bol zvláštnym tajomníkom na Mimoriadnej biskupskej synode roku 1935, v rozhovore so zástupcom rímskeho denníka TL TEMPO o Cirkvi a o súčasnom pápežovi medziiným povedal : "Vo vnútri Cirkvi sa zapaľuje svetlo novej plurality. To, prirodzene, prináša so sebou napätia a riskuje narušenie jednoty, ale ešte viac je znamením neprerušenej životaschopnosti Cirkvi, ktorá, dnes na konci druhého tisícročia je čosi celkom iné než Cirkev v agónii. Práve v krajinách Tretieho s Štvrtého sveta sa predstavuje ako Cirkev mladá, ako Cirkev na postupe. Môžeme sa iba. nádejať, že tento čerstvý vetrík zachytí aj staré európske cirkvi... Premiestnenie ťažiska zo Severu na Juh znamená, že Cirkev sa neviaže na nijakú určitú kultúru, na určitý politický systém. Dnes žije v najrozličnejších společensko- kultúrnych podmienkach. Vie, že je zodpovedná v každej situácii za základné ľudské práva. Ani jeden pápež pred Jánom Pavlom n. nehovoril tak Často a s takou silou o týchto ne- odcudziterných ľudských právach na celom svete. Stal sa obrancom chudobných u utláčaných, advokátom spravodlivostí n milosrdenstva... Cirkev dnes prechádza ťažkou dobou, v ktorej je potrebné napomáhať zákonitý pluralizmus, ale bez narušenia jednoty. Je pochopiteľné, že v hľadaní novej rovnováhy medzi jednotou a pluralizmom sa ukazujú rôzne mienky a sily. Podľa mňa tu nejde o proces umrtvováni» Cirkvi, ale o krizu restu, ktorý musíme napomáhať rez zdôrazniac jednu a rez druhú stránku. Oboje— jednota v Petrovej službe a pluralita v kultúrach a v národoch — musia nájsť miesto v jednej Cirkvi." KOSICE — Krajský cirkevný tajomník Košíc Michal S;- čák oznámil gréckokatolíckemu správcovi fary v Lutine Cyrilovi JančíŠinovi, áe mu od 15. októbra berie štátny súhlas. Si- čák neudal pre odobratie súhlasu nijaký konkrétny dôvod. Gréckotatolícki kňazi prešovského dekanátu sa obrátili na kapitulárneho vikára Mons. Jána llirku písomnou prosbou, aby sa zastal svojho kňaza Cyrila Jančišina. “Vsetei sme pre- svedčem — píšu v liste gréckokatolícki kňazi — že Otec Cyril Janäšin je nevinný.” Mons. Hirka sa usiloval o prijatie u krajských funkcionárov, ale tí nechcú s ním pojednávať o prípade odňatia štátneho súhlasu kňazovi Janciámovi v Dutine, TURÍN — Turínsky arcibiskup kardinál BaHestrero na tlačovej konferencii 13. okt. 1988 oznámil, že podľa vedeckých výsledkoch v laboratóriách univerzity v Arizone, v Orfords a na polytechnike v ZUrichu takzvanou rádio-uhlíkovou metódou svetoznáme Turínske plátno, ktoré ea od roku 1578 uchováva v turínskej katedrále, pochádza z doby od roku 1260 do 1390. Aj po týchto vedeckých pokusoch ostávajú však aj naďalej problémy o pôvode tohto zvláštneho obrazu tváre Krista Pána. ŠTOKHOLM — Nobelova cena za literatúru na rok 1988 bola udelená 77-ročnéniu egyptskému spisovateľovi Nagufbovi Mahfozovi, ktorý je autorom okolo 40 románov. Komisia, skladajúca sa z 18 spisovateľov a švédskych univerzitných profesorov, odôvodnila cenu slovami. že "autor výtvoril arabské rozprávačské umenie, týkajúce sa celého ľudstva a prispel k rozvoju románu a literárnej reči v arabskom kultúrnom svete". MAĎARSKO - Maďarský minister zahraničia Peter Var- konyi oznámil, že Maďarsko sa rozhodlo odstrániť "železnú o- ponu", ktorá ho doteraz oddeľovala cd susedného Rakúska. Takto chce odstrániť posledné ostatky "studenej vojny", pretože sa chce "otvoriť svetu”. Odstránia sa aj míny, ktoré boh doteraz pozdĺž rakúskych hraníc. Minister Varkonyi to povedal v rozhovore so zástupcom viedenského denníka "Kronen Zeitung”. SLOVENSKO — V utorok 11. oktôbrav Kláštore pod Znievom zomrel Otec Jozef Škoda zo Spoločnosti Božieho Slova. Pohreb bol v piatok 14. ckóbra o 11. hodine v Kláštore pod Zníevom. FRANCÚZSKO — V nedeľu 16. októbra vo Val-ď Oise pri Paríži sa konala slávnostná posviacka ?-met. vysokej sochy Panny Márie, ktorú dali postaviť členovia laického hnutia Máriinej légie. Na slávností sa zúčastnil parížsky arcibiskup kardinál Lustiger, a biskup diecézy Pontoise Mons André Rousset ďalej novomenovaný nuncius vo Francúzsku Mons. Antonotti a okolo 30 tisíc veriacich. Členovia hnutia Márii- nei légie nazbierali na túto sochu vyše 4 milióny frankov. RÍM — Taliansky denník IL TEMPO uverejnil rozhovor B litovským biskupom Mons. Ste- ponaviciusom o súčasnej náboženskej situácii v Litve. “Sľúbili nám, že vláda pripraví a u- verejní nový vrúvvy systém pre vztahy medzi štátom a cirkvami v Litve. Čakáme na toto nové zákonodarstvo. Uvidíme, či sa situácia zmení a ako sa zmení. Doteraz sa nič nezmenilo. Boli iba sľuby, ale nijaká zmena sa nezaznamenala. Cirkev očakáva, že litovská vláda sa nebude miešať do vnútorných záležitosti cirkevného spoločenstva. Žiada, aby biskupi mohli slobodne vykonávať vlastnú zodpovednosť.v spravovaní diecéz, bez zasahovania civilných úradov... Ja sa nepokladám za mučeníka, ale za svedka viery mojej cirkvi. Nebol som po- trefitaný za. to, že som aa dopustil nejakých prečinov, ale za to, že som odmietol prijať vládne nariadenia, ktoré sa protivili cirkevným zákonom. Prijal som tú skúšku spokojne, lebo som vedel, že to je môj pri- «wok pre cirkevný život v Litve ... Všetci očakávame návštevu Svätého Otca. AJe len sám Pán Boh vie, ti a kedy sa uskutoční táto návšteva. Nemám velké nádeje na návrat dc avojej diecézy, dokiaľ zostane na mieste terajší komisár kultu.

RAKÚSKO — Od 20. do 23. októbra sa konal vo viedenskom centre “Austria" 12. medzinárodný kongres o rodine. Jeho cieľom bolo posilnenie rodiny ako ^skladnej bunky ľudskej spoločnosti. Organizačný výbor oznámil, že je priam za- planovaný prihláškami účastníkov na 13. medzinárodný kon- grw o rodine, ktorý sa bude konať na jar budúceho roku v Nemeckej spolkovej republike. Doteraz sa už prihlásilo vyše 3 tide osôb, z čoho okolo 300 aj zo socialistických krajín. Medzi prednášateľmi na kongrese vo Viedni Je aj Matka Tereza z Indie, ďalej profesor Viktor Frankl, francúzsky genetík Jerome Lejeune a svetoznfimy americký psychoterapeut dr. Bernhard Nathanson. Tridsiata tretia cesrocnrí nedeľa PRVÉ ČÍTANIE V tom čase brute národ tvoj oslobodený Cítenie z Knihy proroka Daniela. — V tom čase povstane Michal, veľké knieža, čo stojí nad synmi tvojho národa: bude to čas úzkosti, aký nebol, odkedy národ povstal, až po ten čas. V tom čase bude však národ tvoj oslobodený, každý, koho nájdu zapísaného v knihe. A mnohí z tých, čo spia v prachu zeme, sa zobudia; niektorí na večný Život, iní na hanbu a večnú potupu. Rozumní sa budú skvieť ako oblohy, a tí, čo mnohých priviedli k spravodlivosti, budú ako hviezdy na večné veky. Počuli sme slovo Pánovo. MTTHrrSP'EV Pán, čiastka dedičstva môjho a kalicha môjho, ty si, čo držíš poďtetoriôj. Povždy si kladiem Wna zoči-voči, a že je po pravici mojej, nezakolíšem sa. Zachoraj me, Bože, veď utiekam sa k tebe! Preto sa srdce moje raduje a plesá duša moja, ale aj telo moje bude odpočívať v bezpečí. Lebo ty nezant^cháš dušu moju v podsvetí, ty nedáš uzrieť porušenie svätému svojmu. Zachovaj ma, Bože, veď utiekam sa k iébet Ty ukážeš mi chodník života; pred tvárou tvojou plnosť radosti, rozkoše po pravici tvojej naveky. Zachovaj ma. Safe, veď utiekam sa k tebe! DRUHÉ ČÍTANIE Jedinou obetou natrvalo urobil dokonalými tých, čo sa dajú posvätiť Cítenie z Listu židom. - Vfetci kňazi deň po deň konajú bohoslužby a znova prinášajú tie isté obety, ktoré nemôžu odstrániť hriechy. On priniesol iba jednu obetu za hriechy a zasadol sl navždy po pravici Božej. Teraz už len čaká, kým mu Boh nepoloží nepriateľov pod nohy ako podnožku. Lebo jedl nou obetou natrvalo dokonalými tých, čo sa dajú posvätiť. Keď sú však tieto odpustené, netreba už obiet za hriechy. Počuli sme slovo Pánovo. PRÍPRAVA NA EVANJELIUM Pána 1000, boli, čo si mysleli, že tn istotne bude rok. kedy bude koniec sveta. Keď sa ale nič -nestalo, nuž sl títo zvedavci odkladali svoje predpovede na neskoršie roky...

Zabúdajú, že Boh 1e Pán aj časnosti a aj večnosti, že len On Jediný rozhodne, kedy skonči sc svetom, ktorý si stvoril. Túto pravdu podopiera oj Slovo Božte tejto nedele. Hovorí, Že Ježi5, Vzkriesený Víťaz, ozdoliený svojimi oslávenými ranami, ktoré utrpel pre naše hriechy a za naše spasenie. Že zas príde. Potom už smrti viac nebude. Sírne tejto uravde, dôverujme Ježišovi a neustále žime v nádeji očakávania. í :AltíuJa:) Bedlíte a modlite sa u kíiädom čase, aby ste mohli suírpred Iváron Syna človeka. (:Aleluja:) EVANJELIUM Zhromaždi svojich vyvoleních od Štyroch svetových strán čítanie zo svätého evanjelia podľa Marka. — V tom čase povedal Ježíš svojim učeníkom: V tých dňoch, po onom súžení, slnko sa zatmie a mesiac nevitie svetlo. Hviezdy budú padať z neba a nebeské mocnosti sa budú triasť. Vtedy uvidia Syna človeka prichádzať na oblakoch s veľkou mocou a slávou. A vtedy vyšle anjelov a súiromaždi svojich vyvolených od štyroch svetových strán, od konca zeme až po kraj neba. Od flgovníka sa naučtej-pedobenstvu! Keď Jeho, ratolesť mladne a vyháňa lístie, viete; ?a blízko je leto. Tak aj vy, keď uvidíte, že sa tieto vecí dejú, vedzte, že je blízko — vo dverách. Veru, hovorím vám, nepominie sa toto pokolenie, kým sa všetky tieto veci nestanú. Nebo a zem sa pominú, ale slová moje sa nepominú. O tom dni však alebo hodine nikto nevie, ani anjeli v nebi, ani Syn, Iba Otec. Počuli sme slovo Pánovo. MODLITBY -VERIACICH Bratia a sestry, v tejto spoločnej modlitbe celou dušou a celým srdcom pokorne prosme ••šemohúceho Boba: • Za biskupov a kňazov: — aby ich Duch Svätý posilňoval svojimi darmi, žeby mohli účinne viesť Boží ľud k svätosti, prosme Pána. • Za všetkých veriacich- — aby sa tak správali v živote, žeby sa mohli predstaviť pred Kriste, sudcu živých l mŕtvych, s hojným ovocím dobrých skutkov, prosme Pána • Za tých, čo opustili cestu spásy: — aby využili Čas, ktorý im milosrdný Boh dal, ku kaj ícnosti a k návratu, prosme Pána. • Za nás všetkých: — aby nás myšlienka na vzkriesenie mŕtvych a večnú slávu povzbudzovala ku kresťanskej horlivosti, prosme Pána. Bože, ty sl nás sviatosťou krstu ^členil do Kristovho tajomného tela a sviatosťou pokánia nás očisťuješ posväcuješ; prijmi vďaku za tieto svolp dary a posilňuj nás, aby sme tl, spojení s Kristom, verne slúžili. Skrze Krista, nášho Pána. A SMRTI UŽ VIAC NEBUDE "A vtedy si shromáždi sroňch vyvolených.. " (Mk 13, 26) Akn Často Kme už počuli výroky, že koniec sveta je už predo dvermi. Ľudstvo táto otá?ta vždy zaujímala. Keď sa blížil rok Matka Tereza im to povedala Tento -vek možno nazvať vekom najvyššieho pokroku. No zo stránky morálnej je to apokalyptická doba Nemravnosť a cyniánus dosiahli najvyšší horizont. Dnes ľudstvo oplakáva plynové komory <a celkom oprávnene), no svedkami sme vraždenia nenarodených detí a nik sa nepohoršuje. Aký cynizmus! Vrahom detí pripínajú prostitútky červené ruže na kabát a to všetko v mene oslobodenia ženy. Ak sa pod slobodou ženy má rozumieť, že môže slobodne zabíjať nenarodené dieťa, to Je potom smutné ovocie íiherallzmu. A najviac ešte, moje a vaše dane majú tieto vraždy napomáhať. V rámci slobody a demokracie. Keď som pred pár rokmi písal o potratoch, Istá horúca frsternsJistka ma nazvsla "male shovinisť*. Vraj to je vecou ženy a jej slobodný. Bohužiaľ, dnes sme svedkami, že aj niektoré cirkevné organizácie tvrdla. 2e aktívni homosexuáli majú právo na kňazskú hodnosť. Smutné štatistiky sa skôr zakrývajú, než by sa mali zverejňovať. Z< obavy, aby sa nestrácali potenciálni voliči. A tu prichádza Matka Tereza do Kanady a z celého hrdla vyhlasuje, že potrat je zlo a že krkavčlu matku i toho, kto Jej pri potrate pomáha treba trestne stíhať. Neslýchané v očiach skazeného svete, ale spravodlivé a opovážlivé v očiach tej, ktorá sa bojí karhať zlo, ako to robil kedysi Ján Krstiteľ. Ak sa na svete neobráti, "moderná" spoločnosť ide v ústrety svojmu kon- 0U. Ide o to, ako sa my, kresťanská väčšina, k tomu všetkému postavíme. Alebo, že by sme pre pohodlie ostali neutrálni? S. K. (Kanadský Slovák) 1. A smrti už viac nebude. Smrť Je tajomstvo, lebo kto ňou prešiel, ešte sa nevrátil, aby nám o nej niečo povedal. Len jeden sa vrátil a to bol Ježiš, Vzkriesený Spasiteľ. Ježiš nám povedal, že smrť Je tvrdá a neodvratná skutočnosť, že každý, kto sa narodil, musí zomrieť. Pán Boh predsa stvoril človeka pre seba, aby sme s nim žili na veky. Keď ale človek zhrešil, musí zomrieť. Smrť je trest za hriech človeka. Ježiš, Syn Boží ale prišiel na svet, aby nás zachránil od večnej amrtí. Preto pia toho, kto sa snaží žiť dľa vôle Božej, pre neho je smrť skutok lásky a radosti. Co ako by mu bola smrť trpká, svätec vie, Že ho v nebi očakáva nebeský Otec, že stretne svoju Lásku, Ježiša a že už viac neumře, lebo bude v Jeho Láske na veky. Tuto pravdu zdôraznili aj cirkevní otcovia 2. vatikánskeho snemu, keď vo svojej konštitúcii o cirkvi (49) hovoria, že keď: ’'Syn človeka piíde vo svojej velebnosti, že vtedy bude zničená smrť a všetko mu bude podrobené." (I Kor, U, 25-27) Prorok Daniel v prvom čítaní (Dan 12, 1-3) hovorí o příchode Pána na konci sveta v rôznych apokaliptických obrazoch Bude bo vraj sprevádzať Michal Archanjel, vodca nebeských mocností. čas druhého príchodu Pána bude "čas úzskostí". Budú to vojny, hlad, zemetrasenia, choroby a rôzne iné navštívenia svetového rozsahu. V tom čase tí, čo "budú zapísaní do knihy života", teda čo žili bohabojné, budú oslobodení. Ba aj mnohí mŕtvi vstanú: ''Niektorí na večný život, Iní na hanbu ako lesk oblohy". Tí, čo príkladom svojho čnostného života aj iných’’ "priviedli k spravodlivosti ', budú sa skvieť ako hviezdy na več- né veky”, V príbehu dnešného sv. evanjelia (Mk 13, 24-32) Pán Ježiš tiež hovorí o svojom druhom príchode. Používa tiež rôzne apo- kallpttcké výrazy. Hovorí však jasne, aby nikto nepochyboval. že On zas naozaj príde Naznačil aj niektoré príznaky, ktoré budú príchod predchádzať. Bude to vraj veľké "súženie" na celom svete, rôzne choroby, navštívenia, hlad, mor, zemetrasenie, ktoré Pán dopustí, aby sa svet vzpamätal. Pán Ježiš hovorí: “Keď toto všetko uvidíte, vedzte, že som už blízko." Keď potom príde "vyšle anjelov, ktorí ?hromaádfa vyvolených od štyroch svetových strán", aby f ním žil । na veky. Budú, čo si budú chcieť nahovoriť, že ša toto všetko nestane, že sú to len obrazné slová. Pán Ježiš ích varuje: “Nebc a sem pominú, ale jeho slová sa nepominú." Teda Pán Ježiš príde, a| keď' pomýlenci nebudú očakávať a príde, aj keď o jeho dni a hodine nikto Iný nevie" "iba nebeský Otec". Rozumné človek si dľa tejto pravdy zariadi celý život, Pre neho už smrti viac nebude, lebo bude žiť s tým, ktorý je život večný, s Ježišom. 2. Dôverujme Ježišovi a neustále ho očakávajme! Nech by nám pravda o druhom príchode Pána Ježiša bola ako nepríjemná, to nič na samej pravde nezmení Pán Boh nám totiž o Jeho pravdách nikdy a nikde nedal príležitosť, aby sme o tej ktorej Jeho pravde hlasovali, čí sa nám páči a či nie. To sa dá len o pravdách tohoto sveta. O pravdách tohoto sveta, ak nám to pravda vláda dovolí, hlasujem? b príjmame ju, alebo nepríj- mame. No, Božte pravdy sú večné a nezmeniteľné, ako je aj sám Pán Boh večný a nezmeniteľný. Pán Boh nám pravdu o druhom príchode svojho Syna, Ježiša dostatočne zjavil a vzkriesenie Ježišovo je zárukou, že sa to všetko stane, ako nám to sv evanjelia hovoria. Dôverujme teda Ježišovi a neustále ho očakávajme, aby nás našiel pripravených. V druhom čítaní tejto sv. omše (Zld 10, 11-14) nám sv Pavol hovorí, že nám nebeský Otec vo svojom Synovi Ježišovi k našej príprave na jeho druhý príchod zásadne pomohol Nielen, že nám pravdu o Jeho druhom príchode oznámil, ale nás "svojou obeťou za naše hriechy" posvätil, aby sme už odteraz tak žili, že ho vřete očakávame. Veď v týchto posledných chvíľach, pred svojím druhým príchodom, Ježiš už len čaká "kým mu Boh nepodloží Jeho nepriateľov pod nohy”. Je pravda, mocnosti tmy, teda nepriatelir. Kristovi dnes, vo svojej pýche vládnu svetom, zúria, lebo nemajú nádeje. No, víťazstvo Ježišovo sa začalo Jeho zmŕtvychvstaním r skonči sa, keď zase príde. Príznaky Pánovho druhého príchodu, ako o nich čítame vo sv. evanjeliu, sú už tu. "Súženia", ako hlad, vojny, prenasledovania, triedna nenávist', sa stupňujú. Ba a) "hviezdy" z neba padajú... Tieto slová hovoria o hroznom duševnom úpadku sveta. Svet sa kazí, manželstvá sa rozvádzajú, krvožižnivé matky vraždia svoje nenarodenlatka bez hanby.,. kňazi a rehoľnlce, ba aj biskupi, pre rozkoše opúšťajú "oblohu", aby už nesvietili iným... Toto všetko hovcri, že Pán je blízko! My, ktorí dôverujeme Ježišovi, večnej a neomylnej Pravde, neustále žijeme tejto pravde, uby sme vždy boli v láske Otcovej. Veď v tomto práve spočíva tragédia tých, čo sa boja druhého príchodu Pánovho. My ale, ktorí sa snažíme stále žiť, ako diet- ky Božie, nás myšlienka na druhý príchod Ježišov neprestra- šuje, ale skôr potešuje. Ak by nás táto myšlienka znepokojovala, to by znamenalo, že to v našom duševnom živote niečo neni v poriadku. Vo svetle druhého príchodu Kristovho má všetko v našom živote večnú hodnotu. Všetko sebazaprenie, lopotenie, práce a ťažkostí života, v domácností i na pracovisku... má zmysel len vtedy, ak denne obstojíme pred tvárou Krista. lebo ak aj niečo musíme znášať, musí sa to odzrkadľovať v kríži Kristovom. Za krížom Je vždy zmŕtvychvstanie, naša nádej e istota víťazstva. Naše horúce sv. prijímanie je najlepšou prípravou na deň, kedy sl Pán "zromaždí svojich vyvolených" k súdu. Snažme sa, aby sme boli stále medzi nich pripočítaní. Prosme vzkrieseného Víťaza, Ježiša často slovami medztspevu tejto sv. omše: "Zachovaj ma. Bože, veď sa utiekam k Tebe", (Ž15) ktorý sl SLOVO BOŽIE [pageend10]JEDNOTA.

DESAT ROKOV PONTIFIKÁTU JANA PAVLA H (1S. októbra 1BS8J Fred destatkni rokmi — 18 októbra 1970 — bol zvolený za pápeža krakovský arcibiskup kardinál Karol Wojtyla, ktorý si vyvolil mano Ján Pavol II. Táto udalosť bola hneď od začiatku podivná a neprestáva byť takou ani dnes po desiatich rokoch. Po prvý raz, po 450 rokoch bol zvolený za pápeža ne-TaĽan. Po prvý raz Poľsko, krajina pod komunistickým režimom a slovanský svet dal Cirkví pápeža zo svojho prostredia. Vtedy sa ešte nevedelo, akým smerom sa bude uberať Jeho pontifikát. Rímu a svetu sa predstavil ako muž “z ďalekej krajiny”: "Bál som sa prijať túto voľbu — úprimne sa priznal — ale som sa jej podrobil v duchu poslušnosti voči Pánu Ježišovi a v úplnej oddanosti jeho presvätej Matke, Panne Márií.“ Hneď si získal sympatiu Talianov, keď povedal: beriem, či sa dobra vyjadrujem vd vašej... či našej talianskej reči. Ak sa pomýlim, vy ma opravíte ■. > A takto vám všetkým predstavujem, aby som vyznaj našu spoločnú vieru, našu tvíde}, našu dôveru v Matku Ježiša Krista a Jeho Cirkev, pričom počítam s Božou pomocou a b pomocou dobrých ľudí.. Keď sa stretol s kardinálom Wyszynským, tento mu povedal: "AJ keď sedíš na Petrovom stolci, ostávaš navždy poľským blskupom. Kľačíačky ťa uisťujem, že vždy budeme duchovne pri tebe a budeme ťa posilňovať svojimi modlitbami.“ Nový pápež mu odpovedal: “Nebol by snm tu bez tvojej viery, ktorá Décúvkľ W Tpreď utrpanímrsni • pred; žal árom.’*- V prvom príhovore ku kardinálom nový pápež povedal: "Skutočnosť voľby možno prijať s vnútorným uspokojením lot vo svetle viery. Z vašej strany bolo treba veľa odvahy a dôvery. Som hlboko vďačný pápežovi Pavlovi VI. za rozšírenie kardinálskeho zboru a za m«bdnárodný ráz, ktorý mu dal...“ Tieto udalosti a slová na začiatku pontifikátu skrývajú akoby v semieaku všetko, čo za desať rokov vyrástlo a dozrelo v pápežovom živote. Nie je ľahko stručne zachytiť všetky charakteristická črty pontifikátu tohto prvého poľského a slovanského pápeža. Talianska revue ta Civiltá Catiolloa na prvom mieste spomína výrok sv. Pavla: “Beda mt, ak by som neohlasoval evanjelium“, ktorý si osvojil tento pápež a tak sa stal neúnavným ohlasovateľom viery tak medzi kresťanmi, aby ich posilnil vo viere, ktorú už vyznávajú, akc aj medzi nekresťanskými národnú, aby im prinieslo radostné posolstvo o smrti a vzkriesení Ježiša Kriste, Prejavom tejto misijnej sterortlivosti sú dnes už povestní apoätol- ské cesty do celého sveta. Doteraz ich urobil už 40 mimo Talianska, a neprejavuje nijakú túžbu zakončiť ich, 1 keď mu roky pribúdajú a telesné ally aa umenšujú Plánuje ďalšie “apoštolské cesty“ do budúc- DQeti, čo aj našim veriacim dodáva nádeje, že príde ohvfľs, keď aj lah navštívi, Tento mísi/nŕ pápež sa na svojich cestách stretáva so svetom, ktorý Je rozdelený: na Jednej strane je Cirkev a kresťanstvo, ktoré on predstavuje a na druhej Je moderný svet, stále viac ovládaný materialistickým a ateistickým sekularizmom. Kontrast medzi týmito dvoma svetmi sa vyostruje hlavne v troch oblsstisciu v oblasti hodnoty ľudského živeta, v oblasti sexuálnej etiky a v oblasti manželskej a rodinnej morálky. Ján Pavol n. svojim apoštoísJrýtD prianím je nútený postaviť sa zotH-voSl tomuto svetu Je známe, s akou energiou a pevnosťou sa zasadzuje tento pápež za hodnotu ľudského života a vystu- puje proti potratu a vražde nenarodených. Vyhlasuje to za ťažké zločiny proti Bohu, ktorý Je jediným pánom ľudského života a proti človekovi, ktorý má ako prvé a neodškriepiteľné právo práve na ävot. Medzi "ľudské práva" vždy uzatvára aj právo na život ešte nenarodeného dieťaťa v matkinom lone. Z vernosti Bohu vyplýva pre Cirkev povinnosť, aby vždy stála na strane človeka. Preto v neoblomnej obrane človeka a “ľudských práv" Ján Pavol II, vyjadruje vernosť Bohu, Cirkvi a evanjeliu. Keď pred niekoľkými rokmi navštívil Assisi, mesto svátého Františka, medzi hlasmi -zástupov na uliciach, volajúcich: “Nech žije pápež“ sa ozval aj ojedinelý tichší hlas: “Nech žije umlčaná Cirkev”; pápež ho začul a pohotové odpovedal: "Umlčaná Cirkev už nemlčí, lebo hovorí ústami pápeža." V živote sú určite veci, ktoré ľudia pochopia len vtedy, keď ich prežijú na v^stno-J koži. Aj pravda o ''umlčanej Cirkví'' ea zdá hlť jednou t nich, ľudia na Západe, žijúci v slobode, jednoducho nie sú schopní chápať “umlčanú Cirkev”. Iba takto sa dá vysvetliť rteobecný nezáujem o osud prenasledovaných v toľ- Xřch krajinách. Súcit je jedinou pravou mravnou pohnútkou tým, íe berie pod ochranu I zvieratá. — Schopenhauer Sluší sa, aby každý Človek mal sa kde uchýliť, kde by i s ním mali zľutovanie. — Postojevakij Tvoj osud spočíva T tvojom vlastnom nútri. — Schiller Ján Pavol íl. sa skutočne stal hlasom “umlčanej Cirkvi", L keď sa to slovo už tak často neužíva ako pred rekrpi. "Nesmieme nikdy zabúdať na tých, ktorí platia za svoju vwnoeť Kristovmu kráľovstvu diskrimináciou, súdmi, utrpením, ba i smrťou... Cirkev aj v dnešných časoch píše svoje mar- tyrológlum vlastnou krvou; p<še zoznam vždy nových a súčasných mučeníkov za vieru... Nesmlerre na nich zabúdaťl”’ Na- o bbJ, umlčaná Cirkev už nemlčí, lebo hovorí ústami pápeža. Ďalšou charakteristickou črtou pontifikátu Jána Pavla n. Je Jeho neúnavné úsilie o zjednotenie kresťanstva. Svojim spo- tupr&oöynikom sa zdôvuríh "Od samého začiatku môjho pontifikátu ekumenismus Je mojou hlavnou starostlivosťou." Na to poukazujú toľké stretnutia s oddelenými bratmi & sestrami a toľké príhovory za obnovenie stratenej jednoty kresťanstva. Ján Pavol II. tiež zdôrazňuje "kresťanské korene Európy" a potrebu obnovenia Jej duchovnej jednoty, ďalej uskutočňovania správne chápaných smerníc n. vatikánskeho koncilu, lásku k Cirkvi a k Matke Cirkvi k Panne Márii a úprimný záujem o mládež. Tento slovanský pápež ie úplnou novotou tohto pontifikátu Jeho osobný vzťah k novinárom a je veľmi blízky všetkým slovanským národom, aj nám, Slovákom. Viackrát to dokázal, hlavne svojou návštevou v Slovenskom ústave svätého Cyrila a Metoda a na nedávnej audiencii vo Vatikáne, keď skupine vyše 500 Slovákov a Sloveniek povedal nezabudnuteľné ♦tort André Frossard, novinár, konvertita a člen Francii wurej akadémie, ktorého novú knihu ‘Tortrrt Jána Pavla II." oznámil parížsky dennfk Le Monds utorok 11. októbra, Jána Pavla n. charakterizoval slovami: “Modli sa tak, ako dýcha.“ Azda najlepší spôsob zhrnúť charakteristické črty pontifikátu.

Policy is made by a board of cardinals and bishops Most at them reside in Rome, while ethers come from dioceses on every continent for occa- sorai plenary sessions. The highest policy decisions are presented to the Holy Father lor his personal study and approval Last November al a meeting in Washington we determined which congregations we wished to vsl Now. as our Roman stay began, we fixed on the points we wished to discuss with Iheir officials, and the order m which we wanted to pie- sent these points. Then we welcomed Archbishop John P Foley of Philadelphia, president of the Pontifical Commission lor Soc>a’ Communications. He briefed us on how ihe Holy See relates io ihe electronic media pointing out that some exceptional coverage ol papal ceremonies is not carried m the United States by commercial television However.be told us. these live telecasts are now available by satellite through the Eternal Word Television Network earned on a growing number of cable systems in the Diocese ot Harrisburg Belote our official meetings began. other activities were placed on the schedule. For example, we visited the Pauime Chapel in the Apostolic Palace, where Michelangelo's last great paintings dramatically depict the martyrdoms ol Sts. Peter and Paul We emerged Irom the chapel, guided by an artist from the Vatican Museums staff, to pause in.the entry haN to the Sistine ChapeL There we viewed great murals, now several hundred years old, depicting battles in which the fate ol European ervifeatien and Christian larvis seemed to hang in the balance Such lor example was the Battle ol Lepanto (1571). in which the-oceai armada of the Muslim TurRsj^s defeated even as prayers of petition rase throughout Europe at the request of Pope St Pius V. • Then as the last crowds of the morning were ushered out of the adjoining Sistine Chapel, we were led in lo gaze on the new splendor of the ceiling. Most of Michelangelo's panels illustrating Ihe Genesis account of Creation have been cleaned and now glow with a splendor of the original brilliant colors, in a matter of months the final scenes will be fully revealed and the experts will turn to the Last Judgement. which lakes up an entire wan behind the altar. Thus, m five years or so the chapel, already considered the setting ol the greatest masterpieces of Renaissance an. will be restored. 11 will regain a splendor it has not known lor some 4C0 years, when coats of varnish and an accumulation ot gnme and soot began to dm ihe lines and colors which came from the brushes ol Michelango and other great masters On Sunday.

Broad Street, Philadelphia, PA 18102 By Daniel F- Tanzooe President» Slovak Lessee of America October 28, 1988 marked the 70th anniversary ol the independence of Czecho-SIovakia. It was on October 28, 1918 that the histone Czech regions of Bohemia and Moravia joined with Slovakia in pre- cfaiming the independence of the new state composed of two kindred peoples, the Slovaks and the Czechs. It was to be a marriage, a partnership, a sharing ot equals. The seven decades of the life of Czecho-Slovakia have proven at times beneficial to both the Slovaks and Czechs and at times beneficial only to the Czechs. Certainly the new republic was an opportunity for history to free two subject peoples who had endured centuries of oppression at the hands of the ^aps- burgs We here in America have always taken a keen interest in the life of this country. Npt only because it is me homeland of hundreds of thousands of Slovak American families, but also because the concept of freedom and liberty as experienced in the United States became a rallying point for the creation of the new state. The early Slovak immigrants who settled in the United States joined their Czech counterparts here and together sought Ihe freedom of the Czechs and Slovaks at home. With the enthusiastic support of Ihe Wilson administration, ihe United States offered its wholehearted cooperation in the creation of the new state, along with other newly emerged states following ihe collapse of the old Austro-Hungarian empire in 1918. During World War 1. Slovak and Czech Americans formed the Czecho-Slovak Legionnaires to fight on the side ol the Allies on several fronts in the European conflict. Slovak organizations banded together under the banner of Ihe Slovak League of America and together with the representatives ol the Czech American organizations met with Thomas G Masaryk, flrsl president of the new naiion. to discuss the fate of Slovakia within the new stale’s framework Masaryk agreed with Slovak American aspirations for full equality lor Slovakia and signed the Pittsburgh Agreement, which was to guarantee autonomy lor Slovakia But this was nol to be in the first republic While Ihe Slovaks found themselves in a much better economic situation in the new republic, they suddenly realized lhal the Czechs had replaced the Hungarians as their new overlords Czechs streamed into Slovakia and look almost complete control ol the major m- stiiutioris of the nation — education, industry, government. When the new state was created, the name Czecho-SIpvakia was spelled with the hyphen to indicate the equality of Slovakia. Suddenly after 1920 ihe hyphen disappeared and a new so-called ’’Czechoslovak" nation, culture, etc., appeared Edward Benes' philosophy of making the Slovaks Into Czechoslovaks but keeping Czechs as Czechs became prominent. He even gave the Western nations the illusion ol a Czechoslovak language It was this "Czechoslovakism" that continued to discourage Slovaks' active support of the nation. Autonomy, which had been promised in 1918 by Thomas G. Masaryk, came at the final hour in 1938. before the destruction of the second Czecho-Slovak Republic. The birth of the Slovak Republic on March 14.1939 was hailed. Why wouldn’t it be hailed’ For the first Determine Fate of Detroit Parishes DETROIT (NC) — On the eve of hearings to determine the fate ol Detroit parishes, a group dI Calhpbcs scheduled fasls and days ol prayer and written tetters asking for "a time ol grace" and collaboration before changes are made. The archdiocese announced plans Sept. 28 to close, merge I or redesignate as a shrine or mission almost 40 percent of Detrat parishes Hearings to review the status of Ihe 46 parishes were to begin in early November. Thirty-five pastors have written Cardinal Edmund C. Szoka of Detroit and Auxiliary Bishop Patrick Cooney seeking "a conversation with vou in regard lo our common ministry in ihe city." ■ Working Together for Peace VATICAN CITY (NC) — Pope John Paul 11 urged Christians and Moslems to set an example to the world by meeting and working together for peace. The popa spoke at the Vatican to a group of religious leaders from six Norin African countries They were in Italy to make the second anniversary of the interreligious day ot prayer in Assisi, Italy. The pope noted that the group, which included Christians and Moslems, had planned Iheir visit together, traveled together and lived together in Assisi for several days. He said they would return home with a "common purpose " time Slovakia appeared on the face of maps: for Ihe first lime. Slovaks represented Slovak interests tor the Irrst time. Slovaks were masters of their own destiny. Unfortunately, the Slovak RepuWic had lies to Hitler s Germany. While we could not condone such association, we cannot fail to see the justice in the rights ol Ihe Slovaks to their own state. With ihe end of World War II, Slovakia was again incorporated in | the "Czechoslovak" Republic, again without the hyphen and wrthoui autonomy. The Slovaks were never consulted, but merely re-joined to the umbilical oord of ’ Prague. When the Communists took control of Czecho-Slovakia m 1948. it must be remembered that Ihey, together with Ihe Marxist Socialists. received a majority of votes only in the Czech lands. In Slovakia, they were soundly defeated. Of course, when one considers Ihe fact thai Slovakia is but one third ol ,> the state, the Communists were victorious The years of Communist Czechoslovakia have proven another sad chapter in the life of the Slovaks and the Czechs. Until Ihe institutions doseď to the Slovaks and Czechs, especially Ihe Catholic Church, ate freed from the chains of the Communists only then can we Americans look more favorably on Ihe state. How can Slovaks celebrate a slale where their identity is clouded? Slovak artists and writers are classified as "Czechs” here in the West Even with the new federal constitution creating the Czech and Slovak Socialist Republics in 1970. Slovaks in Bratislava must slili consul! Prague regarding Slovakia. When some of our clerical leaders here in America sought visas recently, they were told that Bratislava would welcome them but Prague fell otherwise When we express such sentiments. many Czechs consider us as separatists Here in America there are a handful of so-callec Czechoslovaks who would condemn our philosophy They are a group ol aged followers ol the Benes philosophy, who have not consulted Slovaks in years. One need only visit Slovakia or speak with recently arrived Slovaks to see that they feel themselves as second-class citizens in Czechoslovakia This is not what was envisioned in 1918. When the hyphen returns, when Slovaks can decide their Own fate m Slovakia without consulting Prague. When Slovak Americans are free to travel to Slovakia without the opposition of Czech leaders in Prague, then perhaps we will wholeheartedly champion ihe Czecho-Slovak Republic. As such, we here in America can B not choose the form of government ' for ihe Slovaks in Slovakia it is their right lo do sc. Until such lime as a tree plebiscite or free elections can be held In Slovakia, only then will the late ol the Slovaks be outlined It Ihey choose lo remain within the Czecho slovak framework, we will support their aspirations However, should they choose independence, then we would support such a course ol action , As we commemorate Ihe 7Q(h t anniversary ot the Czecho-Slovak * Republic, we can recall and reflect on the history of this state, which was Porn with such enthusiasm and potential but which suffered so many internal flaws. We look forward to the day when Slovaks and Czechs can enjoy Ihe same freedoms, which we enjoy as citizens of the United Stales and Canada. [pageend12]
