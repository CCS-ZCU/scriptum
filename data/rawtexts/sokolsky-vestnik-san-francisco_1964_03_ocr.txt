MANAGEMENT! A SINCERE!! THANK YOU!! TO THOSE WHO LABOR UNNOTICED To the faithful Sokols and Sokolice, who assume almost automatically the hard thankless minor roles. Without a command they go to the particular task they have been performing for years. They sell tickets—decorate the halls — sell refreshments— stay up nights to figure out better ways to do their own particular job. You see them again and again, laboring in the kitchens, eager, enthusiastic, happy. Where do they come from, who are they? They are a cross-section of SOKOLS and SOKOLKY. The tie that binds them and gives them the sparkle of real achieve' ments, is the knowledge that they are serving a magnificent ideal. This public acknowledgment of your unfailing loyalty and devotion is well earned. All of you have our respect, our love. We are happy to call you ! sestro Sokolko, bratre Sokole. Continue in your great work, you are an unfailing inspiration to us. THANKS, THANKS AGAIN. NAZDAR! SOKOL and SOKOLICE SAN FRANCISCO JOIN THE SOKOL [pageend4]
