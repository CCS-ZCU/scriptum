[pageend1]SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO VĚSTNÍK NOVEMBER - DECEMBER, 1987 PAGE 2. IN MEMORY OF GEORGE SPÁNEK Brother George Spánek was born in Hostivař, Czechoslovakia, February 10, 1903. George's father Antonin was a house painter, and he and his wife, Katerina, were devoted parents and dedicated Sokol members. When George was 11 his father sent him to "Realne gymnasium" (higher education school) in Vršovice, where George was introduced to Czech literature, poetry, history, music and above all - taught to love his country. Br. Spánek recalled that this school greatly influenced his futuer direction. Although young George was a very bright student, his family did not have the finances to support him and four other children so he had to leave school after four years. From school he started apprenticeship as radio mechanic with Czech inventor Ludvik Ocenasek. Br. Spánek's parents were active gymnasts, and George followed them by attending classes from the age of five. In 1912 for the first time, he participated with other children at Hostivař Sokol in the VI Sokol Slet in Prague. He progressed quickly through the ranks of Sokol, and eventually was elected Nacelnik of his Unit. When his Sokol Unit performed in the VIII Sokol Slet in 1926, he lead over 200 members of all ages from his Sokol. The success at the Slet had not yet diminished in the hearts of the participants, when George surprised his Sokol Unit and his family by announcing that he was leaving his friends, his brothers, and his country for France. George was seeking better living conditions and more opportunities in France. His first steps into Paris led him, with gym uniform in hand, to Sokol Paris. After a few giant swings, he gained immediate respect of all his Sokol brothers. He remained in Paris for 26 years, and he offten recalled that Paris was a most successful and beautiful part of his active Sokol life. While in Paris, Br. Spánek met another active Sokol member - Anna Needermertl. The two became closely attached, and in 1929 when they took a trip to Mlada Boleslave in Czechoslovakia to visit Anna's parents, they decided to get married there. Soon dark clouds were rising from Germany where the Nazi party was gaining power under the leadership of Adolf Hitler. George Spánek and other countrymen immediately recognized the danger for Czechoslovakis and all of Europe, and started a compaign and fight against the rising threat to France. Br. George along with other patriotic Czechoslovaks fought with the "Czechoslovak Brigade". After the war, he returned to Paris, and in 1952 came to the United States. He settled in Chicago and became an active member of Sokol Slavsky, and was eventually elected president of this Sokol Unit. After ten years he left Chicago and moved to Burlingame, California to be close to his sons, George, Jr. and Denis. His active life here need not be pulicised as it is well known to all people of the Czechoslovak community in this area that George Spánek participated in all Czechoslovak events. After such events, he would send reports to Czechoslovak newspapers in Chicago and New York. In this way, our countrymen in other parts of America learned about Czech activities in San Francisco. He was recently awarded medals from Sokol Paris and by Sokol Organization in Exile for outstanding service to both organizations. George Spánek was very proud of these awards and received them with great satisfaction. Br. George Spánek has passed from this life, and he has left his mark. He has also left an unfinished dream for his fellow countrymen and Sokols to complete....A dream that the work toward a FREE CZECHOSLOVAKIA be carried on with the same pride and dedication as his- [pageend2]SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO VĚSTNÍK NOVEMBER - DECEMBER, 1987 PAGE 3 SAFE IN THE CITY Vladimir Kriz I am walking with my wife around Fishermans Wharf. Seagulls fly screaming over our heads, there are sounds of improvised music coming from the pier. We are in San Francisco- finally - we can now enjoy the view of sailboats by the Golden Gate and around Alcatraz, we can now experience what we were only reading about back in Czechoslovakia. Climbing streets, cable car rides, restful benches, cool breezes from the Pacific, all that we dreamt about, to be able to walk in this park without fear, tasting freedom of thought and action, so natural in United States and so unreachable in Eastern Europe, all this became reality. I left my country after 36 years of stressful attempts to survive, after 18 years as a writer, reporter, and cultural center coordinator, helplessly observing the brutal Russian invasion and total control of my country- a country that used to be called "Little America" because of its perfect democratic government between the two World Wars. I was helplessly standing by as the secret police took over, as my friends were dismissed from work, dislocated, imprisoned for failing to promote communism. I was forced to leave my position for showing a film about American astronauts landing on the moon, and I was excluded from lecturing in the Cultural Academy. As my situation was becoming less and less tolerable every day, I started to think of creative ways to leave. In 1975, I read a brief, sarcastic article in the newspaper that a new ministate- Hutt River Principality- was founded in Western Australia. This ministate, about 16 acres in size and 30 inhabitants, was declared independent by its selfdeclared prince, Leonard Casley- or Leonard I. Leonard named the members of his family ministers .of the new government, published stamps, printed his own money, and accepted immigrants. I was intrigued by Leonard's actions, and wished we could do the same in Czechoslovakia- make our own decisions without fear. I wrote to Leonard I asking for more information. He respond ed personally, and sent me his stamps and pictures of his state, located about 300 miles north of Perth. He also asked me to represent his state as the honorary consul. I agreed and became the first diplomat of the smallest state in the world. Prince Leonard I informed the president of Czechoslovakia about my official appointment. Our joy was mixed with fear. Many people wrote to me request ing information, and I was performing my "diplomatic" tasks in our kitchen- printing and mailing out requested materials, Continued on Page - [pageend3]SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO VĚSTNÍK NOVEMBER - DECEMBER, 1987 PAGE Continued from Page - corresponding with the prince, making appointments to represent the Hutt River Principality at official functions of other consulates. Soon after, the Czech secret police also became unduly interested, as we feared. My mail was being opened, my activities were investigated, finally all my letters were confiscated. I was interrogated, and my passport was taken again. Journals and newspapers were forbidden to publish my writings and the radio station would not broadcast my works. I lost my job and was unable to get another. My best friend and tutor, Professor Oldrich Tomek, died in jail in 1984- and I was told by the secret police that I will be "liquidated" the same way if I don't stop my "hostile activities". I got the idea to take an advantage of the last memento as the Hutt River Principality consul. I printed "diplomatic passports" for my wife and myself, hid them in the trunk of my SKODA 1962 car, and left for Romania. I showed my fresh Hutt River Principality passports to the Romanian customs and we were granted passage to Yugoslavia with all the courtesies due to a foreign diplomat. We crossed the border and rejoiced to be on our way to freedom, unaware that Yugoslavian customs would try to force us to go back to Romania. After some useless negotiations to let us go on, we got into the car pretending to go back, but instead we turned inland in a desperate attempt to get away from the border. I drove at top speed over the impossible country roads,the police were shooting a+ us, and our car overturned. We were captured, returned to the police station, handcuffed to the central heat element, interrogated without food or drink, and later transported to the jail. We spent two months in jail. Finally, thanks to the United Nations, we were sent to Austria although the Czech government requested our return. We left for the United States on July 23 aboard a Boeing 747 and we could glance at our country for the last time as we lifted from the airport in Vienna. We reached freedom the same day. Our lives changed- and we're grateful. -Vladimir Kriz is now learning English. His story was translated by Rose Mary Lavička.

President Liska reported on his progress in obtaining property owned by Sokol Seattle at the time the Unit was expelled from the District. On the advice of ASO, the board of officers is considering imposing a trusteeship over the property, with title to be held by ZUPA. However, there has been some discussion regarding the possibility of reviving the Seattle Unit. Br. President Liska will continue to investigate the alternatives and will keep us apprised. Sis. Cheri Riddle and Mary Falls presented the report on behalf of Sokol Fresno: since the last Zupa meeting, Sokol Fresno organized a picnic which drew over 100 people.

[pageend7]SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO VĚSTNÍK NOVEMBER - DECEMBER, 1987 PAGE 3 An American Thanksgiving The first national day of Thanksgiving was Thursday, November 26, 1789. It was proclaimed by President Washington, not in response to the bounties of the harvest but in gratitude for the establishment of the Constitution of the United States. However, Thanksgiving did not become an annual national holiday following the Washington proclamation. The second National Thanksgiving Proclamation was issued by President Lincoln, in 1863, designating that the last Thursday in November would be set aside for the entire nation to give thanks together that despite the Civil War things were not so bad for the country as they might have been. Lincoln said: “The year that is drawing to its close has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added which are of so extraordinary a nature that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever watchful providence of Almighty God... “Needful diversions of wealth and strength from the fields of peaceful industry to the national defense have not arrested the plow, the shuttle, or the ship... Population has steadily increased... “No human counsel hath devised, nor hath any mortal hand worked out these great things. They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God, who, while dealing with us in anger for our sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy. “It has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly, reverently, and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and one voice by the whole American people... by a day of Thanksgiving and praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens...” A Czech Thanksgiving (from "Czech Folklore”by Vladimir and Delores Kucera) Fraternal Herald, 1986 Thanksgiving is very much different in the Old Country than in America as it is celebrated in different ways and not only for one day. Every village in the Old Country celebrates Thanksgiving (posvícení - hody) on different Sundays, during the autumn, a custom many centuries old. It is interesting to note that Emperor Joseph II did try to simplify this situation and ordered Thanksgiving to be on one Sunday for all villages. He didn’t meet with complete favor and Thanksgiving is still celebrated the same as in the past; on different dates. He did meet with some success in respect to the old custom, in that he created a new form of unity in celebrating by establishing through his governmental order the creation of the so-called “Imperial Thanksgiving,” celebrated on one Sunday for all citizens in his Empire. Usually, Thanksgiving in the Old Country and in many small Czech settlements in America, is celebrated on the Sunday that their church honors its patron saint. For example: the church in Bee, Nebraska, is dedicated to St. Wenceslas. Therefore, this typical Czech town has its Thanksgiving on the day of St. Wenceslas, or the Sunday before. In the old days, the villagers weren’t satisfied with only one day of celebration, but, usually three days. It was a very large celebration. Prior to that day, baking koláče (in Moravia, buchty, a thinner type of koláče), and the men were busy butchering fresh pork and preparing the first wine of autumn. The villages were all cleaned thoroughly, cottages repainted and all repairs were made. It Happened In NOVEMBER On Nov. 5,1968 Shirley Chisholm became the first black woman elected to the House of Representatives. The first known “sit-down” strike in the United States was conducted at the Hormel Packing Company in Austin, Minn., in 1933, on Nov. 13. The first motorcycle was tested in Germany in 1885 on Nov. 10. Gottlieb Daimler’s son Paul tested his father’s latest invention, a motor bicycle. It had wooden wheels, iron tires, and a half horsepower engine. President Abraham Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address in 1863 on Nov. 19. On Nov. 21, 1620 the Mayflower Compact was written and signed, before passengers disembarked from the ship Mayflower anchored off Cape Cod. It was the first agreement for self-government put in force in North America. Some may find sources that say the Compact was signed Nov. 11. In 1752 Great Britain adopted the Gregorian Calendar, moving dates up ten days. November 25 — Thank goodness — Thanksgiving — a time to be grateful for many things, including the first real breather since school began. Nov. 30 — Author Jonathan Swift was born in 1667. His best known work is Gulliver’s Travels. [pageend8]SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO VESTNIK NOVEMBER - DECEMBER, 1987 PAGE Twas all night before Christmas when all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, in the hope that St. Nicholas soon would be there. St. Nicholas served as bishop of Myra in Asia Minor, in 300 A.D. he was famous for his generosity and people came to believe that any surprise gift came from him. In Czechoslovakia, as well as in some Western European countries, St. Nicholas Day is celebrated on Dec. 6th. According to tradition, on that day a man dressed in the rich robes of a bishop walks thru the villages and questions the children on their behavior during the past year. He is usually accompanied by an angel who carries a bag of presents and candy, fruit and nuts, and by a devil who brings switches and onions, potatoes and coal for the children who have been bad. Of course, all children everywhere profess to being good all year long, and because St. Nicholas is so believing and so good, most children are rewarded with only good things to eat and Let me refresh your memory of some Czech and Slovak traditions. Girls told their fortunes by putting a cherry twig in water on Dec. 4th, and if the twig blossomed before Christmas Eve, it meant she will marry sometime during the coming year. They floated nut shells with burning candles in bowls filled with water - or cut an apple in half and if the center resembled a star, your year would be blessed with health and happiness, but any other design meant ill health. Ah, how can we forget those mouth watering foods - Apple strudl which was always eaten with white coffee and Vánočka (a Christmas twist also referred to as houska) and listy or Boží Milosti, Celestial crusts which melted in your mouth like wisps of flavored merangue, and no Christmas Eve was complete without Černá Kuba, with pearl barley, mushrooms and parsley, and “Kapr Na Černo” - carp with black sauce made of prunes boiled in milk. After our stomachs were filled to capacity, we would gather round the Christmas tree which was trimmed with gilded walnuts and colored paper chains and home-made ornaments and popcorn strings and candles which, when lighted, were like stars in the sky to our young eyes. What wonderful memories - and many of them can be re-lived at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago where Marie Knez and her Czech language students make them come alive each year. This information was made available through the Czech Heritage Library and Museum through the courtesy of Curator Lillian Chorvat. Many years ago a cobbler and his wife lived in a cottage on the edge of a village in Austria. They had few possessions, but whatever they owned, they shared with others. Symbolic of this generosity and love of mankind was the lighted candle they placed in the window of their cottage. Over a period of years, war famine and destruction fell upon the little village - and through it all the cobbler and his wife suffered far less than the other villagers.......The Villagers said, “Let us put a candle in our window and see if that is the mysterious charm.” Now it happened that the first night a candle was lighted in the windows of every home, it was Christmas Eve, and before the first rays of the morning sun, a messenger rode into the village to bring the great new peace had come! That Christmas Day there was amazement and awe in the hearts of the humble villagers... And now many years later, this beautiful custom of placing lighted candles... on Christmas, has spread all over the world, sending forth a message of love, hope and cheer.

Wednesday, Oct. 7,1987 St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch Czech Hall to celebrate 100th anniversary with dances, food By Sean T. Kelly Staff Writer St. Paul’s Czechoslovakian community will celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Czech Hall in the city’s West End with a variety of activities Saturday and Sunday. The hall at 383 Michigan St., named for the Czechoslovakian Protective Society when its main portion was built in 1887, originally served immigrants from that part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Through the years, it has continued to serve their sons and daughters with ethnic dances, language courses and gymnastics — three of the main loves of the Czechoslovakian people. A centennial quilt now being assembled by their descendants also pays tribute to Antonin Dvorak, the famed Czech composer who visited the hall in 1893 while on a U.S. visit. “The building is in pretty good shape but we’ve had to do a lot of work to get it that way,” said Henry Jansen, chairman of the board of trustees of Sokol Minnesota, the building’s owner. The Sokol organization, named after the Czech word for falcon, took over operation of the building in 1978, Jansen said. The group’s work centers on gymnastics as a means to physical and mental health and on Czech culture, he said. The building, which was threatened with razing for possible redevelopment in the 1970s, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, he said. The Sokol group has since spent $175,000 to restore much of the building, including installing a new roof, tuck pointing of the brick exterior and insulated windows, he said. “We made many improvements on the storefront level, which now has the Continental Pantry restaurant,” he said. “We also purchased two adjoining lots for parking.” Still needed to be done are a new hardwood floor for the main hall, improvements to the stage and the addition of a library-museum on the third floor. “We have a number of ethnic and historical things we would like to exhibit and that people would like to see, but there hasn’t been a proper place for it,” he said. Another need is for an elevator to the upper two levels of the building to make those areas accessible to senior citizens and to the handicapped, he said. “Right now, we have only a bunch of steep steps going up to the main hall,” he said. The desired improvements, which the group hopes can be accomplished in the next few years, will cost $125,000 to $150,000, Jansen said. Lou Pavliček, a former gymnastics teacher at the hall, said the centennial celebration will include an open house and exhibit of the Czech Hall’s historical flags and artifacts from 1:30 to 4 p.m. Saturday. A flag ceremony, balloon release, time capsule placement, Czech dancing and music will be held from 2 to 4 p.m. in the parking lot adjoining the hall. Also, who's for making a quilt for a raffle? This would be a fun project as wel1 as very profitable. I'm will to make the first square. Wil YOU volunteer the next and the next and the next? Hurray! We're on our way!

This question is very often discussed in newspapers and magazines. We read that government offices, health departments, and businesses ask their employees to smoke only in designated areas. There are many reasons for it, but the important reason is health. At our last dance we posted - for the first time in recent years - "NO SMOKING" signs and requested that smokers use designated areas only. This problem has been discussed many times in the past, but until now people were not informed that smoking was no longer allowed in the main hall. We remember when Eduarda Igrise family performed at one of our affairs, and they requested that guests not smoke because the smoke made singing very difficult. We thank everyone for their cooperation and understanding and our Entertainment Committee promises evenings filled with good food, good fellowship, and good times.
