Under the dateline of Prague-Plzeží, November 7* it sent a letter addressed to Solidarity, Warsaw, in which it noted thst freedom-loving Poles, Czechs, and Slovaks must join together in their struggle for liberation. Two other documents were released on November 9 November 14» abridged versions of which are reproduced below. Letter to the Polish Embassy and the World Federation of Trade Unions in Prague On November 10, 1980, the Polish trade union movement Solidarity was legalized. The entire progressive world now remembers the second anniversary of that important event. Solidarity came into existence as the expression of a popular movement to defend the interests of the Polish working people, not as a protest against the Polish communist party or socialism in Poland. Seeking sooial renewal, the new, legal, independent, and self-governing labor organization quickly won respect as witnessed by its 10 million members. Its impact reaohed beyond the Polish border, and as a new and important peace initiative it was reoeived with hope by labor movements of all political persuasions, even including some oommunist parties. Solidarity’s abolition deferred onoe again the hope that reasonable and generally accepted sooio-politioal conditions would be established not only in Poland but also elsewhere 1 [pageend1]in Europe. The annulment of Solidarity’s legal status did not help to bring about a constructive dialogue at the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe presently convening agsin in Madrid. Charter 77 is concerned about a situation where the military, not the people, is the final decision-maker. This opens the gates to a repressive maohine preventing a political solution and gives preference to violenoe over prudent negotiation. The specter of the 195Os i3 back in the 1980s in Central Europe. Charter 77 regards it as its duty to draw the attention of all people of goodwill to this threat. Prague, November 9, 1982 Dr. Radim Palous, Anna MarvanovsT, Ladislav Lis, Charter 77 spokespersons; Jiri Dienstbier, Charter 77 collective member Declaration on the "Anonymity and Program" of the Preparatory Committee More than a year ago, the Preparatory Committee of Free Trade Unions in Czechoslovakia went public (Czechoslovak Newsletter,, Vol. VI, No. 7/8, July/August 1981)* Its existence was questioned at home and abroad. Issues were raised regarding its work and program, and particularly about who represents the Committee and why the names of its membership were not made publio. For the time being and probably for a while longer, we shall not publish names or details about the Committee* s endeavors for two reasons: 1. We consider now as most important unobtrusive social and promotional work. We do not seek publicity. We do not wish to be a sensation in our country but rather seek to explore ways on how to make it wholesome again. We value Charter 77 highly, but the fate of its signatories and their persecution are a warning to us. We wish to avoid a situation suoh as that involving the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted which has pondered the possibility of discontinuing its courageous efforts altogether. Our program was outlined in the declaration we msde last year. 2. As long as our country’s present political leadership will continue to regard, to its own detriment, any oritioal voice as hostile, we shall not publish the names of our Committee members. Our work would suffer and would probably be made impossible. In our published program we stated that we shall seek legal means to restore the health of the Revolutionary Trade Union Movement (ROH). We want the unions to become a genuine movement of the working people in Czechoslovakia, one that would defend their interests. A number of informal, spontaneously originating groups already exist in some factories and organizations. They follow critically the work of the [official] trade union officials. They watch the stagnating wages, the uneven soales, problems of work safety, and serious technological shortcomings. Such activities, such groups, can now exist and function only informally as cells linked by common interests. We wish to assist directly and indirectly all these informal groups and individuals who spontaneously try to revive and revitalize the trade union movement in Czechoslovakia. Prague, November 14, 1982 Preparatory Committee of Free Trade Unions [pageend2]Report on the Persecution of SRA Members The Council of Free Czechoslovakia received a report from Prague, dated July 4» 1982, on the detention and interrogation of SRA (Skupina revoluční akoe— Revolutionary Action Group) members., The report named 17 individuals, their occupations and addresses, who were arrested for interrogation in January and February 1982 and held incommunicado in the Ruzynb prison in Prague since that time* House searches were conducted in the homes of these persons. ”A large number of security agents and counterintelligence agents were involved in the roundup, which evidences the attempt by the polioe to show SRA links to other groups, especially opposition groups, in other socialist countries,” the report noted. Authorities have kept the affair secret. Among those arrested were Jan Wunsch, Vaclav Soukup, Jitka Tůmova7, and Josef Wunsch. They were indicted for sedition (Article 100 of the Penal Code), a oharge later changed to subversion (Article 98)• They were accused of distributing leaflets addressed to "Workers, Students, Citizens of Czechoslovakia,” calling for the support of Poland’s Solidarity. Interrogators were also trying to determine whether the group had participated in the samizdat activities of EDICE 84, an "independent association for printing and publication” (NSTl). Only three of those under investigation—Jan Wunsch, Jiri Wolf, and Frantisek Hrabal—8re Charter 77 signatories. The investigations covered Prague and the Bohemian towns of Jindřichův Hradec, Beroun, and Pardubice. About 100 persons are expected to be summoned as witnesses. Authorities are particularly interested in the SRA’s contacts with Polish activists, the Catholic Church, and the Polish KOR (Committee for the Defense of Workers). LETTER ON THE MADRID CONFERENCE Charter 77 issued a statement on the eve of the resumption of negotiations in Madrid addressed to the government of Czechoslovakia (Charter 77 Dooument No. 29/82). The following is an abridged version: We appeal to you on behalf of citizens who wish that our Czechoslovak government respect its signature of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (FA CSCE) and observe the obligations, principles, and norms of duly ratified international human rights pacts. Charter 77 was 3 response to the CSCE in Helsinki. Its wish is that the principles of the FA CSCE become part of our oountry’s reality. In his address to the United Nations General Assembly on October 7» 1982, the Czechoslovak minister of foreign affairs said that it is in the interest of our government that the forthcoming follow-up meeting in Madrid be conducted in the spirit of constructive dialogue, that it confirm the process of detente, and conclude as soon as possible by adopting a substantive and balanced final document. One cannot but agree. Charter 77 spokespersons expressed the same opinion in letters addressed to you on the eve of the Madrid conference on September 17, 1980, and before the resumption of the conference on February 22, 1981* As citizens of a oountry which paid dearly for ’’peace at any prioe,” we know that the word ”peaoe" is not unequivocal. It msy serve for the propaganda and 0over- up of great power expansionism, srrogant rule, and spiritual enslavement. It can be a label under which th© powerful conspire against the powerless. It msy also become [pageend3]4 an expression of resignation, surrender of human dignity, end sellout of human values in the name of self-preservation. When representatives of the Czechoslovak government speak of a balanced final document, it should contain principles of peaoeful cooperation as defined in the FA CSCE. This means that the participating governments should respect basic rights and freedoms of all their oitizens as promulgated in the General Declaration of Human Rights and other human rights paots. Past negotiations in Belgrade and Madrid evidenced disagreements among the participants. The word “peace” can beoome unequivocal not only when it signifies truce among nations but especially when it comes to mean freedom, human dignity, responsibility, and respect for truth within states. The position of the Czechoslovak delegation in Madrid and the credibility of the peace policy of our government would be greatly enhanced if a. Citizens were released from jail and the sentences quashed of those who called for the fulfillment of obligations contained in the FA CSCE since their alleged violations would not be found to be valid. Among others these citizens include the following: J. Ada'mek, J. Barta, R. Battek, V. Benda, 0. Bednářová', Z. Cerovsky, J. Duka, M. Frye, J. Gruntorád, V. Havel, R. Hlo^ánka, J. Hrabina, M. Hybek, Javorsky", I. Jirous, J. Krumpholc, J. Litomisky, Fr. LÍzna, D. Nemcova, P. Pospíchal, G. Povai a, G. Rompf, R. Smahel, Fr. Stárek, Dr. Trojan, P. Uhl, A. Zlatohlavy, eto. b. Criminal acts, police chicaneries, and job discrimination against oitizens and their families are halted. This concerns the following, among others; J. Belikovs', J. Dolista, J. Hijek, I. Havel, 0. Havlovs, engineer Holomek, J. Horeo, Z. Jioinsk/, E. Kantůrkovi, M. Kus/, K. Kyncl, L. Lis, V. Mai/, J. MJ-ynárik, J. Muller, J. Nemeo, Jan Rumi, Jiií Rumi, J. Savrda, J. Siklová, M. Šimečka, eto. c. The principal state organs meet their constitutional obligations according to Article 29 of our Constitution concerning the observation of the above principles and their violations. d. The federal assembly, the government, and the prosecutor general oonduct a re-examination of the applicable laws in the spirit of the FA CSCE and international human rights pacts, especially of the Penal Code and laws and regulations concerning the police, as well as of oourt and police practices. It would be useful if the prosecutor general and other oompetent authorities were to apply Chapter 6 of the Constitution dealing with the constitutional court that has never been activated. As was pointed out in earlier documents, e.g., Documents No. 15 (1978) and Nos. 12 and 22 (1982), Charter 77 is ready to cooperate in a constructive manner with the oompetent authorities in an effort to prove that Czechoslovakia is genuinely ready to contribute to the cause of peace and security in Europe and the world. Prague, October 22, 1982 Dr. Radim Palous, Anna Marvanová, Ladislav Lis, Charter 77 spokespersons; Prof. Dr. Jiří Hájek, Charter 77 member (Dr. V. Benda and R. Battik, Charter 77 spokespersons, are in jail) [pageend4]5 CHARTER 77 REPLIES TO ITS CRITICS An "open letter” was addressed in September 1982 by the ’’signatories of Charter 77” "not only to those who recently expressed well-meaning remarks on the activities of Charter 77 but also to all who are not indifferent to the cause of civic responsibility.” Below is its abridged text: Some well-intentioned criticism has been heard lately about past activities of Charter 77• Opinions were expressed that during its six years of existence Charter 77 has lived under the illusion that a dialogue with the power holders is possible and. that it is foolish to believe that authorities would respond to the Charter’s emphasis on respecting the laws. Charter 77 has not conducted a dialogue with an. anonymous power apparatus even when addressing its numerous documents to competent state authorities. It has aimed its dialogue at all citizens of our country. It is true that Charter 77 has placed its emphasis on legality regardless of how frivolously our authorities handle the laws. The original document of the Charter is a declaration in which its signatories pledged to stand for the oause of human and oivil rights; and human rights are psrt and parcel of human rights paots, of our Constitution, and other legally binding obligations. Charter 77 claims allegianoe to legality in a generally moral sense. Within the framework of the historically given legal system it advocates especially those provisions which our authorities prefer to overlook or try to interpret in a slanted way. It is therefore evident that Charter 77 does not harbor any illusion as to the actual state of affairs. It was also stated that Charter 77 is not ”enlightening” enough. Charter 77 is a community of individuals who raised their voices in the name of civic responsibility calling for legality, human values, decency, genuinely open criticism, the truthful reporting of news, and for justice of the unjustly prosecuted. To summarize, our critics maintain that Charter 77 is not enlightening enough. Others say it is too legalistic, while still others hold that it foolishly strives to engage those who wield power in a dialogue. We answer that the present situation does not offer opportunities for ’’stimulating” the masses even though we dare mention that the proper ethos is not lacking. Illegality cannot be opposed by violence in the spirit of the original Charter 77 document. Charter 77 defends legality, especially those parts of the legal system which are partly or entirely neglected by our executive power, that is, the parts whioh concern human and civic rights. And last but not least, Charter 77 does not maintain a dialogue with the oenters of power exclusively. Rather, it is directed in the first place to the conscience of every citizen. RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS A Document on the So-Called Obstruction of the Supervision of Churches An approximately 3,OOO-word-long dooument was prepared in Slovakia on the "so-called obstruction of the supervision of churches” aooording to Article 178 of the Czechoslovak Penal Code. Persons who ’’with the intent to obstruct and make difficult state supervision of churches and religious sooieties violate their economic security” may be sentenced up to two years in jail. Without specifying further details the article refers to Law No. 218/1949 as the basis of its implementation and to executive orders. [pageend5]6 Th© document provides specific examples of oases from the Czech and Slovak regions illustrating how the regime violates its own laws, including provisions of the Constitution, as well as international human rights pacts to persecute olergy and laymen. Billy Graham in Czechoslovakia The Vice Premier of the Federal Government, Matěj Lúcan, received in Prague American evangelist Billy Graham, who was on a speaking tour in Czechoslovakia at the beginning of November. According to Lidová demokracie of November 4» Mr. Lucan "reminded [Billy Graham] of the rich democratic and cultural heritage of Czechoslovakia [and] said that religious freedom is guaranteed by the Constitution and that 18 denominations have 8,000 houses of worship at their disposal and whose maintenance costs the state 200 million crowns annually.” Rudá právo of November 5 quoted Billy Graham as saying that "there is freedom for people to worship and to have services in their churches as guaranteed by the Constitution." The daily printed this quote in English. Perhaps Mr. Graham should explain. A Samizdat Report According to the Catholic samizdat magazine Informace o oirkvi, No. 10, 19&2, the struggle against the Church in Czechoslovakia is increasing. Homes are being searohed (ss happened in Bratislava, Žilina, and Vrutky recently), activists are interrogated and shadowed, the privacy of homes violated when their owners are away, and so on. New arrests have been reported. On August 13, the police held Helena Gondová in Bratislava. Her apartment was searched and she was accused of "dealing in precious metals and pornography." But instead of precious metals and pornography the search party led by Lt. Jakeli confiscated religious literature, probably the reason for Gondová* s arrest. A Catholic lay activist, 26-year-old construction worker Frantiáek Novajevsky, was arrested on August 30* He had planned to study theology but was rejected because he did not meet state polio© (StB) requirements, necessary for admission to the seminary. Because he made repeated attempts to join the seminary in subsequent years, he was questioned again and again and finally informed that he would be admitted if he "became á good patriot, alert against antisocialist elements among students." When Novajevsk/ declined the offer, the police began threatening him and they warned him not to study theology secretly. On August 30 he was arrested at the construction site where he worked. During a search of his home, 300 books and other personal belongings were confiscated. His place of detention is unknown. Police Interrogates Children The Counoil of Free Czechoslovakia received 8 report dated Ootober 11, 19^2, from Dolní Plaohtioe in Slovakia that fourth-grade children at the grammar sohool in Velky Křtíš were interrogated by state police (StB offioer Hoáala) on Ootober 6 because they had attended a Catholio mass end their parents had signed them up for religious instruction in the ohuroh. Three children—Kataríny Tothová, Milota Notová, and Anička Sulková—were shown photographs of a first communion celebration in 19&1 and 8sked to identify their parents. They were then questioned about the priest, prayer books, and other matters. They were finally asked to sign a statement whose oontent they did not know. Milota Notová refused and deolared that she would go [pageend6]7 to ohurch anyway. Offioer Horala also questioned Maria Siminová', a high school, student from Dolní Plaohioe, and warned her she would not be admitted to university if she refused to sign a prepared statement. Constructive Cooperation with Paoem in Terris The regime-sponsored association of the Catholic "peace priests,” Pacem in Terris, met in Brno on October 12 under , the slogan—as Rude" prévo put it—’’Struggle for Peace and Against Nuclear Catastrophe in the Light of the Second Vatican Council.” (The Vatican characterized the association as ’’political"—Czechoslovak Newsletter, Vol. VII, No. 9/10» September/October 1982.) The main speaker 8t the meeting was M. Klusak, minister of oulture of the Czech Socialist Republic, who attacked the Vatican and the United States. He defended the association as "nonpolitical" in a highly political speech (Katoliok^ noviny, October 31, I982). He attacked "imperialism” which under the guidance of the Reagan administration he charged with using "methods of pressure, violence, aggression, barbarism, and genocide wherever circumstances warrant." He accused the Vatican of forbidding Czechoslovak Catholic dignitaries from attending a religious world congress in Moscow last May and praised Pacem in Terris for sending its delegation to the Soviet capital. CONFERENCE AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT More than 75 scholars, publicists, and political activists, including Soviet and East European dissidents, met at the State Department in Washington on October 18 and 19 to consider how peaceful democratic change can be encouraged in communist countries. The conference was called by Secretary of Stste George Shultz to further a political initiative that had been announced by President Ronald Reagan in the British parliament last June. Opening the conference on democratization in oommunist countries, Undersecretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger said that so long as communist leaders oppose change there would be instability. "As long as they depend on force to deny their people's legitimate freedom, there will be unrest .... Our hope is that peaceful demooratio change can emerge from this tension. Our intent is to help it happen." Secretary of State Shultz told the participants he was looking to them "for guidance and creative ideas .... We need new tools, new energies, and a new focus to invigorate our efforts.” He said that "only the people of [the communist] countries can muster sufficient pressure for reform to determine their own destinies. We do not seek to foment violent unrest or to undermine communist regimes. Yet, we will not ignore the individuals and groups in communist countries who seek peaceful ohange. It is our responsibility, both moral and strategic, to meet their calls for help. We must aid their struggle for freedom. The U.S. government is aotive on this front. Our radio broadcasts serve as the oommunist world’s surrogate free press. The U.S. government will spend $44 million this fiscal year for the first installment in a planned $1 billion modernization program to improve the geographic and political impaot of these radio broadcasts. We are encouraging private sector groups to aid the peaceful struggle for freedom in communist countries. More organizations must follow the example of the AFL-CIO which offered strong support for Polish Solidarity .... We will continue to press the issue of human rights in public, international forums, and we will insist that communist states be held to [pageend7]8 ti international standards of behavior and will hold them to the Helsinki Final Aot as we do in forum after forum and in individual discussion after discussion. We will insist that a single standard be applied to all countries. These efforts are important but we must do more to support the emergence of democracy in communist states. We need new tools, new energies, and a new foous to invigorate our efforts.” Reaction in Prague Under the headline, ”A Black Crusade,” the Prague daily Rudá právo reported on October 21: "A two-day secret conference took place at the State Department in Washington where concrete plans for a ’orusade1 were worked out against communism as previously announced by President Reagan in his June address to the British parliament. At the conference representatives of the State Department met with experts in psychological warfare and ideological diversion from Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty and their stooges from various emigrď groups. ”The U.S. Secretary of State, George Shultz, and other government representatives at the conference declared that the U.S.A, would already this year increase substantially its outlays for conducting psychological warfare against the U.S.S.R. and other socialist countries. According to Shultz, for improving efforts and strengthening the political impact of programs alone $50 million are available. The total outlay for the operation of these propaganda stations is roughly $1 billion a year.” CELEBRATION AT THE AMERICAN EMBASSY Ambassador Jack Matlock paid homage to the founders of the Czechoslovak Republic in the American embassy building in Prague, where he laid'a wreath at the plaques commemorating the first president of Czechoslovakia, Thomas G. Masaryk, a Czech; the first minister of war, General Milan Rastislav Stefánik, a Slovak; and President Woodrow Wilson of the United States. The celebration took place on October 28, Czechoslovak Independence Day. In his remarks Ambassador Matlock noted the dose cooperation of the three statesmen in establishing the independent Czechoslovak state in 1918o He said that American personnel working at the embassy in Prague were especially proud that the United States- president had contributed so much to the realization of the dream of Czech and Slovak patriots—the creation of a free and independent Czechoslovakia. CHARTER 77 HONORED At its annual banquet, the Research Center for Religion and Human Rights in Closed Societies in New York, together with the Riverside Churoh, celebrated on Ootober 28 the 20th anniversary of the publication of the RCDA (Religion i.n Communist-Dominated Areas), edited by Reverend Blahoslav Hrubýa and his wife Olga. The oocasion was also intended to honor organizations and individuals who take an active part in the struggle for human rights and against the totalitarian system in the Soviet Union, and Eastern Europe. Among them was the Czechoslovak Charter 77• [pageend8]9 The msin speakers were Bayard Rustin, one of the leading American human rights advocates; Ambassador Richard T. Davies; and the wife of Aleksander I. Solzhenitsyn. Ambassador Davies devoted the bulk of his remarks to the foundation of the Czechoslovak Republio 64 years ago (Ootober 28 is Czechoslovak Independence Day) and to its first president Thomas G. Masaryk. He said among other things that "in his Nobel Prize address Czeslaw Milosz dwelt upon ’the meaning of the afflictions which befell the nations of the other Europe’—that half of Europe which lias east of the River Elbe. He raised the possibility that ’two genocidal dictators,' Hitler and Stalin, might have succeeded, despite their apparent failures, in establishing the practice of dealing with nations as 'objects of trade, if not chips in games of cards or dice.' But Hitler and Stalin have not yet won that posthumous victory. One of the important reasons why they have not is Charter 77» the broadly based coalition of Czechoslovak democrats, social democrats, and socialists, which, despite every effort of the Husák regime, continues to raise its voice in the Czech and Slovak lands in defense of freedom. Here in America we hear little these days about the activities of Charter 77 • • • • -All the more reason, then, why we should remember the brave men and women who keep alive the splendid tradition established in so short a time by these modern Chartists. In a country occupied by Soviet troops, where so many have been cowed by brutal repression, it takes extraordinary courage to break the placid surfaoe of passivity and speak the truth. Faithful to the national motto, Pravda vit^zi (truth prevails), the Chartists of 1977 continue to do so. "It is therefore a particular honor for me to be able to hand this oertifioate of recognition of the heroism and self-sacrifice of the members of Charter 77 to Dr. JiÝí Horák, foreign affairs secretary of the Council of Free Czechoslovakia. (Dr. Horak thanked the RCDA and Ambassador Davies and assured them that the certificate would be deposited for safe-keeping by the Council until the time comes when it can be handed over to those to whom it belongs in Czechoslovakia.) Text of the Certificate The Research Center for Religion and Human Rights in Closed Societies is proud to honor Charter 77 with the RCDA Humsn Rights Award: In recognition and deep appreciation of the courageous defense of human rights by Charter 77 and its valiant stand against communist persecution in Soviet-occupied Czechoslovakia. An inspiration to all oppressed people. (RSC) HUS/k IN VIENNA The Czechoslovak president and party secretary, Dr. Gustav Husák, paid an offioial visit to Vienna in the middle of November. Originally scheduled for last year, the visit was postponed because of a new low in Austrian—Czeohoslovak relations following the persecution of dissidents and the affair of Josef Hodio, a spy planted in Vienna. Dr. Husák’ a reception was anything but cordial despite diplomatically phrased declarations by the Austrian president, Rudolf Kirsohláger, and the Austrian chancellor, Bruno Kreisky. They mentioned the Helsinki Final Act and the possibility of expanding trade, whioh Prague needs in a bad way. [pageend9]10 But the Slovak daily Pravda of November 22 complained that "anti-Czeoho.slovak provocations appeared on Austrian television and in rightist papers* Anticommunist forces in Austria and their control centers farther west made an attempt to disrupt the constructive nature of the visit by dispatching Psvel to Prague.” Indeed, the Czech dissident playwright Pavel Kohout, now an Austrian oitizen, landed at the Prague airport on a Frankfurt-Budapest flight on the day Husák arrived in Vienna, but left after a few hours for Zurich, Switzerland. The Czechoslovak media reported that ”he had hoped to be arrested" to spoil Dr. Husák’s visit, but "we did not oblige." Charter 77 end the wife of a jailed Czech writer, Dr. Jaromir Savrda from Ostrava, sent letters to Chanoellor Kreisky pleading for help, and hundreds of emigres signed a letter to Gustav Husák. He was also handed a letter signed by Dr. Josef Hoohtl, member of the Austrian parliament for the Peoples* (Christian Democratic) Party and a human rights spokesman. Charter 77 Letter to Chanoellor Kreisky Dear Mr. Chancellor, We turn to you because we know of your interest in the plight of the defenders of human rights in Czechoslovakia, which you have proved by your actions. You will soon be meeting with the president of our republic, Dr. Gustav Husák. We hope it will not be difficult for you to find a suitable opportunity to intervene on behalf of all those who are persecuted in Czechoslovakia for their defense of human rights and first of all on behalf of those who are in jail, such as Battek, Benda, Gruntorád, Havel, Hloíánka, Jirous, Litomisky, Lťzna, Pospíchal, Stárek, Uhl, and others. We fear that the persecution may beoome more severe and, after the end of the visit, target others who, although under indictment, are still free. They could be detained once more 3nd a new political trial might be staged. We have in mind individuals like Bartoáek, Kyncl, Mlynářík, and others. Our plea to you to intervene on behalf of these and other citizens persecuted for their defense of human rights guaranteed by Czechoslovak laws and international agreements is therefore urgent. We are grateful to you for your past and effective understanding of our situation and we thank you for your assistance to those whose strength against the power oenters consists merely of their moral position. Prague, November 10, 1982 Dr. Radim Palouá, Anna Marvanová, Ladislav Lis, Charter 77 spokespersons Letter to Dr. Husák by Dr. Hoohtl Dr. Josef Hoohtl, member of the Austrian parliament for the People’s (Christian Democratic) Party and its human rights spokesman, sent a letter to Czechoslovak President Gustav Husák dated November 19^2, in which he msde three points on how to improve the "frigid relations" between Austria and Czechoslovakia. Dr. Hoohtl proposed to the Czechoslovak president to do the following: 1. Pardon jailed human rights activists Václav Havel, Dudolf Battek, Václav Benda, Petr Uhl, Jan Litomiský, Ivan Jirous, and "many others." [pageend10]11 2- Release from detention the following priests and believers: Anton Zlatohlavy, Stefan Javorsky, Gabriel Povala, Josef Labuda, Emilie Kesegová', Josef Duka, Radim Slovánka, Josef Bárta, Helena Gondová, Frantisek įizna, Rudolf Smahel, Jan Krumpholo, Josef Adámek, Josef Vlfcek, Josef Dolista, and Frantisek Novajevsky^ 3# Make an offioisl apology for the espionage affair involving Dr. Josef Hodio. Aooording to a report from late November, a new trial is planned for the jailed Jesuit František Lizna.—Father Radim HloŠánka was transferred from prison to a hospital beoause he suffered a stroke.—A request by Jan Litomiský for his release after serving half his sentence was denied by © court in Plzen.—Václav Havel was denied an operation of his joint. He was informed that it would be allowed only if he requests a pardon, which he rejected. NEWS FROM NORMALIZED CZECHOSLOVAKIA A Voice from Slovakia A letter was received from a Slovak visitor written before his return to his homeland: M. . . You would not recognize Slovakia as it is today. Young people are not spoiled the way they are in the West, but they are terribly demoralized. Our worst concern is the high cost of living and scarcitycf goods, especially foodstuffs. Flour is laoking and often salt, matches, and detergents are not available. The price of gasoline has gone up sharply. It costs young people a third of their monthly wages to fill up a tank with gasoline. You should read the graffiti about Husák in toilets and at railroad stations . . • .” Western Films as Ideological Diversion "How is it possible,” a young communist from the West studying in Czechoslovakia asked, ’’that so many worthless Western movies are shown?” aooording to a report in Novex slovo. No. 35? September 2, 1982. Such films, the student noted, ”are shown in my country in second-rate theaters only.” Nov^ slovo commented: ”And we buy these films. Our young people are easily caught in their ideological net because their world view [Weltanschauung] has not yet been sufficiently crystallized and they are unprepared to oope with such an influenoe. We also know that anticommunism pays great attention to ideological diversion filtered into the socialist states in the form of films.” It is true that Czechoslovakia buys ”second-rate” Western films, but the reason is that they are cheaper and the Czechoslovak film industry needs the profit they yield in sold-out theaters to offset the losses resulting from the projection of Soviet films. A New Nuclear Power Plant Preparations have started for the construction of a nuolear power plant near the village of Temelín in southern Bohemia. Aooording to Radio Prague, November 2, it will have the largest output in Czechoslovakia with two 1,000-megawatt reactors in the first stage snd the possibility of doubling its output in subsequent years. The trial run of the first reactor is scheduled to begin in 1991* [pageend11]12 Foreign Trade Difficulties ’’The adaptability of our products to meet world standards has been chronically poor,” complained the daily Rudá právo, September 2. "Our foreign trade is unable to get [from our plants] what it needs for export. Yet, manufactured goods are easy to produce and equipment is available though, admittedly, it is often obsolete ••••’’ In his speech to communist officials in western Slovakia Gustav Husák, according to Radio Prague, Ootober 20, charged that the Western embargo polioy was designed to undermine the economies of the socialist states, but ’’it will fail," he noted. To counter the effect of what Husák called the "Western economic crisis and imperialist policy of discrimination," it will be necessary to expand cooperation with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. Husák added that "enemy propaganda was spreading fabrications and misinformation magnifying some of our problems so as to create skepticism and mistrust." [pageend12]
