Fischmann Box 134 Corona, CA 91718 February, 1989 SVU Activities BANQUET ADDRESSES pronounced during the 14th SVU World Congress on September 17, 1988, at L’Enfant Plaza Hotel Washington, D.C. Igor V. Nabelek, the new SVU President spoke about the past and the future of the Society in the world of today. His address has been abbreviated with his consent. The members of any nation, any society, any group of people have various opinions and persuasions. The nature of every human community is pluralistic. That is true for our people in Czechoslovakia and it is true for the Slovak and Czech emigration, as well as for SVU as such. SVU is, and should be, an association of persons who have diverse philosophical, religious, nationalistic and political convictions, but who simultaneously accept the democratic spirit of the Society’s by-laws. SVU offers opportunities for the exchange and crystallization of ideas, as they exist only on a very limited scale in other organizations. I believe that thanks to the nonpolitical character of SVU, more progress can be achieved from confronting ideas in a friendly manner than when such confrontations occur in a politically heated environment. There was an initial imbanlace between Slovak and Czech components in the Society. That imbalance, historically understandable, has gradually diminished as the role of Slovaks in SVU has been steadily increasing. This development, having full support of Czech members of the Society, has resulted in today’s Executive Board in which the president and four of the nine vice-presidents are Slovaks. cont. p. 3 A NON-PROFIT CULTURAL ORGANIZATION [pageend1]SVU BULLETIN This English periodical of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences (SVU), incorporated in Washington, D.C., was initiated in 1980 with the specific purpose of reaching a) SVU members who do not read Czech and Slovak; b) English speaking public interested in Czechoslovak topics. SVU Bulletin was enlarged from three issues a year to the current format of four times a year and 32 pages per issue. The regular sections have been: SVU Activities, Personalia, variable categories in What’s Your Thing? and News Received. Occasionally, Assistance Wanted or other additional sections may appear. Information from all artistic and scientific branches is welcome. The achievements of the Czechoslovaks, not exclusively SVU members, and contributions by nonCzechoslovaks to the knowledge of Czechoslovakia-related topics form the main contents of the Bulletin. SVU Bulletin appears in February, May, August and October. It is automatically mailed to SVU members in the English speaking areas. The Office of Publication (see below) can arrange mailings to other areas or to non-members. The publication of articles and other contributions by individual authors does in no way necessarily signify agreement on the part of either the Executive Board of the Czechoslovak Society or of the editor or of the editorial boards with the ideas and thoughts expressed in such articles. Only the authors themselves are responsible for the accuracy of factual information provided and for the substantive content of their contributions. Individual authors are in no instance spokesmen for the Society. SVU Bulletin, USPS 765-610 edited by Zdenka E.

Bunza 75-70 199th St., Flushing, NY 11366 [pageend2]This year ending with “8”, we recall the anniversaries of several milestones of our old country: the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, the take-over of the Czechoslovak government by the Communist Party in 1948, the Munich Pact in 1938, and the declaration of Czechoslovakia in 1918. The declaration of Czechoslovak Republic had probably the most propitious impact on our nations. The freedom and the democratic system which existed in Czechoslovakia between the two World Wars, in time of peace, brought to our peoples great economic development, a high standard of living, formation of an excellent school system, and introduction of various social benefits. In spite of having lasted only a short time, that period was priceless for the future development of our nations. It was a period of enjoyment of freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of news media, freedom of travel... It left an inheritance for future generations which could not be forgotten and which influenced the future thinking of our people. During the years of war our nations expected that a full post-war democracy would be again established. Instead, in 1945 the Carpatho-Rusyns were taken away from Czechoslovakia and the Slovaks and Czechs could establish only a limited type of democracy. It was hoped that the limitations would be gradually removed, but the opposite occurred. A one-party, totalitarian system was imposed on the rest of our people, Czechs and Slovaks, in 1948. Despite a high standard of living, despite excellent social accomplishments, despite wide-spread sympathy towards Russians and toward the Soviet Union, and despite allowing the sharing of power by the Communist Party in the coalition government since 1945, even the limited post-war democracy was destroyed. It was the previous experience with democracy that made it especially hard for our people to see their human rights vanish and the economy plummet. It was the democratic past that contributed to the initial refusal of our people to accept the one- party domination. It was this democratic past that contributed to the attempt to introduce “socialism with human face” into the communist system in 1968. The introduction of Marxism-Leninism as a ruling philosophy into the life of any nation has had ominous consequences everywhere—without exception. In developed countries, it has meant economic disaster, in developing countries starvation with millions of people perishing. And everywhere, the economic plunge has been accompanied by a mile-long step backwards in securing human rights. It should be expected that a failure of such magnitude would be generally known. Surprisingly, we see that the communication of pertinent information has broken down, in a similar way as it did in 1938, and that the knowledge of real conditions has not reached many segments of the public and of the leadership of the free countries. Free exchange of information is important for the development and progress of any organism. It is critical for the intellectual progress of developing human beings, children in particular. The visual, and especially auditory channels must be properly functioning, otherwise the mental advancement of sensorially deprived children is delayed. Similarly, a society which is deprived of the free flow of information and exchange of ideas is lagging behind the development of the societies in which the information is available to all citizens without restriction. 3 [pageend3]In these days we see that in the communist countries the awareness of poor performance of the system, which has been painfully clear to their citizens since the imposing of the system, has finally reached the upper levels of the CommunistParty, the so called nomenclatura, and that remedies are being desperately sought. So far, the cure has been tried by departing from orthodox Marxism-Leninism in the economic sphere by using a degree of private enterprise, but the opening of the gates to free activity of the mind is still out of question. It may be that some persons in the nomenclatura have already realized that they are in a Catch-22 situation. Preventing the free flow of information means stagnation and falling behind the free countries; opening the flow of information means an acceleration of the trend toward democracy and the end of one-party-rule. What is the importance of a nonpolitical organization like SVU in the world today? Let me first note what I mean by the “nonpolitical character” of the Society. I firmly believe that it is not the goal of SVU to generate a political program and to try to impose it on anybody. Its task is to promote free cultures of the peoples of Czechoslovakia. That means that our duty is to support free artistic and scientific creativity and free exchange of information in science and culture. But that does not mean that S VU members should avoid expressing opinions about general questions, questions of freedom of scientific and artistic endeavor and questions of human rights. These are not political questions but issues of a general character, related to normal human activities. The task of supporting such free activities also means that SVU should not support dissemination of ideas which promote suppression of freedom of artistic creation and scientific investigation. SVU should concentrate on the support of individuals and organizations whose goals are in line with SVU bylaws, and not of those whose activities are in conflict with them. An inherent part of SVU undertakings in pursuing its goals is the support of free flow of scientific and artistic information between nations and within nations. The flow of information supported by SVU is not politically oriented but, as the ideas springing out of free arts and sciences touch many facets of human existence, then- possible political impact cannot be totally excluded. The activities of societies like SVU tend to eliminate disinformation aboutthe thinking of various groups of people in the world and the minunderstandings of consequences stemming from different approaches to solve various world problems. The free flow of information increases peoples’ awareness of what is being likely to happen at different places around the world at different points of time. Such awareness might influence the course of history. Better anticipation of events perhaps could have resulted in different outcomes of the situations leading to the 1968 invasion, the 1948 take-over of the government, and the 1938 Munich treaty. SVU activities have a threefold direction: 1 - SVU promotes scientific and artistic contacts between our emigrants in democratic countries; it tries to serve as a bridge, or a link between our oldest immigration groups to the U.S. at the turn of this century and the most recent waves of immigrants; and it serves as a connecting tie between the youngest and oldest members of our immigration. 2 - SVU promotes knowledge in democratic countries about our cultures and about cultural activities taking place 4 [pageend4]in Czechoslovakia. And, 3-SVU informs the public in Czechoslovakia about the cultural and scientific activities in the free world. It provides the flow of information between these three spheres of interest. It is this activity from which our people in Czechoslovakia and the peoples in the free countries can benefit the most. The existence and activities of SVU are important for all of us living in the democratic countries, as well as for our nations in Czechoslovakia. The size of the membership and the scope of SVU activities indicate our members’ awareness of the importance of the SVU goals, as they are related to Central Europe and especially to Czechoslovakia. They are also a proof of the vitality of the Society. Therefore, we can expect that the membership of our Society will grow and that our activities will become even broader. I believe that our activities will contribute to the well-being of our nations and will stand as shining milestones of our future history, be it in the years ending with the number “8” or any other digit. ★ ★ ★ REMARKS by Robert William Farrand Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs Mr. Farrand began his address by mentioning the political changes in Czechoslovakia since January of this year, in connection with Mr. Gorbachev’s glasnost. For space limitations we will reprint only the highlights of his expert and thorough analysis. But, first, I would like briefly to address what has happened in Czechoslovakia since that tragic night in August twenty years ago when tanks from five Warsaw Pact nations rolled in and crushed the flowers planted in springtime. Since that terrible night, millions of words have been written and spoken both condemning and justifying that fateful move by the Soviets. Few were left untouched by the Prague Spring and the brutal way it was suppressed. Members of this audience saw either their own lives or the lives of loved ones or friends changed forever; saw careers broken, years of education interrupted, families separated, friendships strained and broken. These were but some of the costs borne by thousands and tens of thousands of supporters of Party Secretary Dubček and the attempt to make the Communist system more human, more just, more rational. Even today, highly educated men and women in Czechoslovakia have seen the prime of their lives wasted in employment outside their professions: stoking furnaces, sweeping factory floors, driving tractors or running motor pools in obscure parts of the country, while the jobs they should be performing are filled with others whose prime qualification is loyalty to the Party. As in George Orwell's "1984", which caught Czechoslovakia right about on target, words lost all meaning and values were turned upside down. 5 [pageend5]Czechoslovakia is unique. Alone among the countries of the Warsaw Pact, Czechoslovakia knew real democracy and unparalleled prosperity in the two decades between the great world wars. Thus, though their standard of living in comparison with their Warsaw Pact neighbors remains higher, and their quality of life as measured by material things is on balance not bad, the Czechoslovak people, in soul and spirit, have suffered more over the past two decades — precisely because of the rare opportunity so violently snatched from them to remake their government and economy more along the lines of their traditional national character. And the sad irony, lost on no one, is that the Soviets today seem to be going exactly wnere the Czechs and Slovaks were headed 20 years age! Indeed, as Bill Luers, our former Ambassador and my former boss in Prague, wrote recently in the Los Angeles Times (August 21): "The Czechs, with a highly skilled and talented population, a minimal foreign debt and the strongest tradition of democracy in Central Europe, still have a chance to help quide Gorbachev back to the future - (back) to the Prague Spring. The speaker continued analyzing Charter ‘77, the Jazz Section, the appointment of three new bishops and the increase of religious activities in both the Czech lands and Slovakia, the youth of Czechoslovakia listening to “Prague 3” (VOA) and other signs of “restructuring,” but also about the reluctance of the current party and government representatives to institute significant changes and restore all basic human rights. He then concluded the well accepted speech: So Czechoslovakia has a long way to go in meeting the human rights obligations it freely undertook in the Helsinki Final Act. We in Government must take these denials of essential rights into account when we look at our overall policy toward the Jakes regime. In fact, we have opened a channel in which we regularly discuss these matters openly and frankly with the Government of Czechoslovakia. While these discussions have yet to meet with overwhelming success, they have not been without value. There is movement — minor movement, but movement, nonetheless. We need more of it. And both we and the Czechoslovak Government need to hear more from ydu and other members of the American-Czechoslovak community about how you view events in your mother country. We also seek your view on U.S. policy toward Czechoslovakia, since your input is so crucial to our thinking. To quote Bill Luers again: "The most hopeful sign is that the question before East and West today for the first time in 20 years is not how to debate the tragic end of the Prague Spring, but how to revive it and make it endure. " It is in this sense that I am honored and pleased to have been able to speak before you this evening. In a democracy, representatives of the government are servants of the people and need to be in touch with those who pay them, to know what's on their bosses' minds and how best to proceed. You have made my wife and me very proud for having invited us here this evening.

A commemorative protest evening against the repression of freedom in Czechoslovakia followed. The conference was organized by the SVU Swiss Chapter, in cooperation with the Slavic Seminary of the Bern University. After the opening speech by Karel Hruby, President of the chapter, who stressed the key role of culture under the conditions of political oppression, five representatives from European universities read their papers. Professor Jaroslav Krejci from Lancaster (U.K.) outlined the relationships between “Culture and Force” in the history of Central Europe. He emphasized that the culture cannot be only seen as certain kinds of creative activities, but must be interpreted in a larger context of life styles, which are based on generally recognized values and norms of social behavior. During the course of history, several serious conflicts of opposing cultures occurred in Central Europe which often used violence. Basically, those conflicts stemmed from the conversion to another religious faith and later to another nationality and language. Lately, however, it centers on a conflict between completely different Weltanschaung and life attitudes- a conflict which exceeds the religious and nationalistic struggles by the pointedness of its contrasts. None of the encounters ended in an absolute victory of either side, but, as a consequence, the battle lines of such conflicts shifted to other problem levels. One can consequently ask, whether the contemporary contradictions between the free and communist worlds will not be similarly shunned on the side-line. The demographic explosion of the so-called Third World, the imbalance of the ecological issues and the spreading of the desire to escape from public life indicate the essential features of the further development which could loosen the bonds by which communism, directed from the Soviet center, tries to alienate the nations of Central Europe from their civilizing traditions. Professor Zdenek Dittrich, Utrecht (The Netherlands), spoke in detail about the relationship of culture and force in the Counter Reformation era in the area of Bohemia and Moravia. He stressed that in the course of re-Catholicization a number of factors played a role. On the one hand, it was the pressure, and on the other, the emotional appeal of the Baroque culture. He mentioned the different procedural concepts of the Catholic church, as well as the varying intensity of the enforcement and missionary activities in each of the phases of Counter Reformation. Despite all our understanding of the emotional attraction of the Baroque Catholicism, it is impossible to deny the devastating effects of the one-sidedness of the Czech culture and the impoverishment of the Czech- languagc literature as a consequence of the forced exodus of the non-Catholic faithful. Professor Hans Lemberg from Marburg, West Germany, concentrated on the conceptual analysis of the prime mover and the forms of the violent force, for whose definitions he outlined several alternatives. From his analysis the question arose where are the legitimate limits within which the state apparatus may exercise its power in the area of culture. In concrete terms, he specifically spoke about the modern times during which the main focus of repression, directed 9 [pageend9]against culture, are the ideological systems that usurp the exclusiveness of its validity. This is especially evident in the cultural areas of Central and Eastern Europe, regimented by the state philosophy. In the afternoon session, chaired by Professor Jan Peter Locher, University of Bern, Dr. Jacques Rupnik from Paris examined the roots of Stalinism in Czechoslovakia. While he analyzed in his book History of KSC the beginnings of the Stalinization of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSC) during the 1920s, in this paper he concentrated on the role of the intellectuals in the 1930s and after WWII. He specifically outlined the progressive, standing-out shifting of the orientation of the Czech and Slovak intelligentsia. In the era of the National Revival, the great majority of them inclined toward conservatism. With time, however, liberal and later democratic thinking began to prevail. After the creation of the free Czechoslovak state, the tendency which could be in general defined as left-oriented, began to impose itself. A significant number of such intellectuals greeted, in 1948, the February coup d'etat with enthusiasm, and some of them even competed among themselves with their eulogies of Stalin. Within a short time, however, disenchantment set in, and clearly manifested itself, particularly in 1968. Rupnik effectively documented the dimension of the somersaults of the Stalinized intelligentsia on concrete examples of enthusiasm and disillusionment. Květoslav Chvatik, lecturer from Constance, complemented the picture of the development of the Czech literary culture in the present times, with special reference to the dissent and its forms. He particularly explained how the structure of the institutions — political and cultural — influences the scope and focus of the cultural production. The samizdat literature has proved itself as an effective device of defense against any such pressures. All papers provoked lively discussions in which a number of stimulating observations were made about the relationship of “Culture and Force” in our days. After the conference, the participants gathered with many attendees in the meeting hall of the Bellevue Hotel, to observe the 20th anniversary of the occupation of Czechoslovakia. Following the greetings by Karel Hruby, professor Jan Milic Lochman from Basel University spoke about the roots of the Prague Spring. He stressed the continuity of the national tradition, characterized by the democratic, humanitarian and tolerant ways of thinking which, in 1968, were manifested even in the behaviors of the large strata of the population. He called attention to the fact that the whole so-called process of reformation cannot be understood without the connection with the year 1948 when the organized force became dominant in the Czechoslovak society. He criticized Western journalists that they present reform communists as heroes of the Prague Spring of 1968, while such persons in reality had rather been a part of the serious problem which had already arisen in 1948. Past Swiss Minister of Justice, Dr. Rudolf Friedrich, related the Czechoslovak development to larger international developments. He soberly evaluated the impact of the present development in the Soviet Union which he had the opportunity to observe during his recent trip to Moscow, and expressed the hope that the revolt of the spirit against the force in the entire Eastern area seems to indicate the direction of the development which no force can permanently oppose. The evening program, attended by hundreds of mainly Swiss citizens, took place within the framework of the music performance by the string quartet from Lausanne which offered the world premiere of Quadrisinium fidium by the io [pageend10]late composer Jan Novak, written in 1978. It was rewarded by enthusiastic applause. An excellent performance of Dvorak’s American Quartet, op.96, closed the event in a dignified manner. On Sunday, August 21, the conference continued with a discussion of the cultural cooperation in Europe. Another project concerning the area of Central Europe will treat the multicultural character of cultural life and the mutual influences and relations between neighboring nations. The organization of an international Comenius conference was suggested for the 400th anniversary of the birth of the great teacher Jan Amos Komenský, to be celebrated in 1992. Such project naturally requiresa broad network of coworkers and cannot be realized without some sponsoring help. The swiss SVU chapter, in cooperation with the other European chapters, will prepare a proposal for such an event and will suggest to the Board of Directors that the SVU World Congress in 1992 be combined with a Comenius Conference in Europe. -J.S.- ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ SEVENTY YEARS OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA - ACADEMIC CONFERENCE IN LONDON To mark the 70th anniversary of the Czechoslovak Republic the Czechoslovak Society of Arts & Sciences (British Chapter), in co-operation with Professor Roger Scruton of Birkbeck College, University of London, organised on the 15th October 1988 in the premises of the London School of Economics & Political Science, a one day conference with the title CZECHOSLOVAKIA - PAST, PRESENT & FUTURE The conference was open to the public. Altogether seven papers were presented, each of which provided ample opportunity for a lively discussion in which also the students of the said University took part. In the opening address, Professor Scruton mentioned apart from 1918 the dramatic events of 1938, 1948 and 1968, the anniversaries of which should be remembered this year. He pointed out that the aim of the conference was neither a celebration nor political dispute but a scholarly assessment of some salient features in Czechoslovak history. In the first paper Professor Z. Dittrich (University of Utrecht) characterised the political system of the First Republic as an individual combination of Austrian heritage, French Model and American ideal, the latter being a particular aspect of Masaryk’s political philosophy. Prof. Dittrich stressed the role of consensus of the five Czechoslovak democratic parties, which was essential for political stability in a society with numerous ethnic minorities. The socio-economic development of the First Republic was outlined and statistically documented by Professor J. Krejci (University of Lancaster). He pointed out that in the Habsburg monarchy the lands of the Bohemian Crown were its economically most developed part. In the post war reconstruction Czechoslovakia eschewed the rampant inflation which afflicted her neighbours and during the subsequent boom completed her comprehensive scheme of social insurance. The impact of the worldwide crisis of the 1930s, however, could not be avoided. Discussions concerning various economic recipes as in time of reconstruction so in time of crisis were similar to those of the present times in the West. The afternoon session started with the discussion of the Czech-Slovak relationship between 1938 and 1948, introduced by a brief written statement of Dr Kvetko. (The scheduled speaker F. Siberok fell ill). Witnesses of that period from the audience amply contributed to the understanding of the dramatic events of those years. ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★A 11 [pageend11]Dr B. Hnízdo (Associate, Royal Institute of International Affairs, London) gave a synoptic picture of Czechoslovak’s foreign policy in 1939-68. After Stalin’s ban on participation as beneficiary of Marshall Aid, Czechoslovakia ceased to enjoy the role of a sovereign state and since 1948 her foreign policy merely fulfilled the special tasks assigned to her by the USSR. Turning to internal matters K. Kyncl (Associate, Index on Censorship) presented a paper on the political dissent in Czechoslovakia after 1968. He explained the special position and role of the Charter 77. Consensus on human rights and tolerance within a wide range of shades of opinion has become the salient feature of the so-called parallel polis (alternative culture) in contemporary Czechoslovakia. In his contribution on Church and State in post 1948 Czechoslovakia, A. Tomsky (Director, Church in Need) contrasted the depressed position of the Catholic Church in the 1950s with the gradual revival which gathered momentum around 1968 and since then could not be stopped in spite of a new wave of repression in the 1970s. The 1980s brought a spectacular upsurge of religious consciousness in Czechoslovakia in general. In the final paper, on Social and Political Thought in Modern Czechoslovakia, Professor Scruton presented his interpretation of the mental ferment in contemporary Czechoslovakia in which he traced the revival of conservative attitudes and herewith connected values. As a conclusion Professor Krejci stressed tolerance and democratic consensus as the particularly valuable contribution of the First Republic to our national heritage. ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ Further commemorations of Czechoslovak Anniversaries in 1988. Apart from the already reported conferences in Berne and London organised by the Swiss and British chapters of S.V.U. respectively in co-operation with the local Universities, on 20 August and 15 Ocfober, Professor Jaroslav Krejci lectured on Czechoslovak issues at the following international conferences and University seminars: 1.

Dr. Andrew Elias who had been the editor of Zprávy during the period of 1975-76, accepted the editorship as of now. Thanks go to Ms. Zorin for the work done and good wishes to the new editor. Andrew Elias, the new editor of the Zprávy SVU was bom in Prešov, eastern Slovakia. His first “writings,” in the form of short-short stories were published in the local papers. Later, in the United States, he was a frequent contributor to various Czech and Slovak periodicals and for a short period of time an editor of two Slovak publications in New York City. 13 [pageend13]Andrew Elias earned his B.S. and M.A. in Economics at Columbia University in the mid-1950s. He then studied Government and International Relations at New York University, for the doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) which he received in 1963. Professionally, Dr. Elias was considered as one of the top economic experts on the socialist countries and was either an author or a coauthor of numerous pioneering studies, especially on manpower and foreign trade of the Soviet Union and other East European countries. Most of his studies were published by the U.S. Department of Commerce and by the Joint Economic Committee of the U.S. Congress. Representing the U.S. Department of Commerce, Dr. Elias participated in many meetings, conferences and panel discussions in the United States and abroad, with the exception of the meeting of “U.S.-Soviet Experts” in Moscow, where he represented the Department of the Treasury. Dr. Elias retired in 1982 as the Director of Market Research in the Bureau of East-West Trade, U.S. Department of Commerce, and is presently the Chairman of the Board of Directors of ELNEGAR, Inc., a corporation dealing with real estate investments, providing services for U.S. government and other business ventures.

Fischmann, have accepted the task of gathering, compiling and editing data concerning Jewish immigrants in North America since 1918. This is a part of the larger project coordinated by the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences, Incorporated in Washington, D.C., also known as SVU. The membership in the Society or in such organizations as the International Council of Jews from Czechoslovakia (ICJC) in London; Joseph Popper Lodge of B 'nai B’rith, New York; Society for History of Czechoslovak Jews (SHCJ) in New York; Research Foundation for History of Jews of Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia (RFHJ/BMS) in Jerusalem, and other which promised their cooperation, naturally is not a condition of inclusion into this survey and the eventual publication of the results. Ever since its foundation S V U has aimed to acquaint the public with specific contributions to world culture made by the Czechs, Slovaks, Rusyns and all other nationalities residing in Czechoslovakia, in the old country and abroad. That has implied a historical approach and research on those who have immigrated in the United States and Canada. First World Congress of SVU (1962) focused on the Czechoslovak Contribution to World Culture. A 682-page volume of proceedings from that Congress was edited by Miloslav Rechcigl, Jr., and was published in 1964 by Mouton (The Hague-London-Paris). Four years later the same editor and publisher presented the proceedings from the Second SVU World Congress, under the title Czechoslovakia Past and Present, in two volumes, totaling 1,889 pages. In 1983, Dr. Rechcigl took on the task of directing a long-term research project aimed at systematic tracing of the contributions of the immigrants from Czechoslovakia to specific fields of endeavor. In 1985, he asked us to work on the contributions to social, economic and cultural development of North America, accomplished by the Jews with the Czechoslovak roots, who have immigrated to that area since 1918. The first steps were taken in spring 1986 and a preliminary report was presented at the Thirteenth SVU World Congress held in Boston, September 1986, in the “Symposium on the Czechs and Slovaks in America,” chaired by Miloslav Rechcigl. Similar presentation by Frank Meissner took place on September 18,1988, during the Fourteenth SVU World Congress at Chevy Chase, Maryland. 18 [pageend18]The main purposes of the project are: a. Findings based on data provided by respondents to a biographical questionnaire which is enclosed. b. The project concerning the Jews from Czechoslovakia will be finalized on similar lines as the other sub-projects realized by other task forces guided by Dr. Rechcigl. c. A book-length publication will be readied when enough data are collected. In view of the magnitude of this project, assistance of many individuals and organizations is needed. We ask you to participate and help us reach as many as possible Jewish immigrants from Czechoslovakia (Bohemia, Moravia, Slovakia, Silesia and Carpatho-Ruthenia) who came to the United States and Canada after 1918. The way to do it is the following: 1. Data Collecting You, the respondent, can fill out the enclosed questionnaire, send you current curriculum vitae, or use a narrative approach and write a not overlong biographical sketch, and add any other documents of interest. We are interested in objective data that might serve the statistical purpose, but even more in your life story (family background in Czechoslovakia, the way you arrived at these shores, your “emigrant’s experiences,” your current way of life, your children’s prospects, and whatever you want to have preserved and shared as a possible source for any future genealogical research or oral history type of research. 2. Reaching Others Help us gather addresses of prospective respondents who belong to other than the above organizations and of persons among your friends, acquaintances and members of your family who could be interested in this project. Either send their addresses to us or copy this letter and questionnaire and give it to them. 3. Your participation is absolutely voluntary and your confidentiality will be maintained, though a publication is planned (see the end of the questionnaire). 4. We welcome inquiries and suggestions, and thank you for your cooperation. Zdenka E. Fischmann P.O. Box 134 Corona, CA 91718 (714) 737-2781 Frank Meissner 8323 Still Spring Ct.

Since then his newer writings were listed. His latest publications have been: “Do the new Concepts of Space and Time require a New Metaphysics?” (in The World View of Contemporary Physics, R.F. Kitchener, ed., SUNY Press, 1988), “Masaryk’s Personalis” (in On Masaryk, Studien zur oesterreichischen Philosophie, XIII, 1988), “What Survives from the Classical Concept of Absolute Time” ( in Newton’s Scientific Legacy, P.B. Scheurer & G. Delbrock, eds., 1988), and other. Dr. Capek read a paper at the 14th SVU Congress, “Loss of Historical Boundaries of Czechoslovakia: 1742, 1919 and 1945, “focussing on the causes of the losses of Kladsko and Carpatho Ukraine. We wish him many more years of productive work in his fields of expertise, i.e., pure philosophy, philosophy of science and philosophy of history. ★ Anna Kvapilova, née Fojtova Anna Kvapilova was born on March 19, 1905, in Vysoky Chlumec, near Sedlčany. She worked as a librarian at the Prague Municipal Library from 1929 until 1941 when she was arrested by the Gestapo. For some time, namely, the leaders of the resistance held their meetings in her apartment. She was interrogated at the Pankrac jail and then sent to the Ravensbrueck concentration camp for women. Among her fellow sufferers were Milena Jesenská and Margaret Buber-Neumann. Also, several Norwegian women were there. She still vividly remembers that the singing of Czech songs became a source of strength to survive despite the horrors of the camp. The group of Ravensbrueck surviving women, conducted by Anna Kvapilova, gave a commemorative concert in Prague after the liberation. At that time she was closely associated with the work of Dr. Milada Horáková (executed in 1950) and other democratically oriented politicians. Consequently, she lost her job after February 1948 and soon made her escape to Norway, via Germany, where her war time fellow ex-prisoners helped her to settle. After Ms. Kvapilova found asylum in Norway, she became the secretary of the Norwegian-Czechoslovak Help organization that built a Home for the children of Czechoslovak post-1948 refugees. They organized summer camps and a Czech school. The Home, a labor of love, still carries the name of Milada Horáková. Last October, Ms. Kvapilova visited the U.S., to meet friends in New York and California, to share old memories and meet some younger exiles who did not live through the historical events she talked about but wanted to know what her generation lived through.

Here is the continuation of "our things" for your interest. We plan to enlarge this section in terms of both categories and information. The Secretary, all officers of the Society and the editor of this Bulletin (all of whose addreses appear on the first page) will be glad to serve as liaisons between SVU members and interested readers. Communication is one of our main aims. PUBLICATIONS OF INTEREST REVIEW OF THE SHCJ Vol.2, 1988-89, pp.208 The premiere appearance of Reviewl the new yearbook of the Society for the History of Czechoslovak Jews, published in New York, was commented on in the SVU Bulletin VIII/3, August 1987. The second volume recently came out. We will not repeat the biographical data of the editors, Lewis Weiner and Gertrude Hirschler, and of the past contributors. There have been two changes in the members of the Advisory Committee: Joseph Pick died (see Our Losses in Bulletin VIII/3 and an obituary in this Review), and Wilma Iggers, member of SHCJ and of SVU, was coopted. Wilma Ábeles Iggers was born in Mirkov, Western Bohemia, and immigrated with her family to Canada, in 1938. She studied Germanistics at the University of Chicago and earned her Ph.D. with a dissertation on Karl Kraus. She taught at several U.S. and Canadian universities and, since 1965, has been professor of German at Canisius College in Buffalo. Dr. Iggers has lectured on and published in the areas of her special interests and expertise, ranging from Czech and German literature, social and cultural history, to the position of women, civil rights and the peace movement. Her last book is the well documented historical reader, which was published in German (1986) and is being readied for an English version by the Wayne State University Press. Five excerpts, under the title “The Jews of Bohemia and Moravia during the 18th and 19th centuries: Their Daily Life in Memoirs and Documents,” are included: “Anti-Luxury Laws Enacted by the Jewish Community of Prague During the Eighteenth Century” is an interesting document of self-imposed austerity as a defense against accusations of an “ostentatious life style.” “A Jew Engages His Son as an Apprentice to a Christian (late 18th Century)” and “Application of Joseph Brok for a Secular Marriage Permit (1832),” are short vignettes illuminating the prejudicial difficulties Jews had to overcome in their vocational and personal lives. A portion from the autobiography by “Josef Popper-Lynkeus (1838-1921),” an engineer, inventor and social philosopher from Kolin, Bohemia, gives the flavor of the intellectual growth of a budding scientist barred from a free academic career because of his Jewish origin. The concluding “Diversity and Unease in the Modem World (1874-1918)” is Wilma Iggers’ observations on the situation of the Jews in Bohemia vis-a-vis the Germans and the Czechs. 26 [pageend26]William Kluback is a New Yorker by birth (1927) and professor of philosophy at CUNY. He has a Ph.D. from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem where his teachers were Shmuel Hugo Bergman and Natan Rotenstreich. He has written books on the Neo-Kantians Herman Cohen and Ernst Cassirer, studies on French literates, and other books on contemporary humanism and the philosophy of history. His contribution to Review 2 honors his teacher in “The Believing Humanism of Shmuel Hugo Bergman.” Prague-born Bergman (1883) made aliya in 1920 and died in Jerusalem in 1975. The author discusses Bergman’s basic tenets and his interest in all world religions and philosophies that stress the transcendental relationship between humanity and God. Kluback connects some of Bergman’s ideals with his Prague environment and the ideas of Felix Weltsch and Max Brod, going back to Ahad Ha-Am. They also saw the goals of Zionism in creating a state which would become the leading nation by assembling the best humanitarian thinkers from the Diaspora and creating a special community capable of fostering and maintaining the Idea of Humanity “as an expression of God’s Covenant with man, and of man’s free Covenant with God.” Ladislav Lipscher was born in Slovakia in 1915. He became dean of Comenius University in Bratislava and a member of the Historical Institute of the Slovak Academy of Sciences. During WWII he was imprisoned in several labor camps in Slovakia. After the liberation he worked in West Germany and since 1968 has lived in Switzerland. He contributed essays on Slovak Jews to the SHCJ trilogy, The Jews of Czechoslovakia, and published various historical books. In this issue he remembers “Pastor Vladimir Kuna, Rescuer of Jewish Children in Slovakia During World War II.” He traces the beginnings of the “independent” Slovak (puppet) state and the adoption of the anti-Jewish policies. The Evangelical bishop protested, in 1942, against the deportations of Jews and they were temporarily stopped. Among the rescuers of the remaining Jews, Evangelical pastor Vladimir Kuna was responsible for the survival of 26 Jewish children in the orphanage of his parish in Liptovsky Svaty Mikuláš. He was decorated for his action after WWII. He visited “his children” in Israel and a “tree of honor” was eventually planted at the Avenue of the Righteous, though pastor Kuna then could not attend the ceremony due to his age. The longest essay is Karel Kaplan’s “The Prague Political Trials of 1952.” The editor introduces the author, bom in 1928 in Bohemia who worked at Bata’s shoe factory in Zlin. He became the ideologist of the Communist party between 1949 and 1964. he studied (1957-61) history at various special institutes of the party central committee. He was a secretary of the Piller Commission that was to rehabilitate, posthumously, the victims of the Slansky trials. After the invasion of 1968 Kaplan became a manual worker again, and in 1976 found asylum in West Germany. Kaplan had access to many documents which he is gradually making public in his books and also in this essay. If Trockyisna was a pretense, the “imperialist Zionist conspiracy” was the name of the game, instigated as a coverup for declining economy in CSSR. In any case, eleven of the fourteen accused officials were of “Jewish origin.” The author fills in many details of the created scenario: the preparations, choice of defendants, their incarceration and ruthless interrogations, the pseudo-trials and the execution. Iggers, Kaplan, Lipscher and Kluback are new contributors to the Review. We met the next authors in volume 1. Avigdor Dagan (Victor Fischl) from Jerusalem writes on “The Jewish Identity of Frantisek Langer.” The Langer family came to a Bohemian village from Holland in the 1650s, and only Frantisek’s father eventually moved to Prague. Of the three sons, Frantisek 27 [pageend27]became a physician, during WWI fought with the Czech Legions in Russia against the Soviets, returned to Prague in 1920 and won recognition as an outstanding Czech novelist and playwright. During WWII he was in London where his friendship with Dagan developed. The second son, Frantisek’s brother Jiri, accepted the name Mordechai when he got involved in Galician chasidism. Jiri wrote poetry and the book Nine Gates to the Chasidic Mysteries, which appeared in 1937 and again in 1965. He escaped from the Protectorate on one of the illegal Danube boats to Palestine and died there in 1943. Dagan concludes that the Holocaust and Jiri’s death, as well as the creation of Israel and the post-war anti-Semitism in Czechoslovakia drew Frantisek Langer (1888- 1965) closer to Judaism, even though he never used a Jewish theme in his literary output. Jana Renee Friesova from Prague, a retired educator and active translator, is working on an autobiographical novel about her WWII experiences. “The Girls Home in Terezin” is one of the important chapters of her life, starting at age 14. She describes the creation of several separate facilities for children and minors, and reminisces about two women who headed her girls’ home: “Frau Rosa” (Englander) and Irene Kraus, both of whom stressed discipline, selfless and caring cooperation, education and cultural interests, thus becoming models and surrogate “mothers” molding the characters of their young charges. Mrs. Englander survived but Irene Kraus perished—and is still gratefully remembered for her dedication. “Jewish Day Schools in Slovakia During the Holocaust” is the contribution of the Slovak-born historian Yehoshua Robert Buechler from Israel. He gives information on the complex development of Jewish day schools in pre-1918 Hungarian regions and then in the Republic. At the time of the Munich pact 61 Jewish day schools were reduced to 24 that continued to exist and again grew in number to 64 in 1941. The author explains the inner organization of such schools as of Orthodox or Neolog orientation, and states that many functioned even in the Slovak labor camps. He documents the historical data in extensive notes. “Oskar Morawetz: Humanitarian Composer” belatedly reflects his 70th birthday and presents the life and work of this Czech composer who developed his career and recognition in Toronto, Canada. He still writes his first name as Oskar (which was by oversight reprogrammed during the printing as Oscar). His compositions are listed, even some recent ones that are still missing in the cunent dictionaries of music. Among Morawetz’s most frequently performed compositions are the Memorial to Martin Luther King (1968) and From the Diary of Anne Frank (1970. Two short poems by Vera Weislitz, survivor of the Terezin ghetto in her childhood, are very personal memories of the Holocaust. Her father, mother and sister figure in these terse “Stories for children” and “Mother’s Song,” written for her own children who want to know and understand her traumatic past experiences—and she can talk about it only in the stylized, poetic form. Last but not least is the second part of Erich Kulka’s “Escape from a Death Train,” continuing the narration of the events between January 1945 and the Liberation, when he and his young son were hiding, aided by their Czech friends. In his story we meet several courageous individuals and whole families that risked their lives to help the fugitive Kulkas until May 2, 1945, when the Russian soldiers arrived in Zlin. This experience and his current work with the 28 [pageend28]Yad VaShem Heroes’ and Martyrs’ Authority in Jerusalem make him deeply regret that too few persons from Czechoslovakia have been up to now allowed to personally attend the ceremony of the planting of a “tree of honor” or at least to accept the written notification of being included among the Righteous Gentiles. He made sure that his three principal rescuers were so honored. Only after the liberation did Erich Kulka find the details about the death of his wife Elly while she and her friends were escaping from another concentration camp. Olga, the widow of his late brother-in-law Milan and their two children, Dan and Leah, survived in another locality. Obituaries, errata, a list of Recommended Reading and a tear-out form addressed to the Dear Reader round off the contents of Review 2, 1988-89. ★ ★ ★ Joe Haines, MAXWELL (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1988, pp 525, $20.00) In 1923, Ludvik Hoch was born in Solotvina, a small village in poverty striken Ruthenia, then a part of Czechoslovakia. He was the oldest boy in an Orthodox Jewish family. At the age of 16, Hoch became a member of the Czech underground. During WWII he earned field commissions in the British Army and was awarded the coveted Military Cross. For security reasons he changed his name to Robert Maxwell. In postwar Germany—by then married and a British citizen—Maxwell was in charge of maintaining a free press in the British sector of Berlin. There he helped reestablish the famous Springer publishing house, an activity that began his career in mass media. As an international enterpreneur, Maxwell started twice with nothing and fought his way to worldwide recognition and success against all odds. This is a biography of an extraordinary man. It was written by Joe Haines, author and journalist, with full access to Maxwell’s archives, family and associates. No conditions were set as to how Haines would use these sources or as to interpretations and judgements he would make. The resulting book will be of interest to many reader groups. Jewish youth will find dramatic explanations how their ancestors in the “old country” survived the crushing poverty. Czechoslovak military historians will be tracing the 1939- 1940 odyssey of the Army and Air Force units finding their way from their Wehrmacht occupied homeland to the French front and finally to England. In 1940 the rebellious Hoch opted for the unglamorous Auxiliary Pioneer Corps of the British Army, preferring it to other units where discrimination made him uncomfortable. He ended with the rank of captain. His lack of formal education and being considered a “bloody Czech foreigner,” made the postwar climb difficult. Maxwell had enouch “cheek” to enter into playing many roles, all the way from a two-term member of the Parliament for the Labor Party to becoming one of the world’s leading mass media tycoons, including newspapers, books and magazine publishing; television and film producing; operating TV cable; printing as well as electronics manufacturing, politics, promoting sports clubs and events, and becoming Chair of Britain’s National AIDS Trust fund-raising efforts. Haines marks the milestones of Maxwell’s controversial life: military exploits on the western front; building up the Pergamon publishing empire, losing it and regaining control of it; the ins and outs of Labor politics; the incredibly creative promoting of modem science and technology; relentless 29 [pageend29]workaholic habits; the psychological makeup of a revered and/or dreaded globetrotting traveller; the devoted husband of Betty and beloved father of seven children who are as proud of him as he is of them. Still, all the newspaper, magazine and TV profiles of him cannot match the one statement by which his wife paid him an undoubtedly sincere tribute, when she said: “Living alongside you has made me find all other men colorless and other ways of life mediocre.” This would be an adequate last sentence for any conventional biography. However the book was finished while Maxwell was only 65 and still full of elan. In expectation of adventures yet to come, the author closed the book with “To be continued.” Frank Meissner ★ ★ ★ FINE ARTS NEW EXHIBITION AT THE BRITISH LIBRARY Christianity in Eastern Europe An exhibition to commemorate the millenium of the conversion of St. Vladimir of Kiev in 988 is organised by the British Library, Great Russell Street, London, from 9 December 1988 to the end of April 1989. The exhibition aims to illustrate the contrast between the Orthodox and Catholic cultures of Eastern and Central Europe. Religious manuscripts and early printed books from the British Library’s collections are on display in the Crawford Room at the British Library Galleries (British Museum building) and include the Ostrog Bible said to have belonged to Ivan the Terrible, lavishly illuminated book of prayers made for the Polish King Sigismund I, illuminated Gospels of the Bulgarian Tsar Ivan Alexander and others. The three Czech exhibits are: Bible Kutnohorská, the first Czech illustrated Bible printed in 1489 (Czech translation of the Bible was third in the European contex, after French and Italian. It influenced translations into other Slavonic languages). Ivančicky kancionál (Ivancice hymn-book) printed in 1564 in the secret press of the Unity of the Czech Brethren, contains woodcuts of biblical subjects and richly decorated borders and initial letters. These together with the high quality of typography make it one of the most beautiful Czech printed books of the 16th century. Sixtus of Ottersdorf’s Gradual is a large manuscript volume (78 x 50 cm) made in 1570 for the Utraquist chancellor of the Old Town of Prague. Hand production of the large size graduals, used by the “literati” brotherhoods for their church choir singing, continued in the Czech Lands until the beginning of the 17th century as they could not be printed because of their size. This particular example contains illuminated initials and scenes depicting contemporary life as well as music. A concert of East European sacred music will be given by Voces Angelicae on Tuesday 2nd march 1989 in St. George’s Church, Bloomsbury Way, London WC1. Further information available from Devana Pavlik, Slavonic and East European Collections, British Library, Great Russell Street, London WC1B 3DG.

The Emotions, a popular youth band, will begin the festivities on friday night at the Fayette County Fairgrounds where the young will have an opportunity to meet members and friends from throughout the state. A dance for the older crowd will be hel'd at the same location. The celebration will continue at the fairgrounds on the following two days with food, drink, music and dance. Czech and Slavic dance, choral and other musical groups will provide continuous entertainment. A folk dance and music ensemble will travel from Czechoslovakia to Texas to join the festivities. Another highlight will be a 10:00 A.M. Sunday morning Mass at Hostýn, Texas, and the unveilling and dedication of a monument at the Church to mark the centennial. Hostýn is a short drive south of La Grange and can be reached by driving south five miles on Highway 77 and west on FM 2436 to the Church. The Czech Catholic Union of Texas is composed of nearly 17,000 members of Czech Catholic ancestry and was founded on July 4, 1889, to provide protection primarily to surviving widows and children. The Union has evolved into a full fledged fraternal providing fraternity, religious and community work, life insurance and other benefits for its members. The fraternal has 108 lodges or societies located throughout the fertile blackland belt of Texas where the immigrants of the past century found their dreams of property ownership fulfilled. 31 [pageend31]ADVANCE ANNOUNCEMENT (A BROCHURE WITH COMPLETE INFORMATION WILL FOLLOW IN JANUARY, 1989) Sponsored by the Department of Germanic Languages and Literatures MUSIC AND GERMAN LITERATURE An International Symposium 6-9 April 1989 Levis Faculty Center, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign TOPICS: "Musical Terminology in Minnesong as Interpretive Point of Access" "Wort unde wise: The Medieval Poet-Musician" "Libretti without Scores: Problems in the Study of Early German Opera" "17th C.

Rediscovered, Restored, and Now on Video Cassette. n the day of August 20, 1968, a number of Czechoslovakians were in posession of government approved 16mm cameras, working on a variety of approved film projects. That night, and over the next few days, they turned their cameras on the invading armies of the Soviet Union and the other Eastern Block countries. The raw footage was stuffed into the suitcases, briefcases, and coat pockets of tourists, journalists, and diplomats headed west. Then, with support from the USIA, all of the film was gathered together and edited in Paris. The soundtrack is taken from the original radio broadcasts which as you know, were not effectively silenced during the invasion. Subtitles are in English. The completed film, called PRAGUE ’68. THE SUMMER OF TANKS, is a remarkable documentary of a nightmarish event. In the early 1970’s, for reasons still unexplained, all known copies of PRAGUE ’68 vanished without a trace. It remained a lost film until this year when a copy turned up in Philadelphia. After we restored the film, it was seen for the first time in many years, on August 21, 22, and 23, 1988, in Toronto, at the Ontario Institute For Studies in Education. Everyone who saw the film asked if we would make it available on video cassette. We are very pleased to be able to do so now. The film was taken to a lab in New York and given a state-of-the-art, computer enhanced video transfer onto a 1" master. The clarity of the transfer is actually an improvement over the original film. This, in turn, was dubbed down to VHS format and it is in this format that we offer you... PRAGUE ’68, THE SUMMER OF TANKS. Yours Truly, Todd B.
