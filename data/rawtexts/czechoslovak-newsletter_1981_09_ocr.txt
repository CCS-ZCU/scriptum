Signs are becoming clearer that & new political trial is in the offing in Prague (see also Czechoslovak Newsletter, Vol. VI, No. 5/6, p. 2, and No. 7/8, p» 2). Eighteen human-rights activists have been indicted under Article 98 of the Penal Code (subversion in collusion with a foreign power), and the maximum sentence is expected to be demanded for them. Recently, Rudolf Battěk was sentenced to seven years in prison and Jiří Gruntorád to four years on charges of subversion (Czechoslovak Newsletter, Vol. VI, No. 7/8, p. 3), whereas none of the dissidents tried in October 1979 (Czechoslovak Newsletter^ Vol. IV, No. 11, p. 1) was given a prison term in excess of five years. The current situation in Poland is undoubtedly a factor in Czechoslovakia’s renewed policy of intimidation, the latest victim of which is Vladimír Nepraš. Nepraš, a signer of Charter 77 and a former journalist on the staff of Reporter during the Prague Spring, was arrested in Prague on July 23. Referring to the Stalinist trials of the 1950a, J. Sládeček (the pseudonym of an author still living in Czechoslovakia) in his book Osmašedesátý [The Eighty-Sixth] (Colognes Index, 1980) wrote.’ c’The trials were first of all a Satanic plan to shape both nations Cthe Czechs and the Slovaks] into a uniform, conforming mass. To a certain extent the plan has been successful for some time — and the time is not yet over. It was directed against those who had the will and capacity to think and act independently, and even against those who had not yet shown these tendencies but might develop them. . . . Especially threatening were those who showed the finest human qualities: courage and dedication, strong 1 [pageend1]2 faith and idealism. They were regarded as a potential danger to a regime that prefers people submissive, disciplined and selfish. They were the men who had gone to fight in Spain, who were shot down in British bombers over Nazi Germany, who risked their lives in the resistance movement during the protectorate Cover Bohemia and Moravia under Nazi rule]. All such were in danger, and many were liquidated as a preventive measure.” As Sládeček wrote, that ’’time is not yet over,” for the Sovietization of Czechoslovakia’s ’’real” socialism is continuing, and the regime is poised for the preventive liquidation of the courageous and dedicated in order to preserve the privileges of the communist new class. The expected trial is likely to focus on the smuggling of books and periodicals to Czechoslovakia through dissidents’ ’’subversive” contacts with political emigres (Czechoslovak Newsletter, Vol. VI, No. 5/6, p. U). One witness who may well be called is Josef Hodic, the spy whose well-publicized return to Prague from Vienna in July has strained Aus- tro-Czechoslovak relations and caused the postponement of an official visit to Vienna by President Gustav Husák. Many human-rights and other organizations in the West have already spoken out on behalf of the accused, including Amnesty International, the International Committee for Support of Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia, the European Parliament, the French Socialist Party and the Vest German Social Democratic Party. The Council of Free Czechoslovakia joins those in the West who are trying to call maximum international attention to the impending trial and urges that protest letters should be sent to Gustáv Husák, President of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, Prague; Dr. Antonin Kaspar, Minister of Justice, Vyšehradská 16, Prague 2; and Dr. Jan Feješ, Prosecutor General, Náměstí hrdinů, Prague-Nusle. The accused are: A.

Jiri Muller is to be dealt with separately, the same report said. Footnote: H.

MOSCOW EXPANDS THE BREZHNEV DOCTRINE East Europe’s leaders made their annuel pilgrimage this summer to pay homage to Leonid I. Brezhnev, the supreme communist leader, at his retreat in the Crimea, including Gustav Husák, President of Czechoslovakia and secretary general of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. After Brezhnev’s last guests, Stanislaw Kania, first secretary of the Polish United Workers (communist) Party, and Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Polish prime minister, had returned to Warsaw, th® Presidium of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union convened to issue a stiff declaration signaling Moscow’s wish to broaden the Brezhnev Doctrine. Pravda (Truth), the Soviet Central Committee daily, on August 23 called on the leaders of East Europe to observe strictly the Marxi st-Leziinist line of ’’real socialism,” to enforce, ’’democratic centralism” and the leading role of the party, to educate workers in the spirit of ’’unbreakable friendship” with the Soviet Union, and to increase ’’revolutionary vigilance” and stop ’’counterrevolutionary forces” while there was still time. In the light of events in Poland Moscow is afraid lest similar developments take place elsewhere among its dependencies. Prague is the most willing subscriber to an expanded Brezhnev Doctrine. One facet of the Soviet strategy is to step up the economic integration of the communist bloc. To this end, East European capitals were warned not to become overdependent on the West by accepting further credits. This could have widely [pageend3]4 felt consequences. If the strategy is successful, the economies and standard of living of the East European countries could be dragged further down toward the level of the Soviet Union. For Czechoslovakia’s communist rulers this poses a dilemma. Politically they embrace the Brezhnev Doctrine for their own protection, but its economic impact could cause serious difficulties to the sagging Czechoslovak economy, which needs hard currency to buy advanced Western technology to revitalize the obsolete equipment of its factories. They have been trying with little success to increase labor productivity without Western assistance* In their public utterances they admit frankly that Czechoslovaks may face a decline in their standard of living. Gone are the self-congratulatory statements about ’’the ever expanding socialist economy.” They have even invented a new slogan: now it is necessary ”to preserve the present standard of living” in order ”to improve the social security of the population.” In reality, the population is forced to pay for the security of its communist leaders, something the Poles are refusing to do. Whatever may befall in East Europe in the next few years, hard times loom both for the population at large and for the aging leadership in Moscow trying hard to preserve the status quo in its empire* MESSAGE FROM SOLIDARITY The congress of Solidarity, the independent Polish labor movement, in Gdansk gave its approval on September 8 to a message ”to the workers of Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Rumania, Hungary, and all the nationalities of the Soviet Union.” The message from ’’the first independent trade union in our postwar history” and ’’the authentic representative of ten million workers, which has come into existence as the result of strikes,” expressed support ”to those of you who have decided to embark on a very hard and difficult read, the road of struggle for a free worxers* movement.” The message caused a predictable uproar in the communist establishment of Czechoslovakia. (Czechoslovak Newsletter, Vol. VI, No. 7/8, p. 2, carried the announcement of the establishment of a clandestine Czechoslovak committee of free trade unions.) The Czechoslovak media denounced the message from Solidarity as a ’’counterrevolutionary act” aimed at liquidating socialism in Poland and jeopardizing world peace. They portrayed Solidarity as a reactionary force in league with ’’Western diversionist centers” that was trying to undermine the Polish economy by promoting the idea of "group ownership,” a tag referring to Solidarity’s demand that workers should be given the right to participate in the management of enterprises. According to Rudé právo (Red Right), the Czechoslovak Central Committee's daily, on August 3, this "would not only throw enterprises into complete disarray but is also patently antisocialist.” Participatory democracy is abhorrent to the leaders of "workers’ states.” Soviet and Czechoslovak commentary on events in Poland is evidently being [pageend4]sedulously orchestrated. Pravda of Moscow on September 21 quoted Rudé právo as calling for vigilance in the face of Polish developments that ’’recall events in Czechoslovakia in 1968 and Hungary in 1956*” CHURCH AND STATE IN THE COMMUNIST WORLD Relations between church and state in East Europe have recently improved in spite of the ’’high-pitched anticommunist propaganda . . . that is fed daily to the American audience.” So delegates Were told in a report presented to the Executive Committee of the Lutheran World Federation meeting in Turku, Finland, from August 4 to 13. No evidence of such an improvement in Czechoslovakia has been noted, however, and news of religious persecution there is certainly not ’’high-pitched anticommunist propaganda.” On the contrary, as Czechoslovak Newsletter has recorded, there are constant reports coming out of Czechoslovakia of continuing religious persecution. Even Cardinal František Tomášek, the archbinhop of Prague and Primate of Czechoslovakia, has felt constrained to complain about the obstacles put in the way of Czechoslovakia’s believers (Czechoslovak Newsletter, Vol. VI, No. 7/8, p. 6). Several recent episodes show that there has been no change for the better- Frantisek Lizna, a Jesuit and one of Czechoslovakia’s best-known priests, was thrown into jail on July 2? after two West German clergy who had visited him were stopped at the Czechoslovak-East German border. It took Lizna’s family and friends a week to find out that he was being held in Litoměřice prison on charges under Article 112 of the Penal Code (harming the state’s interests abroad). According to the police, the two Germans were carrying incriminating material that Lizna was sending to Keston College in England. It seems, however, that all they were in fact carrying was some widely available Catholic samizdat- Lizna*s troubles began as soon as he was ordained in 197^» He was allowed only to say his first Mass; after that the authorities refused to issue him the state license that would permit him to exercise his office. A signer of Charter 77, he has been allowed to work only as a medical orderly. Josef Kordik, a 33-year-old Catholic priest, was indicted on May 1^ under Article 178 of the Penal Code (obstructing the supervision of churches and religious organizations) foz- celebrating Mass after the authorities in Ústí nad Labem (North Bohemia) had revoked his license. According to Informace o Chartě 77 (Charter 77 Information), No. 6, 1981, religious literature, material about the monastic life, sermons, an address book, letters, and a samizdat periodical, Informace o církvi (Church Information), were seized in Kordik’s home. In an appeal to the Ministry of Culture, Kordik wrote: ”It is impossible for a single individual to register all the suffering the Church has undergone over the past 3^+ years [but] nothing can stop the resurrection of the Church. ... It prays for its enemies.” Přemysl Coufal, an ordained priest, was found dead in his apartment in [pageend5]6 Bratislava on February 26. In the summer of 1980, after a trip to Vienna, Coufal was called in by the police and invited to become an informer, an offer he refused. Thereafter he was kept under surveillance, and repeatedly asked friends to make it public if anything happened to him. His death was declared a suicide, but trustworthy sources said there were signs of violence on his face- Many people in Slovakia are convinced that troublesome clergy have been liquidated, and that his was another such case. The Times of London commented on April 18: ’’Two phrases applied to Christian communities living under communist regimes in Stalin’s day were * the church of silence’ and ’the suffering church.’ Now, after 30 years, the first of these slogans belongs to another era: everywhere except Albania, the church in Eastern Europe has found its voice. . • . The more dogmatic the regime —Albania, Rumania, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Rumania, Hungary in roughly descending order of severity— the worse the penalties. ... In Slovakia the penalties for participating in Christian youth activity are so severe that for the first time in a generation there is a move to reestablish some kind of catacomb church. According to one estimate, 60 percent of all practising Christians in Czechoslovakia are under 35* ” The New York Times on September 21 reported that pressure on the Roman Catholic church had increased in recent months. Two priests and two laymen are to go on trial on September 28 charged with trading illegally in religious literature. STATE OF SLOVAK LITERATURE Jan Kozák, ’’National Artist” and chairman of the Czechoslovak Writers’ Union which controls the country’s entire ’’normalized” literary output, claimed in the July 1981 issue of Slovenské pohl’ady (Slovak Views), the journal of the Union of Slovak Writers: ”We may say that in recent years our work has been successful and encouraging; the 1970s saw a significant upsurge in Czechoslovak literature.” Czechoslovak Newsletter has several times before recorded the lamentable situation in literary publishing in Czechoslovakia, the country of ’’Biafra of the spirit.” The following comments deal specifically with conditions in Slovakia and contradict Kozák’s sanguine appraisal. Nové slovo (The New Word), the Slovak Communist Party Central Committee weekly, conducted a survey among younger ’’approved” writers and published their answers in several summer issues- They were hardly encouraging. Luboš Juřík, author of a highly acclaimed novel, Emigranti (The Emigres), wrote that he could ’’recall no new literary work dealing with social awareness that one could argue over or that might influence our social and political life. . . . Let’s stop having illusions, let’s not knuckle under to the optimism of annual reports.” He continued wistfully: ”How many times a day I envy Ehrenburg or Hemingway for being free to travel the world and learning to know it. . . • How many of us can do that? Writers are no less the representatives of their country [pageend6]7 than, say, soccer players who go everywhere while a writer at best gets to the Adriatic coast where he has to live on canned food. These are matters that need urgent discussion. Problems will not go away if we keep quiet.” Peter Štrelinger: ”We are employed as movie house managers, editors, office clerks, theater consultants. ... We write at night or, if we are lucky, when we are given a grant — provided our employer will give us the time off. Few offices or enterprises do so very willingly.” Peter Ševcovič: ’’There is a great demand for satire. Good satirical works get written but remain in manuscript. When it comes to publishing them, people get scared. . . . Slovak socialist literature has to be free from subjective and pseudoprofessional judgments.” Ján Koška: ’’Literary criticism is pursued mainly in the form of unpublished reviews. . . . There are almost no reviewers whose approach is genuine and not self-centered. The centers of our literary lives seem to be led behind closed doors with an eye to considerations that are incomprehensible to most people.” Dušan Kužel: ’’There is a lot of talk about the crisis in literary criticism. ... It lacks any firm ideological and esthetic background. In short, what critics need is character, not just intelligence and education*.” These quotations have to be read within the framework of the country’s climate of oppression: their language has to be elliptical to pass censorship. The really outspoken Slovak writers like Dominik Tatarka, Zora Jesenská and Agneša Kalinová were silenced years ago when ’’normalization” replaced the heady days of 1988. Slovenské pohl’ady in the same July issue also published an assessment of the state of Slovak literature by the writer Rudolf Sloboda. Sloboda said: ’’Slovak writers need prodding, they need the whip. It seems that a thousand pages of text are enough to malt® a novelist. And if the writer embellishes his work with glamorous topics lifted from others, or even does so under advice., his book becomes untouchable and reviewers do better not to criticize it. The superficiality of our writers is so awful that they become incomprehensible. . . . One can see how little they think about their writing, how little rationality there is in their work, how little they know of theory. Theory is considered a bother. . . . Lies, hypocrisy, favoritism, chaos, willfulness and injustice reign when there is no chance to establish a hierarchy of values.” These are the words of one who knows the situation first-hand. The fact that the monthly found the courage to publish a commentary so much at variance with the usual eulogies in praise of the party that official Slovak writers had trotted out at the Sixteenth Congress of the Communist Party of Czechlslovakia last April, not to mention the Slovak party congress the previous month, shows that the situation on the literary front has reached such a low point that open admission of it is now unavoidable. [pageend7]8 LITERARY EVENTS OUTSIDE CZECHOSLOVAKIA An international congress on the theme ’’The Writer and Human Rights” is to be held at the University of Toronto, Canada, from October 1 to 4. Some forty eminent writers, journalists and critics from Europe, the Americas, Africa and Asia have been invited to attend. The purpose of the congress is to affirm the principle of universal respect for human rights without regard to ideological commitment, to draw attention to the plight, of imprisoned writers, and to raise funds for Amnesty International. The chairman of the congress will be the internationally honored Czech author Josef Skvorecký, who left Czechoslovakia after the Soviet-led invasion of 1968. A member of the Council of Free Czechoslovakia, he now teaches English literature at the University of Toronto. One of those who will attend will be the Czech dissident Jiri Grušą whose book Dotazník 'The Questionnaire) has already been translated into French and German and will soon be published in English. ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ The International Committee for Support of Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia, in Paris, has given its 1981 Jan Palach Award to the Czechoslovak samizdat press, Edice Petlice (Padlock Editions). The 25,000-French-franc award was accepted on behalf of Edice Petlice by Jan Vladislav, a Czech poet and Charter 77 signer, who was forced to emigrate at the beginning of this year and now lives in Paris. MARXISM’ LENINISM AND CREATIVE THOUGHT In an article, ’’Criticism and the Courage to Think Creatively,” published in No, 18, 1981, of Nové slovo (The New Word), the Slovak Communist Party Central Committee weekly, Academician Andrej Siráoký has explained how correctly applied Marxist principles can solve serious social problems. Gustav Husák, president of Czechoslovakia and secretary general of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, he wrote, has said that ”we are often unable to solve problems and make no effort to analyze the tensions that exist between project and reality, between theory and practice. . ♦ . There are reasons why tensions exists among people, between party members and noncommunists, between officials and the man in the street. . . . These problems are not just the result of bad habit: they go deeper. They have theoretical and political origins that affect the whole of society, its thinking, morals, attitudes and general concerns. There is no general panacea, but concrete cases should not be hard to solve. ... We must remember the thoughts of Leonid I. Brezhnev and Gustav Husák on the need for criticism and self-criticism. ... We realize, however, that criticism and the courage to think creatively have limits. They must be rooted in the certainties and truth of Marxist materialist dialectic, and the creative, all-encompassing system of Marxism-Leninism in general.” [pageend8]
