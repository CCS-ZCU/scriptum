Již pouhý výčet osobností, které stály u zrodu Československé společnosti pro vědy a umění v roce 1958 a které od té doby působily v jejich řadách, svědčí o jejím zcela mimořádném postavení a jsem rád, že se mi v minulosti dostalo té cti, abych se stal jejím čestným členem. Pevně věřím, že i další činnost Československé společnosti pro vědy a uměni bude obohacením vědeckého poznání a současně přispěje k řešení těch nejpalčivějšich problémů, před kterými dnešní svět stojí. Přeji Vám všem mnoho úspěchů ve Vaší záslužné činnosti. svu [pageend1]The President of the Republic Dear friends and members of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences: On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences let me first of all thank you for the invaluable service that the Society provided during the course of its existence to the preservation of the Czech republic’s greatest national treasure, namely to the preservation of those intellectual values which were suppressed and trampled underfoot in our country - along with those who maintained them - and which, thanks to the efforts of your Society were not only able to survive but to further fruitfully develop. If one only takes into account the number of outstanding personalities who were among the founding members of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences in the year 1958 and who continued working for its aims, one has proof enough of the extraordinary character of the Society and I am very proud that in the past I was chosen to be its Honorary Member. I am deeply convinced that the future activity of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences will lead to the the enrichment of scholarly understanding and at the same time will contribute to the solution of the most pressing problems the world faces today. I wish you much success in your praiseworthy endeavors. Signature: Vaclav Havel Zprávy SVU (SVU News). Editor Andrew Elias, IO7L3 Howerton Avenue. Fairfax, VA 22030, tel. (703) 273-8565.

Present were eight members, representing sufficient number to constitute the quorum. The Executive Board noted with appreciation the congratulatory letter from President Vaclav Havel on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences. The verbatim reproduction of President Havel's letter, with English translation, appears elsewhere in this issue of Zprávy SVU. The first order of business was the follow-up on the SVU World Congress in Bratislava. Following the financial report of Past Secretary- General Vera Ulbrecht, Rechcigl informed the Board of Professor Tkac’s letter, expressing satisfaction with the payment of the outstanding bills. The idea of publishing selected papers from the Congress has been tentatively tabled, pending the submission of a realistic proposal. Next on the agenda was a discussion of Rechcigl's draft of the Society's Mission Statement. Apart from stylistic changes, it was suggested that an additional area of emphasis be added to current SVU priorities, i.e., to serve as a focal point for the developing civil society. The other priorities are: 1. to enhance and promote Czech and Slovak culture, 2. to coordinate and assist the work of SVU members, 3. to foster cooperation between scientists, artists, and other professionals, as well as with cultural institutions in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, and those abroad, 4. to assist with the preservation of Czech and Slovak cultural heritage abroad. The revised SVU Mission Statement is printed below. It bears directly not only on the future of SVU but also on the question what the Society can offer its members and ipso facto on the recruitment of new members. Vice President Jaroslav Verner has the responsibility of translating these aspirations into a practical menu of services which could be offered to potential SVU members. With reference to membership and our services, some time was devoted to the discussion of the SVU Clearinghouse, based on the materials prepared by Juraj Slavik. Since the previous experiences with various questionnaires, published in Zprávy SVU or sent directly to members by mail, were largely unsuccessful, it was felt that we ought not to pursue this approach. Instead, it was felt that it would be by far more practical, to simply announce the existence of such Clearinghouse in Zprávy SVU and give Juraj Slavik's name, phone and fax numbers, as the main contact. In case of inquires, he would then contact the relevant people to render possible assistance. Individual Executive board members offered 3 [pageend3]assistance in helping with networking. Publications have always been considered a cornerstone of SVU activities. Based on Professor Machann's report, the monograph containing selected talks from the 1997 Conference in Texas is in press. There is a separate announcement of the book in this issue of Zprávy. We urge members to send in their orders as soon as possible. The Executive Board commented favorably on the appearance and contents of Zprávy SVU and expressed thanks to Dr. Andrew Elias for his good work. In order to assure that news is not out of date it was recommended that the Editor includes in each issue a specific deadline for submission of the news items. Another delay in the issuance of the next issue of the English periodical/řoímaí was received with regret and concern by the Executive Board. In the meantime, Vice President Josef Machac and his committee are proceeding with the in-depth evaluation of the periodical with the aim of making it a viable enterprise. The upcoming SVU Conference in Minnesota is taking shape. Based on Rechcigl's report, the central theme of the Conference will be "Czech and Slovak America - Quo Vadis?" Three general areas will be covered in the program: The historic and contemporary issues relating to Czech and Slovak Americans, the preservation of our cultural heritage abroad, and the relations with the Czech and Slovak Republics. The Conference will culminate with the address by President Havel. Professor Josef Mestenhauser was designated as the conference coordinator. Considerable time was devoted to the discussion of the next SVU World Congress, scheduled for the year 2000 in Washington, D.C. This will be an extraordinary event - our 20th World Congress - which will take our Society into the next Millennium. As was reported earlier, the Congress will congregate on the campus of American University which is offering the Society a number of advantages. The tentative dates for the Congress are August 9-13, 2000. The local arrangements are in the hands of the SVU Washington D.C. Chapter, under the chairmanship of Dr. Alexej Borkovec. The logistics are coordinated by Dr. Vera Borko- vec, who is a Professor at American University, and the Local Arrangements Committee, which she is assembling. In this connection, Vice President Milton Cerny and Mila Rechcigl had a very successful meeting with Claudio Grossman, Dean of the Washington College of Law, who offered SVU facilities of his school for the Congress. At the suggestion of Milton Cerny, the Executive Board agreed that the central theme of the Congress will be "Democracy and the Civil Society to the 21st Century." As an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary society, we'll also have the customary sessions and symposia based on various disciplines. Another meeting is planned with the President of the American University Dr. Benjamin Ladner. 4 [pageend4]The last item on the agenda was the question of preservation of our cultural heritage abroad, a new project which is spearheaded by Rech- cigl. In this connection, as was reported previously, the Society has been awarded a grant from the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs to survey historical sites and monuments, and the archival material relating to Czech Americans. This announcement was placed in various newspapers and newsletters in US, Canada and Europe, as well as on Internet, with the aim of stimulating interest among our people as well as the general public. A detailed account of the project was published in Czech the News. The project is envisioned as a long-term and broadly based effort, involving close cooperation with individual Czech American organizations and the relevant institutions in the Czech Republic, such as Náprstek Museum. It is our hope to eventually enlarge the project to also include the Slovak materials with the cooperation of the relevant Slovak organizations in America. The key Czech American organizations were invited to join the National Heritage Commission, the makeup of which is being finalized. Apart from the SVU, which is coordinating the overall effort, the following societies agreed to join this important undertaking: Czechoslovak National Council of America, American Sokol, CSA, SPJST, RVOS, Czech Heritage Society of Texas, Moravian Heritage Society, Czech and Slovak Heritage Association of Maryland, American Czechoslovak Club of North Miami. Additional organizations would be welcome. ČESKOSLOVENSKÝ ÚSTAV ZAHRANIČNÍ přeje všem přátelům, čs. krajanům a jejich spolkům a sdružením v novém roce 1999 hodně štěstí a radosti, dobré zdraví a mnoho úspěchů v práci i osobním životě. / Jaromír ŠLÁPOTA Josef KOLÍNSKÝ předseda ředitel 5 [pageend5]New Faces on SVU Executive Board JAROSLAV VERNER, voted as one of our new vice-presidents during the last election, was bom in Minneapolis and raised in St. Paul, Minnesota. His parents were very active in the Czech community in the Twin Cities and he grew up in that milieu. Czech was spoken at home and, after a long period when he refused to speak anything but English, he too realized the advantages knowledge of another language can bring and made an conscious effort to improve his knowledge and use of Czech. Jaroslav started his education in the St. Paul public schools, earned his BA at the University of Minnesota in Russian language and Russian Area Studies, and did graduate work at the Russian Institute of Columbia University. After finishing college and before entering graduate school he did a tour with the U.S. Army in Korea. With his wife Lois, Jaroslav biked in Europe for four months in 1957. It was during this trip that they made their first of many trips to Czechoslovakia. Jaroslav left Columbia University with a Master's degree in history and a certificate from the Russian Institute and traveled to Moscow to participate in the U.S. National Exhibition in 1959. His experience there led him to choose a career in the Foreign Service with the United States Information Agency (USIA) rather than the Department of State. Asked why he chose USIA over State, he just shrugged and said, "More interesting people.” The Verners' first assignment abroad was in Zagreb, Yugoslavia which was essentially a training assignment. From there Lois and Jaroslav were transferred to the American Consulate in Poznan Poland where they lived and worked from 1961 to 1964. The Consulate consisted of three American diplomats and their families and they were responsible for American interests in all of Western Poland. While in Poznan Lois and Jaroslav were sent to Brno to assist in the initial U.S. participation in the Brno Trade Fair. The Verners returned to the United States on leave in time for their first daughter to be born before they returned to Zagreb for a second tour there. This second Zagreb tour was cut short when Lois and Jaroslav were asked to return to the Soviet Union to work with two American traveling exhibitions. During the next year they took the exhibitions to six different Soviet cities for a couple of months each, giving them considerable experience in the Soviet provinces before being assigned to Moscow in the Fall of 1967. While in Moscow Jaroslav received an invitation from the Czechoslovak Ministry of Post to give a lecture on the postal service of the Czechoslovak Legions in Siberia at a seminar on Czechoslovak stamps which was held in the summer of 1968, thus bringing them to Prague during the Prague Spring. They returned to Moscow just 10 days before 6 [pageend6]the Warsaw Pact forces invaded Czechoslovakia. Following a tour in Washington, where their second daughter was born, and a year at the National War College, the Verners were off to four years in Kabul, Afghanistan. Life in the Hindu Kush was like nothing they experienced before or since, "like living in the pages of the National Geographic," he noted. For sharp contrast, the next assignment took them to Hamburg for four years. The following four years were spent in Washington before returning to Moscow in 1984 where Jaroslav was the Press Attache during the following intense, turbulent and historical four years. USIA recognized that the Verners need a respite after their grueling time in Moscow so it sent them to the "quiet" of East Berlin. There, looking forward to a period less turbulent, Lois and Jaroslav witnessed the occupation of the Embassy, the collapse of the German Democratic Republic, the unification of Germany, and the fall of communism throughout Eastern Europe. Jaroslav ended his career by assisting in opening the American Embassy in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, one of the successor states to the Soviet Union. Throughout his career he worked in the area of public affairs, that is, those aspects of diplomacy that reach out to the peoples of other societies to "tell America's story to the world," as the motto of USIA has it. Along the way he learned Polish, Croatian, and German in addition to the Czech and Russian he spoke when he began his diplomatic career. With retirement, Jaroslav has more time to follow many of his interests including his life-long interest in Czechoslovak philately. ♦ ♦ ♦ EVA VANEK is the newly elected Secretary-General of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences.

Vyznamenání členům SVU Dodatečně se dovídáme, že několik dalších členů SVU bylo vyznamenáno řádem TGM a sice prof. Victor M. Fic, historik dr. Vilém Prečan a prof. Erazim Kohák. Wem upřímně gratulujeme. Activities of SVU Members JAN F. TRISKA, Past President of SVU, is the author or the recent publication, The Great War's Forgotten Front. A Soldier's Diary and a Son's Reflections, published by the East European Monographs in Boulder, CO and distributed by the Columbia University Press. It is an authentic story of a front-line soldier on the Austro-Italian front in World War I. The book is of great value to historians for its first-person detail, and honest, eloquent and extraordinarily vivid narrative. The soldier's son, a professor emeritus of political science at Stanford University, provides commentaries on the soldier's background and experiences as well as a frame of reference for the times, places, and events which characterize the soldier's war. In addition, he reflects on the meaning of World War I for us today. He offers the view that the war was the great existential divide that not only changed the world but has defined much of the twentieth century. LEOPOLD POSPISIL, a former President of SVU, is the author of a monumental publication, Obernberg: A Quantitative Analysis of a Tirolean Peasant Economy, published by the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences. It is an exhaustive study of every aspect of economic life of an isolated Tyrolean farming village of about 300 inhabitants, based on painstaking research lasting some thirty years. The author 14 [pageend14]mapped fields to study years of crop rotation, timed farmers at their work, and drew upon detailed financial records for individual farms, cooperative agricultural and tourism enterprises, and the village itself. The study culminates in 1967, just before the completion of a modem highway linked Obernberg to the eternal world and drastically altered its economy and demography. His work led Pospisil to question theories of peasantry that stress small enclaves' isolation from the larger economy, or that contend on more ideological than verifiable grounds that peasants resist participation in a diversified market. The study is presented in quarto size 330 pages of double column text accompanied by beautiful full-page illustrations, 27 figures and maps, and 79 multi-page quantitative tables. As all his other work, Obernberg is marked by his insistence upon fluency in the language of the culture, incomparable fieldwork, a holistic approach to the intersection of culture, law and the economy, and the attention to definition and detail.

She is a doctor of philosophy, and holds a diploma in a theology and is a linguist of some ability. She writes poetry in both Czech and English and the last year the US National Poetry Library included her in its International Hall of Fame. Her works appear in four American anthologies of verse and two of her poems have been recorded on a CD "The Sound of Poetry." Dr. Gerzanic-Hons is a great promoter of cultural ties between Australia and the Czech Republic, and was instrumental in introducing Australian works of art in Prague. ZDENĚK MACKŮ. Tvorba: mal’ba, kresba, grafika, umělecké kováčstvo. Individuálně, kolektivne a skupinové výstavy od roku 1963. Zdeněk Macků a jedinečný charakter i štýl jeho mal’by hovoří o vel’kej autorskej ambícii formulovat’ svoj umělecký přejav jako jasnú, posobivú maliarsku správu o človeku, jeho živote a jeho zemi. Mal’ba, ktorou nás Z. Macků oslovuje — vizuálně i myšlienkou, podo- benstvom i poselstvom — má však v sebe aj kúzlo syntéz viacerých tendencií formy i duchovného obsahu umenia dob minulých a súčasných. Sám autor sa hlási k secesii i kubizmu, ale aj k exotickým kultúram starých Aztékov a Mayov, 15 [pageend15]k umeniu Japonska i k Pudovému výtvarnému prejavu. V rámci svojej syntézy formuluje svoj program poetického realizmu, ktorý akcentuje rytmus, kolorit i skladbu krátkých oblých a hranatých linií a ako obsahový princip zdórazňuje predovšetkým hravost', humor a vtip. Paradoxně „maliarsky grafizmus“ obrazov a kresieb Z. Macků hovoří o človeku i svete plnom rytmov života, farieb a úsměvu, ktorý je devízou i proti- kladom tých tienistejších stránok našej existencie. PhDr. BOHUMÍR BACHRATÝ GEORGE O. KRIZEK, M.D., washingtonský psychiatr, jehož koníčkem je entomologie (věda o hmyzu), objevil letos nového denního motýla pro území USA. V odborné terminologii je to t.zv. „State and U.S.A, record". K objevu nového motýla, modráska Hemiargus ammon Lucas, došlo 31. května 1998 na Floridě, a to na nejjižnější části, na jednom z řetězu malých korálových ostrovů, vybíhajících v délce více než 200 km jihozápadním směrem do Karibského moře. Lze hovořit o štěstí. Oblast, kde byl nový motýlí druh objeven (ostrov zvaný Big Pine Key), je velmi intezívně prozkoumávaná část floridské přírody, kam během posledních několika desetiletí jsou vysílány doslova stovky doktorandů, postgraduálních i jiných pracovníků z university v Gainesville na Floridě, sídla několika špičkových světových entomologů. Že objev čekal na motýlkáře z celkem malé středoevropské země, je opravdu pozoruhodné. Nejpřednější entomologické časopisy nyní publikují barevné fotografie nově objeveného motýla, jejž Dr. Křížek fotografoval v jeho původním habitatu, tropickém terénu ostrova Big Pine Key. Dr. CARMEN MAYEROVA (recently retired from Temple University, Philadelphia) was awarded a medal by Charles University Prague in recognition of her many contributions, including developing the new Political Science Department at the School of Social Sciences (Fakulta sociálních věd), a six-year teaching span and publication of a handbook of Comparative Politics. This honor occurred during the 650th anniversary celebration of the Charles University. ZDENEK HRUBAN, Professor Emeritus in Pathology, was recently awarded the Medal of Merit of the First Degree by Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic. Hruban received this state decoration in the Library of Congress on Sept. 17 for “lifetime efforts in the promotion of Czech-American relations.” Attending the award ceremony were Madeleine Albright, Secretary of State, and Alexandr Vondra, Ambassador of the Czech Republic to the United States. Hruban established the Archives of Czechs and Slovaks Abroad at the Joseph Regenstein Library in 1972 with the help of the late Vaclav Laska, a former 16 [pageend16]Slavic bibliographer at the University. The archives contain personal material and the works of Czechs and Slovaks published outside the Czech and Slovak Republics. The archives are located in the Special Collections section of the library and consist of 260 shelves of books, brochures, periodicals, anniversary publications, almanacs and personal papers of Czechs and Slovaks living outside of the Czech Republic. The majority of the materials comprising the archives were published in North America during the past 150 years. University of Chicago Chronicle, Oct. 15, 1998 Zdenek Hruban (standing, at right). Professor Emeritus in Pathology, accepted the Medal of Merit of the First Degree from Vaclav Havel (center), President of the Czech Republic. The ceremony took place in the Library of Congress. Also attending the event was Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Vo Švajčiarsku vychádza ZPRAVODAJ, skvělý mesačník Čechov a Slovákov tam žijucích.

He was born in Dobříkov in eastern Bohemia on July 11, 1913. He studied law at Charles University, University of Grenoble and the Paris Sorbonne. During the early years of the Nazi occupation he was active in the National Alliance ("Národní souručenství") in an effort to help his subjugated nation. After the communist coup in 1948 he escaped and emigrated to Canada, and in 1955 to the US. He was an active member of the Agrarian Party in Exile and a frequent contributor to its publications. Ho was also a regular correspondent of Radio Free Europe. For two years he held the position as the Vice President and four years as President of the SVU New York Chapter. During his tenure, the NY Chapter was one of the most active SVU Chapters. In 1989 he published, under the aegis of the Cz. Republican Party in Exile, the book, Antonín Svehla, Profil československého státníka (222 pgs.), which was reprinted in 1990 in Prague. Most recently, he authored another important book, Agrární strana. Její rozmach a zánik (356 pgs.), published by Atlantis in Brno. He died after a short illness in Bethel, CT on September 24, 1998. Dr. Dostál, whom 1 knew personally, was a person of great ability, energy and impeccable character who will be sorely missed by his many friends and SVU members. Mila Rechcigl ♦ ♦ ♦ Charles Bruml (1912-1998) Charles Bruml, 85, a retired artist, and a long-time member of our Society, whose talent helped him survive Nazi concentration camps of World War II, died March 22 at the Powhatan Nursing Home in Arlington, VA. A native of Prague, where he was born on October 8, 1912, Mr Bruml retired in 1979 after 32 years with the commercial art firm of William P. Gelberg Inc. In Terezin and Auschwitz camps he was put to work painting numbers on uniforms and in the printing and engineering department. He survived the 40-mile death march in January 1945 from Auschwitz to Gleiwitz, where prisoners were being moved away from invading Russians. Mr. Bruml was liberated by British troops later that year. He met his wife, Dr. Hana Bruml, a clinical psychologist who had been in the same camps, for the first time at an office in Prague after the war. The couple married and then moved to the Washington area in 1947. Charles Bruml studied at the Corcoran School of Art. He displayed his paintings at galleries in the Washington area and at the Jewish Com- 19 [pageend19]munity Center of Northern Virginia.. His artifacts from the war, including the suitcase he carried on deportation transport, are part of the collection of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum. A videotaped interview with the Brumls, who had traveled back often over the years to the concentration camp sites, is also at the Museum.

Z ČINNOSTI S K U P I N MS SVU Švýcarsko Dne 14. června t.r. přednášel v sále Slovanského semináře univerzity v Basileji režisér a dramaturg Slovenského národního divadla v Bratislavě Martin Porubjak o vztahu české a slovenské divadelní kultury. Jeho přednáška našla živou odezvu v následující diskusi, která se dotýkala nejen kulturních, ale i politických vztahů mezi oběma zeměmi. M. Porubjak, někdejší poslanec a ministr poslední federální vlády, zodpověděl dotazy velmi kompetentně a s plnou otevřeností. Švýcarská skupina se spolu s Etnografickým ústavem AV ČR podílela na organizaci sympozia „Češi za hranicemi“, které se konalo ve dnech 29. a 30. června t.r. v rámci Týdne Čechů v zahraničí v Praze jako součást oslav 650. výročí založení Karlovy univerzity. Ve velkém sále rektorátu KU se sešlo na 400 účastníků z celého světa, aby tu diskutovali o svých zkušenostech, problémech i záměrech. Účast členů švýcarské skupiny byla překvapivě vysoká, mezi přednášejícími byli prof. J. M. Lochman, L. Pau- kertová, J. Stránský; předseda skupiny K. Hrubý působil jako moderátor. Naproti tomu na výzvu uveřejněnou v 1. čísle Zpráv SVU začátkem t.r. se přihlásili jen dva referenti ze Severní Ameriky, prof. M. Povolný a prof. O. Ulč, což bylo řadou severoamerických účastníků považováno právem jako nedostatečné. Ze sympozia bude vydán obsáhlý sborník a na žádost většiny účastníků bude podobné sympozium svoláno do Prahy znovu v roce 2000. Dne 21. srpna 1998 se v kinosále Uměleckého muzea v Bernu promítaly české a slovenské filmové týdeníky zachycující průběh okupace Československa před třiceti lety a dva krátké filmy o Janu Palachoví. Večer uvedl předseda skupiny K. Hrubý stručným historickým přehledem; o překlad textu týdeníků pro švýcarské diváky se postaral ing. L. Křivánek. Potěšitelná byla účast mladší exilové generace, která si tu připomněla osudové udá21 [pageend21]losti, jež zažívala ještě v dětském věku či znala jen z vyprávění rodičů. Zájem obecenstva byl takový, že sedadla nestačila — mnoho diváků se proto usadilo na zemi či postávalo u zdi. Dokumentární film „6. prapor“, zachycující osudy pronásledovaných a diskriminovaných za Slovenského štá- tu, byl 3. září vysílán německou televizí. Je prací místopředsedy ŠS Dušana Šimko a Mirka Pazdery. 20. listopadou pořádala švýcarská skupina ve spolupráci se spolkem Domov v Basileji čtení z nové divadelní hry Julia Effenberga o Janu Masarykovi. Je to psychologické drama člověka, který usiluje o lidskost a přátelství mezi lidmi a je přitom zahnán do bezvýchodné situace. Účinkovali Marta Lachová z Berlína a autor. Večer měl vysokou uměleckou úroveň. Nejvýznamnější akcí tohoto roku byl bezpochyby vzpomínkový večer 25. listopadu v Bernu, jímž Češi a Slováci vyjádřili svůj dík Švýcarsku za velkorysou pomoc před třiceti lety. Tehdy otevřelo Švýcarsko své hranice více než 12.000 Čechů a Slováků a poskytlo jim možnost důstojného života ve svobodě. Koncertní sál hotelu Bellevue byl zcela zaplněn oficiálními zástupci švýcarské vlády, parlamentu, církví, univerzit a četných dalších kulturních, hospodářských i politických institucí. Z celého Švýcarska se sjelo více než 400 Čechů a Slováků, takže prostorný sál byl zaplněn do posledního místa. Večer zahájil jménem SVU, Svazu spolků Čechů a Slováků ve Švýcarsku a velvyslanectví ČR místopředseda ŠS-SVU doc. Dušan Šimko. Shromáždění pak pozdravil krátkým projevem velvyslanec České republiky Dr. R. Belcredi. Po něm se ujal slova zástupce švýcarské vlády ministr hospodářství Pascal Couchepin, který ocenil přínos československého exilu k prohloubení spolupráce a přátelství mezi Švýcarskem a Českou i Slovenskou republikou. Slavnostní projev měl prof. J. M. Lochman, rector emeritus Basilejské univerzity, který zhodnotil, čeho se tehdy našim exulantům ve Švýcarsku dostalo a Češi a Slováci naopak Švýcarsku přinesli. I když většina exulantů přicházela s prázdnýma rukama, jejich hlavy nebyly prázdné. V kulturním, hospodářském i veřejném životě hostitelské země je jejich působení zřetelné. Československému exilu se ve Švýcarsku dostalo skvělé příležitosti rozvinout plně schopnosti a dovednosti, které ve svém domově nemohli pro politickou diskriminaci uplatnit. Za to patří Švýcarské konfederaci upřímný dík. Po projevu prof. Lochmana následoval koncert ze skladeb A. Dvořáka, B. Martinů a B. Smetany pro housle a klavír. Vynikající český houslový virtuos Josef Suk za klavírního doprovodu Roberta Kolínského nadchl posluchače svým vřelým, hluboce procítěným přednesem a připravil tak posluchačům opravdu nezapomenutelný zážitek.
