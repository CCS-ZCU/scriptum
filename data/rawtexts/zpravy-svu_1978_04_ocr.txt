Exhibits and Other Special Events - for time and place see the Program CZECHOSLOVAK SOCIETY OF ARTS AND SCIENCES There are no statistics, only estimates of the number of Czech and Slovak intellectuals abroad. The first Czech refugees from religious persecution by the Hapsburg counter-reformation during the Thirty Year’s War (1618-1648) arrived in New York • the New Amsterdam; the most prominent one among them was Augustin Heiman, later known as ‘Lord of Bohemia Manor’. During the 18th century Moravian Brethern immigrated and established the Moravian Brethern Church of America, with centers in Bethlehem, Pa., and Winston-Salem, N.C. But while a great many Czech and Slovak emigrants settled in the United States starting in the 1860s, before 1939 it was rare for a university professor, writer, or artist to leave Czechoslovakia for permanent settlement abroad. Then came World War II. The Nazi onslaught precipitated the the emigration or escape of some 20,000; among these exiles, at least one-fourth were intellectuals. At the war’s conclusion, some returned to Czechoslovakia. Many, however, remained in the United States, Canada, England, Erance and other Western countries. A still greater exodus began in 1948 after the February coup in Czechoslovakia. In the decade following that coup, over 60,000 people escaped to the West; it is estimated that about one-tenth of these emigrees, some 6,000 are intellectuals, scholars and professional people. Most of .them found their way to the United States, Canada and Australia, while a few hundred established themselves in Western Europe and various countries in Central and South America, Asia and Africa. In the fifties it became increasingly difficult for Czechs and Slovaks to emigrate from Czechoslovakia either legally or by illegal crossing the borders, and the influx of Czech and Slovak refugees into the United States was reduced to a trickle. But after the liberalized Dubček regime was crushed by the invasion of the Warsaw powers in August 1968, another large exodus followed, again largely consisting of in- tellectuas, some of whom were admitted to the United States or Canada, while this time a majority stayed in Western Europe. During the fifties, intellectuals who had managed to leave Czechoslovakia and gain permanent residence in the United States felt increasingly the need of maintaining and further developing Czecho29 [pageend29]Slovak culture, while in Czechoslovakia history was being rewritten as if Orwell’s *1984’ had been advanced by thirty years and the writings of past and present Czech and Slovak authors were on the proscribed lists.In 1958, a group of scholars led by the late prof. Vaclav Hlavatý, the mathematician of the University of Indiana, and Dr. Jaroslav Němec of theNational Library ofMedicine began to organize these intellectuals throughout the world into a society of arts and sciences. In I960 the Society became incorporated under the laws of the State of New York, as a Not-for-Profit Corporation, assuming its present name Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences in America, Inc. Its activities, as outlined in its bylaws, consist in supporting and coordinating the educational, scholarly, literary and artistic endeavors of Czech and Slovak intelligentsia abroad, but the concept of the Society has broadened into that of an organization open to all scholars, regardless of national background, who are genuinely interested in the advancement of Czechoslovak scholarship. By a ruling of the U.S. Treasury Department in 1962, contributions to the organization are tax deductible. The Society is known among Czechs and Slovaks as SVU, an abbreviation of its name in the Czech or Slovak languages. From its inception the Society has maintained its nonpolitical character and refused to become an instrument of the cold war. The membership, of course, is opposed to any totalitarian ideology, be it of the right or the left, knowing that culture and freedom are inseparable. PUBLICATIONS The organization has embarked upon an ambitious publishing program. Among its first publications was a monograph on the composer Antonín Dvořák, by the composer Karel B. Jirák, late of Roosevelt University. In 1963,Mouton and Co. of The Hague, published for the Society the Essays on Czech Literature by Rene Wellek of Yale University. Papers delivered at the Society’s first two congresses (1962 and 1964) were published by Mouton & Co. under the titles The Czechoslovak Contribution t° World Culture and Czecho- vakia, Past and Present respectively, both edited by^the present president of the Society, Dr. Miloslav Rechcigl, head of research of the Agency for International Development In connection with the 300th anniversary of the death of Jan Amos Comenius (1592-1670) several English translations of Comenius’ works and a volume of essays onCome- nius (papers delivered at the Society’s 1970 congress) were published, partly in cooperation with the Department of Slavic Languages and Literature of the University of Michigan. The same cooperative effort also produced a unique bilingual (English and Czech) Anthology of Czech Poetry, edited by Prof. Alfred French of the University of Adelaide. In 1971 the Society published with the cooperation of the Uni30 versity of Michigan, a collection of brilliant essays in the [pageend30]Czech and Slovak languages, Studies in Verbal Art by Prof. Roman Jakobson of Harvard University. Many other publications followed, a bibliographical directory of members (a new edition to be released this year), and a number of publications in the Czech language - a novel, poetry, essays, and others. Recently the Society has published a monograph on Czechoslovak Military Justice during World War U, in the English language and has initiated a new series of occasional papers. As its special contribution to the USA Bicentennial, the Society has published a monumental bibliography on Czechs and Slovaks in North America, the result of meticulous work of librarian Esther Jeřábek, a second generation of Czech descent. Since 1959, the Society has been publishing an information bulletin Zprávy SVU (News of SVU); since January of 1964 it has been publishing a quarterly for literature, philosophy and the arts, entitled Proměny (Metamorphoses). THE WORLD CONGRESSES The Society held its first world congress in April, 1962> in Washington, D.C. Since that time the Society’s congresses have been held bi annually, at Columbia University, New York University, Georgetown University, and George Washington University. This year’s congress at the Cleveland State University, to be held from October 26 through 29, is convened on the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the Society. OFFICERS AND MEMBERSHIP Present membership in the society exceeds 1,500. Dr. Miloslav Rechcigl, Jr., of the Agency for International Development, is president. He is assisted by five vice-presidents, Dr. Alexej Bořkovec of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Dr. Jan Gavora of the Canada Department of Agriculture, Dr. Josef Škvorecký, Czech writer and publisher, of Toronto, Dr. Tarnest Šturc of the International Monetary Fund, and prof.

A second European Conference organized by the society’s Swiss chapter, was held at Interlaken, Switzerland, September 17-19, 1976, on the theme ’ The Philosophy of Czech and Slovak History’; the same chapter is planning a comparable conference on literature to be held in the tall of this year.
