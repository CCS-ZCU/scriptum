Centre for Writers in Exile in Stockholm. Ivan Jelinek’s approached it from a poet’s point of view and we considered it eminently suitable for inclusion in this Poetry Issue of Ar e n a . (Editors.) I do not propose to deal with the theme as a historian, which I am not. I should like, however, to make a few observations, because, as a writer, I am much concerned with these words “history” and “imagination”. These, two words aptly express a serious, dangerous and largely self-afflicted dichotomy existing today in our European mind. On the one hand we are face to face with history presented as an alleged “reality”. We are told, and often we even try to persuade ourselves, that this reality is, in fact, a specific, autonomous, immovable and permanent entity which does not change once it has happened. It is alleged that this reality can be objectively apprehended and evaluated in a scientific way. We are told, or we tell ourselves, that history, that is events and deeds, both our own and those of other people, are independent from the doer, that they alone are the reality which exists. It is to this conception of history that imagination is usually opposed. I do not intend to discuss in what way imagination manifests itself in the works of professional historians. But history, or rather histories apodexis, if I may use the phrase of Herodotus, also concerns me as a poet. The confrontation of “history” and “imagination” 3 [pageend5]in the theme implies that imagination is something private, subjective, something which changes all the time and is not, therefore, of such consequence as “deeds” ; in one word gesta Orphed cannot equal gesta Romanorum in their weight and importance. We are told that imagination is less substantial, and less real if not altogether unreal. 1 do not share this opinion and for that reason the theme seems to me impossibly dualistic. What would history—i.e. that what has already happened, what is happening now and what will happen in the future —what would history be in any sphere, either public o t private, if it were not in my mind? Mind is, of course, a composite thing, consisting, if one wants to name some of its components, of the unconscious, sub-conscious, will, memory, imagination, inspiration, and so on. These various components of mind, such as imagination with which we now deal, operate through various layers of the mind and do it all the time whether we are awake or asleep. For that reason, in my opinion, one cannot separate one component of the mind, the imagination, from the other components ; this would equal examining a dead slide under a microscope and thinking that it was still living matter- This introduction was necessary because from now on I shall be using the term “mind” instead of “imagination” whenever speaking about the work of the writer. I have already posed the question where history would be if not in my mind? Another legitimate question ensues from the first one, namely: how could there exist an antithesis between mind and events? In my opinion there cannot be such a contrast. The Upanishads, which I like to read, say in one place: “My mind was elsewhere, I did not see, my mind was elsewhere, I did not hear.” And in the 4 [pageend6]same Upanishad, Brihadaranyaka, in the Fifth Brahm- ana, we further find: “What is to be known is a form of mind for mind is to be known.’’ For myself, I see no other possibility but to accept these propositions. I do not think that this is a very radical or controversial philosophical statement. After all, even an orthodox Marxist-Leninist historiographer changes event s through his dualistic perception, that is, he changes subject-object study into forms of his mind. For any writer it is of the utmost importance that already the first written human document, a work of history, was also a poem. This epos, the Epos of Gilgamesh, sums up our theme in its first lines in the following words: “This was the man (that is Gilgamesh) to whom all things were known; this was the king who knew the countries of the world. He was wise, he saw mysteries and knew secret things. He went on a long journey, was worn out with labour, and returning engrained on a stone the whole story.’’*) History and mind are the state of projection. What a perfect unity in these opening words of the most ancient epic! Here is the adventurer, the doer, here are his doings, and results of his doings, events ; here, finally, is Gilgamesh himself, becoming the recorder both of the fruits of his actions, and of his own feelings concerning them. The recorder, an ancient king of Uruk, is giving unity to everything in the projection of his mind. *) The Epic of Gilgamesh, translated by N. K. Sandars, Penguin Books Ltd., 1960. I shall not speak about Homer, nor shall I deal with Herodotos. I shall not dwell on Plato’s Poli- teia, produce of a formidable mind still directly acting upon other minds; Aldous Huxley’s ‘Island’ is 5 [pageend7]the most recent example. One might ask whether what is called imagination, inspiration, and so on, comes from the writer’s mind or from the outside world. In my opinion they are ingrained in the nature of things. When I write, the views I have expressed exist in my mind without having been taken from anywhere else, from the outside. History is for me inseparable from my mind; it is one of its forms, or if you wish, one of its concepts. I do not know, what comes first, whether history or imagination, if I want to preserve the two words and the meaning of the title. Such a dualism is impossible for me, yet I am also stamped by it. I am, therefore, at a great disadvantage in comparison with Homer’s Odysseus. His history progressed without our familiar anthithesis; it was all of one piece. It made sense; it was logical, beautiful, terrifying precisely because of its unity with his mind, precisely because of its non-dualistic nature. Whenever his mind was most active, it revealed itself, as it were, as an act, anticipated in the future, or as his great protector, Pallas Athene. Moreover, I am not sure how these two concepts, if I still conceive of them separately, would stand as regards time. Where would they stand in time? Both experience and science tell us that time is a very elusive thing. It is continually displaced from the mathematical rigidity of the clock-face. Single sections of time are not of the same length. And in our mind we do not feel them as of equal duration. We are all familiar with the commonplace notion: how short, alas, is the moment of happiness; how fleeting is youth; how long unhappiness; how impossibly long waiting is. And next comes the time-sequence. Light, by the marvel of which we see the distant galaxies, takes 6 [pageend8]two thousand million years to reach the eye of the observer at his telescope. When an astronomer looks \into space he looks into the past- When he does It tomorrow he will still, by necessity, look into past. \Vhat a curious blend of tenses this is! This gives me courage to put, in all earnestness, the following question: “Had I died before I began to write?”, or, conversely, “Shall I be born after I will have finished writing?” Now, what do these things mean for me in practice? The problem of history and mind, the problem of time in its historical sequence, kept me busy from the very beginning of my literary work in a quest for knowledge by means of poetry. Some irresistible urge made me mix tenses, past, present and future. I did this at first almost without knowing and arbitrarily. Then I was excited when I discovered that it could be quite effective to have—as one of the possible solutions,—in a poem the past tense following the present tense and the future preceding the present. But then I did not know about the astronomer who will, tomorow, look into past. In this way my mind began to work on my history. But later, after my personal history and all other histories had grown in length, I despaired. Whenever I tried to look at my history, in the sense of my introductory remarks, I only found appalling chaos. I saw some (Lisiecta membra and thought that if there were scattered parts these must have remained from some former whole. Who was it who smashed this former unity? I looked on jumble, on events, happy or unhappy. This jumble did not give any story. There was no sense to it, it was not governed by any law. I was told that some historians also have a similar feeling when confronted by their material; they wonder whether there is a meaning— economic laws, the hand of Providence or what have 7 [pageend9]you. But then I realized that I only had this feeling when I had the dualistic approach, when I was under the delusion that history and mind were two different and independent entities. So I told myself: why not begin with breaking this arbitrary, nonsensical chain of the old-fashioned time-sequence? I hoped that if I reject the time-sequence some sense would be revealed in my histories. But the trouble was that I did not know which of the many possible methods I should adopt in order to rearrange time, events and mind into a coherent and meaningful pattern. Trying to put my decision into practice I made a pretty mess of many things. And I am afraid that I still do. My efforts, however, also yielded some results. Histories ceased to be the forbidding disiecta membra which I mentioned; they became connected, they began to live as a single organism. They are resurrected becoming the body to the mind. And, on the other hand, when I asked that certain It, which the poets used to call their Muse, to grant me a moment of imagination, then histories entirely new to me appeared in my mind. I had to ask myself: Who brings forth this new reality or whom does this new reality bring forth? And what is the nature of the time- space and time-sequence in which this happens? At long last, various goings-on, acts and deeds, in short history, as apprehended by my mind, ceased to put claims on me and reproach me, but also began to give. You may ask in what respect? In my writing, of course. It is enough to say that this giving was completely different from what I had expected. Further, I noticed that as soon as I tried to convince myself that history was an external and independent fact from my mind, my mind, or imagination, if you wish, became stifled and was deadened. Now I feel that when I ask my mind—or should I dare to say my 8 [pageend10]Muse—to free my imagination, an invisible gate seems to open and elements of a potential poem for instance pour out in such a way that I can never hope to keep pace with the speed of the flood. Yet—a strange thing —no matter how slow I am in transforming them into verbal form, nothing seems to run away. It happens in the ubiquitous present tense—so how could it disappear into the past? This underground source of rivers or seas is in me and I have access to it on asking. But how often do I ask? And how do I avail myself of this bounty? I know that I need to employ my will in the process of transformation; but everybody knows that this particular will of the artist can go too far and hinder creation instead of helping it. I feel that in the sea I have just mentioned all so-called histories, past, present and future are contained, and not only the histories I hold in my memory. I must ask: whose history does one express when one suddenly must—simply must—write a poem about Orpheus or Persephone, for instance? For me this is not a mere academic question, as this has often happened to me since I began writing. Is this subject matter pertaining to the history of Orpheus o t Persephone also part of my own personal history? Is it the same personal history as the fact of my having fought in the last war, as the fact of my having children, of living in England and not in my native Moravia? Speaking against the dualist conception of the theme—i.e. history and imagination—I also speak for the unity of consciousness in all its forms, or if you wish, for the Logos in the sense of St. John, for the order of Apollon, for the Mind, of the Buddhists, or Atman of the Brahmins, or for the collective mind in the sense of Jung. Time, events, experience, activity, space—they are all crowded in it. I know from the years of my conscious literary work that this con9 [pageend11]sciousness—when released—sweeps away all ordinary motions of time, events, activities, and all experience of these things. What then happens to the mind it- self? This consciousness, overflowing dykes built to contain it, also takes possession of events which happened to other beings. IVAN JELINEK LYRE There, between horns of a ram, tension of voice heightened by words. To what aim? The God’s embrace. For the wounding of his mother, for mortal rents in the flesh of his dragoness mother his love repents. Himself here I golden wolf that behind the flock paced, keeping the lambs safe, my herdsman Lord!. . . Myself wolf, by an arrow pierced for their naked sake. Into the nameless, the speechlessness, prayer’s low sky, he brings my hand by the steps of the strings. Into a fire, self-fire, I plunge, burn up in my fear this self, this grief, this sheaflessness. 10 [pageend12]A dirge, wept word by word, leaning on reeds of tones, I lift, prophecy-tense, to the repentant God. And, through and through cleansed by him, and my heart lanced, I listen, I whisper near his now listening ear. Across the womb’s abyss and through his pythoness the thunder’s meaning is heard. Stretched between strength of horns, calling after ia woman. Stretched between strength of horns, singing woman-famine. Stretched between strength of horns, stillness after the God. AND YET The laurel wreath of beasts, although the she-wolf howled, he wove—and the voice of light was still half-unfulfilled. He balanced blood on the blade edge—not a single spilled droplet. No ripple —stealth into storm—welled from the high or the low blue 11 [pageend13]And yet— And yet.. . only wait, wait till the Lord ceases his thrumming and his phrase, stopped by love’s lacking words within his singing: the thunder-dream that leads out of sight is still ringing— look, he is torn in pieces. All masks from his face ripped by hell, by hate. And yet— He moans the word-drops, one by one, in her soothed lap —the beat, down, up: strums by the gate: goes in her husband. Departs her son. 12 [pageend14]SALVADOR DE MADARIAGA TREE IMAGES OF LORCA The sheer wealth of poetic genius in Lorca is so wide and deep that it forces the mind to a consideration of poetry in itself; so that one might be tempted to write that poetry is whatever Lorca says. As Schubert gives the impression that melodies sprang freely out of his fingers, so does poetry seem to spring from Lorca’s spirit. He was poetry. I have often thought—and written—that a people’s life strikes the mind as ia river in which a rich tradition flows from the past through the present towards the future; but whose flow is also enriched by generous sources that spring upwards from the river bed. Spain, so often represented as a particularly traditional country, is, nevertheless, richer in this upsurging of her spirit than in tradition, this rising of the present life which comes to meet the flow of tradition and to enrich it at every bend of the past towards the future. In a sense, these two forms or movements of the Spanish spirit would account for the two trends in Spanish poetry which in the Middle Ages were known as the clerkship craft and the jugglery craft (master de clerecía, mester de juglaría); the first relying more on forms, standards and books, the second rather on ways, happenings and persons. Science versus experience. Great Spanish poetry is to be found where the two trends meet. Lorca was there- That is why he has been more than once compared to Lope de Vega. Of course, a mere comparison, by 18 [pageend15]no means exact, though near enough. Lope differs from Lorca in more ways than one; to begin with, he was far better versed in the classics, and far more inclined to bow in awe before them. This led him to underestimate the popular vein far more than might have been expected from one whose own poetry owed so much to it. Lorca was in this respect closer to the popular heart. He felt poetry ¡as the people of his native Andalusia are apt to do: surging directly from nature without Quintilian’s permission. A closer parallel might perhaps be ventured between Lorca and Gongora; for in both poetry covers the wide stretch between spontaneous, popular, upsurging, and traditional, cultured, forward-flowing strains. Gongora can play on the village reed as a peasant, and rise to abstruse obscurities like a literary alchemist. And so can Lorca. But here again the parallel turns out to be quite unsatisfactory; for Lorca’s obscurities, though they may at times be due (as much as Gongora’s) to his crowded metaphors getting, so to speak, into each other’s legs, are in the main to be found in his POETA IN NUEVA YORK, which, to my mind, partakes more of the disintegrating trends of our age than of the integrating discipline of Gongora’s; while, on the other hand, the romances and canciones of Lorca are far more essentially poetical and popular than Gongora’s let- rillas, in that they are really and directly sprung from whatever there was of the people in the poet, while in his letrillas, Gongora strikes the reader less as a poet with the people in him than as a poet looking at the people outside him. Lorca is; Gongora imitates. It is thus perhaps not too much to say that Lorca is the most successful example in the whole Spanish literature of a fusion of the two crafts. In his poetry can be felt all the flavour and all the depth, all the grace 14 [pageend16]and all the force of the Spanish popular song. Reading Lorca with that particular ear open and alert, that particular ear which listens to the voice of the jugglery craft, one dreams of the countless jewels of popular poetry that are born, flourish and die in the villages and the hills of Spain like flowers unseen in solitary heig'hts or sunsets unobserved over deserted seas. Lorca seems to have lived to incarnate, represent, save from oblivion the spirit of those blossoms of poetry. Not that he ever knew of them, heard them or of them; but that his sensitive poetical being absorbed them in the air and the light of his native land, and gave them form and a setting. Born to letters just at the time when poetry became conscious of the unconscious (and not infrequently was drowned in it) Lorca was able to remain lucid while driving the roots of his emotion as deep as any one of his contemporaries. One day in the Alhambra (it must have been in 1921), as I was waiting for Fernando de lo Rios, with whom I had an appointment there, I saw him come to me in the company of a handsome, large-eyed youth. “Federico García Lorca, our local poet”, Fernando said. And I remember having thought in my mind how those two words, local, poet, disliked each other. “A poet must be universal” I thought. And in a sense, I was right; and in that sense, Lorca himself was soon to prove me right. For lie became universal, first through his youthful genius; later, it must be owned, through his dreadful death, which came soon to assume a political colour. And yet, Fernando was right also; more right perhaps than he meant to be. For there is in Lorca and Andalusian flavour which no translation can ever hope to preserve. Nor was this the only sense in which he was local. He was just beginning to grow from a promising into 15 [pageend17]a great poet. On re-reading the poems he wrote at the time, I venture to think that his first great poems date from 1920; and, that while his genius pierces through here and there even before that date, in 1919 he still remains somewhat conventional and now and then evinces touches of naivete and even of gaucherie that of necessity take on a local character. Even when he had attained full success as a universal poet, these touches had not altogether abandoned him. Like a flower plucked from a garden he had kept stuck to his roots clods of the natal earth. After that date, he begins to transfigure reality. Shall we ever be able satisfactorily to express in the cold style of the critic what it is that poetry does to life? A mirror to nature? Hardly. Rather should we think of life as a jumping board for poetry to gambol from and away, but not too far. Until 1920, Lorca had been writing excellent, at times wonderful visions of nature. Then he begins to sore above nature on the wings of great poetry. My second image of him dates from the time when he is already famous and successful. It must have happened in 1934 or 35. He came to my house in Madrid. It was a sunny warm day. He was wearing a white suit; and his handsome, colourful face imprinted itself on my memory with so much force that in later years it was that image which I tried to express in my Elegy on his death. Two crystals of black light Shone in his glance. In his mouth there glistened Crystals of white shade. His hair, a moonless night. His skin, olive and orange. His gestures, gypsy spells. His voice, a guitar string. 16 [pageend18]And in his wide blossoming soul The valley of his Granada. His plays were then being received with approval by all, with enthusiasm by the youth of the country. Here again, he was swift in reaching mastery. MARIANA PINEDA is on the whole weak as a play and not in his best vein as poetry; but nearly every other play of his is a masterpiece, and some, such as BODAS DE SANGRE, are models of that fusion between the two crafts of which he is, I believe, the finest example in our letters. My next image of him stands out on the background of Oxford. It must date from 1928, the year I took on the Chair of Spanish studies in the University. I had been lecturing in the north, and on the day I was due back home a telegram was received in my house worded “ARRIVING TO-DAY.’’ Who was arriving? that was the question. Ready for any and every emergency, my wife was soon receiving at our door in Headington the familiar figure of Fernando and another and younger figure unknown to her. The two friends were told that I should not be returning until late at night. They took my house as a base and drew upon my wife’s expert advice to go shopping in Oxford. (Federico bought a shirt.) They spent the rest of the day in the garden, the inner and the outer part of which are divided by a low wall overgrown with ivy and hazel bushes, and between the two there runs a tunnel of greenery faced by an arch of pink small roses. In later years, when Gregorio Prieto was told that Federico1 had stooped under that arch of roses, he grew dreamy—and I believe a little jealous. Fernando and Federico had supper at home, in the course of which one of them let fall with no concern 17 [pageend19]whatsoever that they were sailing that very night for New York “Sailing? Heaven! In what ship? From what port? At what time?’’ The S.S. Olympic. Southampton. As for time, they had no idea. My wife, heroically overcoming her horror of telephones, exchanges and such spidery forms of civilisation, elicited the information that the Olympic would not require her guests to come aboard until five in the morning. Fernando and Federico decided calmly to rely on the railways of Britain;—a touching faith which was to prove fully justified by events. I turned up between ten and eleven, of course blissfully ignorant of the surprise that was awaiting me. After exchanging the most immediate greetings and scraps of information, I went straight to the telephone and rang up the station. The only chance left was a train leaving Oxford at one a.m. for some vague spot on the map where our two friends had ;a reasonable hope of catching another train which (after two more changes and the protection of Divine Providence) might allow them to make their boat. So we went on talking. It was only eleven p.m. after all. At one p.m., at the station, we waved farewell to the poet and his mentor on their way to New York. That stay in the capital of the modern world was to be for Lorca a profound experience. Can anything be found more remote from a Grandino than a New Yorker, from Fuentevaqueros than New York, from the Vega than Manhattan? The grace of the timeless present, the drive of the tumultuous space-time; the rose and petals, the skyscraper. And yet, all is pôetry to the poet, and Lorca turned New York into poetry. I am not quite sure, though, that either the best or the deepest impact of the United States upon Lorca is to be found in the poems he wrote on New York. It might well turn out to have manifested itself more 18 [pageend20]powerfully in somewhat indirect ways. It might well be that the modern metropolis had driven into his sensitive being a cataract of new sensations which enabled him to release his powers of imagination making them burst into fantasy as a load of fireworks would burst into colours and shapes being knocked by a railway express. Thus, that masterpiece of free, fanciful, yet classic interpretation of life, ASI QUE PASEN CINCO ANOS might well be explained as the transfiguration of DOn A ROSITA LA SOLTERA and her rise to the paradise of free poetry after her death under the iron wheels of the New York Central Railway- PETERIS AIGARS PIGS Restlessness stirs in my heart as rustling branches of fir-trees sway in the wrind. Yet I keep longing for peace, peace and quiet. . . That’s why I want to write verses in praise of creatures covered with bristles. True, you will say: “But they’re pigs!’’ Very well. Pigs have their own kind of beauty. When an upsurging wave sweeps us away to eternity—none will remain, neither you nor I, 19 [pageend21]nor will there be any pigs. Why, just for that, feel .sorrow and blur our vision with tears? Things run their destined course— all right. Only this: where your love stops short is the point at which nry love begins. Perhaps you are thinking of horses? Horses, yes, they have beauty, manes streaming out in the wind, delicate curving of necks. . . Very well. Cows have a certain attraction but a mournful look in their eyes, and why should we glorify sorrow if comely plumpness is more to our liking? Pigs, now—look at them, do ! What noble indolence, peace and repose! Watching them, I remember the beauty of noonday beaches, sun-drenched sands in July, frolicsome wave-crests stilled in the haze of a shimmering day . . . Ladies and gentlemen, really: pigs are endearing. Pigs, I grant you, may flounder and wallow about in the mud, but all of us cannot be sitting on gilded rococo chairs— and why should we let it upset us that pigs’ eyes tend to resemble those of swindlers and rogues? Pigs are by no means an evil that cannot be patted and stroked. Pigs retain what we lost: the art of enjoying existence'— 20 [pageend22]and in the end, after death, they do not submit to transience, ,no they remain, and are with us daily, on gold-rimmed plates.

Someone who I was and do not know, He remembers. Quietly I follow his thoughts. I see Myself in a door, Of a house, in a land Where I have not been. 21 [pageend23]He smiles As he remembers And I follow his thoughts Through woods, along pastures And sit down with his thoughts By a lake. He throws a stone. A face floats up to the surface. My face Swaying upon the ripples As they glimmer. The ripples run out But on the smooth surface Remains my face. With eyes wide in surprise He looks about. Returns to my face. And still it is there. In front of him here, today. Why do you look at me As if you know me still? I knew you long ago Is all I know. 22 [pageend24]LINARDS TARNS THE DREAM OF A TOWN I want to examine, whether my town is such As it appears in my dreams. Therefore I will take my dream and enter Where Vincent gathered suns, tea-shops and wheat And I will place my dream upon avenues of fruit trees And upon fruit itself And upon the trousers that are half-mast on two children, As they look longingly at wooden fences, Upon absent-minded dogs and primulas scattered in gardens. By the side of all of them I will put my dream And compare it whether it truly is the same. Looking at crooked roofs I will think, how excellent that my dream too is crooked. But never never must my dream be wrong. Two children with trousers half-mast who watch clouds in puddles—■ Will let me in, passing my dream for a passport. The parole: “The perpetual cloud.” And I did enter the town and I placed my dream upon hardened stones And I saw—they are even older than my most ancient previews. Pharaos sleep in them and suns that also embrace them. (Translated by Velta Snikere) 23 [pageend25]GUNARS SALINS LOST IN NEW YORK I was lost once again among red hair, and then blue hair, and green. A quiet rustle from buildings stirred by warm winds, and tiers of windows, clusters of light, tossed as on wind-shaken boughs. Some broke free, and fell bursting- like big ripe berries on car-tops and down in the streeta. Dreamy children waded among them, and women in glistening grape-flesh gowns,— others came from above with baskets of grapes as if skyscrapers had been replaced by vineyards. They came towards me, came straight into my arms with vineyards and skyscrapers,— and all of a sudden I found in each woman something I recognized: eyes, lips, or voice,— in each, something else—some trace, some remembrance. . . And then, as a cool hand touched me, I knew for certain: this hand, when a child’s, once gave me the first long ago, cluster of grapes— that childish form and those berries gleaming in windows and lime-trees—yes, and in stars— I wandered, lost, until morning through narrow 24 [pageend26]streets which seemed spacious, endless, ever stretching before me—the very first time I was in the city of love. Can it really be you live on not in a graveyard’s alders nor in its nighting*ales, but in hundreds of beautiful women? Theirs are your girlish lips, your eyes and breasts: now our city of love is composed of mature flesh and the gold of vineyards. The shimmer of loosened tresses coiled like streets in me, red, blue, and green. I was deep down in cellars lit by the forms of grape-girls whose feet gleamed with wading through spurting berries and neon-signs.

Traduction par Ladislas Gara Adaptation d’Anne-Marie Backer GEORGE GÖMÖRI ADAM WAZYK: A chapter from THE DEVELOPMENT OF POLISH AND HUNGARIAN POETRY IN THE POST-WAR PERIOD 1945-56. 1955 started with the self-critical report of Bierut at the Third Plenum of the PZPR. This event proved to be the officially acknowledged turning-point in the political developments that followed Stalin’® death in Poland. Until January 1955 the Thaw remained halfhearted and only partly approved “from above”, but from now on it became the official line of the PZPR. It is beyond doubt that the “correction of mistakes” in the past meant something totally different for Communist writers on the one hand, and for the majority of Communist aparatchiki. on the other. 1955 therefore, 28 [pageend30]though it was a year of sharpening criticism against the Stalinist character of the virtually unchanged Party and State apparatus, was at the same time a period of violent clashes between the writers, and the functionaries who made frantic attempts to stifle, or at least curb their criticism. In March 1955 Przeglqd Kultwalny published some interesting poems by W. Wirpsza and A. Siucki (Slucki’s poem bore the topical title “Rehabilitation”) but it was the March number of Tw6rczos6 that raised official eyebrows most. Among the nine new poems by Jastrun and the six poems published here by Pawel Hertz, only two or three contained definite anti-Stalinist allusions but this was more than enough to excite both readers and officials. Hertz made a courageous allusion to a well-known poem of Mickiewicz, “To the Polish Mother” (Do Matki Polski), which Mickiewicz wrote after the suppression of the 1830/31 Polish uprising, a poem bitterly condemning Russian imperialism. The literary sensation of the year was Wazyk’s famous “Poem for Adults” (Poemat dla Doroslych). Adam Wazyk had written very little between 1949 and 1953, and it was all far below his pre-war poetic standards. At one stage it seemed to many that Wazyk, the Communist functionary killed Wazyk the poet. In the worst years of terror he was one of the most feared and hated figures in literary life. He lived in an ecstasy of constant self-purification, utterly subservient to the Party’s authority. But since the death of Stalin this authority had declined. Swiatlo, a high official of the Polish Secret Police escaped to the West and told his horrifying story to the world. The charges against Gomulka were dropped. Wiazyk gradually lost his faith in Stalinism, but rather than indulge in the usual breast-beating, he decided on the 29 [pageend31]more socially useful course of attacking false authority. His was a rationalist’s attack on the irrational features of the Communist system reflecting, at the same time, his deep emotional crisis and disappointment. The first important poem of Wazyk, written in 1955, “Message to a friend’’ (Poslanie do przy- jaciela), shows this disappointment in its most acute form. No Communist poet, including the Hungarian rebels, dared to use such strong language as Wazyk in his passionate attack on Stalinism: The nation was working and philosophical scoundrels attacked us, they have stolen our brains bit by bit and left us merely belief. Men on stilts taught us the art of walking, blind men raised torches, the deaf were guardians of conscience at the market-place ascetics bred crimes. In the same poem Wazyk attacked the “escapists”, those who do not want to fight the Stalinist “scoundrels’” but “return to the country of childhood” instead. (This might well have been aimed at Broniew- ski). Wazyk could not afford to join the camp of inner emigres—he left like a man who suddenly finds that the woman he loved had become a prostitute. Wazyk now chose a mew poetic ideal in the person of Jasinski, the radical 18th century poet who directed most of his satires and pamphlets against political reaction. It was at this point that he was sent to Nowa Huta, to write an article about the life of the new industrial town near Cracow. Wazyk duly went to Nowa Huta but brought back a number of poetic sketches which, when joined together, formed a logical entity: the “Poem for Adults”. In contrast 30 [pageend32]to the childishly primitive and didactic poems of the Zhdanov Era, this poem was written for grown-ups. The “Poem for Adults’’ does not easily lend itself to a precis. It consists of fifteen loosely connected parts, some of which describe the atmosphere of a particular place or town (Warsaw’s new housing estates, a new house in Nowa Huta), others simply convey the author’s comments on a particular ideological or moral question. The first two parts of the poemat serve as an emotional prologue to the criticism contained in Parts 3-14, which culminate in the list of demands in Part 15. It is in Part 3 that the first political problem is touched upon in the overconfident statement ascribed to a Communist statesman: “Today our sky is not empty.” Wazyk concedes that this is true up to a point—there are jet-planes in the sky. But what is behind the slogan? “When we do not want to talk frankly about the earth / then we say: The sky is not empty.” Wazyk’s account of the life of the masses in Communist Poland is brutally outspoken, and in parts horrifying. While Part 4 depicts the immense upheaval created by the Polish industrial revolution which is being carried out in the course of a decade instead of a century, Part 10 gives a glimpse of Nowa Huta, where life is completely different from the workers’ paradise invented by Party propangandists and schematic writers- Parts 7-8 contain a straight attack on Stalinism, while Part 9 is a superb parody of Communist self-criticism. The “Poem for Adults” has two points of culmination. The first occurs in the middle of the poem where the poet’s smouldering anger explodes in biter irony: The dreamer Fourier beautifully prophesied that the sea would flow with lemonade. And does it not flow? 31 [pageend33]They drink sea-water and cry— Lemonade! They return quietly home to vomit, to vomit. After an interesting Part 13 and a weaker Part 14, the poem moves to its conclusion which is the second point of culmination. Part 15 is a list of demands which Wazyk puts to the Party in the name of the people. There were rumours that Wazyk finished his poem with the line “We demand with the Party” only so that it would pass censorship. This is possible, though when he wrote the ‘‘Poem for Adults”, he still was a Communist, that is, a ‘‘Leninist” who hoped for radical reforms within the Party and supported the policy of de-Stalinization. At that time he still believed that the PZPR would overcome the dogmatism of the old leadership and would not disappoint all the people ‘‘who are waiting for justice”. It was this illusion which guided his pen when he wrote a few months later in the ‘‘Criticism of the Poem for Adults”: ‘‘From medieval brains / From medieval methods / The party will free the stream of revolution / And will become the party of Lenin’s image”. The ‘‘Poem for Adults” was a ‘‘virtual bombshell ... on the political and and literary front in Poland”. It was certainly a well timed bombshell. Two years earlier such a poem could not have been published without the threat of immediate arrest, and no editor would have risked his neck to publish it. Now Hoffman, the editor of Nowa Kultura was sacked (Wazyk’s poem was published in the August 21, 1955 number of this leading literary weekly), but Berman, the Party’s chief functionary for cultural affairs, 32 [pageend34]failed to get Wazyk expelled from the Party. The ex-Stalinist poet suddenly became a popular hero: “copies of the ‘Poem for Adults’ were circulating from hand to hand, avidly read by thousands and when Wazyk entered a Warsaw café he was greeted with applause. The poem had a strong impact on Hungarian writers and intellectuals too: typewritten copies of a rough translation were available in Hungary as early as the end of 1955, and when in the summer of 1956 Tibor Tardos wrote an article for Irodalmi Ujság in which he attacked dogmatism and the Stalinist myth of reality under the title “Brine is brine’’ —this was immediately understood as a reference to Wazyk’s poemat. From an aesthetic point of view, “Poem for Adults’’ is not impeccable. It is too loosely constructed, and in some parts it reads more like prose than poetry. It was obviously written in a hurry, in a state of emotional upheaval, its main object being a clear formulation of the truth newly discovered by the poet about social reality. In a sense, “Poem for Adults” was a revelation. For the first time in the history of postwar Poland a Communist was telling the people that the régime was bankrupt. Many officials protested against what they called Wazyk’s “anti-Party lies and calumnies”. Some contemptuously called the “Poem for Adults” a Socialist Realist poem à rebours, but the average reader accepted it as relevant and artistically true. Wazyk himself had been a “varnisher of reality”, therefore now, if revealing the dark side of the system, he did not quite escape the opposite danger of naturalism. This is true only of some parts of the “Poem for Adults”, but in the best passages Wazyk succeeded in achieving a synthesis between realism and satirical symbolism, a style which henceforth became typical of his poetry. Most of Wazyk’s 33 [pageend35]poems written in this period turn into satires. Even the non-satirical poems are imbued with sad irony: They lived with the dawn And have sown darkness. They lived with the idea And they parted with people. They lived with a dream And lies have become their daily bread. Wazyk’s satires were to some extent influenced by Tuwim and Galczynski but while the irony of these two “bourgeois” poets was directed mainly against the official enemies of the new regime, such as political opponents and apolitical intellectuals, Wazyk turned on his own class and made fun of Stalinist theology and Communist bureaucracy. In the “Genius of Consequence’’ he mocked the ridiculously exaggerated campaign for “vigilance”, so characteristic of the régime, and in “The Dream of Bureaucrats” he took a potshot at the tumbling edifice of Stalinism: Blunderers—down below Infallibles—at the top Painted in halos With Byzantine gold On a pin-head Five hundred angels Blowing the trumpets Of official cant Despite all this, Wazyk might well have become a convinced supporter of the new “Gomulkist” Party if he had not happened to go to Hungary in October 34 [pageend36]1956. As a guest of the Hungarian Writers’ Association he arrived in Hungary on the very day (October 23) when the historic student demonstration took place at the memorial of General Bem. This was a decisive experience in Wazyk’s life, a turning-point in his political development. Now at last he understood the futility of his struggle within the framework of the Party, which he quit less than ia year afterwards, as well as the openly imperialistic nature of Soviet Communism. Having returned from Budapest, ruined by the shells of the Soviet Army, Wazyk wrote a short but beautiful and remarkable poem entitled “Qui tacent clamant”. The last four lines of this poem are well worth quoting: We, who were history’s conscience, are silent, Reasons of state enforce this dumb speech. . . Where over the corpses of rebels the bitter smoke creeps The last myth has collapsed. But Bem’s monument remains. 35 [pageend37]RAINER MARIA RILKE DUINESER ELEGrIEN THE TENTH ELEGY May I, when at the end of this cruel insight, Sing jubilation and praise to assenting angels. May not one of the firm-hammered keys of my heart Fail to evoke response by touching on slack, Doubting, or tearing strings. May my streaming face Make me more radiant ; may inconspicuous weeping Blossom. 0 nights of grief, how dear you will be to me then. Why did I not receive you, inconsolable sisters, More submissively kneeling, surrender myself more freely Into your free-flowing hair? We, the wasters of sorrows. How we gaze ahead of them, out into sad permanence, To see if perhaps they might come to an end. But they are Our foliage lasting through winter, our dark evergreen, One of the inner year’s seasons—not only Season—are place and settlement, camp, soil, and dwelling. Strange, alas, are the streets of the City of Suffering Where, in the sham silence of sound drowned by sound, There swaggers, the cast poured forth from the mould of emptiness, Blatant, the gilded noise, the monument bursting apart. 0 how completely »n angel would tread down their market of consolation 36 [pageend38]Adjoined by their church, which they bought ready- made: Clean, disillusioned, and closed as a post office is on a Sunday. But, outside, there is always a ripple along the rim of the fair. Swings of freedom! Divers and jugglers of zeal! And the shooting-range figures of prettified happiness, Targets jerking and tinnily clinking whenever Hit by some better marksman. From cheers to chance He goes staggering on, as booths serving every kind of curiosity Solicit attention, bawl, and beat drums. But there is, in particular, Only for adults, the breeding of money on view, anatomical, Not for amusement only: the sex part of money, The whole of it, all, the act—instructive, and rendering Fertile . .. Oh, but a little farther away, just beyond it, Behind the last hoarding pasted over with posters for “Deathless,” The bitter beer that seems sweet to those who consume it When, as they drink, they continually chew fresh distractions, Just at the back of the hoarding, there, just behind, it is real: Children at play, and lovers holding each other, aside, Gravely, in shabby grass, and dogs obeying their instincts. The youth is drawn farther away; it may be that he loves A youthful Lament . . ■ Behind her, he walks into meadows. She says: 87 [pageend39]“Far away. We are living out there...” Where? And he follows. He is touched by her bearing. Her shoulder, her neck —perhaps She is of noble descent. But he leaves her, turns back, Faces round, and waves. . . What does it avail? She is a Lament. Only the youthful dead, in their first condition Of timeless equanimity, of becoming weaned, Follow her lovingly. Maidens She waits for, befriends them; shows them gently What she wears on her person—The pearls of suffering, The finely woven veils of endurance. Youths She walks with in silence. But, where they live, in the valley, one of the older Laments responds to the youth when he asks. ‘‘We were once,” She says, ‘‘a great family, we, the Laments. Our fathers Worked the mines in those towering mountains; at times, among humans, You find a piece of polished primeval suffering Or drossy petrified wrath from an ancient volcano. Yes, that had its origin there. We were rich once.” Lightly leading him through the spacious landscape Of Laments, she shows him the columns of temples, the ruins Of castles from which, in the past, sovereign princes Of the House of Lament had wisely governed the land. Shows him the tall tear trees, the fields of blossoming sadness (Known to the living only, as gentle foliage); Shows him the pasturing beasts of grief—and at times 38 [pageend40]A bird starts up and draws, in its level flight through their lifted Gaze, the far-reaching scroll of its lonely cry. In the evening she leads him up to the graves of the eldest Of the House of Lament, the sibyls and seers. Night drawing near, they move more softly, and soon, Moonlit, there rises before them, guarding all things, The sepulchral monument. Brother to that by the Nile, The lofty Sphinx—the reticent chamber’s face. And they marvel at the regal head which, in silence, Ilas placed forever the face of man Upon the scale of the stars. His glance does not grasp it, dizzy With early death. But her gaze Starts an owl from behind the rim of the pshent; Brushing, in slowly descending flight, Along the cheek of the ripest rondure, It softly traces across the new Death-given hearing, over an open Double page, the indescribable outline. Higher, the stars. New ones. Stars of the land of suffering. And the Lament slowly names them: “There, See: the Horseman, the Staff, and they call the more crowded Constellation the Garland of Fruit. Then, nearer the Pole: Cradle, Way, The Burning Book, Doll, and Window. But in the southern sky, pure as within the palm Of a blessed hand, the translucid M Which signifies Mothers ...” 39 [pageend41]But he, the dead, must go on his way and, in silence, She takes him as far as the gorge, And there it gleams in the moonlight— The Source of Joy. With reverence She names it, and says: “Among men, It is a carrying stream.’’ They stand at the foot of the mountains. And there she embraces him, weeping. All alone, he climbs to the Hills of Primeval Suffering. And not even his steps sound out of soundless fate. But if they wakened a symbol in us, the endlessly dead, See, perhaps they would point at the catkins Hanging from empty hazels, or else Bring to mind the rain that falls on dark earth in the spring. And we, who think of happiness Ascending, would then experience The feeling which almost startles When what is happy falls. (Translated by Ruth Speirs) 40 [pageend42]From the Russian of MARINA TSVETAYEVA I. My poems, which I wrote not even knowing I was a poet—for I was so yonng—; Which broke away like sparks, torn from a rocket, Like spray from fountains sprung; Which burst into the Sanctum’s heavy incense Like little devils, hampering its sleep; My poems about death and adolescence Which no one ever reads; On dusty shelves, in gloomy bookshops scattered, Ignored by all and taken out by none— My poems stay, like precious wine in cellars: Their turn, their time will come. II. Close, as the right and the left hand,— Your isoul and mine together stand, In blissful nearness, warmly tight,-— A left wing tucked into the right. But storm arises.—Gulfs divide The spreading wings of either side! (Translated by Lydia Slater) 41 [pageend43]BORIS PASTERNAK NIGHT The night proceeds, and dwindling Prepares the day’s rebirth. An airman is ascending Above the sleeping earth; And, almost disappearing In cloud, a tiny spark, He now is like a cross-stitch, A midget laundry-mark. Beneath him are strange cities And heavy traffic-lanes, And night-clubs, barracks, stokers, And railways, stations, trains. The shadow of his wing-span Falls heavy on the cloud. Celestial bodies wander Around him in a crowd. And there, with frightful listing Through emptiness, away Round unknown Solar Systems Revolves the Milky Way. In limitless expanses Are headlands, burning bright. In basements and in cellars The stokers work all night. 42 [pageend44]And underneath a roof-top In Paris, maybe Mars Or Venus sees a notice About a recent farce. And maybe in an attic And under ancient slates A man sits wakeful, working, He thinks, and broods, and waits. He looks upon the planet As if the heavenly spheres Were part of his entrusted Nocturnal, private cares. Fight off your sleep: be wakeful, Work on, keep up your pace, Keep vigil, like the pilot, Like all the stars in space! Work on, work on, creator, — To sleep would be a crime.— Eternity’s own hostage, And prisoner of Time. (Translated by Lydia Slater) TRANSLATOR’S NOTE Every poet has at one time or another written about Nature, the weather, about spring, summer, autumn or winter, and about love; all these things are very old, and we have all experienced them in our own lives and have described them to others, using the 43 [pageend45]same appropriate but limited vocabulary. What then is it that suddenly lifts one poem of this kind above another, that makes it take your breath away and forces you to cry or to laugh with sheer exaltation? Obviously it is not only what the poet writes about, but how he writes about it, in what particular way he combines the unexciting units—words—into exciting images, unexpectedly new, fresh and striking; in other words the form of a poem is at least as important as its content. This is particularly true of Pasternak’s poetry. No matter what his subject—he can write about the most trivial things—when you hear the poem read out, it will overwhelm you with sudden happiness (for in order to be appreciated to the full, his poems, unlike a Victorian child, must be heard rather than seen). As the son of two artists, an impressionist painter and a great musician, he has inherited and incorporated in his poetry both visual art and music; and the music, I think, not only plays the more important part in his poetry— it is this poetry itself. I well remember how as children we often could not go to sleep, disturbed and reduced to tears by his improvisations on the piano in the adjoining room. Whenever he was inspired, excited or unhappy he invariably poured out his feelings into music, inarticulately moaning and humming as he played. It was not until much later that his music found expression in words, in poetry. He never really abandoned music, he merely changed his instrument. The essential qualities of musical composition are rhythm and melody. To translate my brother’s poems without trying to preserve his melodies and rhythms is for me equivalent to not translating him at all. It is like stating in so many words that he writes about love, nature, the four seasons or the weather, while 44 [pageend46]leaving out all the essential characteristics of his art. His style has undergone great changes since the appearance of “My Sister Life” and “Themes and Va- rations”. His later poems were simpler, less ‘obscure’ and exclusive than what he described as his “immature” work, and were imbued with a more epic vigour and wisdom. But they are still as fresh and spontaneous as his earlier poems, and their main qualities, now as then, are their music and their lifelike and impressionistic imagery. He does not merely describe lilac after a thunderstorm: the lilac bush itself, in all its purple clusters, bursts out of his lines, and one can see and smell it drinking in the refreshed and purified air. Anyone who has tried to translate Russian poetry into English will know by experience that owing to the radical differences in sentence-construction and in the length and stress-pattern of the words in the two languages it is almost impossible to produce a perfect English poem while at the same time preserving the Russian flavour, the content, the melody and rhythm of the original, as well as the personality of the poet; one has to sacrifice at least one of these qualities in order to be free to manipulate the others more or less successfully. Individual translators sacrifice different things, according to what seems to them most important to preserve. For my part, for reasons I have already explained, I believe that a translation from Pasternak must sound like the original, and though I try to produce an acceptable English poem, I do not think that this is the most important of my tasks. Those who are out for perfect English poems should read their own great poets (there are plenty of them waiting to be read); to those, however, who want to know what the Russian poems of Pasternak are like, but who are prevented through lack of knowledge from 45 [pageend47]reading them in the original, I offer my versions in English words, but still essentially Russian, and as near the originals in melody, content, rhythm and feeling as it was possible for me to make them. Lydia Slater 46 [pageend48]ILA EGON AGNES NEMES NAGY Agnes Nemes Nagy is one of the most significant and remarkable poets of today. This introductory sentence should have duly ended: “.......... of postwar Hungary.”—but she cannot be called strictly post-war, (mid-war would perhaps be more correct); while the fact that she is Hungarian is material only from the point that her readers are usually confined to those acquainted with that particular language— while what she has to say is universal. Born in the Twenties, the daughter of a Presbyterian clergyman, educated during the Thirties in a Presbyterian college, imbued with the ethic and principles of her faith she stepped out of school,—straight into war. Her poem “To My Ancestors”, written most probably in 1944, sketches in the general background more effectively than I could do in prose. TO MY ANCESTORS Ernestinas, honoured Susannahs, crofts, carts and presbyteries, Grandfather—a lawyer in Egypt other words, moments, mysteries, .... What do I look like? How do you see me? What do I mean to my own kin? Bewildered, blind I stand before you probing the bones beneath my skin. 47 [pageend49]I run around in empty chambers. Question the mirror,—no reply. I light a candle, scribble, doze off,— when it’s time to rise I’d like to cry. The stove has gone, (for they are shelling the town just now)—I’d like to know: Did you too dream of new ideals, new fruits, on journeys long ago? Of battles? Men in heavy furcoats? Pictures? Hands touching under books? Did you conceive me, built my bones and fashioned in your minds my looks? It matters not. There is just one thing, one single thing I’d like to check: Why did Grandfather go to Egypt with his money ’round his craggy neck? What dreams he dreamt? What longings plagued him? What thoughts crossed his mind in a flash? It’s hot,—he must have said, no doubt wiping his handlebar moustache. The tone is still light,—that of smoothly flowing conversation. The questions exist, but they are mere questions, no more. They have not yet disrupted the faith that formed such an integral part of the childhood, the youth, in fact the life to date of Agnes Nemes Nagy. The questions exist, but so do the answers and so does God who can be equated with good and who will eventually triumph over momentary Evil. They are shelling the town just now and the stove is gone—but when they have finished shelling the town we shall have new stoves; we shall be 48 [pageend50]able to pick up the threads entangled by Evil, unravel them and find—if not the solution to all the bitter-sweet mysteries of the past—at least the reason for all this present misery. For nothing is without reason and design and when we traversed this temporary abyss of darkness, God, in His infinite mercy and wisdom might allow us a glimpse of His purpose. When the ultimate good has defeated the forces of evil we might be granted at least a partial understanding of the plan and the order of things. For Good will, of course, always triumph over Evil, and Light over Darkness—-so we have been told and taught and this we believe. The underlying faith is still implicit. How many intermediate triumphs Evil has over Good before the forces of Light eventually arrive and what these triumphs consist of in terms of detailed horror was something the textbooks did not contain—even less did the surroundings and upbringing of Agnes Nemes Nagy prepare her for it. Evil was an adversary one fought with all one’s might, and eventually conquered. But since Evil is surmountable its problems are also fathomable, comprehensible and answerable. The Unfathomable, Incomprehensible and Unanswerable had not yet leered in the face of the girl who was the product of pure and simple Christian values. When it had, her faith, and with it her very being, was rocked to its foundations and God fell from His Heaven. TO LIBERTY Cathedral. Full of awe and reverence. Garlanded Angels. Looks of beatitude. From down here their feet’s circumference seems Gargantuan—and their heads minute. 49 [pageend51]Up there majestic pillars splice the dome’s view, Fake Heavens flame like varnished amethyst. What good if you exist and I disown you? What if I praise you and you don’t exist? Left-over God. Your wayward fascination holds me no more. I tired long ago. Some of my friends have just died of starvation. You haven’t heard. I thought I’d let you know. What kind of straw did they last clench their teeth on? What kind of skulls sank to what kind of dust? A few odd crumbs might have been within reason, Some small miracles would have been august. I long to see their lips again in smiling, Their soft, round chins that were ground underfoot. I long for Home. For beautiful, beguiling gardens, and for rich, luxurious food. Give meat! Bananas. Be the world’s Provider. Naples at night. A clear Swiss morning scene. False Love of all my yearnings wild desire Give back the vibrant air upon the green! Give Marvels. Faith. A new Heavenly Sign. Break through the Law and give yourself to us! That racketeers should not constantly dine, And that the dead may rise up from the dust. ——■— In a vase on the table: a peony. Her ornate beauty like a diadem. Over the brim, magnificent and stony The gorgeous petals cascade round the stem. If I could still find piety exultory Upon my crumbling knees to her I’d crawl. On her alone pin your triumphant glory: She’s beautiful—alive—and has no soul. 50 [pageend52]Faith, or the lack of it, is not the only aspect of Agnes Nemes Nagy’s writings. But it is one of its major components, just as it was one of the major components of her own early life. The course it charts, the forms it takes permeate her poems of almost any date on almost any ¡subject. The following is an example written in the ’fifties: ICE Slowly the world freezes into me like clumps of reed into a wintry lake in ice-bound blocks the jagged fragments ache, A patch of sky, a scene, a sound, a tree. . . If I believed in you, you Silent One, You’d spread out your two warm palms for my sake, They’d shine above the ice, above the lake in twofold glory like a small Twin Sun. The ice would break, the surf awake, And all the objects leaping high would gleam against the morning sky. And yet, the fragments survive. Broken, scattered, frozen, ground to dust, the specks live on,—drawn by a force of cohesion that is perhaps Life itself—to unite again in a belief more universal than mere individual religion. In the Order of the Universe, or perhaps Universal Order itself. 51 [pageend53]TOWARDS SPRINGTIME Hewn out of Faith and composite politics The Tropic of Capricorn radiates the light. The Summer forges on towards the North. Lift up your head, lift up your sunsoaked sleepiness, Your latent strength, your irri descent weakness My Self—spell out where does the Sun strike forth? In the deep of night heavy engines rumble, Deep in the earth buried guns germinate. Fish ever slimier rows of roes beget. Slimy bodies. I don’t revere my species, My cells don’t ooze with past eternities Yet how does Order spread her vital net? Not blood alone in hundred forms subsistent, Not mere existence only feed my brain. Order re-vitalises my vital eyes. And intertwined like climbers of twin foliage Intentions will bear Gods to their own Image, and pure Intellect its own self fertilise. 52 [pageend54]R. HOLDER EXTRACT FROM AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY I was relieved in the morning when Fred Burcher’s coal lorry—the one on which I had worked—turned up, and half our worldly possessions, including the radio and the black boxing gloves and the stuffed football, three items I was most anxious about, were stacked on the lorry for all to see on the journey. My Father, my brother Ivor and I sat in the driver’s cabin, which was as hot as one of my Father’s ovens, until the lorry was speeding along the road and the breeze got amongst us, turning my hair into a mop again. My Mother, my sisters and Austin were to follow on the Monday with the remainder of our possessions. I was excited into tears of joy and not one was shed for my departure from the river which had meant so much to me, or from the ferryman who watched the loading for a few minutes with his cap held over the nape of his neck while he scratched his head rumi- natively, spat as was his wont to put a full stop to liis rambling thoughts, and then retreated into his yard to the happy barking of his alsatian. No one else observed our going and the lorry was soon one of ¡several, many of them taking cattle and squealing pigs to Gloucester Market. Each time we rounded ¡a corner there was a squeal of pigs or the rattle of hooves on bare boards as the cattle moved from side to side with the lurching of the vehicle. Sometimes there was the mounrnful bellowing of a cow for her calf. Here and there the road and the river came very 53 [pageend55]close to each, other and then, after a brief conversation over the wall—the river doing all the talking—they separated, the road taking ns through orchards of Blaisdon red plum trees with white-washed trunks, as yet not bent down with clusters of purple-dusted plums; past the hay-fields of small farms where the bright pointed teeth of mowing-machines chattered away to tremulous rabbits. All the harvesters seemed out: men and women and children, bronzed and bonneted, energetic with pitchfork and rake even as the bright dew vanished in the sunlight. Hay-harvesting all the way and the hay getting more golden and feathery the higher we climbed into the hills- Behind us lay the tall tower of the cathedral, marking out the city I wanted to forget, and streaming from it like a silver eel broken into pieces by the irregularity of the land was the river of my childhood. Then my thoughts turned ahead to the hills, no longer blue and cold in the distance, but now seen to be scored into deep coombs and to be a patchwork of green woods and grassland and golden hayfields, red chip roads and lanes and the cream gashes of stone quarries. The sun flashed on windows marking out solitary and clustered houses, and intermittently on the window screens of cars as they undulated along the roads. We climbed on up into an ampitheatre of hills and came into Dursley, sprawling in an elevated basin, some of its houses surging up the steep slopes among the trees. “Dursley!” proudly exclaimed my Father as we rattled through row upon row of new houses on the outskirts of the town, the brass knobs of our bedstead twinkling in the sunshine at all who passed by. He pointed to a rectangular building with a gaping 54 [pageend56]entrance and a tall pillar before it with ‘Regal’ in neon light. Men were still at work on the building. My Father spoke proudly and we all felt superior to the lorry driver who Irad to return to Newham-without- a-cinema. Not that Fred had any time for reflection. The lorry was soon bouncing in and out of holes and partly filled trenches running between the houses, our wordly possessions rattling noisily is their fold of black iron bedsteads. We purred on down a tree-lined road with the Grammar School on our left and behind it fragments of the escarpment rising up sheer out of the sloping fields. Then the road dipped down, getting' narrower and 'narrower, a high path on our right. Ahead, the wooded hills rose up sharply and at the foot of them, rising in tiers, were stone cottages, a few tall Georgian houses, and some new houses built above the tiered cottages among the trees. In the town proper the very narrow streets and the even less adequate pavements were congested with cars and people. Hurrying and leisurely people swung round perambulators on the narrow pavements and seemed about to fall under our wheels as we slowly moved down the thoroughfare. Shops and public houses were on either side and ahead, as if blocking the roadway, was the old Market Place standing stoutly on its pillars and sporting a cupola ami bell. “Here’s the bakehouse and shop,” announced my Father ¡and the lorry pulled up before a yellow and green painted cake shop which shared with the ‘International Stores’ the support of a long black and white upper ¡storey called ‘The Cotswold Café.’ “I’ll just nip in and see if the boss is there,” said my Father and we bundled out after him. We followed him up a passage way between the Stores and the Cake shop. There were many smells coming from the 55 [pageend57]quiet building at the rear of the busy shop, the smell of bread baked in the early hours of the morning now faint among them. ‘The Boss’ was sitting in his office beyond the storeroom where tray upon tray of cakes were stored in racks immediately behind the shop. The office was very small and we crowded into it to meet a well-preserved man, a head taller than my father, with deep brown hair and moustache, sunken cheeks wrinkled at the edges of his mouth and with cordiality and shrewdness in his open brown eyes. There was a touch of the debonair about him ias well as modesty, efficiency and purpose. He was wearing a snow white warehouse coat. He got up from his desk and greeted us: “So these are two of your family, Holder?” He looked ¡at me. “You are the clever one.” “Yes, sir I” I replied respectfully. “I think you are going to Mawdesley’s.” “Yes, sir!” He turned to my brother. “And you are going to follow in your Father’s footsteps?” “Yes, -sir!” “Good.” The plump manageress came into the office. “Hello George. You’ve got here safe then?” “Yes, Mrs. Joyce.” “And these are your two boys. ...” She beamed at us and I warmed to her very quickly. “You’re the clever one; you’re Roy!” I coloured deeply and my eyes wandered down over great round bosoms billowing out of a white coat. Then my troubled eyes shot up again to a bright silver cup 56 [pageend58]on the window ledge. She promised my brother a very happy time with them. “Do you think you will like living* here?’’ I shot a glance to meet her smiling eyes. “Yes!” I retorted quickly ¡as if to ward off any doubts, the image I had formed of our ‘bungalow under the hill’ coming straight into my mind. She and her employer exchanged glances of surprise at my manner. “Well, I must get on with my work!” exclaimed Mr. Shapland, jerking his head up a little in simulated resolution and 'dropping his hands significantly. He was soon immersed in work at a ledger as if our coming had not been. “I’ve put some bread and cakes by for you, George —on the top rack,” mentioned Mrs. Joyce as she busied herself at the desk. “I hope you soon get things straightened out.” We followed my Father into the store-room just as a plump young girl, with soft rosy cheeks and warm eyes, came up the steps from the shop with an open paper bag resting in the palm of her hand. “Hello Mary!” my Father greetd her with warmth. “Hello Mr. Holder,” she replied with a smile that bulged her round cheeks. “These are my two boys,” nodded my Father proudly. “Roy and Ivor.” “How nice to see you.” “This is Mary, Uncle Ted’s niece,” explained my Father. Mary was rolling our names around in her mouth as if sampling them. “Roy . . . and . . . Ivor.” She gurgled her approval. Mary, too, was in a spotless white coat, billowing out. She was beautifully groomed, matronly for her 57 [pageend59]age, charming in her manner. I found her congenial instantly. My Father collected his bread and cakes and we passed through the shop out into the street. We scrambled into the lorry which had earned many rude comments for remaining in the ■narrow street. We went on down this street and my Father pointed out another cinema. Then the street rose up suddenly and then dipped down again and we could see hayfields swelling up ahead and more hills. On the outskirts of the town we passed Mawdesley’s, the electrical engineers with whom I was to be apprenticed. It was a most insignificant works after the ones I had seen in Gloucester and, after a pang of fear, was soon forgotten as we gathered a little speed along the country road. The road dropped suddenly and crossed a stream and then rose up again like the towering flank of an elephant. On a higher level it followed the course of the stream until the stream was lost somewhere in the village after serving a saw-mills. “Here’s Uley,” remarked my Father as we passed an octagonal Pike House at some cross-roads. The little house had a bricked-out window giving it a veteran air and its grey roof seemed to be pulled down over it in grim defiance. Then we began to ascend through a village that was assembled on either side of the winding, ascending road. The houses on our left looked down on the houses on our right and would have felt superior in every respect if a few tradesmen had not become established with their shops among them. The village slumbered under a long grass and shrub mound but for the yelping and snarling of many dogs in the distance. There were houses of every period, some of them with Costwold gables, warm grey even in shadow or almost oozing the honey colour out of their depths in the melting sun, some of 58 [pageend60]them houses in dull brick and grim roughcast which even the hot summer sun could not render warm and inviting. My Father nodded towards the first inn, naming it with a quiet satisfaction, ignoring the nearby blacksmith’s with its grey grimy atmosphere. I was all ears for the dogs. We came upon them at a bend in the road, at the kennels and stables of the Hunt. The bloodthirsty hounds were leaping up above an encircling wall, revealing a confusion of black and brown and white heads, large flapping black and brown ears, flopping pink tongues, white teeth, and white tails raised and waving. At any moment I expected the hounds to burst forth in full cry, so fierce they were and unfriendly to our coming. I shuddered and was relieved when we passed on our way around the corner. The houses on the corner were large and one was a fine old Cotswold Manor with a farmyard beside it. Newly mounting hayricks scented the still air and the hay in the open Dutch barn was so light that it appeared to be lifting the curved roof high above all other mundane buildings. On the other side of the road was a cemetery for farm waggon wheels; large and small wheels, faded pink and blue, with broken rims and missing spokes, rusty bands and hubs decayed from years of turning in damp winters, were leaning against every possible pillar and post and wall. Stinging nettles and dock leaves flourished among them. On and on we ascended; past the bakery whose breath for a moment revived a memory of Newnham; a garage with a row of faded red petrol pumps and rusty advertisements; the village grocery looking across to the Post Office; a butcher’s shop, its cleavers and knives lying gleaming on chopping blocks, their 59 [pageend61]cleaving done for the day; past a fish-and-chips shop with its lingering smell of burnt oil and the flash of its metal covers; past many stone cottages, solitary and in terraces, some at the roadside, some set back in high front gardens; past another inn to which my Father nodded, almost bowed; past the gloomy Village Hall in roughcast and the mellow Cotswold Church on its mound of earth which seemed to be puffed up with the bones of the dead under a congestion of leaning tombstones: until we came to the village green. Here the road forked and my Father directed the driver to the right along a lane that dipped out of sight. I looked up the winding road to our left and desponded that we were not going up any higher. There were a few’ fine houses and cottages around the triangle of the Green, and lofty trees; but not to be outshone, the long low building of the inn was cream- washed, and a colourful sign of a jewelled crown with a deep burgundy velvet filling caught the eye and told the traveller that it was ‘The Old Crown Inn.’ In case our driver had missed it my Father called out: “The Old Crown, Fred!” and he was soon singing the praises of the innkeeper and his bitter beer from the wood. In the hot cabin of the throbbing lorry the driver’s mouth gaped wide and he looked at the silent inn with a mournful expression. The lane declined gently at first among some meaner cottages. All were silent but for the ‘cluck, cluck, cluck’ of hens, half buried in the baked earth in hollow’s shaped out by their breasts and looking like ducks floating in dark water. One dog got up to look at us, yawned, stretched out his long lean mongrel body, and then curled up again on an old sack in the shade of a porchw’ay. 60 [pageend62]Then the earth appeared to fall ¡away from us, taking my breath, as the lane dropped sharply down to a sudden corner over a brook. For a moment I caught a glimpse of a cottage and two solitary bungalows, one like a Swiss chalet which was set right up under the hill. “You aren’t going to like this place in winter, George,” muttered Fred when he had gained his composure after the descent. I scowled but listened to no more of his gloomy predictions. I was all agog for glimpses of our new home as it ¡appeared fitfully through gaps in the high hedge, only to vanish altogether as the hedge mended and then terminated at a cottage set up on a bank in its own garden. An old man was sitting in the shade of the doorway in an old high armchair. A chained collie was lying on the step before him while an excessively thin girl on sparrow legs, midway in her teens, was scraping out a saucepan on to a plate near the doorstep. She was almost a skeleton in skin and yet there was such animation about her face and in the friendly curious eyes which she turned towards us as we passed, ¡and in her wave as she recognised my Father, that I was most affected. We passed the cottage and turned into a loose stoned lane. The lane branched, one branch a track leading to the bungalow set right under the hill, the other, a gravelled drive with an iron swing gate leading to our bungalow. Huge elms towered above us and there was a great deal of raucous comment from the crows and the rooks, w’ho rose up out of the thick foliage and then settled down on higher, withered, leafless branches running into* the deep blue sky. My brother and I were out of the cabin like a shot and swinging the iron gate open. I didn’t know 61 [pageend63]where to run: into the bushes of the garden with their bright fruit, or to the house, or to the lawn at the front, or to the long corrugated garage and chicken- battery house which in an instant became for me a gymnasium? I ran everywhere in a moment, with a whole flock of birds terrorizing me as they spurted out of the fruit bushes and the peas to contemplate me and my brother dolefully from hedges and trees and fences for driving them out of their paradise. There were guffaws from the crows in the elm trees, who mocked them for their innocence. Innumerable slugs and snails must have crawled silently away and even as we ran through the garden, whooping with delight, there was a great flutter of butterflies from among the cabbages and two rabbits—who had not heeded the warning from the crows—went on nibbling at the lettuce among the weeds until my brother’s approach sent them scampering away, first in a panic towards the raspberry bushes, and then in a delightful scamper across the drive, through the hedge, and over the field rising up towards the scrubby hill, their white tails flashing mockingly at us to mark their almost imperceptible course over the brown earth until they were lost among the bushes. Later I clambered on to the roof of the garage and I saw the two of them in the field below the scrubby hill looking down longingly towards our garden. The dusk gathered. Two shots rang out: fired by a shadow m a wrinkled trilby hat. In the morning something wild and menacing sprang up out of the drive with a rabbit dangling from its fist. It was Reg, the skinny uncle of the very thin girl—a perfect piece of camouflage with his wrinkled old trilby, which I supposed to have been handed down from generation to generation with 62 [pageend64]earth-soiled hands, pulled well down over his brow to cast a shade about his deep-set, small, mysterious eyes. The sun had tanned and tanned his skin like taut leather about protruding bones. He carried so little flesh and his tattered coat hung from his narrow shoulders as if from a coat-hanger. His very wrinkled trousers were hitched about him with a huge leather strap and a brass buckle out of all proportion and there was so much mud caked and hardened and shiny on his trousers that I thought he was wearing a new kind of suede trousers until at the parting of his jacket I could see the weave of rough worsted <4oth. He was unshaven and dark hairs were growing out of every part of him. I looked him up and down with wondering eyes and expected to see his coarse dark hair bursting through every split and opening in his clothes. His eyebrows were hairy, his ears, his nostrils; he had an unkempt moustache, ragged sideboards, and hair grew out of the pores of his small face. I expected to see hair growing from his teeth which were the blackest and yellowest I had ever seen, some of them mere black stumps which had decayed to the gums. He had come to offer us one of the rabbits and so we got back some of the stolen produce in a more delectable form. He spoke to my Father in a quiet musical voice which belied his appearance. I was overwhelmed with excitement. The house itself was something to astonish me. For the first time we had no neighbours so I could run all round the house and enter it at the front door, or a side door, or even through the low windows. And, marvellous to behold, there was a bathroom with gleaming white porcelain and silver taps which said ‘hot’ or ‘cold.’ No longer would I have to bath in a tin bath with no privacy. The house was a bungalow with a corridor 63 [pageend65]down the centre with two rooms on either side, a large kitchen with a boiler, and a serving hatch and lots of cupboards. Upstairs there were three bedrooms along the length of the house, with a corridor leading from the stairs alongside two of the rooms to the third bedroom which filled the width of the house. On one side of the corridor were cupboards and there were more cupboards on the other side of the rooms under the acute slope of the roof. The rooms were partitioned by pine boards stained a very deep red-brown and the impression made on me by the house—though it was built of brick and stone —was of a log cabin with views out of numerous windows of rising and falling fields, undulating woods and hills; a landscape in its contours heaving and falling like an agitated breast but with huge shoulders affording me obscure shelter and serenity. Never before had I eaten so many garden fruits. The gooseberries were so ripe and large that to me they seemed to glow like gas lamps though for my brother they were like football bladders with their veins marking off the segments. We picked and ate and picked and ate to our hearts’ content ; gooseberries and blackcurrants, strawberries and loganberries and raspberries in such abundance that the glow in our cheeks might have been reflected from the raspberries which filled the whole corner of the garden with a deep hue. My Father had been to the village shopping and when we sat down to our evening meal the dessert he cooked for us was a very tame thing and unwelcome to our sated appetites. The peas straight from the burst pods and carrots pulled straight from the soil proved more to our relish. My brother and I thought we were in Paradise. The sun poured down on us and the occasional breeze 64 [pageend66]which, moved in delicate shadows over the field below, still tall and feathery with unmowed grass, blew upon our naked sun-flared bodies with a soothing breath; while at night, when the tawny owls, with spittle in their whistle as we believed, hooted from the dark woods all around us, the breeze murmured a soft lullaby in the trees until we were fast asleep. Happy and exhausted I went to sleep on a mattress on the floor with my brother beside me. I awoke at dawn with the crowing of the cocks, not from every hill as I supposed, but from the farms and the many scattered houses. I had never heard such a chorus and looking out of the window', and then another window, to convince myself that this enchanting world was not a dream I saw the sun already tingling the world beyond the shoulders of the hill with its first flush. And as the flush deepened, louder sang the dawn chorus, louder crowed the cocks: and another day dawned in Paradise for me. But it was a busy day, with my Father anxious to do as much as possible before he went off in the evening for a night’s work in the bakery. When we were able to, my brother and I wandered into the fruit bushes to take our fill, but the setting up of the wire-netting to enclose the fowls was a long and wearying task. When Monday dawned I was horrified with the wish popping in and out of my mind that something would happen to prevent my Mother and the rest of the family arriving to spoil my happiness. I tried to suppress the mishaps I imagined but they only came stronger into my mind and it was with some relief that I saw them appear at the end of the drive in mid-afternoon—though as soon as I saw my ¡sisters running about in curiosity all over the place, and 65 [pageend67]even invading my little world of juicy fruit, I was filled with resentment. My resentment didn’t last long and soon we were all sitting down among the raspberries and blackcurrants with the blood of the fruit dripping from our mouths and staining our hands, my little sister Margaret looking a gory sight, as she mingled the juices of many fruits by squeezing them in her little podgy hands, and transferred them to every quarter of her face and down her dress. My Mother, for whom I always cocked an eye, came to the open door and looked about with astonishment. She had never known her brood of temperamental children to be so quiet in the daytime. Suddenly six mouths stopped eating- as the loud harsh cry of a familiar voice sent a tremor of fear down every spine. First my mop of hair appeared above the green bushes, then my brother Ivor’s head appeared with a shock of wild hair about his forehead, then my sister Rosemary’s head of straight brown hair with a fringe, then Dorothy’s with slightly wavy brown hair, and a long face which already showed signs of suffering. Austin strained to put in an appearance, while my youngest sister Margaret crawled to the overgrown grass verge holding out her right hand, in its clutch a puree of blackcurrants and raspberries and an overripe gooseberry. “Wb at are you bloody children doing in those bushes!” shouted my Mother, her eyes blazing. We assembled at the verge and, with baby Margaret now clutching my brown body with her juicy hands, we shuffled in single file to meet the wrath to come. The sight of blood, if only fruit blood, roused my Mother to a frenzy and her fists and her fulminations flew about our ears scattering us into various corners of the house. Overhead there was 66 [pageend68]another din from my awakened Father who was banging the bare boards of his bedroom with his boot and calling out for less noise. On the following morning, Tuesday, my brother Ivor was the sole interest of my Mother. He was to start work in the bakery and already the avid look was in my Mother’s eyes as she handed him his new white apron and his meagre lunch and almost launched him on his new career with a shove. She watched him proudly until he was out of sight down the drive and then turned to the rest of us who were at that moment rather low in her esteem. Austin attached himself to me: and what a study he was—from the moment he stood on the lawn before the house and his eager young eyes looked about ami seemed to say ‘this is the world for me.’ Although he had shown some interest in the boats on the Severn he had never taken to the water and never accepted the challenge of its treacherous currents. He was not very venturesome and had shown no urge to kick a football or wield the willow in cricket. He appeared to be waiting for something. There was always a calm expression on his long face and a contentment which was expressed in his fair hair which curled up like woodshavings all over his head and to his embarrassment provoked many a tender comment. The sight of all the fields and farms around our new home transformed him; and his wondering eyes roamed everywhere until they rested eagerly on the cattle grazing in the meadows, on the horses and the groups of men at their harvest. After an hour or two of laborious weeding in the garden around the kidney beans, whose tendrils had wandered out into the air and had begun to twine about weeds and anything but the sticks erected for them, I felt a strong urge to hide and abandon myself 67 [pageend69]to dreams. Austin had wandered into the raspberry bushes and so I turned my thoughts to an orchard lying below the field near the brook. Both my parents were indoors and I quickly skirted the edge of the hayfield and with my heart thumping with excitement went to the orchard, whose entrance was through an old green paling gate. Around it was a congregation of tall stinging nettles waiting for the gate to open and admit them to the already overcrow'ded enclosure. They were very weary in the blazing sun and soon fell down as I laid about them with a stick. Birds flew up in whirring clouds as my stick swished through the air, hurried into flight by the clattering cry of a crowd of blackbirds who made an enormous din and for a moment startled me. I pushed open the rusty-hinged gate and elatedly made my way through the tall grass, and the saplings shooting straight up from the roots of the trees. The trees were thickly planted and branch entwined with branch to make an apple-spotted canopy through which the sun flittered a golden green, flashing on the cheeks of the apples and dappling the tall grass. I made my lair and lay murmuring with bliss at the apple picking joys to come. The birds slowly returned to the branches; one robin hopped down an apple laden branch—his red waistcoat puffed—to eye me and the apples as if aware that I too was awaiting the autumn. I heard someone coming and lay quite still, my heart thumping. Suddenly the curly head of my young brother ¡appeared above the tall grass. “What do you want?’’ I sought irritably. He said nothing and with a serious look on his face lay down beside me. I resumed my day-dreams. “Shall we .save up and buy a farm?” he asked quite quietly, containing his excitement. 68 [pageend70]“You can save up yourself!” I retorted gruffly. “I am going to be a boxer and a sportswriter.” We were silent and I was lost in dreams, hardly noticing my young brother get up and saunter away, lie was absent from the lunch-table and my Mother scolded me for not knowing his whereabouts. Much to my joy, after lunch I was despatched to find him instead of weeding in the garden. “I’ll find him, Mam,” I said ingratiatingly to my Mother, who was scowling fiercely. I set off, hoping that I wouldn’t come upon him too soon. I wandered in all directions and everywhere found bronzed men and women gathering in the hay, all of them in the happiest of spirits and very friendly in their greetings to me. “Thee’st got a good crop of ’ay,” sallied one old farmworker, referring to my mop of hair. There was laughter all round and I blushed deeply, hurrying away and losing interest in the search for my brother, walking under the hedgerows and punching at the outgrown branches. When I came upon more groups of workers I scrutinised them at a distance. Eventually I came upon my brother in a hayfield. In the centre a hayrick was rising up towards the burning sun. Haycocks were dotted about everywhere and between them my young brother was leading a chestnut horse who was helping a grey roan to pull a blue and red farm-waggon. Austin was handling the horses as if he had been doing it for years, without any instructions from a trilby-hatted figure on top of the hay. He sensed when to stop and start, and the horses responded to his piping exhortations with alacrity. I hadn’t dared to venture far into the field and slowly the swaying waggon came towards me until 69 [pageend71]I could see the proud gleam in my brother’s blue eyes. “Steady.... steady!!” intimately my brother advised the chestnut horse that in response to his ‘geeup’ had plunged forward a little too eagerly, as if to impress me, the brother of his new young guide. The waggon stopped and with a quick glance at me my brother, his little brows pressed in concentration, went round both the horses checking the harness and pretending to adjust the straps. “Our Mam’s very angry with you, Austin. Why didn’t you come home for dinner?” Before he could answer there was a cry from one of the men pitching up the hay to move the waggon on. My brother’s face expressed annoyance at me for putting him in the position of having to be told. He urged the horses forward, all intensity. “I’ve bin ’elpin with the ’arvest,” he exclaimed proudly, emphasising the words like a countryman, and I thought he was going to spit to confirm it. Instead, he pushed his little grey cap over the back of his head and stroked the long white nose of the chestnut horse affectionately. “I ’ad me dinner with ’arry!” He pointed to the man on the top of the waggon. “Harry’s the carter,” he added with excitement, “These is ’arry’s horses.” I moved up to stroke the chestnut horse. But this was the moment he chose to shake off all he tormenting flies and I stood back in alarm as he shook himself vigourously, snorting with anger and rattling the brasses and the chains of his harness. My brother held on grimly to the ring of the gleaming bit and tried to remain erect, though the ducking of the horse’s head pulled him up and down with it. 70 [pageend72]“Don’t be afraid,’’ firmly said my young brother, “’ee won’t hurt thee.” The waggon was moved forward and then stopped again. I moved up to the horse. I thought he was winking at me and then I saw that the flies were settling around his eyes and that he was constantly twitching his eyelids to send them on their way. There were dried tear drops in the corner of his eyes and I felt an urge to clean them out. “Aren’t you coming home, Austin?” A look of displeasure passed over his eyes. “We hope to clear this field before dark,” he replied, his treble voice not managing the authority he wished to impart to his words, though his face was serious and his eyes sharp. He turned the horses towards the rick and they plunged forward, Austin trying to give the impression that he was in control of them though he was hurried along and almost swept off his feet. I followed him. At the rick Harry, the Carter, called down to him in warm, admiring tones. “That’s me boy, Austin.” Austin’s eyes were merry with joy but his face remained serious. He flashed a glance at me which said. You see! “Get the cider, Austin!” called down Harry and with deliberate stride my brother fetched it from under the heap of hay. The men gathered around him, and swilling out the battered enamel mugs with cider, he handed around the drink to the thirsty men, watching them intently all the time and storing up in his admiring mind the details of their actions. “Is that thee brother, Austin?” My brother nodded. “My Mother says he’s got to come home,” I said anxiously. 71 [pageend73]“’ee’s alright with us,” replied Reg who lived in the cottage near our home. The waggon was unloaded and my brother led the horses on their next round. I watched them go into the distant corner of the field. Then I turned round and, in spite of the hot sun, ran all the way home. I was breathless when I entered the kitchen and confronted my angry Mother. “Where’s your brother?” Breathlessly I stammered out my reply and pointed in the direction of the farm whose farmhouse, set above the farmbuildings, could be seen out over our garden. “He wouldn’t come.” “I’ll give him harvest.” I gobbled down my tea and escaped to the garden with a promise to carry on with the weeding—a promise I had to fulfil as whenever I looked up I saw my Mother’s scowling face at the window. Dusk was already settling when suddenly my Mother’s voice rang out, startling me out of a reverie. “You’d better go and fetch your brother.” My sisters appeared as if from nowhere at the sound of my Mother’s voice and I was reluctantly about to move off when they cried out: “There’s Aust, Mam!” He came up the drive quite unconcerned. He was W’histling as cheerful as a lark over a cornfield. His little grey cloth cap was pushed back over his head, his hands were deep in his pockets and his gait was jaunty in a way I had never seen it before. My Mother stood in the doorway and my sisters huddled together behind her with their heads protruding on either side. The fierce expression was on my Mother’s face with the nether lips protruding and she was picking her nails. 72 [pageend74]“Where have you been!!” she spat out. My brother, who was never impertinent, continued whistling until he slowly descended from the heaven of his bliss. He took his hand out of his pocket and extending it proudly to my Mother said: “I’ve been helping with the ’arvest, Mam.” A shilling’s worth of fierceness went out of her countenance as my Mother took the coin from bis extended hand. “You should have come ’ome when your brother came for you!” She was still aggressive but pleasure was modifying her tone before she had finished remonstrating with him. Then her expression changed again. “If I know anything about it, you bloody well earned it.” “I looked after the hosses, Mam.” Pride flashed in my Mother’s eyes. “Cart hosses, Mam. . . . Prince, he’s the grey one. Ging'er, he’s the chestnut one. Harry says I’m good with horses. Can I go again tomorrow, Mam?” My Mother, no doubt giving the shilling a squeeze, said he could. There was bliss in my brother’s blue eyes. His face was very meditative. “Can I have supper early and go to bed, Mam? We shall have a hard day tomorrow. I can go and help Harry catch the horses. They don’t start getting in the hay until ten o’clock, Harry says, as the dew ain’t dried until then.” Until the other rooms were ready my young brother was sleeping with Ivor and me. In the night I awoke to find him pulling at my mane of hair and exhorting me to ‘Wo there’ and to ‘Gee up’. (Ivor was lucky to have shorter hair.) My ear he thought the ring of 73 [pageend75]th© bit and I spent a busy time clearing several fields of hay. Austin was up and about long before the sun. Well before ten o’clock he had disappeared and I didn’t see him again until I heard him whistling on his way home and breaking out into a song after the manner of a Swiss yodeller. Perhaps it was the influence of the Swiss chalet-like bungalow under the hill, but whenever he looked up into the hills with his bright purposive eyes he would start yodelling and I could often hear his voice about the farm though I couldn’t see him. The cows soon got to know it and its first notes were enough to call them to the gate when he went to fetch them for milking. He yodelled and whistled all day long and he had a pacifying effect on the most temperamental cow so that she yielded her milk abundantly. Even Reg the rabbiter lost his taciturnity when it came to the subject of my brother, and my Mother and I and my sisters looked at Austin very proudlj’ when Reg came to deliver the .milk and told us of his days on the farm. I was disconcerted, however, when he looked at me and said: “What’s ’ee going to do?” Before my Mother could say anything I chimed in with: “I am going to be apprenticed at Mawdesley’s.” Reg shook his head, but not precisely, and I was left wondering as to his opinion of me and of Mawdes- ley’s. Through the hatch could be heard my radio. Reg listened for a moment and, looking up to my Mother, asked if I could bring my radio along to the cottage so that his Mother, who was bedridden, could hear a Sunday morning Service? The following Sunday I took my radio along to the cottage. T was ushered into the most crowded room 74 [pageend76]I had ever entered. There was a little door just inside the front door which, partly opened, revealed the narrowest stairs imaginable. In the living-room was a large double bed with four large brass knobs and a series of smaller ones, and the sun filtering in through the lace curtains of the small window spread out quickly to sparkle on the knobs which were beautifully polished. The sparkling knobs had a wonderful effect in the gloomy crowded room and they shared their light with the brass rail of the fender and the black- lead polish of the beautifully kept fire-grate and with the horse brasses hanging from the mantel-shelf. The huge double bed dominated the room. The rest of the old furniture which was crowded with ornaments of every description, one or two plants which were frightened to put forth their long pointed leaves, and faded photographs, sepia and white in carved wooden frames—had a very forlorn appearance. The walls and the ceiling were smoke-stained and the faded sepia photographs on the walls appeared to have been similarly stained with the brown of the ceiling and walls. In the bed was an old man and an old woman, both propped up with spotlessly white pillows. The white of the pillows made their pale, lined faces seem quite grey. They were both breathing heavily, the old man with his dull grey moustache gasping at a more rapid rate than his companion who, catching less of the sunlight, looked more pallid than he. No mention was ever made of their sickness and I concluded that they were dying of old age though they were but in their sixties. The thin girl was bustling about among the furniture. Her thinness was a commendable foresight on the part of nature in anticipation of lack of space in the room. She was as straight as >a sapling and her 75 [pageend77]dark hair, parted in the middle and fastened back across her ears, was done in as small a bun as any I had seen and so in proportion to her little round head and long thin neck and body. She flashed a glance at me out of the corner of her shy eyes and went on busying herself with the ornaments on a huge chest of drawers. A small table was put at the bottom corner of the bed near the fireplace. I placed the radio on it and opened up the lid which automatically raised the speaker iat an angle. I had hidden a Sunday newspaper, with an article in it on Tommy Farr, inside the lid and this I took out and placed on the table. I then connected the accumulator. I was conscious of four dimming eyes opening at this modern marvel and when I twiddled the knobs of the radio and a voice came over the air announcing the broadcast of the Morning Service from a West Country church, the eyes of the old people started as if they had just witnessed a miracle. The expression on the old lady’s face as she lifted her weary eyelids and revealed eyes glistening with tears was marvellous to behold and as the hymn, ‘Crown him with many Crowns’ was sung by the choir I saw her slowly turn her to the window, pull aside the curtains, and look towards the little church, her soul lifted with the memories of her devotions there. The old man fixed his stare on the radio, alternating between belief and unbelief, while his withered lips under his drooping moustache moved all the time in silent repetition of the words of the hymns and the prayers. I could see the tears streaming faster and faster down the cheeks of the old lady and they glistened as she leaned forward a little out of the shade to look through the window. Her hands, placed outside the sheet, were trembling and I saw the huge 76 [pageend78]labouring hand of the old man move tenderly across and grasp both of them in its calloused palm. She turned her head ¡and a faint smile tried to form itself oin her trembling lips. I thought she was going to break into sobs but the old hand gripping hers renewed its pressure and she took strength from it. Her eyes opened and she turned the most enraptured gaze upon the modern miracle, the little portable radio which was mine, as she heard the Priest saying: ‘In the name of the Father. . . .’ before his sermon, while the congregation could be heard sitting down and coughing and shuffling. The old man was asleep and sometimes snoring before the sermon was done. His lean granddaughter was embarrassed and tried to awaken him. He only mumbled in a half-awake fashion and went back to his slumbers. The old lady never took her eyes off the radio again and though the preacher was talking about one of Christ’s miracles it was the miracle of my radio that was creating* the wonder-filled light in her eyes. The old sleeper seemed to know when the sermon was coming to an end and, half awake, he mumbled: “Has he done yet?” His wife gave him a nudge with her elbow to remind him of my presence and then they both closed their eyes and clasped their hands as the Blessing was given from the altar. The church clock could be heard chiming in the distance. I switched off the radio and the twelve o’clock chimes of our own village church came in through the open door. I was watched with wonder as I disconnected the accumulator, returned the newspaper to the inside of the radio, and closed the lid. Suddenly the old lady asked: “Do you have to use a newspaper?” 77 [pageend79]1 realised that she thought the newspaper had some function in regard to the radio. “No,” I replied. “I was just hiding it in there.” Iler face expressed deep bewilderment. Then Reg, her son, who had been leaning against the door post, came in. “You have to take that there accummulator up to Bill Bruton’s garage for charging, don’t you?” I nodded my agreement. “And you have a dry battery in there?” He pointed to the interior of the radio. I nodded again. His old Mother shook her head with pleasure at his understanding but she was even more confused and looked at us with infinite respect. I took my leave of them and saw those four aging eyes fix on me and my miracle box as 1 walked out into the sunshine and the sounds of birds everywhere. Thin Reg saw me to the gate and the even thinner Jean, who had suddenly lost her shyness, waved to me from the doorway. I went home full of importance and waited for the rest of the family, my Father excepted, to come home from church so that I could tell them my story. 78 [pageend80]GIOVANNI GROTTO TWENTY-EIGHT POEMS Mr. Ealing said So now, you with feeling know the look upon the atitude of topmost Fernando I’o ceiling * There you’ll see An aeroplane a fly come and an aero lovely crawling had a helicopter for a baby Or- is it a Now they fly blemish without together even meaning? more amicably * * Rhyme is no ruddy good, ‘Be correct’, said Mr. Ferret who’s said Robin book on the Hood, And shot an nobility was very explicit arrow through the wood It hit a poet making love He flew to heaven as a ringtail dove How obscene to go behind the scenes And eat icecreams * Yet, yet, yes, ‘Don’t’ said, ‘Yes’ yes, This is the land of ‘Do’ said, dreams ‘No’ * 79 [pageend81]Oli! proper is the word for me Especially when I fall from my tricebicycle But when from St. Paul’s I venture like a swallow into space I find myself properly in disgrace * The flower shadow flickers on the wall Neither short nor tall Light gone The shadow’s out * If words were birds But they are not Poets would be spared a lot.

This happened in July, 1950. I am deeply ashamed for never having committed the above mentioned crimes which I was credited with, though I would dearly have liked to commit them. But I have always been much too lazy for political activities. Although completely innocent, I had a fair chance of being' hanged or at best, to get a life term. For the time being it was much more probable that I would be hanged; the prison were overcrowded. For the last four decades communist leaders have been engaged in clarifying and interchanging their dogmas, busy finding the right expressions for the Platonic ideal of communism and the communists. These and other transcendental questions have left them no time for such practical matters as organizing public supplies or the extermination of vermin, let alone the building of houses or even prisons, so very much more necessary. Since the prisons were overcrowded and there was no hope for new prisons, the Secret Police had to do its best to clear them out. In spite of that, as soon as the iron door was locked, I felt relief. I had many reasons to rejoice. Since I hated and despised the communists (I hated them whenever I was alone, I despised them when I was not alone), I felt moral relief: finally, I was in a position worthy of me; I was where I belonged in a communist state, in prison. Besides, I was excused from a hypocritical life where I had to control and 84 [pageend86]suppress not only my words, but even my movements. Before undergoing a minor operation I had sweat on my forehead for days and days. I was quite sure that I will, in the first seconds of narcosis, call Stalin a Caucasian bandit, Rakosi’s bald head a rotten ostrichegg sticking out of the Hungarian swamp and how could I know if there was no informer among the nurses attending the operation? Writing and talking had become too dangerous after ’48. At first I had to give up chatting with friends; later, I could not publish what I had written; later, I wrote for my drawer and later, I did not dare to write for my drawer since I was sure there would be a house-search one day and thought only, what I should write and was on the verge of giving up even thinking. Life consisted of unceasing humiliations, where to hold moral principles was equal to either suicide, or to intellectual ruin. I felt like someone gravely ill, who had lost all feelings save that of pain, and who was glad to meet his death. Now I felt dead and happy, as if my soul would hover above my body and laugh at its former fear of death; I was no longer afraid of arrest; I was arrested. I have already confessed that I was always very lazy. I only wrote poetry when my editor pressed me. Once I did not write a single poem for five years and then wrote a whole book of poetry in twenty days, because my publisher was implacable by nature and was sitting in my hall for hours, until I handed him half a dozen sonnets late in the evening. True, I had already spent eight years in emigration, sixteen months in the Hungarian Army (peace) and forty-four months in the U.S. Army (war), I spent a period in a concentration camp in Africa as a “dangerous democrat and anglophile” another period on Ellis Island in New York Harbour, as a “premature antifascist’’, until finally I arrived in this prison as a „fascist 85 [pageend87]beast“. I had wasted much time in cloud-gazing, growing cacti, chatting with friends and what is even worse, sitting at my desk and working hard in order to propagate some humanitarian ideas. Now shut up in prison, I felt that all this time was lost, although sweet to remember. But at last I had plenty of time for poetry. I was in solitary confinement and there was nothing else left for me but to write poems. This made me happy. Later, in a concentration camp, I was to witness that the workers sighed for a hammer, the motormen for an engine, the painters for canvas; I was the only man able to continue his own profession there and in this cell. The previous year, urged on by useful premonitions and private interests, I read practically every major prison-diary to be found in Hungarian and world- literature. From the diary of a Hungarian poet, Ka- zinczy, I learnt that in the Austrian prison of Kuf- stein, where he was held captive at the end of the eighteenth century as an empiricist, they had given him neither paper nor ink so that he was obliged to mix the rust scraped off his bed with water in his mug and with this he wrote on the margin of the books he borrowed from the prison-library. These pages he tore out and hid them in his straw-mattress. Maronel- li the Italian carbonaro who was imprisoned in Brunn around 1830, wrote with his own blood on his sheet and shirt. All these studies helped me precious little: communist prisons cannot boast of libraries nor books, nor even of mugs or sheets; the only piece of furnishing to be found in the cells of the cellar of the Secret Police HQ is a bed constructed of three planks of wood. But if nothing else, the prison-diaries taught me resourcefulness. Once a week I got a broom to clean my cell. I pulled out a fibre of the broom and sharpened it on the concrete floor; the next morning I 86 [pageend88]filched some sheets of toilet-paper. To write with their own blood is an old tradition of poets. First I tried my gums, but all the blood they gave was hardly enough for a few characters. I had to invent a new method. I rubbed the tip of my finger on the cement- floor until blood was gushing from it. This did hurt terribly, but it resulted in an ink-pot; each time I needed a drop of blood or two all I had to do was to press my finger. After I had managed to write four lines, the guard, who watched me through the Judas- hole, came in, boxed my ears and took the paper. I had to look for a new method. The next day it occurred to me that in Homer’s time writing was unknown. How did Homer make his poems? Probably walking up and down on the shore or in a beautiful garden. (I could never accept the theory that Homer was blind. How could anyone, who never saw it, describe the “wine-coloured oiliness” of the Ionic sea at dusk?) I decided to try for myself and began to walk, like Homer. The cell was two steps ami a half long; I could have taken three shorter steps. But no; this would have meant giving in to the Procrustes-prison of the communists. I made up my mind not to let myself be influenced by them, I rather bumped against the wall at every third step. The poems came straight away and with incredible ease. How and why? It is easy to answer the “how”. Pen, paper, typewriter or dictaphone are as far from the ancient ceremony of versification as the neon- lighting I saw in some South-American churches, from the Holy Mass. Only one problem remained to be solved: how to memorise my own poems? I thought of twenty to thirty lines a day; whenever I invented a new line, I repeated the whole poem three times. And 87 [pageend89]every morning’ I repeated the whole lot I made in prison. It is much more difficult to answer the “why”. Let me start with the personal and then try and find the general implications. My main driving power is the fear of death. Whenever I was asked by a customs officer for my final destination on a train, at an airport or harbour; a cemetery emerged before my eyes. The thought, that I will die, made me jump out of bed at the age of eight. My friends, my parents, my wife used to encourage me, saying that my fear will soften up by becoming older, but it never did and still doesn’t. Whenever I write a poem, I am not afraid of death; but I am at all other times. Lazy as I am, I would never have become a poet for the sake of fame, money or out of vanity; although it is rather a pleasant advantage not having to court a woman for two weeks at an end as I would have had to as an architect or a doctor, but reach the same result after an afternoon’s courtship. The fear of death was within me in prison. There was a cell at the end of the corridor, with a bath-tub in it. Every second or third evening the henchmen of the secret police used to drag a victim along, outside my iron door. The victim was probably unconscious, or maybe his mouth was gagged. They opened the door, then a splash was heard and a horrible, short, terrifying groan. Five or six seconds later I felt the smell of acid; but I could not tell whether it was sulphuric or nitric acid, or both. This was horrible, just as horrible as the sound of beatings and lashings I could hear at night, the screams of the tied-up men; but after the screams, the sounds of beatings and the smell of the deadly acid better rhymes, likenesses and pictures always sprung to my mind. And if by chance it happened to be quiet and I felt my inspira88 [pageend90]tion to be insufficiently strong, all I had to think of was my own hanging. The vision of a man is multiplied many times by the mere fact of being locked up in a cell. They say, solitary confinement makes a man go slowly mad; but as far as poets are concerned I think it is a revival. We all possess this necessary kind of poetical phantasy in our childhood, especially the visual part of it, but we lose it later. Or, to be exact: ordinary people forget about it, insane ones turn back to it, dive into it and poets realize it. When I was a child, I saw in a stove a witch, in a crumpled oak tree a stove (it was not similar to a stove, it was a stove). There were cracks on the wall of my nursery, making pictures. Directly above the foot of my bed I had discovered the outlines of a beggar. (It did not look like a beggar; it was a real beggar.) He became my friend, representing the incarnation of human misery; every evening I had silent talks with him. In the mirror, there was a child and a nursery; similar to me and my nursery, I conceded, but still different. He lived his own life. Whenever I moved or ate, I watched him and although I guessed, that he may move or he might eat, I still watched him. I could never be sure; he had his separate and independent life. On the prison wall, pictures similar in their effect to those of my childhood, were reborn. I discovered the British lion and the Statue of Liberty, although Liberty became old and was sitting in an armchair, without a torch. There was a long, vertical crack on the wall; on the left side of it, I discovered a stage coach with passengers, stuck in the mud, and above it, the letters MMIR. There could be no doubt: the long crack represented the river Rhine and the passengers were probably aristocrats, fleeing from the reign of terror. But what had I in common with them? After 89 [pageend91]some hours of thinking I finally solved the problem. The letters M M IR at the place of Paris, could only represent the initials of Maximilien. Marie Isidore de Robespierre and the passengers of the ooach were no aristocrats but Girondists. The coach is stuck in the mud, they will soon be caught up by Robespierre’s henchmen, and they will drag them back to the Conciergerie. When I was kicked into the cell, I had already heard the banging of the iron door and the hissing of the air say: Gi-ronde; really, it should have occurred to me before- So it was not I who thought of the theme of my first poem, I merely saw it on the prison-wall, and the rest followed. I made up the first poem about Madame Roland—whom I felt to be very close to me for a long time. This is how the other themes followed. First, I was afraid, having made four poems of the hieroglyphs on the wall, whatever was I going to do from now on? I had to live on old memories like ia dog on a gnawed bone; but after all, this is what one does even when free. The world seemed to have become petrified at the very minute of my arrest; a world officially declared an ancient monument. The sharpness of my senses had, in prison, created a sharpness of visions; I walked in this world as if in a splendid museum, undisturbed by the chatter of the guides or the silly remarks of visitors. I believe this is just about the ideal condition for making poems. Within five weeks I had approximately fifteen hundred lines of poetry ready. Unfortunately, soon enough ia new series of hearings began lasting eighteen hours a day and later I was transferred to the concentration camp in the mountains of Northern Hungary. Here I wias forced to work from dawn to dusk three hundred and sixty- four days a year (the only exception being the first of May) and the happy days of Aranjuez were gone. 90 [pageend92]Fortunately, not forever. There was no possibility for making poems at night-time in crowded barracks; I was too tired and my head was empty, just as the planks in the barracks were devoid of poetical hieroglyphs. But there was still something, that we called the prison of third grade. The prison of first grade was Hungary itself, behind barbed wire, the prison of second grade was the concentration camp with a second barbed wire around it: the prison of the camp had one more strand of wire. After a few remarks about the Byzantine police state, I found myself in the solitary confinement cell and was put on a starvation diet of one dish of beans or mashed potatoes and a slice of bread a day. This place was even better and far more fitted to poetry-making than the underground cell of the secret police had been. I had always hoped to live sixty-four years at least, as my father did: but the sixty-four squares on the window reminded me that on this diet there were no more than sixty-four days left. There was no time for loafing. All sixty-four squares of the miniature window were covered with white paint, but there was one small hole in it, no bigger than a pinhead. The first evening a pale yellow ray of the setting sun penetrated the hole and hit me in the eye. I remembered a night on Tarawa Atoll, with the radiant full moon reflected on the surface of the water and green and yellow diffused lights on every side. I immediately made a poem about the Pacific. But now, when I write “I made a poem”, I feel as if boasting. The first person singular is not quite right: it was rather the situation than myself that made the poem. The bewitched situation in which I saw in my cell the waves and night-lights of the Pacific better, clearer and much more as realities than at the time, when I really had seen them. As if the whole time 91 [pageend93]from Frisco to Tarawa and back, I had been asleep, but a camera in my pocket would automatically have filmed everything, which was now conjured up by someone who held it in front of my eyes. This time, death was surer and nearer than it had been in the underground cell. In a short time, I lost thirty pounds in weight, but closeness to death urged me only to hurry up with my work. Weakness of body became inseparable from strength of mind, if I dare call fear of death and the struggle against it, strength. The first three hours of my confinement, the time I was walking up and down in my cell pondering over my own misery, those three hours lasted three thousand hours; indeed, they lasted longer than the six months I spent in the prison of the third grade. Four days later, when I was regularly making fifty lines every day, the day was gone in half an hour. Whenever they sounded tattoo, I considered it a hallucination amongst my other hallucinations, and would not believe that a day had gone until the 12 watt electric bulb in my cell went out. It was quite incredible that beside the absolute relativity of time (as I would call the theory of Einstein) there is a personal, a relative relativity of time, bound to the conditions of life. After lights went out, I stretched myself out on the planks, I repeated the lines written that day and, with a smile, tried to make four or eight lines more. I needed four days to get into a normal routine, when hunger began to work. Hunger is as much of a stimulant as it is a narcotic drug; stimulating not the stomach or bowels, but phantasy, spiritual life, associations, or, even more important in poetry, the dissociations of thoughts; thus it becomes a narcotic drug as well. The first few days all I felt was the primary, crude, ordinary sort of hunger, digging into my abdomen, causing cramps 92 [pageend94]and altogether interfering with my work. But after four days came the feeling of starvation, the painless, almost happy and delirious, floating inspiration, that leads steeply towards the road to death by hunger. In a few weeks’ time, I had nearly finished the volume of poetry. At this point, my friends had managed to smuggle a large piece of bacon into my daily vegetables, which saved my life all right, but it also slowed down the completion of my volume of poetry. No sooner did I suck through the first portion of bacon, just like sucking sweets (death had instantly disappeared from my side at the mere sight of the bacon), instead of thinking of my next line, I began making plans of what to do once I got out of here and reached San Francisco again? The only thing that troubled me was not that I would die in prison, but that my poems would be lost in that event. I had had the same problem in the underground cell, where I had been scared of being hanged; and whenever I turned my thoughts to that, I had the fixed idea that my brain would become like a collapsed pit, and nobody could ever extract the ore buried inside it. From this hazard, as well as from the hardships of finishing my book with a full tummy, I was spared by the lovely and sudden death of Stalin. Being sent back to the barracks I had to give up the idea of inventing more poems in prison. In solitary confinement, I had to face the problem of how to save my poems, alone. Now my_ fellow- prisoners faced the same problem, collectively. During the six months that I spent in solitary confinement, they had made an anthology of world-poetry on wrapping-paper and they were very proud of it. They said they were even more proud of my poems, which, in 93 [pageend95]one way or another, expressed their feelings as well. But the anthology of world-poetry on wrapping paper had, beside its incomparably greater value, a second advantage over my poems in prison—the poems of Baudelaire, Catullus or Hölderlin were printed and reprinted in thousands and thousands of copies. Their existence was seperate from the existence of their authors. The existence of my poems on the other hand was closely connected with, and dependent on my individual survival. Now, some hundreds of my fellow prisoners learned all my poems (some four hundred lines) by heart. They crammed and mugged my poems while cutting stones or building roads. The optimists thought, there would be a war in five or ten years; then the U.S. tanks would be about twenty miles from our camp and we should, as Nazi or Communist ritual demanded, all be massacred. Statistics proved that after every massacre there were survivors to be pulled out alive from the lime-pit, about one for every two hundred. My friends wanted to play safe and did not rest until six hundred of them had memorised my poems. This meant, so they said, that three of them would still be left to crawl out of the mass-grave, who would then be able to recite my poems to posterity. We all cheered up at this idea. But some of my friends still had doubts. Two manuscripts of my poems were buried; one of them near the barracks, the other at the trigonometrical point on top of the hill in the camp. We all cherished hopes that our descendants would dig up the site of our sufferings. When we reached this point, we received help from where we least expected it: the officers of the secret police gave us a hand. At their headquarters in the capital they heard rumours that I had written poems in prison. Every week, one or two of them, made their appearance in the camp—only eighty 94 [pageend96]miles from the capital—and used to call for interrogation (they were excellent in inventing any silly pretext) an inmate to the office building. Alone with the prisoner, they offered him two hundred cigarettes for each poem. (They never called me, they knew I did not do business with communists.) My friends on the other hand knew they could disclose only poems free from the taint of politics and they asked for three hundred cigarettes. They usually agreed on two hundred and fifty, and the officer departed with a poem in his pocket. Hungarians are fond of poetry. I could compare their liking for poetry with that of the ancient Greeks, the Arabs under Abdel Malik’s or Haroun al-Rashid’s reign, or that of the British in the nineteenth century. Experience taught me that, however funny it may sound, even secret police officers have to be included in the category of poetically-minded people. They were murderers and I had the consolation that the very same people who might kill my body, would preserve my soul. Fortunately, it did not come to that. When the late Imre Nagy—who was later executed, or rather murdered, by the communists—became Prime Minister of Hungary, he ordered our camp to be disbanded immediately. I left Hungary after the Revolution of 1956, but I had no time to take my manuscripts with me. When ¡at last my poems made in prison were published in London, I got letters from every corner of the world. My former fellow-prisoners were and are still practising textual criticism on me, for they remember the originals better than I do. There are many instances, when posterity discusses the poetic texts of certain poets: but I don’t think there has ever been another case where they were arguing with the poet himself. All this goes to 95 [pageend97]show that even prisons have their own advantages and that there is some truth in the old Hungarian saying: To become a poet true, Off to darkest hell with you. 96 [pageend98]NOTES AND REVIEWS DIE STIEFMUETTERLICHE MUSE Nach einer allgemein gültigen Regel soll die Gesundheit ein natürlicher Zustand des Menschen sein. Das würde bedeuten, dass sich ein Mensch, der krank ist, ausserhalb des normalen Zustandes befände. In übertragenem Sinne liesse sich formulieren, Bücher zu lesen sei eine natürliche Tätigkeit des Menschen, während derjenige, der Bücher schreibt, sich auf irgendeine Weise ausserhalb der Menge normaler Menschen befände. Es liesse sich noch hinzufügen, dass jeder normale Mensch von irgendetwas lebt, wobei wir dieses Irgendetwas als Arbeit jedweicher Art bezeichnen. Merkwürdigerweise jedoch ernährt das Schreiben von Büchern den Schriftsteller nur selten, nur in Ausnahmefällen. Musen sind Stiefmütter. Der New Yorker Psychoanalytiker, D. M. Levy, stellte fest, dass es Mütter gibt, deren Übermässige Fürsorglichkeit für ihre Kinder nur als Versuch zu verstehen ist unbewusste Hassregungen zu kompensieren. D. M. Levy nennt sie ‘rejecting mothers’. Sind nun die Schriftsteller, Söhne der Musen, unerwünschte Kinder übereifriger Mütter, Mütter, die sie im Grunde ihres Herzens eigentlich hassen ? Falls manche Schriftsteller eine solch merkwürdige Psychopathin als Mutter ihrer Seele haben, lässt es sich allerdings leicht erklären, dass sie darunter leiden. Und wie lange brauchen sie, bis sie merken, mit welch einer Megäre sie es zu tun haben! Stellen Sie sich nun, bitte, vor, Sie bemühten sich um literarischen Erfolg in einem Ihnen fremden Lande. Versetzen Sie sich in die Lage eines, in seiner Heimat erfolgreichen, Schriftstellers, der sich erst in reiferem Alter für ein Leben im Exil entschloss. Er kam in ein Land, das er nur aus Büchern kannte, und das er erst jetzt wirklich kennenzulernen begann. Er kam unter Menschen, deren Sitten und Gebräuche sich von seiner bisherigen Umgebung unterscheiden, und die auf verschiedene Ereignisse abwei97 [pageend99]chend reagieren. Kurz, er kam in eine Welt, die ihn nicht kennt, ebenso wie er diese Welt nicht kennt; er ist in ihr nicht aufgewachsen und wird mit ihr nicht verwachsen. Trotzdem will er sich ihr mitteilen, und dafür hat er sehr zwingende Gründe. Dieses Sich-Mitteilen ist die eigentliche Substanz jeder schriftstellerischen Tätigkeit. Der Schriftsteller nimmt die Umwelt empfindsamer auf als die übrigen Menschen; er erfasst Dinge, die anderen verborgen bleiben, seine Wahrnehmungskraft übersteigt die der übrigen Menchen, die die Dinge zwar auch bemerken, sie jedoch nicht zu erfassen vermögen. Hinter die Dinge sehen und sie auswerten, das ist die ureigentlichste Bestimmung eines Schriftstellers. Ob er richtig oder falsch sieht, ist etwas anderes, aber er sieht tatsächlich hinter die Dinge, vertieft sich in ihre Ursachen und Ursprung und projiziert das, was er sah, in Poesie oder Prosa. So war es und so wird es immer sein. Für dieses Sich-Mitteilen braucht er einen Mittler, und hier beginnt eine Jagd, die eine grössere Zähigkeit erfordert, als das Schreiben eines Buches. In slawischen Märchen führt meistens eine weisse Hindin den Prinzen zu dem geliebten Wesen. Zum Verleger aber, dem das gefiele, was der Exilschriftsteller schrieb, führt höchstens ein glücklicher Zufall. Mit diesem Zufall ist eine Menge von Voraussetzungen verknüpft; eine von ihnen kann sein, dass der Autor, dank eines anderen glücklichen Zufalles, ein Thema angesprochen hat, das die Oeffentlichkeit zu eben dieser Zeit zufällig interessiert. Es kann aber geschehen, dass er einen Verleger für eben nur dieses eine Thema findet, das heisst, nur für sein erstes Buch, aber nicht für seine anderen. Ein weiteres Problem ist die Uebersetzung. Jeder Exil- schriftsfeller weiss, dass Uebersetzer und Militärköche oftmals viel gemeinsam haben : Sie bringen es zuwege, auch die beste Menage zu verderben. Lassen Sie mich nun von der Sendung der Schriftsteller im Exil sprechen. Zu jener Zeit, da man in Süditalien noch Singvögel in Netzen fing, um damit die italienische Küche zu bereichern, entdeckten unternehmende Geschäftemacher, dass eine ge98 [pageend100]blendete Lerche ununterbrochen singen muss. Sie blendeten also die erste gefangene Lerche, banden sie an das Netz und verwendeten sie als Lockvogel für die vorbeiziehenden Vogelscharen. Ueber Nacht waren dann die Netze voll gefangener Vögel. Die Tragik der Schriftsteller ist, dass sie schreiben müssen. Nicht etwa, weil sie geblendet sind, sondern im Gegenteil, weil sie allzu gut sehen. Ebenso wie ein, bis heute noch ungelüftetes, Geheimnis der Nervenverbindungen die geblendete Lerche bis zur Erschöpfung zu singen zwingt, zwingt ein unabwendbarer Drang der menschlichen Seele manche zu schreiben, was sie fühlen, was sie denken — zu kritisieren und zu warnen. Die Exilschriftsteller gehören zu jenen Zugvögeln, die, aus dem Lande des wissenschaftlich-materialistischen Winters in die Lande der tropisch wuchernden,materialistischen Selbstzufriedenheit ziehend, vor Versuchen warnen, die eiskalten Herzen der Diktatoren mit glühenden Worten von Gott und gutem Willen erweichen zu wollen. Diese Zugvögel können nicht anders singen als ihnen der Schnabel gewachsen ist und wie ihnen ihr Gewissen befiehlt. Sie sind daher auch nicht immer willkommen, von irgendeiner Unterstützung nur selten zu reden. Im Gegenteil, oft hält man sie sogar für Unglücksboten, für Käuzchen, und behandelt sie dementsprechend. Diejenigen Menschen, die das geistige Elend, vor dem die Exilschriftsteller geflohen sind, aus eigener Anschauung nicht einmal kennen, sind meistens ihre rücksichtslosesten Widersacher. Gerade diese “Idealisten” aber, die sich in den meisten Fällen von den wohltönenden Phrasen der Kommunisten einfangen, liessen, haben oft dort einen beachtlichen Einfluss, wo die Exilschriftsteller die grösstmöglichste Unterstützung finden sollten. Zugegeben, diese Schriftstellei- singen meist traurige Lieder. Sie sind keine Vögel, die die Herrlichkeit der Natur preisen. Wenn sie singen, dann, wie könnte es anders sein, am liebsten von der Gefahr, die sich hinter der Nachgiebigkeit im kalten Krieg verbirgt, von dem Leben der Erniedrigten hinter dem Eisernen Vorhang. Und was ist das Resultat? Die Gesättigten in den freien Ländern, denen ihr Leben ohnehin “hart” genug vorkommt, geben ihren heimat99 [pageend101]liehen Sängern, die ihnen süsse Abendlieder singen, den Vorzug. Und so sieht man, dass viele dieser heimatlichen Barden nicht stört, was jeder Exilschriftsteller so gut kennt: Dass nämlich überall dort, wo der Materialismus an die Macht kam, er zuerst den süssen Sängern der Heimat die Schnäbel verstopfte. Die Literatur ist oft eine Stiefmutter. Das erklärt wieder, warum aus einem “Idealisten” so oft ein Feind wird; da es ihm nicht immer gut genug geht, beginnt er, die Gesellschaft aus der er stammt und das System, nach welchem ebendiese Gesellschaft lebt, zu hassen und ein neues, besseres, vermeintlich besseres System zu suchen. Und weil die Materialisten verkünden, sie hätten dieses bereits gefunden, schliesst er sich ihnen an, und aus Unzufriedenheit stimmt er in ihren Chorgesang mit ein. Er meint, er habe einen neuen Propheten gefunden, dessen Namen angeblich Millionen glücklicher Menschen preisen. Angeblich glücklicher. . . In Wirklichkeit jedoch geht es um einem Propheten, der enttäuschte, um eine Lehre, die sich nie bewährte, die den vermeintlich Glücklichen nur Unfreiheit und Elend in einem bisher nie gekannten Ausmass brachte. Die Exilschriftsteller können nicht anders als schreiben und warnen, auch wenn sie dabei nie an der richtigen Seite des Tisches, an der entschieden wird, was geschehen und was nicht geschehen soll, sitzen können. Die Schriftsteller im Exil gehören zu jener Gruppe von Menschen, denen es, im Gegensatz zu dem Wort Friedrichs des Grossen, vergönnt ist, in jedem Lande nach ihrer Facon unglücklich zu sein. Gott sei ihnen gnädig. Vladimir Stedry LE CARDINAL PRISONNIER par CHRISTINE AR- NOTHY. Editions Julliard, Paris, 1962. Le sort du cardinal Mindszenthy, condamné à vivre comme prisonnier dans une ambassade étrangère en pays communiste, devait inévitablement tenter l’imagination des roman100 [pageend102]ciers et des cinéastes. Christine Arnothy en a fait le sujet d’un roman dont la lecture captive et bouleverse. Elle a élargi le sujet avec une maîtrise exceptionnelle pour faire du cardinal prisonnier le symbole vivant du désarroi de notre époque où se joue l’avenir de la liberté humaine. L’action se passe à Budapest vingt ans après la suppression sanglante de la révolution hongroise. Toute l’Europe a été asservie par le communisme ; il ne reste du monde libre que la Grande Bretagne et l’Amérique. Un industriel américain vient d’être nommé ambassadeur à Budapest. Son beau- frère Harry Morton, atteint d’une maladie incurable, conçoit le projet fantastique de mourir à la place du cardinal pour le faire sortir de son asile. Il quitte donc son laboratoire de recherches scientifiques à Princeton pour venir s’installer à l’ambassade de Budapest. Le cardinal vit isolé dans son coin, entouré de la vigilance et des soins presque maternels de son fidèle serviteur Janos. La consigne est de respecter la solitude du prélat prisonnier et même d’ignorer son existence. Morton passe outre et réussit à avoir une série d’entrevues avec lui. Un passionnant duel verbal s’engage entre le prince de l’église et l’humaniste mécréant. Sentant que sa mort est proche, Morton veut se substituer au cardinal et assurer ainsi son transfert aux Etats Unis. Ses motifs sont multiples et complexes. Il veut réparer le tort que l’Amérique a fait à l’Europe en la laissant tomber sous le joug du communisme sans essayer de la défendre au prix d’une guerre. Il veut faire du cardinal le symbole d’une nouvelle croisade pour reconquérir la liberté du vieux continent. Il veut enfin ramené son fils à la foi catholique qui a été la sienne jusqu’au jour où il a du se marier pour la deuxième fois hors de l’église. Le cardinal refuse de quitter son pays natal, persuadé que son devoir est avant tout envers son peuple subjugué. Il se prend d’amitié pour l’Américain et veut sauver son âme. Mais Morton reste inébranlable dans son refus de faire pénitence et retourner à la religion de son enfance. Le dialogue est serré, les arguments volent comme des flèches, mais chacun reste sur ses positions et, pour finir, Morton meurt presque abattu par l’échec de son extraordinaire projet. Le cardinal lui tient la main pendant qu’il rend le dernier soupir. Le lendemain le fidèle Janos trouve son maître sans vie 101 [pageend103]au bord du lit de l’autre défunt. Le cardinal ayant mis le petite croix de sa mère, qu’il portait en sautoir, dans la main de Morton au moment de sa mort, ce dernier reçoit l’absolution et le droit à un enterrement religieux. Janos, feignant de ne pas comprendre l’anglais, avait suivi avec anxiété la lutte entre le cardinal et L’Américain ; il avait souffert des tourments de son maître et compatit au déchirement de son interlocuteur. Il se dit que la dépouille mortelle du cardinal serait mieux dans cimetière ouvert de Princeton que sous une dalle de la cathédrale de Budapest. Ainsi, pour ses raisons à lui, il réalise le rêve Morton en le faisant passer pour le cardinal. Autour de ce frémissant duel oratoire où les arguments de la religion et de l’atheisme scientifique sont présentés avec vigueur et une rare fraîcheur d’expression, Christine Arnothy a crée un tableau vivant de l’époque où nous vivons. Par des traits sobres et incisifs, elle évoque le contraste saisissant entre le monde communiste et ce qui reste de liberté. Le récit consiste surtout en dialogues aux reparties concises et mordantes comme dans une vraie pièce de théâtre. Les longues descriptions sont plutôt rares mais tracées de main de maître. La foule agenouillée sur la place Saint-Pierre recevant la bénédiction papale, décrite par Morton qui se laisse impressionner et plie aussi le genoux, ému jusqu’aux larmes malgré son incroyance ; la campagne hongroise en hiver sous la neige immaculée ; la musique tzigane qui retentit dans les salons de l’ambassade américaine à Budapest. Ici je ne peux m’empêcher de citer textuellement car le passage est si beau : “Ce fut la tempête. Une tempête fantastique, qui partit de ce deuxième salon pour se déchaîner comme un fleuve prêt à rompre tous les barrages. Un fleuve puissant, portant sur ses vagues des débris de souvenirs, un passé tumultueux, un présent nostalgique, un avenir obscur.” Il est réconfortant et salutaire de lire le “Cardinal Prisonnier” de Christine Arnothy à une époque où le roman est si injustement décrié comme genre littéraire. 1. Zavalani. 102 [pageend104]Anthologie de la poésie hongroise du XII Siècle à nos jours (Editions du Seuil, Paris) Une cinquantaine de poètes français, et parmi les meilleurs, ont participé avec des adaptations, à cette Anthologie de la Poésie Hongroise établie et annotée par Ladislas Gara. Cette anthologie vient d’obtenir le Prix Saint Michel de la traduction et de l’adaptation. Ce prix a voulu souligner, lit-on dans le communiqué ,,l’esprit de travail collectif et d’échanges qui a présidé à cette réalisation remarquable“. Nous avons demandé à l’un des meilleurs adaptateurs de ce recueil, le poète Paul Chaulot, Prix Apollinaire 1950, ce qu’il pense de ce travail et de cette littérature par laquelle la petite Hongrie se révèle une grande puissance de la poésie. Rien ne facilite mieux l’accès d’une poésie étrangère que les voies de l’adaptation. Le long et ardu cheminement que cette opération impose à qui la pratique, mène à une exploration du verbe poétique bien au delà des limites où aboutit une simple traduction. Les tentatives en vue d’assurer l’adéquation de deux formes lyriques, sans grandes communes mesures le plus souvent, fait, en quelque sorte, se réactualiser la genèse de l’œuvre. C’est ainsi que s’est dissipée la vue un peu superficielle que j’avais de la poésie hongroise, je l’avoue. Je n’en ignorais ni la richesse, ni la diversité. J’y distinguais l’existence de rapports harmonieux entre le peuple de ce pays et ses poètes, ou mieux encore une mise en commun des élans de chacun. Je n’en appréhendais pas l’autre rive, celle où brillent les feux qui signalent la voie de l’efficace approche. Au terme d’un certain nombre d’adaptations qui m’ont mis en contact avec à peu près toutes les tendances, toutes les formes d’expression que la poésie hongroise a pu connaître depuis ses origines, suis-je en droit de me dire maître de cette rive? D’où me voici, du moins, j’entends plus net le chant, autrefois seulement deviné. Il vient d’un long frisson populaire et l’on ne sait s’il en est la cause ou l’effet le plus pur. D’un siècle à l’autre, des voix le modulent bien différentes dans leur 103 [pageend105]structure, mais attentives à n’en point dénaturer la substance. Il est reflet d’une sensibilité collective orientée vers des aspirations que le course de l’histoire a suscitées et que la nature humaine a insérées dans ses propres mystères. De la complainte anonyme des troubadours médiévaux aux poèmes d’aujourd’hui le contact demeure et s’il se relâche parfois, aussitôt le ton baisse et la résonance perd de son ampleur et de sa portée. Cela est évident pour certaines époques, séduites par les formulations savantes de l’Occident ou qui ont confondu interrogation de l’homme aux prises avec son destin et quêtes métaphysiques. La poésie hongroise n’est pas de celles qu’un souffle étranger enrichit, qu’une spiritualité sans soubassement anoblit. Elle s’étiole à se retrancher derrière les jeux du langage, sa fausse patrie, qui trouve en elle le chaud refuge du dépassement par le cri. De patrie, elle n’en a qu’une : les vibrations de tout un peuple aux fluctuations de sa condition et quand bien même la personnalité du poète procéderait d’un farouche individualisme, l’empreinte de l’âme collective demeure. Les écoles ont pu passer, baroque, classicisme, romantisme, surréalisme, elles n’ont jamais atteint dans son essence le chant hongrois ni atténué en quoi que ce fût sa force incantatoire. Là est le miracle. Mais plutôt que de miracle, n’est-ce pas de phénomène naturel qu’il convient de parler? Partie intégrante de la vie du groupe, cette poésie ne saurait s’en séparer sans se détruire. Paul Chaulot 104 [pageend106]COMMENT REFUGEE WRITERS' CONGRESS An exiled writer is a frequent phenomenon in history. Names as ancient as Ovid and Dante come to our minds and in more recent times Gorki, Thomas Mann, Bunin and an endless number of writers who in the throes of the second world war were compelled to seek free countries because in their own lands they would have been bridled and it had really become a matter of life and death. Within the International PEN Club there are 250 such refugee writers functioning as a separate group with London as its centre and under the Chairmanship of the Latvian writer Peteris Aigars. Writers in exile from different parts of the world meet every second year to discuss their problems which are very different from those of the writers of free countries. The present Congress was held in Stockholm where the local PEN Club and the Writers’ Association took part in organising it. The Swedish writer Dr. Johannes Edfelt acted as its Honorary Chairman. The Congress opened at the Swedish Stock Exchange in the Hall of the Swedish Academy. There were members from 12 different countries. Visitors from distant countries were Dr. Hingorani from India as a representative of Indian PEN the famous Hungarian writer, Lajos Zilahy, now living in the United States and another author also now living in America, the Estonian poet, professor Aleksis Rannit. The Writers in Exile Group has Chinese members but they were not represented in the Congress. Among the other nationalities taking part in the Congress were Latvians, Czechoslovakians, Polish, Albanians, Rumanians, Germans, Estonians and one Russian, the historian Michael Prawdin who gave a very illuminating and excellent opening lecture. There was also the fiery Spanish writer Julian Gorkin. The majority were Hungarians and Estonians. Among the Estonians known in Finland was Gert Helbemae, who lives in London. From Sweden there were Marie Under, Varlev Uibpuu, Bernard Kangro, Kalju Lepik, Ivar Grunthal and Raimond Kolk who acted as an energetic organiser of the Conference. Invited 105 [pageend107]guests from Finland were Kauko Rare and the writer of this article. How does the Exiled Writers of Pen Group function? Its Centre is London and it has a publication called “Arena” in book form which represents many different nationalities. The Centre for writers in exile is not political but it goes without saying that in private discussions politics cannot be avoided. The Exiles have something like two home countries, the new official one to whose laws and regulations they are now loyal though their hearts belong to their original country. One of the greatest problems for exiles arises from seclusion and pessimism. Therefore co-opbration is most important. On professional grounds alone the exiled writers have many problems in common. Therefore getting to know each other at the conference was very useful and rewarding. The discussions and workings of the Conference were very intense and much more lively than usual at Pen Conferences in general. The main languages used were English, French and German. History and the writer. Does the author base his work on history and follow its truths; in other words, does his work produce history? The discussion was animated. Shakespeare was given as an outstanding example. His historical characters have been imprinted in people’s minds more vividly than the dry presumptions of historians. Shakespeare has given colourful and plausible pictures of his characters. So the writer can provide history with its outlines and create history. The writer should really be also the true voice of his time, its prophet and its conscience. And in this the writer in exile may have a more important task than usual. During the four days of the Conference there were many tours, opera performances and dinner parties. The Swedish PEN Club’s lunch at the Skansen was one of the highlights where in addition to the Conference representatives a group of Swedish members of parliament was also present. Many new friendships were started and it is certain that this Conference gave new ideas and new impulses to literary work but above all it helped to extend and clarify the viewpoints of all those who took part in it. Tuuli Reijonen-Dibopuu in Helsingin Sanomat, 106 [pageend108]WRITERS IN EXILE BOOK EXHIBITION “Habent sua fata libelli”—this Latin proverb is, in most cases, quoted in the following sense : “Books have their own (characteristic) history”. On Thursday afternoon *) a book exhibition was opened in London. Looking around at its exhibits, about 400 books in 24 different languages, I thought that the Latin dictum can be applied in a somewhat changed version : “the nations, to which the authors of the exhibited books belong, have their own (characteristic) history.” The book exhibition was organised by the International Pen Club Centre for Writers in Exile and was opened by the new International President of the PEN, Mr. Victor van Vries- land. The PEN is an international literary organisation of great reputation and is guided by the principle of the freedom of the pen. The exhibited books were written by authors from countries which are not allowed at present to respect the great idea of the freedom of literature. This is the main characteristic shared (to a varying degree) by all the nations whose writers’ books were exhibited here. Many of the writers of these oppressed nations found their way towards the West where they continue their literary activities. The London group of the International Pen Centre for Writers in Exile have now arranged an exhibition from works of those exiled writers who are members of this group. *) October 11, 1962. There were about 400 books exhibited, all published in the free world during the last four years. I saw books written by Ukrainian, Russian, Polish, Spanish, Portuguese, Catalonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Hungarian, Albanian, Bulgarian, Czechoslovakian, Estonian exiled authors. This fact clearly indicates that not only writers from countries under Communist domination but also from other countries, now under a totalitarian system, are participating in the life of the International Pen Club Centre for Writers in Exile. Two world-famous names indicate the really ‘catholic’ character of the exhibition. One is Madariaga, the Spanish man of letters, the other Arthur Koestler who is of Hungarian 107 [pageend109]origin and consequently some of his works gave added interest to the colourful Hungarian group of exhibits. The London Pen Centre of Exiles has 30 Hungarian writers. Many of them are represented at the exhibition. It was interesting to look at their exhibited works which gave an example of extreme variety. Sometimes modest poetry books, even first poems of an exiled poet, perhaps published by some little known firm. Then well-known books published by famous publishers, books which sometimes conquered the Western market and became great literary successes. There were many books published in Magyar. Many others translated into or written in English or German or in other Western languages. Amongst the books published in French I have to mention the famous, recently published Hungarian Poetical Anthology. Some books of Hungarian exiled authors have found their way even into Asiatic languages. It would be futile to attempt to give a list of the names, some very well known in the West and some new talents hardly ever heard yet anywhere. Poetry, novels, autobiography, scholarly works and even plays were to be found on the shelves of the Hungarian section of the exhibition. It is imperative to emphasise the emphatic general message of this section and of the whole exhibition. In the West, the exiled authors continue, undisturbed by any kind of censorship and unmolested by any kind of outside authority, their spiritual activities, finding a suitable public for their work amongst their nationals or in the wide circles of the Western public. This is an important message, and friends of intellectual freedom should be thankful to the PEN CLUB for all the help given in connection with this exhibition. B. G. Ivanyi (in the Hungarian service of the B.B.C.) 108 [pageend110]KUPKA, LE GEANT DE L’ART NON-FIGURATIF Voici six ans disparaissait Kupka, pionnier, au même titre que Kadinsky, Klee et Mondrian, de ce qu’il est convenu d’appeler l’Art Abstrait. Il mourut, âgé de 86 ans, dans sa maison de Puteaux, où il était venu s’installer en 1905 avec son épouse, une authentique citoyenne de Montmartre. En 1914, malgré ses 43 ans et une santé peu brillante, il s’engagea comme volontaire afin de combattre pour la Erance, sa patrie d’élection. Et ceux qui ont eu le privilège d’approcher ce grand solitaire, savent combien sa qualité de Français lui tenait à coeur. Cela dit, il importe de rappeler que Kupka n’oublia pas en ces mêmes années 1914-1918 qu’il était natif de Bohême, pays qui, avec la Slovaquie, aspirait alors à l’indépendance. Rien d’étonnant à ce que Kupka, évacué après un an de combats sur la Somme et réformé “pour épuisement total”, eût accepté d’assister les Tchèques Masaryk et Bénès et le Général slovaque Stefanik (naturalisé Français comme Kupka) dans leur lutte, depuis Paris, pour l’indépendance de la future Tchécoslovaquie. Pour l’Histoire de l’Art, François Kupka, peintre français d’origine tchèque, est un des plus illustres représentants de l’Ecole de Paris, et c’est sous cet angle qu’il nous intéresse avant tout autre considération. En effet, si Braque, Gleizes, Picasso, Matisse, Vlaminck, Derain marquent de leurs noms deux des plus importantes révolutions dans la peinture moderne figurative (Cubisme, Fauvisme), Kupka aura donné, au Salon d’Automne de 1912, le magistral départ à la redoutable et toujours vivace aventure de la “non-figuration”*). Il est évident que bien avant *) “Cet art est un “problème” qu’on voulait “enterrer” trop souvent, qu’on disait résolu définitivement (dans le sens négatif naturellement), et qui ne se laisse pas enterrer. Il est trop vivant. Il n’existe plus de problème ni de l’impressionnisme (les Fauves!) ni du cubisme. Tous ces “ismes” sont distribués dans des cases différentes de l’histoire de l’art. Les cases 109 [pageend111]cette manifestation publique de 1912, Kupka dans sa tour d’ivoire de Puteaux, préparait depuis plusieurs années sa révolution à lui, en toute ignorance, d’ailleurs, des recherches faites de leur côté à peu près à la même époque par les Kandinsky, les Mondrian, les Klee. En France, nous en sommes convaincu, il aura été non “parmi les premiers” mais bien le premier peintre non-figuratif. D’aucuns lui contestent cette primauté qui ignorent qu’un Robert Delaunay exposait encore, en mars de la même anné 1912, des toiles uniquement et totalement figuratives (Galerie Bar- bazanges, Exposition des peintres R. Delaunay — Marie Laurencin). Les deux grands chefs-d’œuvre historiques de Kupka intitulés Amorpha, Fugue à Deux Couleurs et Amorpha, Chromatique Chaude, exposés pour la première fois au Salon d’Automne de 1912, et qui ne sont pas les premières œuvres non-figuratives de Kupka, font partie de cette peinture nouvelle, parfaitement consciente et dont l’artiste ne s’écartera plus jamais. En effet les deux Amorpha constituent, on le sait, l’aboutissement d’une cinquantaine d’études, conservées aujourd’hui au Musée National d’Art Moderne de New York, études parties elles-mêmes de deux thèmes entièrement non-figuratifs. Il y eut d’abord, on l’imagine aisément, une période de “tâtonnements”. Kupka lui-même l’expliquera volontiers en 1913 au correspondant à Paris du New York Times, Warshaws- ky, qui écrira, après sa visite à l’atelier de Kupka : He is extremely modest about his new work ; merely expressing the hope that it will be received seriously and, by 110 sont numérotées et portent des étiquettes correspondant à leur contenu. Et ainsi, les débats sont finis. C’est le passé. Et les débats autour de l’art “concret” ne laissent pas encore prévoir leur fin. A la bonne heure! L’art “concret” est en plein développement, surtout dans les pays libres, et le nombre de jeunes artistes partisans de ce “mouvement” augmente dans ces pays. L’avenir!” (Extrait de l’Art Concret, un article de Kandinsky, XXe Siècle No 1, 1938, Paris.) [pageend112]virtue of his position, not relegated into the class of freaks. *) He does not even give freakish titles to his pictures. For instance, those to be exhibited next month are known by the following names: “A Burst of Light”, “Harmony in White and Line”, “Cold Chromatic”. A humorous effort of diagonals and verticals he calls: “Crisis of an Old Palette”. Kupka admits that he sometimes does not know what he is doing and therefore, prefers the technical titles to the brand which Cubists so fondly affix to their works. *) Il faut dire ici que Kupka avait, dès les années 1900, une grande renommée comme peintre figuratif et comme graveur et illustrateur de livres de bibliophiles. Kupka disait encore à son interlocuteur américain que si une ou deux générations de peintres procédait de la même façon l’Art ne pourait qu’y gagner : “Je tâtonne encore dans les ténèbres, disait il, mais je crois que je pourrai trouver quelque chose la peinture et la musique (something between sight and hearing). Je peux déjà créer une fugue en couleurs comme Bach l’a fait en musique. En aucune façon, je ne me contenterai plus de copie servile.” Les toiles telles que Les Touches du Piano (1909), Le Portrait de Madame Kupka (1909-1910), Plans par Couleurs, Grand Nu (1909-1910), Plans par Couleurs (1910-1911), Nocturne (1910-1911), Ordonnances sur Verticales (1911-1912), Plans Verticaux I (1912), Les Disques, études pour Amorpha, Fugue à Deux Couleurs (1911-1912) •— ces quatre dernières étant déjà entièrement non-figuratives — sont une fascinante revue de la genèse de cette nouvelle voie que Kupka ouvre à la peinture moderne. C’est encore le journaliste américain Warshawsky qui bénéficie des premières indications publiques données par Kupka en octobre 1913 : “I have come to believe that it is not really the object of Art to reproduce a subject photographically. There is an immediate objection that one cannot create forms and color them without some absurdity resulting, because what we know as organic must remain so. Therefore the artist must always follow nature. “To this I reply that Man created Doric Columns and 111 [pageend113]Ionie Columns and that Architecture bas continually created forms and their modifications which are well proportioned, and hâve every reason for existence. . . Man created the articulation of thoughts by words. He created writing, he created the aéroplane and the locomotive. Therefore, why may he not create in painting and sculpture independently of the forms and colors of the world about him?” “Créer” est le mot-clé chez Kupka. N’a-t-il pas, d’ailleurs, intitulé ainsi un essai sur l’Art tel qu’il le conçoit? Dans cet écrit, paru sous forme d’article dans La Vie des Lettres (Paris, 1921) il nous parle du peintre corne d’un poète-créateur : “ . . . Oui, l’art du peintre, c’est de revêtir de formes plastiques les événements qui se déroulent dans l’âme humaine — être poète-créateur, enrichir la vie d’aspects nouveaux. Et, précisément les efforts faits dans ce sens, évoluant trop souvent sur le terrain d’adoptions sans contrôle, ont placé l’art tout à l’opposé de la science. Ainsi restant indéterminé, il offre un champ assez vaste pour que les conceptions les plus diversement téméraires s’y donnent libre cours. Champ labouré jadis par les sculpteurs et les peintres de l’Hellade, qui en ont extrait une récolte toute de clarté et d’une luminosité inégalable, fruits de leur désir de savoir et de leur besoin de précision. “Puis pendant les trois derniers siècles les grands peintres ont apporté leurs conquêtes techniques et la science des couleurs ; legs nous obligeant à nous incliner devant eux avec la plus profonde gratitude. Quant à leur conception du ‘sujet’, elle ne mérite pas un examen sérieux, tant leur esprit était brumeux, désuni sans doute par leur éducation bilingue, imposée d’un côté par le latinisme chrétien et d’un autre par ce même latinisme, mais païen et tout le rayonnant monde grec s’imposant de lui-même. “Somme toute, la “grande peinture” présente des visions très chaotiques, des amas bien élémentaires d’images, d’impressions cueillies au hasard et auxquelles, par surcroît (pour convaincre le spectateur de l’existence matérielle des êtres et des choses ainsi imaginées) les peintres apportaient l’aspect de réalité puisé dans la nature. Oh! un fragment ici, là un autre, car on se doit de na pas bouleverser l’agencement 112 [pageend114]de sa vision; l’artiste, prêtre d’une deuxième réalité, est libre de transposer, recréer même les enchaîments organiques visés — tout comme à Charenton *). *) Charenton, commune de la banlieue Est de Paris, oû se trouve un asile pour aliénés. “Plus près de nous et plus sobres d’esprit, les réalistes découvrirent la poésie dans la nature même. Sortis de l’atelier pour d’inépuisables motifs à peindre — aussi respectueusement que possible ils ont fait preuve d’un héroïsme admirable en luttant contre les lenteurs du métier de peintre en face des variations de la nature vivante et où, tour à tour, chaque détail est conditionné par les détails correspondants. ‘Faut- il tricher? Pardonnez-nous, Nature, le peintre a d’ailleurs coutume de présenter non pas exactement le modèle, mais un échantillon de sa peinture!’ “La synthèse? ... Le retour aux clichés archaïques? . . . Ou la fameuse arabesque des arbres, des ruisseaux, voire même celle des lignes charmantes du corps humain? Nature! Nature — morte — en peinture!” Plus tard, dans la préface à sa magnifique série gravures sur bois, Quatre Histoires de Blanc et Noir (1926), il formule ses vues d’une façon claire et concise, non sans son brin d’ironie et d’humour qui caractérise tant l’homme que le peintre (n’oublions pas que, dans ses débuts parisiens et en marge de sa peinture, il dessinait pour des journaux humoristiques et qu’il illustra de nombreux ouvrages en prose et des recueils de poèmes) : “Visiblement, ces histoires ne se passent pas entre figures humaines, au milieu des arbres et sous des ciels tels qu’on a coutume de les voir peints ou gravés. Ce sont des figures d’une autre réalité, substituée à la traditionnelle copie des formes de la nature ou à leur interprétation, usage que je continue à ne pas pouvoir suivre. Si j’ai adhéré jadis à l’Art- Vérité des peintres-réalistes, admirant les aspects du mécanisme de la vie, je suis parvenu également à voir l’impossibilité de les rendre aussi fidèlement que je l’eusse voulu. D’autre part j’avais vu de bonne heure que l’art, mensonge pieux — ou impie — tel qu’il est encore pratiqué, n’est qu’une des formes survivant du métier des peintres, nos charmants an113 [pageend115]cêtres, les congénères des alchimistes, des astrologues et des sorciers-guérisseurs. Leur principe d’art se trouve coincé dans l’alternative de cette situation paradoxale : ou bien l’artiste trahit sa vision d’art pour ne pas trahir le modèle, ou bien il déforme le modèle pour serrer de plus près l’aspect de sa vision. . . Aussi et pour marquer le progrès, leurs successeurs modernes déclarent que la figure humaine et tout ce qui sert de modèle, une fois devenus matériaux d’une œuvre, n’ont plus rien de commun avec la nature. Alors pourquoi s’en servir, quand ces entités organiques deviennent de gré ou de force des ‘n’importe quoi’ physiologiquement inex- pliquables ? “L’Oeuvre d’Art en SOI, réalité abstraite, demande à être constitutée d’éléments inventés. Sa signification conrète découle de la combinaison même des types morphologiques et des situations architecturales particulières à son organisme propre.” Le peinture de Kupka, les arguments qu’il a développés pour permettre à l’observateur de le suivre dans ses réalités nouvelles, sont une source intarissable d’exaltations pour les privilégiés, un enseignement pour ceux qui aspirent à ce privilège. Car il est bien évident que devant les tableaux de Kupka ou bien on a la chance de pénétrer de plein pied dans son univers où l’ordonnance des formes sublime les sens et satisfont la raison, ou bien l’on fait modestement antichambre, en attendant qu’une éducation sensorielle vienne peu à peu préparer un terrain quelque peu inculte. Il est, bien sûr, difficile sinon impossible de faire intervenir dans cette sorte d’éducation des méthodes uniquement rationnelles. Autrement dit, il ne suffit pas d’être, par exemple, d’accord avec Kupka (ou avec Kandinsky ou les autres grands peintres qui ont abandonné le peinture figurative), lorsqu’il démontre avec une logique effrayante que la nature ne peut être reproduite fidèlement, que cette nature est, sur le tableau, une nature bien morte, une nature dont toute vie a été abstraite donc retirée, ôtée, et qu’il faille à un peintre d’aujourd’hui soit renoncer au métier de ses ancêtres, soit créer en peignant une réalité nouvelle, celle-ci bien vivante, bien concrète. Non, ce seul accord ne serait pas suffisant. Il y faut un autre accord, ressemblant plutôt au phénomène de 114 [pageend116]la résonnance, bien connu des accousticiens, des radioéléctri- ciens, des musiciens, ce phénomène qui, entre autres, est mis en évidence lorsque l’on fait vibrer le La du piano en frottant l’archet sur le La du violon. Il faut que le spectateur se mette pour ainsi dire à la fréquence, à la même longueur d’onde que l’artiste et son œuvre d’art. Comment faire pour y parvenir? Une seule méthode semble bonne -— à moins qu’on ne se mette soi-même à peindre. C’est celle qui consiste à visiter assidûment les expositions, à voir ou mieux : à regarder les œuvres, à les fréquenter des années durant dans les musées, dans les galeries, dans les livres d’art qui, de nos jours, disposent de reproductions irréprochables. En somme il s’agit de faire un peu pour la peinture non-figurative ce que Pascal recommandait à ceux qui aspiraient à devenir croyants — faire tout ce que font ceux qui croient, et alors, peut- être, la Foi vous touchera-t-elle de sa grâce. . . Cela n’est pas, loin de là, une comparaison gratuite. Le sens esthétique nécessite une culture constante, une fréquentation des belles choses, une comparaison incessante des œuvres. Pour voir, il faut d’abord apprendre à regarder. Ceux qui réfléchissent couramment aux problèmes de la peinture moderne, sont frappés par un curieux phénomène : le public condamne la peinture dite abstraite et “reconnaît” F “autre” parce que cette peinture-là répond sans difficulté à la trop simple question : “Qu’est-ce que cela représente?” Mais alors, on peut se demander si, le côté “histoire”, le côté “littérature”, le côté “anecdote” d’une œuvre satisfaisant de tels spectateurs, ces derniers ne sont pas, en vérité, frustrés de ce qui constitue le principal de la beauté de l’œuvre. Si nous nous sommes un peu éloignés du sujet, c’était pour dire que la peinture de Kupka, comme celle des autres peintres non-figuratifs n’est pas une peinture facile. Elle est même parfois austère, et déconcerte le profane. Mais, encore une fois, et quelle que soit la forme picturale, qu’il s’agisse d’une œuvre non-figurative ou figurative, on n’en pénètre pas la beauté plastique sans effort, véritable reconnaissance et récompense due à celui qui crée. L’œuvre de Kupka, d’une prodigieuse richesse d’invention, fut créée entièrement dans cet e,telier de Puteaux, qui occu115 [pageend117]pait tout le premier étage du pavillon du numéro sept de la petite rue silencieuse, Jules Lemaître. L’artiste se levait d’assez bonne heure, et, tous les matins, après sa douche qu’il prenait “pour être en forme” et après le petit déjeuner servi par sa femme, il montait à son atelier. Il travaillait pendant une demi-heure à son chevalet, puis, fatigué, descendait dans le jardin, y faisait un tour, puis remontait à l’atelier. Jamais il ne travaillait plus de trois heures par jour au chevalet. Son état de santé lui interdisait des efforts prolongés. Cependant son oeuvre picturale est très importante. N’oublions pas que cet homme dont la santé laissait souvent à désirer travailla jusqu’à sa mort à 87 ans! Cette oeuvre est aujourd’hui répartie entre plusieurs musées d’art moderne, notamment entre ceux de Prague, Paris, New York, sans compter les toiles appartenant à Madame Kupka et un certain nombre — restreint d’ailleurs —• d’autres toiles, gouaches, dessins, chez des collectionneurs privés, galeries ou particuliers. Il faut dire que Kupka, de son vivant n’a jamais rien vendu. Un autre aspect, également important, caractérise sa façon de travailler. Kupka reprenait souvent des toiles qu’il avait commencées des années auparavant et ne les signait que le jour même de leur ultime achèvement. C’est ainsi que s’explique le fait que bon nombre de toiles portent un, deux, ou même trois millésimes. Bien des gouaches ou aquarelles ne sont ni datées ni signées. Ce fut la cause, après la deuxième guerre mondiale où le nom de Kupka s’imposa à nouveau avec un éclat croissant, de nombreuses tentatives de contrefaçon. Enfin il convient de souligner que Kupka, à l’inverse de tant d’autres artistes de moindre importance, n’a jamais rien fait pour sa publicité personnelle. Bien au contraitre : renfermé dans son atelier, il ne recevait que de rares amis, ne soignait nullement les marchands de tableaux, ne parlait pas à la Radio, ne recevait pas la Presse. Sa renommée a connu plutôt malgré lui quelques sommets. En particulier à l’occasion du Salon de la Section d’Or, groupe animé par l’illustre Jacques Villon (qui habitait, soit dit en passant, un pavillon voisin de celui de Kupka). Ce fut en 1912, presque au même moment que le fameux 10e Salon d’Automne. Kupka fut l’un 116 [pageend118]des exposants à propos de qui, le lendemain du vernissage, Guillaume Appolinaire prononça pour la première fois le nom d’“Orphisme”. Cette désignation resta depuis lors acquise à la peinture de Kupka et de quelques autres. Mais le publie, pas plus d’ailleurs que MM. les Critiques alors en vue, ne comprirent les recherches de Kupka. Et même beaucoup plus tard, entre deux guerres, on vit, écrites à même les toiles exposées, des injures à l’adresse de l’artiste qui, fidèle à lui même n’essaya jamais de composer avec “le monde”, de plaire en s’abaissant au niveau du vulgaire. C’est en cela également que Kupka fait partie de la race des pionniers. Aussi, est-il, disons paradoxal que, lors de l’Exposition Universelle de Bruxelles, en 1960, son pays d’origine, dans lequel l’art tel que le concevait Kupka est aujourd’hui le malvenu, se fût donné tant de mal pour faire représenter son art moderne notamment par des oeuvres de Kupka, pourtant l’un des plus illustres de l’Ecole de Paris ! Mais, la politique a ses raisons que l’Art ne connaît pas ! L’art de Kupka n’a évidemment pas été fait pour servir d’autre cause que celle de l’Art et de la Beauté. Ses magnifiques Disques, ses Verticales, ses Hot-Jazz, ses Mécanismes, toute la gamme de ses trouvailles, mûries au long de ses promenades solitaires, soit dans le jardinet de Puteaux, soit sur les berges de la Loire près de Beaugency, sont du reste à la disposition de tout le monde, oui de tout le monde, y compris les masses populaires. Reste à savoir si tous ceux-là voudront bien venir, et désireront apprendre à voir . . . Kupka, personne n’en doute plus, est l’un des grands de la peinture moderne, le géant de la peinture non-figurative. Sa vie fut sans autre histoire que celle de son travail lent, lucide, obstiné. Sa gloire est celle de son oeuvre. Cependant, il serait injuste, dans ces lignes écrites à l’occasion du 6e anniversaire de sa mort, d’oublier Madame Eugénie Kupka, son épouse. Celle qui à consacré toute sa vie à l’homme et à l’artiste. Celle qui a sauvé une quantité importante d’études, de gouaches, d’aquarelles, de dessins, d’ébauches, voués à la destruction, tant il est vrai que Kupka détruisait souvent ses oeuvres. C’est à Madame Kupka notamment que le Musée d’Art Moderne de New York doit sa série d’études pour les 117 [pageend119]fameuses Amorpha. De son vivant Kupka l’a confirmé au conservateur de ce musée, lorsque celui-ci vint à Puteaux il y a quelques années pour en prendre possession : “C’est elle qu’il vous faut remercier, dit-il. Sans elle tout cela aurait passé au feu.” Alors, le représentant du plus grand musée d’art moderne du monde, embrassa Madame Kupka. O. Hajek (France) 118 [pageend120]LASZLO JAVOR Laszlo Javor, the Hungarian painter held an exhibition of his paintings in Geneva last autumn. Although a painter by vocation, he first acquired fame as a writer and composer with a song he wrote before the war, “Gloomy Sunday”. This song caught the nihilist, suicidal mood which swept the Continent between the two wars, was translated into innumerable languages and became a phenomenal success, acclaimed by such writers as Jean Cocteau. Javor since his early childhood felt a great sympathy and affinity with the people who remain obdurate nomads within the sedentary civilization of Europe. These were the clowns, the troops of circus people. He himself joined for a while the famous Cirque Medrano in France as violinist. He fought bravely in the war and was four times decorated. It was still in the war, in 1942 that he suddenly realised his great gift and longing to paint, and began to study at the l´Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris. In 1945 he was already exhibiting at the Salon National des Beaux Arts in Paris and both the French Government and the City of Paris have bought some of his pictures. Then followed exhibitions in Mexico, in London, in Scandinavia and again in Paris at the Galleries André Weil. His latest exhibition was held at Geneva. His favourite subjects are the clowns of the circus whom he regards as the only real people. In the eyes of Javor, the painter, it is the ordinary people who wear a mask and act ridiculously, while the clowns he portrays are real and natural. His colours are bold and vigorous and his pictures represent the work of a forceful and searching painter who has also retained the eye of the once melancholy poet. Although painting has now become Javor’s main artistic activity, he still continues to write poems and on the merit of his writings he is also a member of the PEN Centre for Writers in Exile, and their recent book exhibition in London included one of his wellknown paintings. M. K. 119 [pageend121]OUR CONTRIBUTORS Gio v a n n i GROTTO : poet, novelist, and painter. Original name : Giotto which (for obvious reasons) he could not use. On coming to Twickenham some thirty odd years ago from Mussolini’s Italy, he changed his name, in honour of Pope, to Grotto. He lives at Park Road where his three-storey house contains over thirty-thousand volumes of books and well-over two thousand paintings of his own (which he is ready to offer for sale to visitors). He claims that his oils are better than his poems and many agree. His publications include : Come, Dreams Are Endless, a novel published by Jonathan Cape; A Year, (a poem dedicated to Siegfried Robert), etc. Ro l l o Ho l d e r VAN RIEJNDIJK (R. HOLDER) : fortunate enough to have become acquainted with what are undoubtedly the beauties of the English country as a very young boy, he reacted to them not only with the open-eyed wonder of the child but also with the enchanted surprise of someone who met with the unexpected. He was young enough to learn English then so well that he might, indeed, be considered an English writer. He was one of the prize winners of an Observer short story competition. When not writing he listens and studies the music of Mahler, as well as the pianistic artistry of Peter Frankl (whom he considers the greatest key-board player of our time). Il a EGON : an artist by inclination rather than a writer. Born in Budapest she quickly established herself as one of the little known assistant animators in what was a little known industry at the time in Hungary : cartoon films. Due possibly to the precarious nature of this type of business, she took up writing mainly as a hobby, and although she has written a great many works (half-finished novels, complete children’s stories, etc.) she has, so far, failed to place them. She thinks that the causes of her failure are due to her ignorance of commercial standards which she holds sacrosanct. It is, indeed, human to venerate what we do not know. But that is by-the-bye. She has been a close friend of Agnes Nemes Nagy over the years; Miss Nemes Nagy is recognized as a poet of some standing in Hungary, and Miss Egon’s 120 [pageend122]study was written at our request. We hope that this type of study is only the first of a series to be published by ARENA, and we hope that Miss Egon will persevere in this type of work. J. C. ARRAY : mainly (we would emphasize : mainly) responsible for editing this number of Ar e n a , believes that no editor should include work of his own in a magazine the standards of which he is judging when he compiles what is to be a ‘number’ from an all-assorted jungle of manuscripts. No one can calmly judge his own work. Yet, in the process of personal discussions with some contributors, he became convinced that his motives have been misunderstood and to refute allegations of misconceived pride, in lieu of an autobiographical note, he has decided to submit what is, after all, the writer’s only autobiography : a piece of his own. In order to avoid being accused of ‘judging’, he confesses that the principle of selection was based on chronological order: it is the last piece of verse he wrote. RICHMOND PARK: SEPTEMBER I am speaking of the voices in the grass, The address delivered by the cricket to its mate Rasping through the yellowed autumn grass Across the trembling silver substance of the air. And since I breathe I also am a voice encroaching On the latticed hold of grasses on the sky. The structure of the living tissues is such air as Moves their voices through the silence of the leaves. At this time of dying grass the yellow silence. Wavers when unspoken words no longer hold its roots, When from the golden shadows of denuded blades The fiddled wooing of an insect blends with speech. From an instrument of faded green the notes Of flesh accompany the air which lingers on The apparition of a prayer once unheard. The evidence against me is the spoken word. 121 [pageend123]EXILE P.E.N. NEWS The London Centre of the Writers in Exile is holding its Annual General Meeting and dinner on February 15. A series of spring and early summer meetings will be devoted to ‘work in progress’—members of the Centre reading from their current novels, short stories or poems. The Centre hopes to be well-represented at the International Congress in Teheran; as we go to press, Ivan Jelinek, Ruth Speirs and Paul Tabori of the London Centre, Pavel Tigrid of the Paris Branch and Aleksis Rannit of the New York Branch have been listed as participants. Professor Rannit will be also the official delegate of the Estonian Centre. The Paris Branch has celebrated at a special meeting the sixtieth birthday of its Chairman, the distinguished Czech writer, Jan Cep. The New York Branch is planning its Annual General Meeting and a number of literary gatherings. It also hopes to organize a series of lectures by its members at various American Universities, probably beginning with Chapel Hill, North Carolina. We deeply regret to announce the death of our member, Dr. Thyra Csernyäk who died in Vienna, after a long and painful illness, on December 26, 1962. She was seventy- three. Her only daughter lives in Bratislava and she left three grandchildren. Dr. Thyra Csernyäk was a brilliant analytical chemist who combined her scientific career with a series of translations from German, French and English into Hungarian. She has lived in Vienna for the past six years and took an active part in the work of our Centre; she attended our meeting in Düsseldorf and wrote regularly about ‘Arena’ for various exile magazines. We offer our warmest sympathy to her family. 122 [pageend124]ARENA NEWS The yearly subscription of Ar en a is £1.— or $3.00. — We once again ask those who have been receiving our issues of 1961-1962 to let us have this sum by cheque or money order.
