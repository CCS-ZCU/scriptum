Also, to Peter Vrana, Otto Prossr, and Jan Kucera who have contributed. And, to all the kind souls who during 1988 have presented us with items of interest on varied subjects. To our fellow Sokol Units and CSA who share their publicaions with us and allow us to borrow from them. (We hope they do the same.) To our mailing committee consisting of Blanche Duffey, Jarmila Vrana, and "sometimes" help from Lillian Scott and Millie Forsythe — without them our publication would never get "on the way" ! All in All, your Vestnik Editor is proud of our 1988 accomplishments and extends to everyone - - A Very Joyous Holiday Season A Glorious New Year and Many, Many Thanks! Mary Frances Meier Editor [pageend1]SAN FRANCISCO VĚSTNÍK NOVEMBER - DECEMBER, 1988 Page 2 THE REAL MEANING OF CHRISTMAS by Jan Kucera For many people, Christmas is the season that calls for lots of celebrations. But what is celebrated and why is hard for many to know and remember. The stores, merchants, communities and families compete with one another in decorating homes, streets, lobbies and lanes with wreathes, trees, lights and all those shining baubles. Weeks before December 25, parties are held in offices and homes - celebrating Christmas, but do they know the meaning of Christmas? Not too many do. Most of them have forgotten that the real meaning of Christmas is the birthday of Christ and the day should be celebrated as such - that is, to put Christ back into Christmas. The majority of people, instead of identifying themselves with the humble origin of Christ are pushing Christmas in the direction of excessive spending and expensive parties. Christmas is for everybody - not just for the children. Adults, especially the elderly, need all the Christmas they can get - not just the presents under the tree, but the real meaning of Christmas - love and a helping hand. When people are in a crisis situation; when they lose their homes, when jobless and when everything looks bad, they tend to get down on their knees more often for a prayer. Christmas is the right time to bring a little comfort and hope for those whose stars have fallen. As we celebrate the birth of the Christ child, we should see it as the birth of a new opportunity to mend our errors of yesterday and to look for a new way to live in peace with each other and to have understanding love for our neighbors. As we sit down to Christmas dinner or as we unwrap our presents we should think about the gifts that could bring joy to this world: Food for the hungry, freedom for the oppressed and hope for the weak. This is a time when we see more clearly - not what divides us, but what unites us - to live in harmony and sympathy with others. May the true Spirit of the Christmas season - joy, beauty, hope and above all — faith live with us. Not for the short time of Christmas, but all year round! This is the real meaning of Christmas! [pageend2]bAN FRANCISCO VĚSTNÍK NOVEMBER - DECEMBER, 1988 Page 3 President’s Message Increased Sokol membership involvement was the theme of my "President’s Message" at the beginning of the year. I quoted Tyrs to emphasize the importance of this theme and clarify the goal of the incoming administration. The essence of this goal, extracted from Tyrs’s statements, was that increased Sokol partici pation at all levels would be critical to the perpetuation of the San Francisco Unit, and the physical and cultural development of its members. I am pleased to report that the objective of increased Sokol participation has been achieved thanks to the involvement of Sokol members (and nonmembers), their families, and friends. Their efforts last year were the reasons for the many positive changes which took place in the Unit. "Change for changes sake" was not how this year's Board of Directors approached their goal. The Board recognized that in order to promote Sokol involvement, the Sokol Board would have to develop a plan which would make Sokol a more attractive and enjoyable place to visit. The Board developed a three-tiered approach to attracting Sokol visitors by: 1) making significant capitol purchases, 2) actively supporting Unit participation in Sokol events, and 3) sponsoring special Units events. The success of this multi faceted approach is evidenced by the outstanding participation of Sokol members, their families, and friends during 1988. Improving Sokol facilities was the first component of the tiered plan. Some improvements such as the new Sokol sign on the outside of the Hall, new Sokol library, and phone answering machine are obvious. Some less apparant (but just as critical) purchases were the V.C.R. machine and monitor, band sound equipment, heavy duty kitchen mixer, and ping-pong table. These and other purchases made in 1988 represent the largest monetary investment made by the Unit in recent memory. The payback on these investments has been increased attendance during Sokol dances, Prostna and Furiant! practice sessions. Because of such exceptional attendance, the Board was able to implement the second part of its three-tiered plan. The Unit partially sponsored a record number of Prostna drillers, gymnastic competitors and the Furiant! Dance Ensemble at the VIII Montreal and Pacific Zupa Slets in 1988. The Unit made it possible for 10 participants to perform in the Montreal Slet and nine participants to perform in the Pacific Zupa Slet in Los Angeles. Because of the Unit's active role in supporting these Slet participants, the Hall was alive with more activity in 1988 then in recent years. Active participation was not limited to the Slets alone. Because of the contageous enthusiasm exhibited by those in Sokol, the Unit was able to sponsor specific events such as the Karel Kryl April Concert, or Professor Bonus'( Professor of Folk Dance and Music and Director of the Czechoslovak National Folk Dance Company) two week Czechoslovak Folk Dance Seminar. Both of these events took a great deal of the participants energy to make them such a success. Everyone who at tended the concert and seminar had nothing but praise for the two events. Continued on Page 4 [pageend3]- utberMrsKK, iya« Continued from Page 3 Probably the most significant act of sponsorship has been the Unit’s uninterrupted support of the Furiant! Czechoslovak Folk Ensemble for the past two years. Because of this support Furiant! has been able to perform in Montreal, Sacramento, Los Angeles, as well as in many Bay Area Exhibitions. By supporting this ensemble, Sokol San Francisco has supported a most "special event" -- the perpetuation of Czechoslovak culture in the Bay Area. As I reflect on 1988 and the San Francisco Unit, I can confidently state that the Board’s objective of increasing member participation in Sokol activities has been achieved. The attitude changes of the members last year made partici pation at all levels in Sokol activities extremely enjoyable. Our actions during the past year helped perpetuate Tyrs' dream of continued Sokol existence in the years to come. I acknowledge and thank the Executive Board, their families and friends, and those who just came by to watch, for making 1988 such a special year. r. i NES-SPORT NAM POMAHA Bernhard Zoder Fitnes-sport nám pomáhá a odstraňuje denní napětí, stres. Jednou jsem čeh. že běh "jogging" byl právě proto vynalezen, abychom při pomalém běhu přišli na jiné myšlenky. Mám dojem, že všichni ti, kteří provozují jakýkoliv sport, provádějí tuto činnost proto, že mají radost z pohybu a že každý sám zjistil, že po dobu tělesné činnosti každý myslí na něco jiného, jen ne na dobu, kterou stráví v práci. A proto i ta tendence různých moderních prvků, na příklad gymnastika pro matky s dětmi, gymnastika pro ženy v domácnosti, aerobic nebo i stretching a různé kursy jazz-gymnastiky a fitnes-treningu. Nejdůležitější je opravdu jen radost z pohybu a to jen potud, dokud se vše dělá, aniž by se tělo nadměrně unavilo. Pokud by někdo jakoukoliv tuto činnost prováděl, jak bych řekl z "nerealistického nadměrného vypnutí", nebo aby rychle třebas ztratil nadměrnou váhu, sám sobě si škodí, ztratí zaručeně dobrou náladu a neodstraní denní stres. Chtěl bych ale podtrhnout jeden z velmi důležitých faktorů: Pravidelnost. Ten, kdo se rozhodne něco začít, třeba i u nás v Sokole, musí dbát na pravidelnost. Ten, kdo mezi nás přijde jen jednou za uherský rok, tomu opravdu žádné cvičení nepomůže. Je dokonce jasné, že i ten, kdo jen jednou něco zkusí, je ve větším nebezpečí, že si něco natrhne, palec vyvrkne či při hře i nohu podvrkne. I ten pohyb musí být s tělem koordinovaný. A to je ten druhý faktor: Rytmus. Bylo nesčíslněkrát zjištěno, že hudba podporuje rytmus v těle. Jen se podívejme na tu krásu pohybu těla při vystoupení vrcholných sportovců - krasobruslařú nebo gymnastek. A nechodme daleko, při našich rozcvičkách přece sami používáme hudbu a jak nám to jde! A zkuste to samé bez hudby. Jak je to fádní, jen tak počítat, nebo jen předcvičovat bez hudby, možná, že by to ani lidi k nám netáhlo. A třetí faktor podle mého, je určitě počasí. Pochopitelně, každý bude na počasí reagovat jinak. Ale určitě při hezkém počasí, když sluníčko pálí, tak mírně, tak akorát, hned je nám dobře, oproti počasí deštivém či chladném. Chtěl bych ještě jedno dodat. Jestliže bychom přesto něco ve sportu chtěli dokázat (a to je možné i na příklad v kategorii seniorů - myslím na sebe), je jisté, že výsledek se neobjeví ihned, ale až za určitou dobu pravidelného sportování. A nezapomínejme při tom všem na náš vlastní postoj. My si musíme věřit a chtít. Ne na začátku být skeptický k vlastním výsledkům. A zaručeně v každé jednotě se najde někdo, kdo rozumí trochu víc psychologii sportu a poradí. Ale nic se nesmí přehánět, protože potom je nebezpečí zranění a nechuti něco podnikat, to znamená, sportovat. Zajímalo by mne, zda moje rady mají u sportování úspěch, napište mCváš "^or, či vaši zkušenost. Adresa je v redakci.

Author Unknot [pageend4]SAN FRANCISCO VĚSTNÍK NOVEMBER - DECEMBER, 1988 Page 5 Nacel nice’5 Report Since our Nacelnice, Sylvia Prossr, was unable to complete the year due to obligations in the Air Force, I am submitting this report of activities in Gymnastics. As most of you know, Sokol Canada had a national Slet this year, and we were proud to have two men and five women participate in the mass calisthenics. From all reports the Slet was a huge success and San Francisco participants were warmly received. The purchase of a VCR and TV with the help of the ASO Educational Fund made learning the drills much easier. Videos are a wonderful educational and learning device. Sokol Los Angeles had their Annual Vereny and we also participated in this week-end of activity. Three adults took part in the calisthenics and the warm-up exercises that were composed by Bro. Liska of Los Angeles. We also had three children participate in the competition exercises and San Francisco should be proud of the fact that they did so well in the competit ion. They all placed in the top four of their divisions. They worked hard getting ready for their participation, and thanks to our newest Sokol member Humberto Avelar the children were able to practice at the San Mateo High School Gymnasium where they got the experience of vaulting, using the high bar and the hi-low bars. This is the first time in fourteen years that Sokol S.F. had any competitors in a Sokol event any where. We had two attend the course at Ennis, Texas. Sokol San Francisco sent Kate Prossr, and Marla Meier attended also. In August Sokol Fresno hosted a Zupa Improvement Clinic and Mary Frances Meier and Marla Meier attended that event. This clinic was outstanding as Fresno has the use of a wonderful well, equipped gym, and the children had a wonderful learning week-end. They had exhausting practice in all gymnastics as well as lessons in history, Sokol Ideals and games not to forget the good food served by Sokol Fresno. This Fall we actually had a Board of Instructors' meeting, and we scheduled classes for the tots and adults. We do not have an instructor for the children’s class so they are not gyming at the present time. They are very eager to commence classes and are very interested in participating in the Slet in Omaha next year. If anyone knows of an experienced instructor or if you, yourself, is an instructor we would certainly like to hear from you. We have the beginnings of a tots class - ages 4 to 6. They meet every Friday evening and Kate Prossr is their instructor. Continued Page 6 [pageend5]SAN FRANCISCO VĚSTNÍK NOVEMBER - DECEMBER, 1988 Page 6 Continued from Page 5 We have several adults interested in learning the calisthenic drills for the Slet in Omaha next June. We will start classes in January on Friday evenings as we now have the videos and printed drills and there is something for everyone! This Fall Sokol approved the purchase of Indian Clubs, jump ropes, and wands for use in the gym classes. That concludes the report on gymnastic classes during the year 1988, and we hope to grow in our gymnastic endeavors in 1989..

EDITORIAL Since the last issue of the Vestnik was published, I have received some disturbing phone calls from people distressed about information printed in the publication. When articles pertaining to procedures within our Sokol Unit are published in the Vestnik, it SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD that decisions are made at our Sokol Unit monthly meetings. They are not made by the Editor of your Vestnik. The members of our Sokol Unit make decisions pertaining to Unit business democrat i ca 1ly. The issues are proposed, discussed and voted upon. As a Sokol member it is your choice to make. Attend our monthly meetings and participate in the democratic system, or stay at home, BUT if you choose to stay home be prepared to accept the decisions made by Sokol members who attend the meetings.

Referent pro české a slovensJfié^aálBŽÍtoflti t [pageend7]SAN FRANCISCO VESTNIK NOVEMBER - DECEMBER, 1988 Page 8 Ho, Ho, Ho 'Tis The Season To Be... by Paul Larson I wanted to write something about Christmas for this issue of W.I.N., so I researched some of the facts on the origin of the holiday. Christmas is a collection of traditions from over a half-dozen cultures, collections that have been in the works for centuries. The Christmas cards, Santa Claus, mistletoe, and all of the Christmas carols that originated with different ethnic groups have become an integral part of the yuletide season. But looking back into the history of Christmas, no one is certain just when Jesus Christ was bom. Christmas was first celebrated on December 25 somewhere early in the fourth century a .d .—337, as close as can be determined. December 25 was chosen to rival another religion that was threatening the existence of Christianity. Before that time, birthdays were totally unimportant—only the days on which people died were celebrated. Since Jesus was a divinity, his birth was deliberately played down. In fact, it was sinful to celebrate Christ's birthday, as though he were an emperor or a king or a pharaoh. By reading the Bible, theologians have tried to pinpoint when Jesus was born. Various dates have been assigned—January 1, January 6, March 25 (very close to April Fool's Day), and May 2(1 Actually, May 20 probably comes closest, because in Luke the shepherds who received the word of Jesus's birth were tending to their flocks of sheep at night. In those days, shepherds only guarded their flocks at night when the sheep were lambing, which was in spring. In winter, all animals were kept in corrals and not closely guarded nor even watched at night. There was a major rival religion in Rome that celebrated the sun god, Mithras. Mithras really originated in Persia, though the god was adopted by Romans in the first century B.c. By the beginning of the fourth century a .d ., the belief in the sun god was so prevalent among the Romans that Emperor Aurelius proclaimed it the official reli- Thomas Nast developed the modern image of Santa Claus with his drawings for Harper’s Weekly in the 1880s. gion. This religion seriously jeopardized Christianity, and, of course, it was hotly debated. It was well known that the Romans liked their festivals, especially ones that lasted for a week or even two weeks. They often called for feasts and parades. One celebration was in honor of Saturn, the god of agriculture, and it was called Saturnalia. The Christians needed something to happen in December to combat the popularity of these occasions. So in 337 the Roman church officially recognized Christ's birth, and December 25 was picked as the date. The difference between the mass celebrated on December 25 (which is where we get the name of Christmas—"Christ's Mass") and Mith- raism was that Christmas would be a sacred and holy day, quite unlike the pagan festivals celebrating Mithras and Saturn. The Roman Emperor, Constantine, was the first baptized emperor, and he decreed that Christianity would become the official state religion. In a .d . 354, Liberius, the bishop of Rome, rescinded the law of celebrating only Christ's death and legalized celebrations of both his death and birth. Christmas on December 25 began at that time. The Christmas tree didn't appear until the early 700s. There is a story that it began in Germany, [pageend8]SAN FRANCISCO VĚSTNÍK NOVEMBER - DECEMBER, 1988 Page 9 where a British monk named Boniface was preaching a sermon to the druids who worshiped oak trees. During his sermon Boniface cut down one of the mighty oaks, which wreaked havoc on all of the other trees and bushes around it—destroying every tree and shrub in its path, except, just by accident, for one small fir tree. It was interpreted that the fir, having survived the crushing blow of the mighty oak, became the miracle tree. Christmas in Germany was thus celebrated by the planting of fir trees. It was still another 700 years before the tree was recorded as being decorated. The decorations were colored paper, fruit, and sugar candies. Lighted candles were later added to the tree, and this was attributed to Martin Luther. The tree didn't come to England until sometime in the nineteenth century, when it was introduced by Prince Albert, Queen Victoria's consort. Albert was quite used to the festivity and the decorating of Christmas trees, and when he married the Queen he convinced her to continue the German tradition. X is the first letter of the Greek word for Christ— Xristos. By the sixteenth century "Xmas" was popular in Europe. It was merely a Greek term for Christ's Mass, but people who were not familiar with Greek misunderstood the "X" as a sign of disrespect, and for hundreds of years, Christians disapproved of "Xmas." Even today, some Christians disapprove. "Santa Claus" was originally St. Nicholas, a saint born early in the fourth century, in the ancient southeastern Turkish town of Lycia. He was a favorite of children, and he would give gifts to them. St. Nicholas was persecuted, along with the rest of the Christians, and under the orders of the Roman jurist Gaius, he was imprisoned. But when Constantine was baptized and adopted Christianity as the official religion of Rome, he freed St. Nicholas. St. Nicholas's gifts to children were known from Roman accounts of his favoritism of youth, and that led to his becoming the patron saint of children. St. Nicholas was referred to by many names, but none of them was Santa Claus. The Dutch spelled St. Nicholas as Sint Nikolaas. When the Dutch came to America, the word became Sinter Klaas. Eventually, it was anglicized to that name which we're all so familiar with today: Santa Claus. The reindeer came from the poem The Night Before Christmas. Before that, Santa Claus made his rounds without sleigh and reindeer. The poem was written by Dr. Clement Moore in 1822, who read it to his children on Christmas Eve. A friend of the family mailed a copy of it to a newspaper, and it was picked up by other newspapers and magazines, and it became part of the legend of Santa Claus. The original St. Nicholas was reported to be a very tall, slender, elegant bishop, and he was portrayed as such for centuries. The fatter, shorter, jolly Santa Claus that we know today was originated by the nineteenthcentury cartoonist, Thomas Nast, an artist who made drawings for Harper’s Weekly magazine. Nast's car- oons told the history of Santa and how he spent the rest of the year. It was also through Nast that the children's lists of bad deeds were kept, and he also received the requests from children for the gifts that they wanted. They were all incorporated into the drawings for Harper’s. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer didn't appear until 1939, when Montgomery Ward department store wanted something for their Santa Clauses to distribute to parents and children. It is said that Rudolph was first called Rollo or Reginald, but the president of Montgomery Ward didn't like those names, so he chose Rudolph. Approximately two and a half million copies of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer booklets were handed out to children as they saw Santa Claus in stores across the country. A songwriter named Johnny Marks put the poem to music, and in 1949 Gene Autry made the first recording, and the rest is history. Gene Autry's recording hit the top of the Hit Parade, and more than 300 different recordings have been made since, and more than 90 million records sold. The original Gene Autry version is second only to Bing Crosby's "White Christmas," which, by the way, is the top-selling record in recording history. The first printed Christmas cards originated in England in about 1845. A Boston lithographer, Louis Prang, was the father of the American Christmas card. His cards were very expensive, and his first ones were floral arrangements of geraniums and apple blossoms and roses. They didn't sell very well to the Americans. Instead, postcards were imported from Germany to send out as greeting cards. After World War I, the American greeting card industry grew, and it has continued to up to today. In fact, Christmas cards are the top-selling card in the printing industry. The stockings that are hung by the chimney with care in hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there originally were the wooden shoes of the Dutch, and were filled with straw to help feed St. Nicholas's donkey (this is before he had reindeer). Their shoes were filled with fruits, hard candies, nuts, and clay figures. Of course, I don't suppose Christmas would be final without saying something about mistletoe and the tradition of kissing underneath the mistletoe. The tradition originated in ancient Britain with the druids, about 200 years before Christ's birth. To the druids, mistletoe celebrated the start of winter, and they would burn it as a sacrifice to their gods. They also hung mistletoe in their homes for good luck. Guests who came to the homes hung with mistletoe would embrace, and it was said that if enemies met under a tree that bore mistletoe, they would lay down their arms and forget their differences for a day. There was a ban on mistletoe throughout the Middle Ages and, surprisingly enough, as late as the present century churches in England forbade mistletoe and corsages made with mistletoe during any Christmas services. So there you have it, the story of how Christmas came about as we have it today. May this be the most joyous holiday season that you and yours have ever spent together. idA [pageend9]SOKUL SAN FRANCISCO VĚSTNÍK NOVEMBER - DECEMBER, 1988 Page 10 ANNUAL REPORT VESTNIK Submitted by Mary Frances Meier At the beginning of the year each committee and officer was asked to set some goals for the year '1988. The -following is a report o-f progress made on the goals set for the Vestnik. All Sokol Units in the United States were notified that we would like to trade Vestniks. Two copies of ours for two of the i rs. We are now trading Vestniks with several units and have found they have some interesting articles that we can pass on to our readers, and in reading the Vestniks they have sent to us, we find that they have also borrowed articles and pictures from us. In addition, some of our articles and letters have appeared in the National ASO Vestnik.We have tried to include something for everyone. We understand that some people desire more Czech and we are making an effort to do so. We would also appreciate articles about Sokol and our Czech heritage in the Czech language . We have increased our subscriptions and advertising. We recently received subscriptions from out of state so our Vestnik copies to other Units must be getting read and enjoyed. Using the telephone book to locate Czechoslovak names and addresses, we periodically send complimentary copies of the Vestnik including a letter explaining something about Sokol and our own Sokol Unit. We offer them an opportunuity to subscribe or to notify us, if they would like to receive our invitations to Sokol activities. So far this has not proved very successful, but we will continue the procedure hoping for better results in the future. The average number of Vestniks we send out every two months is 220. This varies depending on the complimentaries we mail. We also have out of the country subscribers so we are covering the Universe, so to speak. We have also become computerized and all addresses for the Vestnik and invitations are on the computer. We are also beginning to use the word processor for articles appearing in the Vestnik. We have also slightly altered our compiling of the Vestnik; We now have them stapled and mailed in booklet form. It makes them look more professional. Don’t you agree? Another one of the things we wanted to do was include more information on our invitations. Toward this end, we have included items of interest about Sokol, an invitation to join Sokol, announcement of coming events, etc. From all indications - mainly an increase in subscriptions and ads - I think we have come a long way toward meeting our goals, and with help from everyone we can continue to improve our San Francisco Vestnik in 1989. [pageend10]SAN FRANCISCO VĚSTNÍK NOVEMBER - DECEMBER, 1988 Page 11 POVÉST O BRATISLAVĚ Ing. Jozef Vlček V roku 1920 bol som šestročný a býval som v Trnavě, keď som prvý raz počul měno Bratislava, častejšie však Prešpork (Pressburg) a Požoň (Pozsony). Netušil som vtedy, že ani v roku 1988 nebudem vedieť ako vzniklo historicky a oficiálně pomenovanie Bratislava. Dlhé roky som sledoval v literatúre a pohovorech dajaké pramene nového miestopisného názvu Bratislava, ale zůstala mi len povést. Nebudem opakovat historiu z doby Rímanov (Posonium, Poson, Pozsony), Germanov (Brezenburg, Pressburg) ani starých Slovanov (Braslav, Preslav, Bre- slawespruch). Pre úplnost a zaujímavosť třeba uviesť, že dla čs. vojenského archivu z roku 1919^ okrem názvu Prešpork užívalo sa aj pomenovanie Wilso- novo Město. , Na počiatku roku 1919 vznikol a definitivně sa však ujal názov Bratislava (dla méjho názoru) takto: V období po 1. januári 1919 přišli do Prešporku malé útvary čs. armády pod vedením plk. Riccardo Barecca. Súčastne prichádzali aj prvé moravské a české sokolské jednotky a slovenski dobrovoťníci, legionáři a politici. Ne- chcem uvádzať mená činitelov, třeba však vzpomenúť aspoň niektorých účast- níkov a sokolských dobrovolníkov: poručík Holan, Václav Hanošin, Karol Bednář, Jaroslav Jelínek. Bolo v Prešporku radostné a vzrušujúce převratové "revolučně" obdobie a to sa patřilo verejne aj súkromne oslavovat. Ako pri každej slávnosti v pl- nom prúde fungovali pivovary a hlavně prešporské viechy, ktoré mali právo výměru vína vlastnej úrody. Pod týmiti viechami (věchýtek, Heuriger) spieva- lo sa moravsky, slovenský, česky, nemecky, madarsky a nikedy ani v budúc- nost i ~ nepřišlo tu k neprístojnostiam. V dobrej spoločnej náladě sa vyvolávalo "bratři - sláva, bratia - sláva!!" a po úprimnom objímaní všetci spokojné od- chádzali domov. Třeba poznamenat historickú skutočnosť, že spev pod viechy priniesli Moravaniu, Cesi a Slováci, lebo za stáročnej uhorskej vlády sa pod viechami nespievalo. Jedného rána v januári-februári 1919 vo vojenských a sokolských rozkazech aj úradných písomnostiach objavilo sa miesto názvu Prešpork a Wilsono- vo Město nové pomenovanie BRATISLAVA (brati+slava). Toto krásné a výstižné měno, ktoré vzniklo z lásky a bratstva, sa tak rýchlo a živelne ujalo, ze historici a etnografovia nestačili zaznamenat jeho vznik, ale napriek tomu málo zaistenú historickú budúcnosť ako hlavně město Slovenska. Generál J. Snejdárek, ktorý umožnil přístup do vojenského archivu, v roku 1935 povedal- Názov Bratislava vytvořil statočný Slovák a dobrý Čechoslovák, ale bude už patřit na večnú pamať medzi neznámých čs. bojovníkov." Bratislava sa potom dóstojne zařadila aj do historie sokolstva na Slovensku, lebo to bola "Župa Masarykova". Sokoli boli vždy pyšní, keď s týmto označením na kroji vystupovali. Pre úplnost a pamať třeba ešte uviesť (i keď mnohým bratislavčanom to dnes už nieje známe), že Bratislava za prvej CSR bola skutočne ídeove československá, lebo na exponovanom mieste pri Dunaji v medzinárodnom prostředí tomu ani ináč nemohlo byť. V Bratislavě nebolo nikedy veřejných národnostných rozporov a žilo sa tam dobře v duchu federa- tívnej znášanlivosti. Až raz v budúcnosti historici a etymológovia objasnia vznik názvu Bratislava, rád zabudnem na moju "povést o Bratislavě". [pageend11]WUVMIBEK - DECEMBER, 1988 Page 12 Somehow, not only for Christmas But all the long year through, The joy that you give to others Is the joy that comes back to you; And the more you spend in blessing The poor and lonely and sad, The more of your heart’s possessing Returns to make you glad. John Greenleaf Whittier MEMORIES - MEMORIES - MEMORIES While visiting Fresno, we had an opportunity to visit with Sokol San Francisco member Jeannette Chambers in her new surroundings. Jeannette borrowed a home movie video which contained some "flicks" of Sokol activities during the 1939 Treasure Island World’s Fair. It was wonderful seeing so many Sokols in action; the "hoop drill" mass calisthenics; a field full of dancers in costume doing the "old" Beseda. On the platform delivering speeches we recognized some faces no longer with us - Br. Storek and Be. Kohoutek for instance. By studying the film closely and carefully we even managed to identify some familiar faces among the dancers and drillers on the field. It is hard to imagine that 1989 will mark the 50th Anniversary of that memorable time. Memories are nice to have and nice to share with our dear friends and relatives. Mary Frances Meier 1939 Participant Addem: Is it little wonder that some of us are seeking a drill with a little less kneeling? HOLIDAY FAMILY TRIVIA GAMES Christmas is a family affair — exactly what this game is all about. After that big Christmas dinner, suggest that your family play Family Pursuit, which is like the popular board game except that each member of the family makes up the trivia questions. Questions like these can be fun for that after-dinner boredom: • What was grandma’s maiden name? • Junior’s bike was what make and color? • Where did the family go camping after Sis was bom? • How many lumps of sugar does Uncle Joe put in his cup of tea? • Where was Mom’s favorite picnic spot before she married Dad? This is a good way to record the family’s history, too. And in 10 or 20 years, the grandchildren will have interesting reading material. Try it this holiday season.

I have greeted you with the traditional Sokol salutation. This greeting was adopted very quickly after the founding of the first Sokol Unit in Prague, and became the by-word with all Sokols throughout the world. It is a simple phrase - yet one of great meaning. The founders of Sokol realized that a uniform greeting was needed to place every member in the organization on the same level. During this period class distinction divided the people into definite groups. There were the working people, the large farmer and property owner, craftsmen, professionals, and nobility. Each group considered itself apart from the other. In the Sokol organization every member was considered equal regardless of his status outside of the organization. Therefore all members would be addressed as brothers and saluted with "Nazdar!". Nazdar to every member must have a specific meaning. When we meet a person on the street and greet him with a "Hi" or a "Hello" or a "Good day" this may be only a gesture of good manners, not necessarily of friendliness. E<ut when greeted with "Nazdar" and the response is also a "Nazdar" then immediately a feeling of comradeship, equality and mutual interest is implied. It puts them on a basis for better understanding of a mutual interest- Let us have a better understandi ng of our brothers and sisters. For a good beginning, be the first to say "Nazdar" when you meet. It will work a little magic for you. May "Nazdar" forever ring in these halls. Nazdar! L.B.
