CZECHOSLOVAK NEWSLETTER PUBLISHED BY THE COUNCIL OF FREE CZECHOSLOVAKIA 420 East 71 Street, New York, N.Y. 10021 ELEVEN YEARS AGO, ON AUGUST 21, 1968, TROOPS OF FIVE WARSAW PACT COUNTRIES INVADED CZECHOSLOVAKIA TO STIFLE ITS DEMOCRATIZATION EFFORTS. IN VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND EVERY FACET OF HUMAN RIGHTS, SOVIET TROOPS ARE STILL OCCUPYING CZECHOSLOVAKIA TO THIS DAY. Vol. IV, No. 7/8 (34/35) July-August 1979 CONTENTS Charter 77*s Theses on Consumption ... p. 1 The Official Media on Shortcomings ... p. 8 Resolution of the European Parliament . . p. 10 THESES ON CONSUMPTION Preparations are in progress in Prague for a show trial of ten members of the Charter 77 human-rights movement and the Committee for Defense of the Unjustly Persecuted who were arrested on May 29 (Czechoslovak Newsletter, June 1979, p. 2). They have been charged, according to ČTK news agency, with ’’subversion of the state,” in particular with ’’fabricating and disseminating false information on domestic conditions with intent to undermine the foundations of the socialist order and to foment distrust of the regime.” If sentenced, they face prison terms up to ten years. (The Council of Free Czechoslovakia has appealed to Western political leaders and humanrights organizations to protest against these latest violations of human rights in Czechoslovakia [Ibid, p. 53•) One of the documents that particularly aroused the communist powerholders was published by Charter 77 on May 27, just two days before the arrests. Entitled ’’Theses on Consumption,” it is a critical analysis of shortages in the consumer field. It is based on official sources like The Statistical Yearbook of the Czecho-1- [pageend1]Slovak Socialist Republic and on facts generally known in the country. In Czechoslovakia, however, as in other communist-dominated countries, publication by unofficial bodies or individuals of. facts about economic shortcomings and other unfavorable developments, even when based on official documents, is considered subversive and punishable at law. In its original declaration of purpose in January 1977, Charter 77 laid great stress on the fact that it is not an organized movement and that its intention is to lead "a constructive dialog with the political and state authorities” within the limits set by the constitution and laws of the land as well as with regard to international agreements signed and ratified by Czechoslovakia, such as the Helsinki Final Act. The arrest of the ten now charged was obviously therefore a political act. To prove this, we have cited (see p. 9) a number of quotations from the official Czechoslovak media that are just as critical of the situation in Czechoslovakia as the ’’Theses.” On May 27, 1979, over the signatures of Dr. Václav Benda, Jiří Dienstbier and Zdena Tomínová (Dr. Jaroslav Sabata, the other Charter 77 spokesperson, is in jail), Charter 77 published its ’’Theses on Consumption," which is ”a collective work by authors subscribing to widely differing beliefs and opinions.” The following is an abridged text. Theses on Consumption In making consumer proposals, we are well aware that we are dealing with a subject that vitally concerns the majority of our population. Problems of consumption, particularly those of consumer goods and services, have be^n the most vital concern in Czechoslovakia for many years. They are commented on in the press, talked about on radio and television, and have become the most frequent topic of everyday conversation. They are a favorite subject of literary works, motion pictures, and television series. In the first part of this document, we proceed, on the assumption of the right of every citizen to secure the basic necessities of life, to describe the present situation, and problems and difficulties encountered daily by consumers. In the second part, we attempt to show the deeper causes and interrelationships of the present state of affairs, and to suggest possible ways toward at least a partial solution. However, we realize that problems óf consumption cannot be considered independently of a number of other societal factors. The very type of political-economic system in which we live leads to crises, and any improvement in the sphere of consumption is possible only through fundamental changes in economic and political structures. Until recently our country could have been considered the "shop window” of socialism. Today such an assessment would possibly be valid only in comparison with the standard of living of some other East European countries or in relation to the poorest countries and peoples of the world. We can no longer stand comparison with most of Europe, especially if we take into consideration the enormous possibilities offered by the relatively highly developed Czechoslovak economy immediately after [pageend2]-3- World War II. Part I Satisfaction of consumer needs is one of the most important requirements of human existence. The most fundamental right, the right to life, is an empty formula if it is not backed by well-considered efforts by society at large to secure the satisfaction of human needs and remove all anxiety about them. The principle of the defense of these interests is embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Art. 25) and in the International Pact on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (Arts. 7, 11 and 15)• A peculiar feature of Czechoslovakia as a special brand of consumer society is the conflict between the orientation of a large part of the population toward intensive consumption and the inadequacy of the national economy to ensure such a level, of consumption. Czechoslovak consumers constantly confront shortages of certain goods, limited choice, and very often goods of poor quality. They encounter all sorts of difficulties in consumer services and are bedeviled by conditions of consumption that are beneath the dignity of civilized human beings. The chronic tension between demand and supply, constant shortages and the narrow choice of quality goods lead, to a situation in our country where 'one does not go shopping, but rather hunting, for goods. The consumer can never be sure that a shop will not be closed on some.flimsy excuse (inventory, arrival of new supplies, vacation, illness, renovations, lectures, etc.) or that the desired goods are in stock. Realizing the need to buy the first available, more or less suitable articles, since there is no assurance that they will be available elsewhere or at a later date, many consumers even buy goods that are of inferior quality, unreasonably priced, or not needed at all. Shopping expeditions consequently take more and more time. Individual citizens are compelled to spend an inordinately long time on their shopping hunts. As a result, procuring consumer goods and attending to the daily needs of the family have become the main occupation in life of the citizens of Czechoslovakia, particularly the women. The supplier has become the master of both the customer and the retail trade. The outcome of this is that customers have to curry favor with salespeople, often with bribes, to obtain desired goods or those in short supply. In the cultural sphere, the critical consumer situation is further complicated by the absence of freedom of expression, artistic creation and scientific research. Like the trade sector, services are plagued by insufficient capacity, lack of diversity, shortages of spare parts, attitudes of indifference, lack of flexibility, and shoddy workmanship. The customer, in turn, has no possibility of choice. In the wider sense, services should include mass transport, about which also there are mo^e and more consumer complaints. [pageend3]-4- Ineffective management, shoddy goods and general difficulties in the consumer sector have brought into being the so-called second economic circuit, which makes life bearable for many people and at the same time is moving us toward a new style of society that trades in kind. It is a society in which wanglers can obtain practically anything through contacts, bribes or mutual favors. A component of the second economic circuit is the barter practiced, among others, by store clerks, who operate on the principle: ’’You scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours.” Many of these favors are rendered not out of an individual’s own resources but at the expense of society at large, by pilfering factory stocks, for instance. Consumers as well as workers in trades and services live by complex legal double standards, for two sets of laws govern society. On the one hand, there are the over-the-counter norms set by laws and other legal regulations, and on the other, there are the prevailing legal and moral customs and usages that are often at variance with official laws and regulations. A system of corruption has become an integral part of normal relations between enterprises. And unfortunately, these malpractices also pervade the health and medical services, education and public administration. Indications of the crisis in the Czechoslovak economy became very obvious last winter and seriously affected consumers. Repeated interruptions of the electricity supply, breakdowns in the provision of heat for whole residential areas, coal shortages for small consumers, and serious disruptions in the transport and delivery of goods demonstrated not only incompetence in coping with normal problems in difficult weather conditions but also deep rifts in the country’s political and economic superstructure, especially a total lack of able management. There is one sector of the population, however, for which the average consumer's daily worries do not exist at all or only very rarely. These are those privileged individuals who shop at special stores stocked with a wide variety of high-quality goods, who enjoy special delivery services and credit facilities, and who do not need to do their shopping in person. Their very high incomes relieve the privileged of all worries and difficulties, so that they often learn that there are shortages only from newspapers and rumor. As the economic and social crisis deepens in Czechoslovakia, certain fundamental achievements in the so-called tertiary sphere and areas of social consumption are being progressively cut back. The general standard of health care and education is going down. Reasonable requests for complete medical checkups, operations, effective drugs, good general health care, and good education for their children have become problems for tpo many people, causing deep anxieties and involving them in frequently heavy expenses. Many valuable services that have become taken for granted are being reduced or even done away with — meals in factory canteens, for instance. A society that nationalized all the sources of national wealth should be able to develop the social-consumption sector (health, education, public transport, etc.) without having to restrict consumption based on personal income and eventually reduce it to a uniform level for all. Housing construction and maintenance, long considered a part of the social[pageend4]consumption sector, is becoming more and more the burden of individuals and families, either in the form of cooperative self-help or compulsory construction by individuals. The problem of housing is reaching colossal proportions in Czechoslovakia, particularly in the cities. The production capacity of the construction sector is quite inadequate to deal with it. Existing housing difficulties spawn moral dilemmas. Many young people postpone having children. Many couples split up because of inadequate living quarters or disputes with the parents or relatives with whom they are forced to live. Securing an apartment, new or old, often involves bribes and favoritism. Another aspect of the sphere of social consumption is the pervasive inadequacy of health care and welfare services for the elderly and the erosion of old-age and disability pensions by continuing inflation. The environment, too, is being neglected. Standards of public hygiene, general conditions in many workplaces, the sanitation and esthetic appearance of our towns and villages are all completely unacceptable. It is obvious that more funds and professional attention need to be devoted to these matters than is presently the case. Instead of seeing improvement and enlargement of the social-consumption sector year by year, we find stagnation or even deterioration in the way public needs are being met in health care, education, welfare and social services, sports and physical education, culture and adult education. Yet disproportionately large funds have been allocated to other sectors favored by the central authorities, such as modernizing and strengthening the police apparatus, building up the armed forces, and putting up excessively expensive buildings for the central authorities. Part II The problems of inadequately meeting consumers’ needs are inseparably linked with, the way Czechoslovakia’s economy and society have been developing. They mirror deeper political, social, economic, moral and cultural difficulties. The bureaucratic-cum- centralistic and nondemocratic economic system reflects the difference that exists between the social nature of labor and the dominance of the power center. The present economy makes no allowance for healthy competition among enterprises and production units, nor does it promote the real interests of individuals, differing social groups, or society as a whole. The centralized economic system engenders unhealthy relations between trade and manufacture, produces chronic imbalances in the consumer market, and through its financial and monetary policies stimulates a relatively vigorous demand without a corresponding supply. The consumer-goods market is allowed to develop with practically no reference ťo consumers or any thorough market research. Undemocratic decision-making processes and the completely unsatisfactory state of a national economy beset by growing disorganization, incredible waste and wretched management have "made people indifferent to their work, to society, and even to their own futures. Alienated work is a concomitant of alienated interests, which include compensatory overconsumption in a market of tight supply. The poorly functioning distribution system dominates the daily quest for bread; the trend toward overconsumption leads people on an irrational hunt for ever better and more fashionable goods, for ever new symbols of affluence, in a senseless and draining merry-go-round. The [pageend5]-6- *5 present political regime encourages people to absorb themselves in their private lives (an orientation toward consumption) in order to suppress their real interests, particularly creativity, criticism, and public affairs. Notwithstanding all claims to the contrary, a petit bourgeois mentality has become an ever present reality. The problems in th^ consumer sector and in our entire national economy have aggravated the unfavorable development of Czechoslovak foreign trade. According to the official statistical yearbooks, the overall deficit in foreign trade amounted to 12,531 million crowns over the period 1970-1977, including a deficit of 654 million crowns in trade with the socialist countries. The most serious deficit was in our trade with the advanced capitalist countries, which came to 18,350 million crowns over the same period. The overall position was offset to some degree by a surplus of 6,473 million crowns in trade with the less developed countries. This generally dismal picture is in fact worse than it appears, because the figures given in the statistical yearbooks are based on ’’foreign currency crowns,” which presently fluctuate between 3*5 and four crowns in terms of domestic prices. Our economic and consumer situation is further aggravated by the energy crisis and the rising prices of raw materials. The impact of these factors is made the more serious by the unfavorable structure of our foreign trade, especially the need to export metallurgical products, heavy machinery, and goods requiring intensive use of energy and raw materials. Another negative element is the reduction of imports of consumer goods and an increase in the export of them. In the past Czechoslovakia earned foreign exchange by exporting high-quality machinery, but its present inferior quality (including a shortage of spare parts and poor servicing) has necessitated an increase in the export of quality consumer goods at the expense of the domestic market. The persistent scarcity of foreign exchange has made it impossible to import for the domestic market goods that our industry either does not produce or produces in insufficient volume and quality. The government faces a difficult, situation. It is well aware of its seriousness but afraid of more fundamental changes. Hence desperate appeals for harder work are accompanied by sudden, poorly prepared decisions that in their form violate all proclaimed socialist principles—decisions regulating wages, raising prices, changing workhours, etc. The undemocratic nature of these decisions is made possible only by the population’s utter indifference, an indifference that can be attributed only to fear. This indifference, frequently accompanied by slovenly workmanship, is also a result of a sense of futility in trying to do a good job in an environment of unprofessional management, questionable cadre policy and undemocratic decision-making. Material incentives usually reinforce only formal loyalty,. and do not lead to higher productivity but mostly to hasty, inferior and inefficient work. The oppressive situation of consumers is thus deeply rooted in the very foundations of the existing socioeconomic system. It would be a mistake, however, to shelve the whole problem as insoluble a priori. Even now many problems can be solved step by step. It is up to us all. Whenever the situation permits, we should take a high- principled attitude toward our shortcomings, rejecting corruption, insisting on work of high quality and social utility, and condemning sloppiness and irregularities in our own sphere of activity and influence. A similar high-principled stand should also be taken with regard to the field of [pageend6]-7- consumption. A consumer organization that would take part in making decisions on prices, distribution, sales, service and even production of consumer goods could make a great contribution to defending consumers' interests. The public needs its own independent organization to protect consumers' interests and air their views. It could be financed by contributions from retail sales, industrial enterprises, labor unions and so forth. It should also publish a magazine that would report on goods and services, and publish the results of quality tests, consumers1’ opinions, price lists, statistical data on wages and prices, the cost of the consumer basket, international consumer information and comparisons of prices, market research studies, and the behavior of both sales personnel and customers. People should also have an opportunity to speak out on the scope, structure and quality of social consumption. They should be able to take part in decisions on how much should be spent for such purposes as health care, education, schools, cultural and social services, and the environment. The consumer sector, like so many other areas of our life, is characterized by the paucity of information available to citizens. The whole gamut of consumer problems should be constantly and systematically monitored and publicized in statistical abtracts, critical public addresses, the press, radio and television, not simply as a propaganda exercise, but to make detailed and reliable information available to our citizens, organizations and institutions. Problems should be debated by the Federal Assembly and both National Councils. Labor unions ought to have an important ro]e in this area. They have a duty to monitor systematically the fluctuations in the cost of living, and wage and salary levels, and to make public their views on changes in the living standards of such social groups as the retired and families with children. Trade union organizations should make known their position on price increases, wage reforms, changes in working conditions and other issues of vital importance. The Revolutionary Trade Union Movement (ROH) of Czechoslovakia probably does not have at its disposal agencies or institutions qualified to analyze the living standards of various groups of workers, inequitable wage increases, or deficiencies in meeting needs. It certainly does not have the facilities for an independent assessment of current difficulties, for publicizing them widely, or for proposing suitable solutions. Our people should take advantage even now of all means available to criticize deficiencies in the consumer area — the media, public meetings, trade unions, and meetings with their representatives in parliament and elsewhere. Current policies and practices in the consumer field make it obvious that those in charge are unable to establish, through their understanding of actual needs, a set of priorities that would properly satisfy the consumer requirements of individuals and society as a whole. Their inability to suggest such priorities is surely due to their reluctance to allow the independent and creative development of a society that would meet our ecological, economic and sociocultural possibilities and needs, and to free our society from detrimental alignments and cramping dependency. If our society is to solve the problems of persistent shortages of goods and services, it cannot function without a supplemental network of small enterprises, particularly repair shops, workshops, fruit and vegetable gardens, smallholdings, [pageend7]-8- retail shops, and small hotels and restaurants, operated by individuals or families for their own profit and free from punitive taxation. For such a network to develop, it would be necessary to establish important legal and economic preconditions to define its place and function, in order to eliminate the possibility of merely reinforcing the negative aspects of the existing second economic circuit. The deficiencies and difficulties faced by Czechoslovak consumers attest to the lack of a clear-cut, overall concept of life style. Life style should be neither exclusively consumer-oriented nor uniform. Society should offer all its members a choice of life style and be open to experimentation, whether it is nonconformist, individualistic and creative, group-oriented, traditionally family-centered, or rural. Society’s basic interest in the development of individuals and social groups, and in the satisfaction of their reasonable needs, should be reflected in its tolerance and dynamism and in its encouragement of a variety of life styles. Since according to the Statistical Yearbook for 1977 the average wage of ’’industrial workers” was approximately 2,500 crowns a month, and hence 13*90 crowns an hour, it is easy to calculate real wages for comparative purposes. To buy one kilogram of top-quality butter (40 crowns), a Czechoslovak worker requires 2 hours 53 minutes of work. In comparison, a West German worker in 197*+ could afford it after only 2+8 minutes’ work. An international comparison of the number of hours of work needed to buy certain household appliances (based mostly on 1977 figures) yields the following: CSSR West Germany Nether- East Germany Austria lands France Refrigerator (no freezer) 2*+1 38 86 55 88 27*+ Refrigerator (with freezer) *+19 *+7 77 70 151 Gas range 15*+ 35 63 91 60 87 Washing machine 477 *+3 68 57 137 583 Electric iron 12 2 3 2 3 7 Vacuum cleaner (500 W) 62 18 15 — 20 36 Transistor radio 100 7 12 8 18 91 Automobile 4335-6307 — 772-1275 — l*+3*+ 3250 THE OFFICIAL MEDIA ON SHORTCOMINGS The ten under arrest are to be tried on charges of subversion for publishing data that are available in the official press and radio and television commentaries, [pageend8]-9- as the following selection shows. ’’Complaints about mistakes and shortcomings in management, violations of socialist legality, individual wrongdoings, and disorganization in various areas are an important means for citizens to manage and control our life.” Pravda, March 1.3, 1979 ”A foreign customer claimed indemnity for half the cost of merchandise he had received [from Czechoslovakia!. Five of our technicians had to work a whole year at the customer’s place to put the defect right.” Nové slovo, March 2.3, 1979 ”Do we have to go to Gyor [in Hungary, 50 miles from Bratislava! for our shopping? With high hopes I went to the newly opened House of Fashion . . . but a look in the window disappointed me at once. It is sad that people from Bratislava must go to Gyor to shop for fashionable things. How is the Hungarian garment industry able to bring in new fashions so quickly? Wouldn’t it be a good idea to ask our neighbors for advice?” Letter to the Editor, Nová mysl, May 24, 1979 ’’Inspectors in Slovakia checked 200 stores and nine organizations responsible for supervising restaurants, hotels and other businesses in the first three months of this year. They concentrated on problems affecting consumers and the protection of socialist property. . . . The results were not good. Of 384 items bought, 140 were overpriced. The situation was worse than in 1977* Laboratory tests of some beverages also yielded unsatisfactory results. Of 31 samples of alcoholic drinks, 18 did not come up to standard. . . . Juices and coffee were inferior in quality. More than 43 percent of the coffee served did not contain the prescribed amount of coffee. This too was worse than in 1977*” Letter to the Editor, Práca, May 25, 1979 ’’All party, state, economic and public organizations should do a better job of evaluating their personnel. The interests of society require that people should do the work for which they are best suited, prove their abilities, and achieve the best results. . . . Some comrades, however, think that they are assured of their jobs without regard to their competence. . . . Czechoslovakia cannot tolerate officials who do not have the necessary skills for their job and who are getting rich at [pageend9]-10- society’s expense.” Rudé právo, August 11, 1979 ”It was a 'startling fact’ that 326 production enterprises, one- third of all factories, had not reached their planned targets for the first six months of this year.” Radio Prague, July 18, 1979 ’’Compared with the same period of 1978, only 80 percent of the apartments planned have been completed [in the first six months of this year.], the worst performance of recent years." Rudé právo, July 30, 1979 "Czechoslovak tourists planning trips abroad are not allowed to take with them extra dishcloths, socks, shoes, bedding or various foodstuffs. Meat, butteredible fats, rice, sugar, coffee, cocoa, and children’s clothes are also scheduled. Special authorization is required for certain articles, such as tents, sleeping bags, skis, leather gloves, cut glass, and chandeliers.” Radio Prague, August 1, 1979 RESOLUTION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ON THE ARREST OF DISSIDENTS IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA The following resolution was adopted by the European Parliament in Strasbourg on July 20, 1979* "The European Parliament, — Deeply disturbed by the arrest in Prague on May 29 of ten members of a Czech human-rights group, all of them signatories of Charter 77, — Having noted that these people have been charged with spreading antiState propaganda, a crime carrying a maximum penalty of ten years' imprisonment, and that their trial is imminent, 1. Makes clear its conviction that these arrests and proposed trials constitute a clear violation of those provisions of the Helsinki Final Act that guarantee freedom of expression; 2. Calls on the Czechoslovak Government, which is a signatory to the Helsinki Final Act, to release the ten detainees in accordance with its international obligations; 3« Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Foreign Ministers of the nine Member States meeting in political cooperation."
