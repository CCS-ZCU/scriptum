The members of the Executive Board asked me to write this “open letter.” I would like to point out to all persons involved and interested in SVU activities that the Executive Board would appreciate any suggestions - in English, Czech or Slovak - sent to the Executive Board members or the Editors of SVU Bulletin and SVU Zprávy, on subjects such as: the membership drive, future meetings, establishment of new SVU chapters or specialized sections, long range planning, fund drives, names (nominations) for consideration of honorary and founding members, potential candidates to serve on the Council and Executive Board of the SVU, and so forth. I wish to urge the Council and the whole SVU membership to obtain and read the By-Laws of the SVU that outline the mission of the Society and the opportunities to serve the Society in a variety of capacities. The By-Laws may be requested from our Secretary Milos K. Kucera, 245 East 63rd St., New York, N.Y. 10021. They also have been reprinted in SVU Biographical Directories, but the most recent amendments are of importance to us all. Karel B.

They chose the topic “Anthropologic Dimensions of the Central- European Cultural Area” as their primary research project. The members of the section plan to present, at the next SVU Congress, the first papers concerning social- structures, language use, historical development of kinships, and aspects of the early political processes in Central Europe. The founding members pf the Anthropology Section invite cooperation of other scholars - linguists, archeologists, theologians, philosophers, experts on literature and arts, and so on - to jointly collect all- encompassing informatipn about Central-European civilization and thus contribute to the contemporary research of complex societies. Write about concrete proposals and inspiring ideas to: Dr. Peter Skalnik, Department of Social Anthropology University of Cape Town, Rondebosch 7700, South Africa or Professor Leopold Pospisil 554 Orange St., New Haven, CT 06511, USA ★ ★ ★ CULTURAL COMPETITIONS - SVU CLEVELAND The Board of Directors of the SVU chapter in Cleveland has taken the initiative of announcing a plan of competitions whose purpose is to save Czech and Slovak languages and culture in northern Ohio. The special action to be taken will focus on general cultural and scientific programs and on competitions in linguistic expression in Czech or Slovak, as well as in novel presentations of Czechoslovak cultural heritage to the new exile generations. To guarantee high quality and professionalism of the future presentations, donors are sought. A basic sum of $1,000.00 and additional sums of $300.00, $200.00 and $100.00 for three awarded prizes are needed to pay participants’ expenses, rent of appropriate halls, and whatever else is required (for example, for a concert or a theatrical performance). Names of patrons, sponsors, major donors and contributors will be used for particular programs/competitions, and will be publicized. All contributions are tax-deductible. A program to commemorate the centennial of the National Theater in Prague was prepared and presented by SVU member Frantisek Svejkovsky from the University of Chicago, in December 1983, to initiate the SVU Cleveland Cultural Competitions campaign.

Bednar was born on November 3, 1930 in New York, a son of Karol Bednar (b. 1898 in Hodonin), leading worker of the Slovak Sokol in America and editor of its press. He studied political science at Rutgers University, earning his B.A. in 1951 and M.A. in 1952. He finished his studies with a Ph.D. degree at Columbia University in 1960. He shortly taught political science and philosophy at Lynchburg College, Virginia, and since 1962 has been a member and Chairman of the Department of Political Science at Muhlenberg College, Allentown, Pennsylvania. During the decade 1970-1980 he also was the Associate Dean of the same College. Dr. Bednar is a member of several Greek letters honor societies and of many professional societies. For his teaching merits he was awarded in 1965 a special prize by the Lindback Foundation. He also was nominated for the Outstanding Educators of America Award. In addition to his scientific and educational work, Dr. Bednar has been on the board of directors of the YMCA in Allentown. ★ ★ ★ KAREL HRUBY EDITOR OF PROMĚNY (METAMORPHOSES) Karel Hruby was born in Plzen (Pilsen) on December 9, 1923. He graduated from a Teachers College in his native town and then continued his studies at Charles University in Prague, earning a Ph.D. in sociology in 1950. He taught in Stribro and Plzen between 1950 and 1955, when he was arrested for “treason” and sentenced to ten years imprisonment. He was released after five years and had to work at first as a factory worker. He now lives in Basel, Switzerland, and works as a sociologist for the CIBA- Geigy International company. Karel Hruby’s special interest has been Masaryk, since his doctoral dissertation that explored “Masaryk’s Philosophical Realism in the Literary Criticism.” He organized the SVU Conference on Masaryk in 1980, at Interlaken, Switzerland. The papers from that conference were published by the Society as T. G. Masaryk in Perspective. Comments and Criticism, edited by Milic Čapek and Karel Hruby (see Bulletin III, 1, January 1982; available from SVU Books). Dr. Hruby was elected President of the SVU Swiss Chapter in 1982 and was in charge of the 1983 Regional Conference in Bern which we reviewed in the last issue. ★ ★ ★ RENE WELLEK, SVU PAST PRESIDENT - 80 Rene Wellek, Sterling Professor Emeritus of Comparative Literature at Yale University, was born on August 22, 1903 in Vienna, Austria. His father was of Czech origin and moved his family to Czechoslovakia after 1918. Rene Wellek earned his doctorate in English Literature’in 1926 at Charles University in Prague. During the twenties he did research on Carlyle and Kant in England and for a while taught in the United States. Between 1931-1935 he lectured on English Literature in Prague and then 5 [pageend5]was appointed to the London School of Slavonic Studies, lecturing there on Czech literature. When Czechoslovakia was occupied by the Nazis, he was able to cross the Atlantic with the help of his American friends and colleagues. He taught in Iowa and later in the war he trained translators for the American Army. Since 1946 until his retirement in 1972 he was active at Yale. His well known bookv Theory of Literature, written in collaboration with Austin Warren, appeared in 1949 and has been translated into many languages. His History of Modern Literary Criticism gained him international renown as one of the most outstanding contemporary scholars in the field of comparative literature, He received several honorary doctorates from American and European universities, has held memberships and leading positions in many learned societies, has kept publishing books and countless articles, and has lectured as a visiting professor in this country and abroad. His interest in SVU started at the time the Society was founded. He was the second SVU President, from 1962 to 1966, and accepted honorary membership in 1972. ★ ★ ★ FRANCIS SCHWARZENBERG SVU PAST PRESIDENT - 70 Francis (Frantisek) Schwarzenberg, Professor Emeritus of Loyola University of Chicago, was born in Prague on March 24, 1913. He studied law and political science at Charles University in Prague and at Ecole Libre des Sciences Politique in Paris, receiving his doctoral degree in 1938 in Prague. He was one of the leaders of those aristocrats in Czechoslovakia who declared themselves in 1939 as identifying “under all circumstances” with the Czech nation. A confiscation of some of his family properties by the Nazis followed. In May 1945 he took part in the Prague uprising and in the negotiations of the German capitulation in the city. He was appointed charge d’affairs of the Czechoslovak legation at Vatican in 1946. He resigned after February 1948 and came with his family to the United States. Until 1979 he taught political science at Loyola University in Chicago. Dr. Schwarzenberg has been a prominent member of many Czechoslovak emigre organizations, especially of the Czechoslovak National Council in America. He was one of the initiators and very productive members of the SVU, becoming the President of the Society for the period of 1972-1974. After his retirement he moved to Vienna where he continues active in promoting free Czechoslovak culture. ★ ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★it What’s Your Thing? Here is the continuation of “our things” for your interest. We plan to enlarge this section in terms of both categories and information.

We hope they will find response and support from the whole Society. SDSO November 21, 1983 NEWS RELEASE DEPARTMENT OF MUSIC COLLEGE OF PROFESSIONAL STUDIES AND FINE ARTS SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY SAN DIEGO CA 92182 (619) 265-6031 The Smetana Centennial: An International Conference and Festival of Czechoslovak Music The Smetana Centennial: An International Conference and Festival of Czechoslovak Music will be held at San Diego State University on March 29 to April 8, 1984. The international conference has received the support of the National Endowment for the Humanities, the L. J. Skaggs and Mary C. Skaggs Foundation, the Paul C. Stauffer Memorial Fund and the Friends of Czechoslovak Music, in addition, the leading international musicians and scholars - Gerald Abraham, past president of the Royal Music Association; General Jan J. Ambras, Ret., Czechoslovak Air Force, WW II; David Atherton, music director of the San Diego Symphony and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestras; Rudolf Firkusny, concert pianist, residing in New York; Karel Husa, resident composer, Cornell University; Rafael Kubelik, conductor and recently retired music director, Bavarian Radio Orchestra; Sir Charles Mackerras, music director, Sydney Symphony Orchestra; Jarmila Novotna, soprano, Metropolitan Opera; Jan Popper, conductor and professor emeritus, University of California, Los Angeles; and Francis Schwarzenberg, professor emeritus, Loyola University - have endorsed the Smetana Centennial project. The conference/festival also has the support of the Pacific Southwest Chapter of the American Musicological Society; the House of Czechoslovakia, Balboa Park, San Diego; the Los Angeles Chapter of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences; and the San Diego Branch of the Czechoslovak National Council of America. The purpose of the conference will be to bring together the community of scholars engaged in the study of the Czech composer, Bedrich Smetana (1824-1884), and of other Czechoslovak composers. By examining the music of Smetana and his successors in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the conference will also commemorate the 100th anniversary of his death and thereby recognize the leadership and direction which he gave to the revival of a Czech national school of music in the 19th century. 7 [pageend7]Smetana is not only a significant figure in the history and development of Czech Nationalistic music, but also he ranks with his peers as a Romantic composer who has made a noteworthy contribution to 19th-century musical genres. In his total output, there are eight operas, nine symphonic poems and other orchestral works, chamber music, choral music, songs, and piano music - all substantial statements in their respective genres. The need for the conference becomes apparent when, 100 years after his death, it is noted that the average concertgoer is familiar with only the three dances from the Bartered Bride and perhaps the symphonic poem Vltava (Die Moldau) from the cycle Ma Vlast. Before World War II, scholarship about Czech music in English was carried on primarily by British scholars. To some extent, they still lead the field. However, it is fortunate that in the past 10 to 12 years a number of young American scholars have begun the study of Czechoslovak music. Some of them have been invited to participate with senior scholars in the conference. On the centennial of his death, it is therefore of utmost importance that the music of Smetana and his position in the history of music be reexamined. Although the conference will celebrate the centennial of the death of Smetana with attention being focused on his life and works, it will also address the important questions of Smetana’s relationship to his age and heritage, and of his impact on subsequent Czechoslovak music in the 19th and 20th centuries. The conference participants are being asked to present a critical appraisal of the man, his music, and influence. Some of the topics to be considered and the issues raised are as follows: Smetana: His Predecessors, Music and Influence, Sources, Editions and Specific Stylistic Problems; The National Revival and Smetana: Artistic, Social and Political Issues; Smetana and His Contemporaries: Protagonists and Antagonists; A 20th-Century Perspective of Smetana: Views by Composers, Critics and Historians; and A Round Table: Summary and Conclusions. The conference will convene over a three-day period, March 29-31. There will be morning and afternoon conference sessions, and related musical events in the evening as part of a concurrent music festival, as well as an exhibit of rare books, scores, manuscripts, letters and other documents. There will also be an exhibit of Czechoslovak costumes and arts and crafts. During the conference, there will be a plenary session with the concurrent meeting of the Pacific Southwest Chapter of the American Musicological Society. The following is a list of participants who have been invited: Dr. Michael Beckerman, St. Louis, Missouri; Dr. John Clapham, Bristol, England, Dr. Zdenka E. Fischmann, Corona, California, Dr. Edith Vogl Garrett, Brookline, Massachusetts; Dr. Karel Husa, Ithaca, New York; Dr. Nors S.

Yoell, Los Angeles, California; and Dr. Joseph F. Zacek, Albany, New York. 8 [pageend8]The music festival, March 29 to April 8, 1984, will feature the San Diego Symphony in a complete performance of Smetana’s Ma Vlast conducted by Paavo Berglund and Karel Husa’s Two Sonnets from Michelangelo conducted by the composer. In addition, there will be a series of concerts of chamber music by Smetana, Dvorak, Janacek, Martinu and other Czechoslovak composers performed at San Diego State University. Also, Karel Husa has been commissioned to write a Smetana fanfare. The festival will present a Czechoslovak Ethnic Day at San Diego State University on Saturday, April 7. There will be folk dancing, popular outdoor brass band music (dechovka), a Food Fair featuring a variety of Czechoslovak pastries and appetizers, and a production of Smetana’s Bartered Bride Saturday evening.

Jan Loewenbach (1880-1972) was a distinguished attorney, music critic and publicist of Czechoslovak music. He received the degree of Doctor of Jurisprudence from Charles University, Prague in 1910 and practiced law in Czechoslovakia until 1939. As an attorney, he formulated the copyright laws in Czechoslovakia to protect the rights of composers and authors. As a music critic and publicist, he wrote for numerous European music journals, championing the cause of Czechoslovak contemporary music. He was a close friend of Leoš Janáček, Jaroslav Křička, Bohuslav Martinů and other Czechoslovak composers. Under the pseudonym of J. L. Budin, he wrote the librettos for Martinu’s first opera The Soldier and the Dancer and Kfička’s The Gentleman in White. With the outbreak of World War II, he emigrated to the United States where he continued his active support of Czechoslovak music in New York City as the cultural adviser to the Czechoslovak Information Office. He planned the celebrations for the Dvořák Centennial in 1941, wrote an extensive book on Smetana (unpublished), arranged the American premiere of Dvořák’s Rusalka in Detroit in 1945, and was in close touch with Jarmila Novotná, Rudolf FirkuŠný, Bohuslav Martinů and other Czechoslovak artists. Dr. Loewenbach went back to Czechoslovakia after the war and then returned to the United States. He went into retirement in New York. The Loewenbach family donated the personal papers from his American period to the San Diego State University Library. SOSO 11 [pageend11]BOOKS OF INTEREST We reprint excerpts from two reviews by SVU member Josef Kalvoda, Professor of History and Political Science at St. Joseph College, West Hartford. Msgr. Ludvik Nemec, SVU member, has taught at Rosemont College in Pennsylvania. He celebrated his 70th birthday last October. Professor H. Gordon Skilling is SVU honorary member and an expert on Czechoslovakia. Ludvik Nemec. Our Lady of Hostýn. Queen of the Marian Garden of the Czech Moravian, Silesian and Slovak Madonnas. (New York: RCH Press, 1981 Pp. xii, 171. $6.00, paper.) Professor Msgr. Ludvik Nemec is a prolific writer and an accomplished scholar. His most recent book presents a perspective of the Marian cult and a reflection on current religious conditions in Czechoslovakia. The volume relates the legend of Hostýn, where centuries ago the Tatar invasion was stopped, about the apparition at Turzovka, and about hundreds of places of worship to which Czechs and Slovaks have made pilgrimages. There are more than 1,200 Marian churches and chapels in Czechoslovakia. This indeed, reflects “the true dictum of Jesuit Jiri Plachy who in 1648, holding a Marian flag, defended Prague against the Swedes. Standing with his university students on the Charles Bridge, he inspired the young fighters to bravery with the words: ‘Dear was the Virgin Mary to the Czechs, dear will be the Czechs to the Virgin Mary; citizens, let us defend ourselves; the Queen of Heaven is with us!’” (p. 30). The Czech and Slovak settlers in the Néw World have also built churches dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Currently American Catholics of Czech origin, upon the initiative and under the leadership of Msgr. Nemec, are building a chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Hostýn in the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C., and proceeds from this book will be used for that purpose. The title of the book is derived, in part, from the name of a book by Julius Zeyer, Marianska Zahrada (The Marian Garden). When Zeyer published this well-known book before World War I, less than two-and-a-half percent of Czechs professed other than the Catholic faith. Although a large part of the intelligentsia was somewhat religiously indifferent, the Czech people, especially in the countryside, in Moravia, the mountainous regions and small towns, was deeply religious. Among the outer manifestations of this religious sentiment were mass pilgrimages to famous shrines such as Svaty Hostýn, Svaty Kopeček, Svata Hora, Stara Boleslav, Chlumek nad Luzi and others... Msgr. Nemec refutes a misconception widely spread among the English-speaking peoples according to which the Czech culture was Protestant. He shows that the Czech and Slovak cultures were deeply rooted in Catholicism. As the Czech historian, Frantisek Palacky, has already noted, “the most beautiful memorial of Old Czech art... is the Virgin Mary with the Infant in the church monastery in Vyssi Brod” (p. 140)... The book by professor Nemec is illustrated by a large number of photographs of shrines, statues and pictures from various churches in Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia and Slovakia. It is equipped with an index, notes and bibliography. It is a pioneering work and an excellent source of information on the subject. From Nationalities Papers, Vol. XI, No. 2, Fall 1983, p. 320. ★ ★ ★ 12 [pageend12]H. Gordon Skilling, Charter 77 and Human Rights in Czechoslovakia. (London: George Allen & Unwin, 1981. Pp. xv + 363. $37.50) Thus far, this is the largest English language study of Charter 77 and human rights in Czechoslovakia. It consists of some 195 pages of narrative with footnotes, 143 pages of selected documents of the Charter, information about the trials of 1977 to 1980, and an index. Professor H. Gordon Skilling discusses the origins of the Charter, its signatories and spokesmen, and the response to it within Czechoslovakia and abroad. The author points out that, contrary to widely spread opinion, some 90 percent of the signatories of the document were non-Communists and only a small minority of them were ex-Communist party members. The first spokesman for the human rights movement was Jan Patočka, an apolitical man and philosopher who was prepared and willing to risk his life for the cause. Vaclav Havel, another non-Party member who is a writer and a “prisoner of conscience,” has languished in prisons for several years. The movement itself, however, consists of people from all walks of life whose backgrounds and views differ widely. While some of the Chartists hold parochial views, Havel and Jan Tesar for example have advocated cooperation with dissident movements in other countries, especially Poland. The conditions existing in Poland, however, are radically different from those in Czechoslovakia where the Chartist movement has been confined to merely a small fraction of the population. In Poland Solidarity represents some nine and a half million workers. Skilling’s conclusions about the significance and future of the movement are tentative. Regardless of what will happen in the future, the movement has already produced a significant amount of literature as noted in the publication. Undoubtedly Vaclav Havel will be remembered for his courage and his essay “Power of the Powerless,” in which he brilliantly describes “living in the lie” and shows the way to those who seek “to live in truth.” The book is a valuable source of information for anyone who does not read Czech and is interested in human rights in Czechoslovakia...

Heim teaches Czech and Russian Literature at the University of California, Los Angeles. He is SVU member, past co-editor of this Bulletin (see issue II, 2, May 1981), and has translated several books by contemporary Czech authors. His newest accomplishment is his translation from the Russian of The Island of Crimea by Vassily Aksyonov (Random House: 395 pp., $16.95) Aksyonov now lives in exile in the United States, though he was popular and very successful in the Soviet Union during the post-Stalin era. He is a son of the writer Eugenia Ginzburg who perished in the gulag. His father was also Stalin’s victim. The book is a satirical and fancy free presentation of a Western-like democratic society established in independent Crimea by the White Russians who found refuge there after the Revolution. Heim’s translation is idiomatic and witty, making the book very readable for the American public. ★ ★ ★ In Bulletin IV, 2, May 1983 Jožka Pejskar’s Poslední Pocta (The Last Honour) was reviewed by Frank Meissner. Many universities and libraries holding Czech materials have acquired the book as an indispensable research and source tool, reserving the upcoming second volume. Some copies of the first volume are still available directly from the author (J. Pejskař, 330 N. Stage Coach Lane, Fallbrook, CA 92028) or from the publisher in Switzerland (Konfrontation AG/SA, Werdhoelzlistrasse 14, CH-8102, Zurich, Switzerland). *** 13 [pageend13]P.O. Box 427 Woodstock, New York 12498 THE OVERLOOK PRESS Beyond the Chestnut Trees Maria Bauer Biography November $15-95 224 pages 5 *4 x 8 ’4 8 black-and-white illustrations LC: 83-42917 ISBN: 0-87951-190-7 “I will be thinking about people and scenes in Maria Bauer’s haunting memoir for a long time. It is an elegant book, beautifully structured, with vividly evoked landscapes and personalities” (Gail Godwin). It is impossible not to be moved by this masterfully written reminiscence of a woman who returns to Prague after a forty-year absence. Although the spirit of the city and its people has changed, familiar sights rekindle Bauer’s memory and we are transported back to the idyllic, and often turbulent, time of Czechoslovakia between the two world wars. Interwoven with the contemporary story of Bauer’s search for the people of her past is a vividly drawn series of flashbacks in which we experience the events and the characters of her childhood. Among them are her mother and father, whose diminishing wealth and social status parallels the changing political climate, and the two men Bauer learns to love: Karel, the elegiac artist, and Robert, who heroically aids her family in their courageous escape from the Nazis. Born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, in 1919, Maria Bauer divides her time between Woodstock, New York, and Washington, D.C. ★ ★ ★ Tales of the Czechs, by Kathy and Joe T. Vosoba (Lincoln: Word Services, 1983, p. 65; order from Nebraska Czechs of Wilber, Wilber, NE 68465; $7.65 incl. postage) The book is described as “History and Legends as told at the Pageant of the Czech People, Wilber Czech Festival, Wilber, Nebraska, 1962 through 1982.” The full-color cover and illustrations are by Beth Vosoba of Wilber. The authors, Kathy and Joe T. Vosoba, SVU member, explain that “this little booklet is obviously far from a thorough treatment of 1,500 years of a people. To serious historians, we extend our apologies. We feel it is better to pass on some history by means of entertainment than to pass on nothing at all.” All profits from the book go the the Nebraska Czechs of Wilber, a non-profit organization that holds the copyright. The organization sponsors the annual Wilber Czech Festival (see Bulletin IV, 2, May 1983), 14 [pageend14]operates the free Czech Museum and a Craft Shop, and recently has renovated the historic Wilber Hotel to create an old world Czech Restaurant. We have to read the stories in the book with the awareness that they accompany the various scenes of the pageant. In this manner we meet the forefather Cech who brought his people to the territory of Bohemia; the legendary ruler Krok and his three daughters, among them Libuše who married Přemysl and thus founded the dynasty of the Kings of Bohemia. We witness the defeat by the men of Bohemian Amazons led by Vlasta. Horymir and his horse, the brigand Janosik, Dalibor with his fiddle and others promenade before our eyes. Among the important historical personages we get acquainted with King Wenceslas; Roman Emperor and King of Botjemia Charles IV of the Luxemburg line; Jan Hus and the Hussite general Jan Zizka; the exile Comenius, and so on. We listen to some folk music and observe the dancers. Eventually we hear that many of those Czechs and Slovaks left their country and found their freedom “in America,” bringing their heritage with them. And in this manner we return to Wilber, “Czech Capital of Nebraska,” where the Nebraska Czechs - Pioneers of the Prairie - have kept alive the Czech spirit. ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★A THEATER The Real Thing by Tom Stoppard A review of the life and work of Tom Stoppard by Jack Kroll appeared in Newsweek (January 16, 1984). Stoppard’s Czech roots, stay in Singapore, loss of the father who was a doctor in Zlin, mother’s remarriage that gave Tom the very British name of his stepfather — a name he made famous — explain some of his brilliance, in the dramatic thought and in use of the language. By now, he says, he has lost his “peculiar way of speaking English with a Czech-American-Chinese accent” that made him stand out among his schoolmates in England. The turbulent course of his formative years also explains his sensitivity to people’s need of independence from the state and from authoritarian systems of any kind. His involvement with Amnesty International gave him an opportunity to speak with Soviet dissidents and to visit Czechoslovakia for the first time since his childhood and to meet the playwright Vaclav Havel. His irreverent humor also may have something to do with his Czech origins. At the age of 29, in 1967, Tom Stoppard made a big impact with his play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead. Jumpers, Travesties, Every Good Boy Deserves Favour, Professional Foul and other plays followed. His latest work, The Real Thing, was produced in London and currently has a successful run on Broadway. A two-hour teleplay of Stoppard’s Squaring the Circle has been shot in London for British TV, in cooperation with the American Metromedia. It presents Lech Walesa and the story of Solidarity in all its perplexing ambiguity when seen by an American reporter. An airing in both Britain and the United States is anticipated for April 1984. ★ ★ ★ 15 [pageend15]Beckett’s Catastrophe Dedicated to Vaclav Havel An off-Broadway trilogy of plays by Samuel Beckett has been performed since last June. The playwright created the first play, Ohio Impromptu, to celebrate his 75th birthday at Ohio State University. The third piece, What Where, uses three characters named Bom, Bim and Bern as representing parts of one fragmented personality, while they communicate through megaphones. The middle play, Catastrophe, has a silent/silenced and immobile protagonist standing on a pedestal - Vaclav Havel - who is being inspected and “reshaped” by a Director and his female Assistant. By eventually raising his head the Protagonist silences the potential audience’s applause. The trilogy was reviewed by Stanley Kauffmann in Saturday Review, February 1984. ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ ARTS The Precious Legacy The exhibit on tour, The Precious Legacy (see Bulletin IV, 2, May 1983) moved to Miami Beach after eight weeks in Washington, D.C. At the Smithsonian Institute President and Mrs. Ronald Reagan, in company of visiting President of Israel Chaim Herzog and his spouse, were offered a special viewing of the Jewish Artifacts from Czechoslovak State Collections, exhibited abroad for the first time. The next city on the tour is New York (inauguration on April 15, 1984) where the Society for the History of Czechoslovak Jews, Inc. plans a special preview of the exhibit. The art historian Dr. Zdenka Munzer, member of the above Society and of SVU, reportedly wants to prepare a special lecture On the West Coast, the only city that will host this unique collection is San Diego (September 22 to November 18, 1984). New Orleans, Detroit and Hartford. CT will then follow. ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ News Received SIXTY-EIGHT PUBLISHERS RECOGNIZED The New York Times (Sunday, June 5, 1983) published a special article by Michael T. Kaufman concerning the Sixty-Eight Publishers of Toronto. We reprint the article in full as a recognition of the unremitting labors of SVU members Josef Skvorecky and Zdena Salivarova during the past decade. 16 [pageend16]BOOKS BARRED BY PRAGUE FIND NEW LIFE IN TORONTO By Michael T. Kaufman Special to The New York Times TORONTO — A noted Czech emigre novelist and his wife, also a writer, have set out to sustain Czech literature and redeem it from the political arbiters of culture in Prague, who have banned more than 200 writers. The novelist, Josef Skvorecky, whose own books have been outlawed, and his wife, Zdena Salivarova, have gone into competition with Czechoslovakia’s official publishing establishment by issuing 139 Czech books. Some are by authors who fled or were banished after the Soviet military intervention in 1968 ended a brief period of liberalization; others are the works of writers still living in Czechoslovakia whose manuscripts have made their way here. Mr. Skvorecky, 58 years old, whose books include the widely translated and acclaimed Bass Saxophone, The Tank Corps and Miss Silver’s Past, said he believes that Czechoslovakia has the most repressive cultural apparatus of any Warsaw Pact country. There has been no impact, he said, from the events in Poland, and unlike the Polish authorities, who are liberalizing what they publish in the hope of gaining credibility, the Czechoslovak establishement has remained rigidly censorious. Narrow and Safe Topics He said that officially sanctioned writing focused on narrow, safe topics. “It is as if at the time Mark Twain wrote Huckleberry Finn, people would write about the South without mentioning Negroes or slavery,” said Mr. Skvorecky, who teaches American literature at the University of Toronto. He said that Government- approved Czech works included a number of anti-Semitic books that sought to establish that the liberalizations of 1968 were brought about by “foreigners” and “Jews” who “manipulated the Czech people into provoking their Soviet comrades.” Mr. Skvorecky said that, in fact, there were few Jews left in Czechoslovakia since the Nazi German occupation in World War II. Miss Salivarova is a 49-year-old former actress whose own book, Summer in Prague, was well received in the world and banned in Czechoslovakia, whose cultural bureaucracy it describes by telling the story of a member of a folkloric chorus that is permitted to travel abroad. It is Miss Salivarova who was the real founder of the publishing effort and is its major driving force. “Josef had a job here and spoke English well when we arrived, but I did not and felt cut off from things,” she said. She said she realized there were other Czech emigres who were cut off from their language. “A musician or dancer can survive in exile, but a writer is tied to the language,” she said. Made Use of Prize Money She said her husband, concerned by her moodiness, had given her some prize money he had won, in the hope that she would take a course as a dental technician or computer programmer. Instead, Miss Salivarova, whose father was a bookseller, decided to start the publishing venture by bringing out an edition of The Tank Corps, a book that her husband wrote in 1954 and that the Czech authorities banned in 1969. She collected lists of Czech readers all over the world, including one in Nepal. Today she has a mailing list of 10,000 and new titles come out in editions of about 2,000 copies. The price of books averages around $10 and the profits are put back into the business. The publications include books by such contemporary Czech writers as Jan Benes, Arnošt Lustig and Milan Kundera. The most successful book on the list of 139 titles is The House of Fear, a book of poetry about life in a concentration camp, written by Jan Zahradniček, a priest. ★ ★ ★ 17 [pageend17]THE NUTLEY SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA PREMIERES A SMETANA WORK On October 23, 1983, The Nutley Symphony Orchestra performed Smetana’s Scherzo from the Festive Symphony. The American born and educated conductor and Director of Music Education in Nutley Public Schools, NJ, Dr. Ernest J. Ersfeld, SVU member, made the following comment. Today’s program is essentially classical in its structure with an infusion of the beginnings of romanticism in the Beethoven Symphony. This is further represented in the music of the scherzo from the Smetana Symphony which I had the pleasure of locating in the archives of the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra’s library in Prague which I visited this past June. The orchestra parts are in manuscript and only the conductor’s score is published. It is a delightful composition which reflects many moods of the ‘ ‘Bartered Bride” and the “Moldau” (Vltava) the most famous works of Smetana. While this has been frequently performed in Czechoslovakia, today’s performance represents its first in the United States. I am personally grateful for the efforts of my professional colleagues in assisting my efforts to obtain this music in Prague and making this presentation possible. Constance G. J. Wagner said in the program notes: Scherzo from “The Festive Symphony” — Smetana This intriguing 1863 scherzo, although frequently performed in Europe, has had no exposure in the United States. The symphony as a whole also remained largely unplayed because of the heavy influence of Haydn’s Austrian anthem which permeates the work. The fall of the Austrian monarchy in 1918 and the symbolism the music stirred after World War II made the complete work a less popular choice for symphonic programs. The scherzo, however, free of any nationalistic suggestions, retained its popularity and even today delights the listener with its mature, yet joyful vitality. * * * 18 [pageend18]Note: The date 1863 must be a misprint. Smetana composed his Festive or Triumphal Symphony in 1853/54, hoping to have it performed at the wedding of Emperor Franz Josef and Princess Elizabeth of Bavaria. However, the symphony was first performed in a public concert in Prague, on February 26, 1955, the composer conducting and playing piano in the second part of this concert. A Supraphon recording with Czech Philharmonic and Sejna is available. ★ ★ ★ ETHNIC LIFE USA Today (“USA Journal,” June 9, 1983) had a special report by Nancy Stevens on a Czech Village in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Some excerpts follow: Ethnic Village Works to Check Slipping Heritage “Bohemie Town.” Czech descendants in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, hate the term. It used to fall like a racial slur, implying the Czech enclave on the southwest side was the wrong side of the tracks. In 1972, Czech Village wasn’t much to look at: a string of dumpy, dilapidated buildings housing a handful of small businesses. But no one is laughing now. Czech Village has emerged from its slump. Scores of sightseers will attend the Koiache Festival this weekend, munching Czech pastry as they walk down the Village’s quaint, clean streets and peer inside ethnic shops and boutiques. Last weekend, the city’s blacks, Danes, Irish, Mexicans and Norwegians joined the Czechs in celebrating the Ethnic Festival. The weekend after Labor Day, the beer tent goes up, dancers in native costume swing to accordian bands and a Czech prince and princess are crowned. And two days after St. Patrick’s Day, Czechs celebrate their patron, St. Joseph, and invite Cedar Rapids’ Irish community to sample the delights of red beer. Merchants give any customer named Joe a good deal — regardless of national origin. What transformed Czech Village from a slum to a showcase? “It started with just four of us (in the early 1970’s) meeting as a way to drum up business,” says baker Les Sýkora. “But it wasn’t just that. Our heritage was slipping away.” The council of four — the baker, a saddle-shop owner, a barkeep and a decorator — wanted to make the rest of the city of 100,000 sit up and take notice.” The group of four spread the word that “Czech power” was on the rise and the Village with it. Three new Slavic buildings housing a restaurant, insurance agency and paint store went up. Jerry Bodicker said his wife Arlene’s Czech background and their music school’s emphasis on accordion music made their business a natural for the “new” Village. But he says there are holes. “We need a grocery story and a drugstore. The Village has come a long way. But we have a little farther to go.” Iowa By Heidi Ehrlich, USA TODAY Cedar Rapids ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ 19 [pageend19]FRIENDS OF CZECHOSLOVAK MUSIC San Diego State University Enclosed is my tax deductible contribution of $_____________________________________ 1. _____ Student & Senior Member 55-524 5. _____ Major Sponsor $500-5999 2. _____ Friend $25-$49 6. _____ Major Patron $1,000-51,499 3. _____ Donor $50-$99 7. _____ Guarantor $1,500 plus 4. _ _ __ Benefactor $100-5499 8.______ Memorial Contribution 9.
