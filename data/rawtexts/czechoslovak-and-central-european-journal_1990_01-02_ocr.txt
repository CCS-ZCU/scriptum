For Moravians, the encounter on the Moravian Campus poses the issue of spiritual roots. As the very name indicates, Moravians consider and cherish Moravia and Bohemia as the Land of the Fathers and Mothers. With the memory of their specific roots in the Czech Reformation, they came to Hermhut and then to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, even though the clouds of ages of persecution might have obscured what it originally signified. As regards the presence of Czechs and Slovaks in general, their issue is that of cultural identity. What do we know about that particular tradition of the Czech Reformation which was evidently powerful enough to shape not only the face of its country of origin for centuries but to penetrate, as a creative inspiration, into utterly unexpected comers? Thus for all of us, this encounter is an invitation to refresh our memory and not just for purely historical interest. For all churches and all nations, particularly for those exposed in their history to persecutions and totalitarian pressures, the awareness of their roots strengthens their actual identity and their hope. It is in this sense that I would like to approach the spiritual and ecumenical significance of the Czech Reformation. The Magna Charta of the Czech Reformation The Czech Reformation was a multifaceted dynamic reform movement which had begun already in the fourteenth and culminated in the fifteenth [pageend6]2 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l century. Generally, we speak of “Hussitism” with reference to the key figure of the Czech Reformation, the Prague scholar, preacher and martyr Jan Hus (1372-1415). But the movement was broader than this. There were remarkable renewal efforts in the fourteenth century before Hus connected with preachers and theologians like Jan Milič of Kroměříž (1325-1374) and Matthew of Janov (1355-1393). There is also a whole spectrum of different trends and actions after the death of Hus: the radical Taborites, the more cautious Prague party and, above all, the Unity of the Czech Brethren, the spiritual home of some of the deepest thinkers of Czechoslovak culture like Jan Amos Komenský (Comenius) (1592-1670). In spite of all the differences in emphasis, there was a common denominator in this multifaceted movement. All of the main groups among the Hussites subscribed to a common manifesto, the Magna Charta of Hussitism: The Four Articles of Prague (1419) which mark the basic theological program of this Reformation. When the Hussites were invited to present their cause before the Council of Basel in 1433, The Four Articles formed the agenda of the memorable and dramatic exchange between the representative thinkers of Western Christianity and the leaders of the Czech Reformation. They offer the best insight into the spiritual profile of Hussitism. Let us concentrate on them. (1) 11 The Word of God is to be preached freely.” First things first. With its first principle, the Czech Reformation pointed to its origins, both historical and spiritual. These origins were identical with the origins of the church itself, in the prophetic and apostolic message of the Word of God. In the course of history, the apostolic foundation had been covered by the dust and splendor of ecclesiastical tradition. In many respects, the immediate contact with the biblical message had been interrupted. The free preaching of the Word of God was the instrument of its renewal. Both parts of the formulation have to be emphasized. Preaching of the Word was to be encouraged, not just interpretation and translation of the biblical texts. To be sure, translation is important, and the Hussites worked on a Czech Bible. Yet the real renewal of faith arises out of a living encounter with the living Word, in dialogue between a preacher and a congregation. Both Milič and Hus were masters of such dialogue. Preaching has to be. free. This applies first to the Word of Christ; it has to be set free from its traditional strictures. It would be wrong to say that the medieval church had forgotten the biblical message. Yet under the [pageend7]Spir it u a l a n d Ec u me n ic a l Sig n if ic a n c e 3 authority of its traditional magisterium, this message had been narrowed down. There had been a tendency to monopolize the exposition of the Bible, while the walls of dogmatic tradition were built up around it. The Hussites opposed these developments. The Word, Christ himself, will defend its truth. Its spiritual presence in the church cannot be bound to institutionalized conditions. Consequently, the freedom of preachers had to be enlarged. There could be, strictly speaking, no monopoly of preaching. It is a universal gift entrusted to the whole people of God. The Taborites went so far as to question the institutionalized office of preachers. Everyone, men and women, may be called to witness. Everyone should have immediate access to the Word. Therefore, free preaching is the first principle of Hussitism. (2) “The Sacrament of the body and blood of Christ is to be served in the form of both bread and wine (sub utraque) to all faithful Christians. ” For the Hussites, this second article had been of central importance. In celebrating the Last Supper, they returned the cup into the hands of all communicants. The cup became the symbol of the Czech Reformation. Is this to be understood as a liturgical novelty? Some church historians have tended toward this conclusion: “You do not reform the church and the world by a reform of ceremony” (A. Hauck). Yet this is a deep misunderstanding. For the Hussites the Lord’s Supper was much more than a mere ceremony. In this sacrament, the main lines of their faith and theology converged. The following three seem to me particularly important: a. In withdrawing the cup, church authorities dared to manipulate even the sacramental memory of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ himself. At this very point, the infamy of the established church was to the Hussites blatantly apparent. The realization of the contradiction between the articulate Last Will of Christ and the practice within the church was a shock to the Hussites. Their leader after Hus, Jacobellus, said: “All priests are actually the thieves of the blood of Christ.” They had reserved that blood for their exclusive use. b. The blood of Christ is the bond of salvation for all the people of God. Here the social implications of the Last Supper became relevant. It must not be made into a privilege of church officials. In the presence of the Lord, all distinctions dissolve; all the children of God join in their common heritage. All are the priests — all are subjects and not just [pageend8]4 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l objects of the elaboration. The experience of the Christian brotherhood, so strongly felt and grounded in the sacramental community, radiates into all spheres of life. From this center, the ecclesiological and social initiatives of the Hussites, particularly the Taborites, are to be understood. Therefore the sub ut raque was more than a ceremonial reform. The cup was to them the symbol of the eschatological brotherhood and sisterhood of men and women. c. The eschatological aspect of the Lord’s Supper was particularly strong with the Hussites. They celebrated Communion as an anticipation and representation of the coming kingdom of God. It is the sacrament of the new age, empowering believers to stand and to overcome the temptations and struggles of the old age. Frequently the sacrament was celebrated on mountaintops (the eschatological symbolism is apparent). In this understanding, the Hussites went a different (and possibly more biblical) way than the reformers of the sixteenth century. Much of the spiritual energy of the Reformation was devoted to the ontological aspects of Christ’s presence in the sacrament; the question of the “elements” and their metaphysical status preoccupied their minds and debates. The Hussite emphasis on Christ’s eschatological presence in the brotherhood of believers might actually be closer to the original meaning of the sacrament than the sixteenth century discussions. (3) “Priests are to relinquish earthly position and possessions, and all are to begin an obedient life based on the apostolic model. ” This article indicates the ecclesiological consequences of the Hussite program. What are the notae verae ecclesiae (“signs of the true church”)? “Word and sacrament” is their reply in the first and second articles, as if anticipating the classical position of the Lutheran Reformation. But the Hussites continued and added a very practical concern: an obedient life based on the apostolic model is also a sign of the true church. This was an attack on the life-style and structure of the Constantinian church. It struck at the privileged position of the priests because in their case the contradiction between apostolic and Constantinian Christianity was especially sharp. Yet more was at stake — all of the church was to be confronted with the apostolic way. The apostles were the disciples of Christ; they followed his way not only in teaching but also in living. The “apostolic model” is the way of service in solidarity, particularly with those who are poor and underprivileged. Likewise, a renewal must produce practical and concrete [pageend9]Spir it u a l a n d Ec u me n ic a l Sig n if ic a n c e 5 social consequences — in church and society. Not only orthodoxy (renewal in biblical teaching), but also orthopraxy (renewal in personal and social discipleship) was the goal of the Hussite movement. (4) “All public sins are to be punished and public sinners in all positions are to be restrained. ” With its last article, the Hussite Reformation demanded moral discipline in all realms of life. This article may sound like legalistic moralism. No doubt there were legalistic tendencies among the Hussites. But at their best, their emphasis on law and discipline surpassed legalism. Like the later Calvinists, the Hussites recognized that a real reform of the church and society has to develop structural aspects. The moral and legal orders are not indifferent. Among Christians, they should reflect the “law of Christ.” This implies discipline. Precisely in this article the Hussite Reformation showed its revolutionary “teeth.” It spoke of sinners “in all positions.” There is only one order of justice in light of the kingdom of God. His law refers to all classes and all people. There are no positions which can claim special privileges. The Lord is to be obeyed more than the lords, and the lords are to be judged under the supreme authority of the Lord. Not only the church, but also the society is to be shaped in conformity with the royal authority of Jesus Christ. Ecclesia et societas semper reformanda. The Four Prague Articles are a document of the early fifteenth century firmly rooted in their historical context responding to actual issues of their times. Yet their relevance transcends their historical origins. They express insights that have proved their fresh actuality also in different situations later. They were cherished, indirectly, in the spiritual heritage of Moravians: the importance of preaching, the liturgical and communal centrality of the Lord’s supper and the emphasis on the “discipline of grace” — all these elements belong to the specific climate of Moravian piety and life. There are also striking social and political parallels of The Four Articles. Let me mention one example. In the Prague Spring of 1968, the theology students of the Comenius Faculty of Evangelical Theology tried to formulate their political stand and demands in support of the movement towards democratization of the Czechoslovak society. They did so in a free interpretation of The Four Articles: Freedom of the Word; the free access of “all the People of God” to the ultimate “mysteries” of society in questioning the privileges of the “governing priests” (i.e. a plea for [pageend10]6 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al more transparency — “glasnost” if you wish — in all spheres of public life); the concern for a democratic legal order and structures supporting human rights. Thus a document of the fifteenth century, the magna charta of the Czech Reformation, proved its spiritual potential and inspirational power. Ecumenical Contribution Our cursory attempt at charting the spiritual and theological territory of the Czech Reformation raises the issue of its theological significance and possible actual relevance. Is there a legitimate ecumenical contribution of this reform movement? Many theologians and church historians seem to have doubts about this. If one looks at traditional textbooks of church history, vivid illustrations of these hesitations will be found. From the perspective of mainstream Roman Catholic historiography, the Hussites — like the Waldensians before them — were typical medieval heretics (although since Vatican II this view has been corrected by some researchers, particularly in relation to Jan Hus himself). For most of the church historians of the great Protestant churches, the Czech reformers are the “little brothers,” attractive and sympathetic in the initiatives they took, but from a truly Reformation stance definitely “underdeveloped”; that is, they were mere precursors and heralds of the classical Reformation of the sixteenth century. I would like to challenge this evaluation. What follows is a plea for more attention to, and appreciation of, the distinctive contribution of the Czech Reformation to Western Christianity. Perhaps I am biased in this plea. The Czech Reformation is my spiritual home. So there might be a need for some discounting of my judgments. Yet there is more to it than personal bias. There is the strong experience of the theological and ecumenical relevance of this heritage. Let me try to give the rationale for this judgment. I will do so in two steps, dealing firstly with the issues of the specific theological challenge and, second, with the contemporary significance of this Reformation. (1) The Czech Reformation understood itself as a part of the broader reform movement within the ecumenical Christianity. It did not intend to break the unity of the church but rather to renew and strengthen it on its apostolic foundation. When Comenius looked back at its history, he [pageend11]Spir it u a l a n d Ec u me n ic a l Sig n if ic a n c e 7 underlined the solidarity with the reform programs of their reformers — and he included among those also some popes and councils of the Middle Ages. Particularly, the close affinity to the Reformation of the sixteenth century was highlighted. In spite of this broad solidarity, however, the Czech reformers had their own and distinct theological accents. One could perhaps characterize their intention with the term radical renewal. The word “radical” has two meanings here. It refers to the two aspects which seem to me to be typical for the Czech Reformation. On the one hand, in their confrontation with the established church, which was in such a need of reform, the Czech reformers referred back to the origins to the radix, the “roots” of the church, that is, to its apostolic origins. Particularly, the praxis of the primitive church played a normative role for them; it constantly reoccurs in their theological declarations, together with references to the sovereign authority of the Scriptures, as an appeal to binding discipleship. In this memoria apostolorum they hoped for, and sought to promote, the restructuring and renewal of the contemporary church. In returning to the church’s origins — a step which had parallels in the Reformation of the sixteenth century — the Czech theologians developed the second accent of their radicalism, which lends them their specific image and importance. By referring to the apostolic origins, they emphasized the practice of the early church in its exemplary purport and placed these practical aspects in the foreground. Such an orthopraxy is no less important for the reform of the church than an orthodoxy, neither side should be played off against the other, nor should they be separated from one another. To know and to teach the truth means to do it. In this connection, the Czech reformers’ constant appeal to the example of Jesus, to his actions, played an orienting role. The Czech Reformation turned directly to the Bible, placed it in the hands of believers. Above all, it prized the vitally preached Word as a challenge to discipleship. In so doing, it set unmistakable accents in the selection of its texts. It was the Gospels, primarily the Sermon on the Mount, which received the greatest amount of attention. Without desiring to set up false alternatives, the following distinction could be made: where the later reformation concentrated its theology on the Pauline message of justification, the Czech focussed on the evangelical commandment of Jesus. [pageend12]8 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l This orientation brought the Hussites closer to the Waldensians: the call to evangelical and apostolic poverty. As is well known, this was the basic motive in the conversion of Valdes: the voluntary poverty of the wealthy merchant for the sake of discipleship and of credible proclamation. But for Jan Milič and Jan Hus too, the reference to Jesus as the King of the Poor played an important role in the critique of church and society. The true church of Christ is apostolic in the sense that it understands itself as the church of the poor. There is double significance in this: the church first devotes itself to the poor and takes a stand for them. This was practiced with revolutionary consequences by the Hussites in particular. And then the church should live in the spirit of poverty: worldly domination jeopardizes and contradicts the inner constitution of the church, destroying the credibility of its word and mission. Therefore the Czech reformers challenged the established church in its institutionalized life-style; they revealed the church in its wealth and power interests — e.g. sale of indulgences — as a church in contradiction with itself. In this regard there was a strong polemic accent in this reformation. But the Hussites and the Czech Brethren did not merely polemicize — rather they put their message into practice, lived out an alternative, took the person and Word of their Lord seriously. The Hussites, particularly the Taborites, attacked the unjust social structures of the Constantinian Christendom and experimented with “classless models” of a Christian society. The Czech Brethren concentrated on forming the committed fellowship of resolute disciples of Jesus outside the mainstream of society at first, yet radiating the spirit of Christ into the surrounding culture indirectly and effectively. Common to all is the deep conviction that both the personal and social life of Christian people is to be creatively related to the promise and challenge of the coming kingdom of God. As the revolutionary Prague preacher Jan Želivský put it: “Status mundi renovabitur” (The state of the world will be renewed). Some aspects of this type of thinking and acting may seem, from the perspective of several centuries later, to have been too enthusiastic, sectarian, and alien to the world’s realities. There are elements of apocalypticism and legalism. Some presuppositions and consequences must be clarified and examined theologically. This the Reformation of the sixteenth century would do, and its corrections would not be unheard by [pageend13]Spir it u a l a n d Ec u me n ic a l Sig n if ic a n c e 9 the churches of the Czech Reformation. It would be foolish, however, to overlook in this process of correction the permanent contribution and challenge of this Reformation: the emphatic insistence that a true and serious reform to the church — a radical reformation — must have its social-ethical and social-critical dimensions. Or, to put it another way, the semper reformanda must never be applied only to the realm of doctrine and ecclesiastical theory, but also to the life-style and practical engagement of the church — applied to both the personal life of the Christian as well as to the institutional life of church and society. A biblically radical reform movement has its integral ethical, even political, dimension. Lacking this dimension, the implications of Christian renewal are not fully developed, and reformation is not understood radically enough. (2) In its emphasis on faith’s radical relationship to reality, I see the charisma of the Czech Reformation and its relative “plus” in comparison with other reform movements including the reformation of the sixteenth century. Was it not a danger of the great reformers of the sixteenth century that their passionate renewal pathos was related too one-sidedly to doctrine and to the inner realm of the church? Certainly this is not exclusively so. Particularly, the Calvinist churches were not so one-sided. But looking at the Reformation as a whole, their efforts and initiatives did have this tendency. One cannot overlook the ecumenical significance and achievements, for example, of Lutheran theology and church life. However, one should not ignore the shadows which accompanied them. I am thinking of a certain inadequacy in the area of the practical and social consequences of the Reformation. Luther’s one-sided and gruff “no” to the peasants’ revolt demanding more justice and freedom is symptomatic. I do not wish to underestimate the complexity and difficulty of decision in the given historical moment (1525) and exercise cheap criticism from the safety of temporal distance. But how profoundly burdened Protestant church history has been by fear or theological hesitations in regard to the practical and social demands of reformational freedom — in part with express reference to Luther’s attitude. The failure of evangelical churches in the social area is at least in part explained by this. The relative absence of the other voices — like those of the Czech Reformation — and their notorious underestimation in the perspective of established Protestant orthodoxy, [pageend14]10 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al have had negative consequences for the church and society. Today, a more positive réévaluation of the contribution of the Czech Reformation for ecumenical Christianity might be in our common interest. Within ecumenical Christianity today we are experiencing a veritable explosion of social-ethical engagement, both in Protestant and Roman Catholic churches (the manifold Liberation Theologies are examples of this). At the same time, a growing anxiety is being felt in some ecclesiastical and political circles as reaction to this engagement. There is a dangerous process of polarization in our churches. More than ever, concentrated theological reflection on this burning issue is essential. While social involvement by Christians is an urgent matter today in view of the global distress of humankind, it is persuasive and effective only when it is not the overreaction of unreflective activism compensating for lack of spiritual discipline and concentration, but rather issues from thoughtful and dynamic faith. Here is where theology has its important task. But theology will hardly be able to fulfill its charge unless it looks about its own “house” and searches out sources and models for a new beginning. Some of those traditionally neglected ones might prove particularly helpful. To my thinking (and frequent ecumenical experience), the voice of the Czech Reformation is such a source and model. On the prominent place within the Moravian campus in Bethlehem, there is an impressive statue of the one who quite exceptionally embodied both constitutive elements just mentioned: the social and cultural engagement of immense richness and intensity and also the spiritual depth of a person firmly grounded in the unum necessarium: Jan Amos Komenský (Comenius). His legacy unites and obliges us all. It is a privilege and responsibility of both spiritual and cultural heirs of the Czech Reformation and history — the Moravians and sons and daughters of Czechoslovak culture — not to forget but to commemorate and cultivate this common heritage.

[pageend16]The Renewal and the Formation of the Moravian Church in America Miloslav Rechcigl Jr. The Origins The glorious days of the ancient Unitas Fratrum1, the religious followers of the teachings of the Protestant Bohemian martyr Jan Hus, came to a sudden end when the Czech armies and their allies were defeated in the Battle of White Mountain on November 8, 1620. The victorious Habs- burgs were determined to put forever an end to the “Czech heretics” through public executions, imprisonment, torture, confiscation of property and forced exile. The freedom of territorial rights was infringed by enforced centralization, Czech nationality was extirpated by German- ization, and the last remains of Czech Reformation were rooted out by the governing Catholic absolutism. The population had been reduced to half, one third of the farmland was left untilled and the whole country became impoverished. The Habsburg rulers would rather have their lands desolate than inhabited by “heretics.” The venerable Jan Amos Komenský-Comenius (1592-1670), the “last” Bishop of Bohemian Brethren, made a heroic but futile effort during his many years in exile to revive the ancient Unitas Fratrum. Nevertheless, before his death he bequeathed the world the treasured principles and ideals of the Church, which he deemed of universal value, in the ecclesiastical traditions of the Brethren.2 Despite the dismal outlook, the “hidden seed” remained, and when the opportune time came, it sprouted and blossomed into the renewed Unitas Fratrum.3 The Exile [pageend17]Th e Re n e w a l a n d t h e Fo r ma t io n 13 The beginnings of the epic of the Moravian Church can be traced to Christian David (1692-1751), a carpenter of Ženklava, Moravia, not too far from Comenius’s parish of Fulnek, a convert from Catholicism, who became first a Lutheran and then an ardent supporter of the faith of the ancient Unity of Bohemian Brethren. Upon his return to his native Moravia from abroad, where he learned the truth of the Gospel and became its confessor, he travelled extensively through Moravia and Bohemia in an effort to seek out the followers of the persecuted Unity as well as converts among the “hidden seed,” and was determined to find a refuge for the spiritually awakened families. The opportunity presented itself in 1722, when he was introduced to a young Saxon nobleman, Count Nicolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf (1700- 1760). Moved by the plight and the religious zeal of Christian David’s countrymen, Zinzendorf promised to help. He offered to provide them shelter but not much else since, being an exile himself, he did not have funds to spare.4 Soon after Zinzendorf made his promise, two brothers, Augustine (1681-1750) and Jacob Neisser (1693-1757), with their families, and Michael Jaeschke (d. 1772), all from the Moravian village of Žilina, ten individuals in all, arrived under David’s guidance on Zinzendorf s estate in Upper Lusatia.5 In Zinzendorf s absence (he was in Dresden at the time) the refugees were accepted with some reluctance by his estate manager, George Heitz. He did not allow them to stay in the village, as they desired, but instead set aside for them a space in the middle of a forest on the road leading to Zittau.6 A few days later Christian David commenced to fell the first tree for a house on a site selected by the Count’s manager. This was the beginning of the village of Hermhut — later to be so intimately linked with the history of the Moravian Church — of which Christian David is rightly called the founder of. In 1723 the small settlement was joined by three additional Neisser brothers (George, Johann and Wenzel) of Žilina, who, with their families, counted eighteen persons. The next chapter of the Moravian Brethren began on May 12, 1724, with the arrival in Hermhut of five young men from Moravia, three members of the large Nitschmann family, all bearing the Christian name David, together with Melchior Zeisberger (1701-1781) and John Toeltschig (1703-1764).7 Because of their old family traditions, anchored in the ancient Unitas Fratrum, the five young Moravians fled to Hermhut [pageend18]14 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al with a definite goal of reestablishing the Unitas there. This earned them later the designation “The Five Pillars of the Church” or “The Five Moravian Churchmen,” in recognition of their vision and the special role they played in the formative years of the history of the Moravian Church.8 The exiles’ families, left behind in Moravia, were severely punished, and some were imprisoned in the damp cellar of the Kunin castle. David Nitschmann’s father, George, escaped by means of a fishing net and fled across the border to Hermhut. Melchior Nitschmann was bound to a stake with wet ropes and left knee-deep in water and later, half dead, he was brought before the authorities for questioning. It is estimated that 280 persons from Suchdol and 167 persons from Kunin alone were questioned and condemned.9 The size of the exodus from the Kravarsko district of Moravia to Hermhut was estimated as follows: 270 individuals from Suchdol, 100 from Kunin, 9 from Butovice, 21 from Mankovice, 58 from Šenov, 47 from Žilina, 24 from Životice, 17 from Ženklava, 9 from Štramberk, and 5 from Morkov, 550 exiles in toto, not counting the refugees from other regions of Moravia or Bohemia.10 The Renewal Zinzendorf was not at all in favor, at least initially, of reestablishing the Unitas Fratrum.11 Being a Lutheran, he wanted the Moravian and Bohemian exiles to abandon their faith and to join the Lutheran Church, using every opportunity through private discussions to bring the Brethren to his point of view.12 All his efforts were in vain. The Moravians remained firm in their resolve and declared that if the introduction of their ancient system and the establishment of a distinct Church of the Brethren was not possible in Hermhut, they would turn elsewhere to seek another location. Their zeal and fearlessness as evangelists increased Zinzendorf s regard for them and when he read Ratio disciplinae, revised and republished by Comenius in 1660, with the history of his much-loved Church, História Fratrum Bohemorum, Zinzendorf apparently had a change of heart.13 This is reflected in one of his letters where he says: “I could not long read the pitiful lamentation of the aged Comenius, who thought that the Church of the Brethren had come to an end and was locking its door; I could not look the second time at his sorrowful prayer, ‘Turn thou us unto thee, O Lord, and we shall be turned, renew our days [pageend19]Th e Re n e w a l a n d t h e Fo r ma t io n 15 as of old,’ before the resolution was formed. I shall help to do this so far as lies in my power, even if my estate, my honor and my life are sacrificed, and thus as long as I live, and, so far as I can provide for it, after my death, this little congregation of the Lord shall be preserved for Him until He comes.”14 Whether his change of heart was out of respect for the Brethren or simply from realization that he could not prevail and therefore decided to join them, or as a result of a premonition that he could use the Brethren’s unique missionary zeal to fulfill his life-long dream “to spread the Gospel among the heathens,” we shall never know; possibly it was a combination of all these factors.15 Be that as it may, the fact is that, after consultation with the Moravians, Zinzendorf issued on May 12, 1727, under the title Herrtschaftliche Gebote und Verbote, a “set of ordinances in harmony with the first Apostolic Church pattern and with the constitution of the old Church of the Brethren.”16 On August 13, 1727, a date celebrated in the Moravian Church as the Day of Renewal (Emeurungstag) and the Day of the Descending of the Holy Spirit, Count Zinzendorf gathered together the inhabitants of Hermhut, and in an address lasting three hours, enthusiasticaly announced that his Gebote agreed almost word by word with the then discovered Ratio disciplinae of Comenius.17 Powerful emotion was felt throughout the gathering and all agreed it was the Holy Spirit which, as on the Day of Pentecost, carried them into the Renewed Moravian Church. Count Zinzendorf presented the assembly with a new set of Ordinances, called the Brüderlicher Verein und Wilkür in Hermhut, popularly known as the Statuten, which all present were urged to sign. Of the sixty-three individuals present at the memorial service in the parish church of Berthelsdorf, where the above event took place, forty-four were Moravians, seven Bohemians and three Silesians (the ethnic origin of the remaining nine cannot be determined).18 The revival of the Brethren’s Church was finally legitimized on March 13, 1735 by the consecration of David Nitschmann (1696-1772) as its first Bishop from the hands of Bishop David E. Jablonský (1660-1741), Comenius’s grandson, thus assuring the continuity of the ancient Unitas Fratrum.19 Moravian Missions [pageend20]16 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al Zinzendorf s enthusiasm for missionary work stemmed from a solemn covenant he formed with a school friend, Count Frederick de Watt- eville.20 As he later recounted the episode, the two boys resolved “to do all in their power for the conversion of the heathen, especially for those for whom no one else cared, and by means of men whom God would provide.”21 The Moravians who so unexpectedly appeared on the doorsteps of his estate in Berthelsdorf must have been regarded by him as God’s answer to his prayers. As early as in 1727 Zinzendorf wrote to the Danish Court and offered to send Moravian missionaries to Greenland. On 10 February, 1728, on the first Prayer Day, he proposed his plan for preaching the Gospel in the West Indies, Greenland, Turkey, and Lapland. On the next day, led by Leonard Dober, presumably of Bohemian ancestry, twenty-six young men “made a League and Covenant to respond to the first clear sound of the bugle call.” As is documented in Tobias Leupold’s letter of July 25, 1731 addressed to Count Zinzendorf, the first volunteers for service in Moravian Missions were Tobias Leupold (d. 1734) and Leonard Dober (1706-1766), two Brethren of Bohemian descent who were inspired by an address by a Negro slave from the West Indies at their congregation in Hermhut.22 The decision whether they would go or not was decided by lot: Leonard Dober’s selection was confirmed but in place of Tobias Leupold, David Nitschmann was chosen. On August 21, 1732, Leonard Dober and David Nitschmann set out from Hermhut for St. Thomas to begin the first Moravian Mission to the “heathens.” The second mission was undertaken on January 19, 1733, when Matthew (1711-1787) and Christian Stach (d. 1739), originally from Mankovice, Moravia, together with the Evangelist Christian David started for Greenland. On November 12 of the same year, fourteen men and four women, mostly of Moravian or Bohemian origin, sailed for the Island of St. Croix to found a missionary colony.23 On February 24, 1734 John Nitschmann (1703-1772) of the famed Moravian family left with two companions for Lapland and at the same time Frederick Boehnisch (1710- 1763) of Kunin and John Beck (1706-1777) of Upper Silesia, set out for Greenland. During that year plans were also made to begin missionary work among the Negro slaves in the Dutch possessions in South America and the next year George Piesch (d. 1753) and George Berwick, both from Kunin, went to Surinam to explore the situation and prospects for missionary work. In 1735 eleven more Brethren were dispatched for the [pageend21]Th e Re n e w al an d t h e Fo r mat io n 17 Island of St. Croix, again mostly from the ranks of the Moravians or the Bohemians.24 From later years we must mention David Zeisberger (1723- 1808) and John Heckewelder (1743-1823), both of Moravian ancestry, who made their names as missionaries among the Indians in North America, and George Schmidt (1708-1792), from Kunin, Moravia, who was destined to become the first missionary to South Africa. Moravian Immigration to America25 The first Moravian to step on the shores of the United States was George Boehnisch (1695-1772) from Kunin who arrived in Philadelphia on September 22, 1734,26 accompanying a second group of Schwenk- felders27 on their resettlement voyage to America. Count Zinzendorf initially secured a tract of land in Georgia where the Schwenkfelders were supposed to settle. When the Schwenkfelder immigrants decided to go to Pennsylvania instead, the Trustees of Georgia proposed that a Moravian colony be sent to the new province in their place. The suggestion was adopted because it opened a prospect for undertaking missionary work among the American Indians.28 Twenty men volunteered to go and on November 27, 1734 nine of them set out for England: they were Anton Seiffert, John Toeltschig, Gotthard Demuth, Michael and George Haberland, Frederick Riedel, Peter Rosa, George Waschke and Gottfried Haberecht — all but the last having been bona fide Moravians or Bohemians; Gottfried Haberecht came from Silesia. The little colony, joined by Augustus Spangenberg, sailed from Gravesend on February 6, 1735 on the ship The Two Brothers, and landed at Savannah, Georgia, on March 22.29 In the summer of the same year a reinforcement followed under the leadership of Bishop David Nitschmann. The second group comprised twenty-five persons, most of them again from Moravia or Bohemia.30 Among the passengers on the ship which brought the Moravian Brethren to Georgia was John Wesley (1703-1791), the founder of the Methodist Church, who became acquainted with the Brethren, attended their services, worshiped with them and lived in their home during his initial stay in Georgia. On March 10, 1736, Bishop Nitschmann organized the colony as a regular Moravian Congregation and ordained Anton Seiffert (1712-1785), [pageend22]18 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l a Bohemian, to ministry, placing him in charge of the congregation. The service performed by the Moravian bishop is thought to be the earliest record of a regular ordination performed by a bishop of the Christian Church in the English colonies of North America.31 The Moravians immediately went to work and within a short time were not only able to take care of their needs and maintenance but even repaid the money advanced to them in London. Moreover, they offered their helping hand to newly arrived immigrants. At the same time, they erected a schoolhouse for the Indian children and proceeded with their plans to preach the Gospel to the Indians.32 In 1737 the colony was joined by two young Moravian boys, David Zeisberger Jr. and John Michael Schober (d. 1737) of Nová Ves, Moravia, who unexpectedly arrived from Europe on their own, in the spirit of adventure.33 (This is the same Zeisberger who later in life achieved considerable fame as a missionary among the Indians). In the following year arrived in Georgia George Schulius (d. 1733) of Suchdol, Moravia with Peter Bohler, both of whom were commissioned to missionate among the Negroes of the plantations between Savannah and Charleston.34 The tranquility of the Moravian colony was soon interrupted when the neighboring Spaniards endeavored to expel the English from Georgia. The Brethren were also called upon to join in taking up arms against the invaders; stating that “they neither could nor would bear arms on any consideration,” they refused.35 When the Trustees of Georgia, to whom they appealed for exemption, ruled that the Brethren must furnish men for military service even though they would not have to bear arms, the Moravians decided to move to Pennsylvania which offered more ideal conditions for their work. After the unforseen debacle in Georgia, all future migrations of Moravian Brethren from Europe were directed to Pennsylvania, the port of entry usually being Philadelphia or the New York Harbor. The massive emigration fell between 1742 and 1767, although individuals continued coming to America. Shortly after the purchase of land by the Church in the present Northampton County, Pennsylvania in the year 1741, two colonies were organized in Europe, known as the First and Second Sea Congregations, followed by four others, bearing the name John Nitschmann, Gottlieb Pezold, Henry Jorde, and Gottlob Koenigsdorfer. The colonies were brought in by one of the four vessels owned by the [pageend23]Th e Re n e w a l a n d t h e Fo r ma t io n 19 Church, namely the Catherine, Little Strength, Irene, and Hope, which were afloat at different times within the referenced twenty-five year period. Some Brethren, including Bishop David Nitschmann who travelled back and forth between America and Europe, sometimes booked passage on commercial ships. There is a common perception that the native Moravians or Bohemians formed but a minute percentage of Moravian Brethren who immigrated to America and settled in Pennsylvania. Inasmuch as we have fairly complete passenger lists of the Moravian-owned ships which brought the Brethren to America,36 I have made an effort to identify those Brethren who came from the Lands of the Bohemian Crown, mainly using George Neisser’s manuscript.37 In the process I have frequently consulted the official Gazetteers of Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia, as well as historical gazetteers of Czechoslovakia, which are an absolute necessity for authentication of specific locations where the Brethren were bom. The First Sea Congregation was brought to America on the ship Catherine which arrived on June 7, 1742.38 It was led by a native Moravian, George Piesch, and included three Brethren from Bohemia, six from Moravia, five from Silesia and two from Lusatia, out of the total of fifty-five passengers. The Second Sea Congregation arrived on Little Strength in New York on November 26, 1743.39 It brought thirty-one Brethren from the Czech Lands, including ten from Moravia, eighteen from Silesia and three from Lusatia. The largest contingent of Moravian Brethren ever to come to America arrived on Irene in New York on May 12, 1749, with the John Nitschmann Colony40 accompanied by Evangelist Christian David (already referred to in connection with the founding of Hermhut), and Matthew and Rosina Stach, Moravian missionaries to Greenland. The leader of the Colony, Bishop John Nitschmann, a native of Šenov, Moravia, was a relative of Bishop David Nitschmann. Out of hundred twelve passengers, there were forty-five persons from the Czech Lands, twenty-six from Moravia, and fourteen from Silesia; three Brethren were natives of Lusatia. The ship Irene also brought the Henry Jorde Colony, landing in New York Harbor on June 22, 1750.41 Among its eighty-four passengers were three Moravians and seven Silesians. On September 9, 1753, the Irene docked in New York, bringing in a colony of twenty-three single Brethren in charge of Gottlob Koenigsdorfer; among the passengers were five [pageend24]20 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al Brethren from Moravia and five Brethren from Silesia. The Irene also brought to New York on November 16, 1754 Gottlieb Pezold’s Colony of single men, including two Bohemians, eight Moravians, one Silesian and one Lusatian. Apart from the above colonies, we have a record of the following arrivals of Moravian Brethren from the Lands of the Bohemian Crown: on December 15, 1740, Bishop David Nitschmann reached Philadelphia with his uncle David Nitschmann Senior (1676-1758) and his niece Anna Nitschmann (1715-1760), who later became Count Zinzendorfs second wife; on December 2, 1741, three Moravians and one Bohemian landed in New York and on the 10th in Philadelphia; in September, 1742, five Moravian Brethren of Moravian origin arrived in Philadelphia; on December 28, 1746, Judith (Münster) Hikel of Suchdol, Moravia arrived; in June 1748 arrived in New York, destined for Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, four Moravians and two Silesians; on September 26, 1751 two Bohemians and one Moravian landed in New York; on May 27, 1752, three native Moravians reached New York; on November 20, 1752, one Moravian and two Silesians arrived in New York; in December 1752, arrived in New York one Moravian Brother from Lusatia and one from Silesia; on June 2, 1756, one Silesian landed in New York Harbor; on October 19, 1761 arrived in New York two Bohemians, seven Moravians, seven Silesians and one Lusatian; in 1765 came David Nitschmann, the “Syndicus” (1705-1779) of Suchdol, his wife Rosina (Fischer) Nitschmann, from Kunin, Joseph Neisser of Žilina, Moravia and his wife of Lusatia; and on May 18, 1770, two Moravians and two Silesians landed in New York Harbor. Altogether close to 250 arrivals were authenticated as coming from the Lands of the Bohemian Crown. Additional 100 individuals of Bohemian, Moravian or Silesian descent, whose names do not appear on the aforementioned passenger lists, were identified from the records of the graveyards of Bethlehem, Nazareth and Lititz in Pennsylvania.42 We can say with certainty that some 400 Moravian Brethren who immigrated to America came from the Czech Lands. Cultural Contributions It "is beyond the scope of this paper to delve into the numerous [pageend25]Th e Re n e w a l a n d t h e Fo r ma t io n 21 contributions made by the Moravian Brethren who emigrated from the Lands of Bohemian Crown and settled in America. The best we can do is only to highlight some of them. We have already established the fact that the majority of Moravian Brethren who constituted the first Moravian Colony in North America at Savannah, Georgia, were of Bohemian or Moravian origin. On September 28, 1741, when the first foundation stone was laid at the first permanent Moravian settlement at Bethlehem, a document, engraved on parchment by George Neisser, contained the names of fifteen individuals present at the ceremony, all of whom but four were Bohemians or Moravians. Bishop David Nitschmann, who is considered the founder of Bethlehem, officiated at the above ceremony.43 When Nitschmann’s work in Pennsylvania was completed, he went back to Europe, but later extended his labors to New York and North Carolina.44 During his lifetime he visited the many countries in Europe and the West Indies, making close to fifty sea voyages. His namesake, David Nitschmann Senior, a joiner by trade and master-builder for some years, took lead in opening the Bethlehem settlement and was one of the most influential men in town.45 He was the first of the Brethren who became a naturalized citizen of Pennsylvania and, as the first nominal “proprietor” of the estates of the Church held the title to the land; all subsequent land purchases were made in his name. Rev. George Neisser (1715-1784) of Žilina, Moravia, was the first archivist and diarist of Bethlehem, its first schoolmaster and postmaster.46 Thanks to his historical sense, we have a detailed account of the early events in Bethlehem as well as the history of the formative years of the Moravian Church, from the time of the exile of Bohemian Brethren in Hermhut to their immigration to America. Bishop Nathaniel Seidel (1718-1782), who was for twenty years the President of the American Provincial Board of Elders was a descendant of Bohemian emigrants in Silesia.47 David Zeisberger Jr., whose parents forsook their considerable estate and fled for conscience’s sake to Hermhut, after coming to America in 1738 embarked on an intensive study of Indian languages, which provided a foundation for his illustrious career among the American Indians, lasting more than sixty years.48 Zeisberger’s able assistant, John Heckewelder, of Moravian ancestry, also attained prominence as a missionary among the Indians.49 Besides his missionary labors, he was a postmaster, a justice of peace and the court of common pleas. Toward the end of his life he [pageend26]22 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l engaged in literary pursuits which led to his election to membership of the prestigious American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia. Another noteworthy man among the Moravian Brethren was David Tanneberger (1728-1804), an organ builder, bom on Count Zinzendorf s estate at Berthelsdorf.50 He was a skillful joiner, was a notably good tenor, and played the violin. He learned the organ building craft and soon became very well-known for his unique technical skills. Organs of his manufacture were in high repute and were shipped all over eastern Pennsylvania from his Lititz shop, even to such distant places as Albany, New York. The members of the Demuth family who came originally from Karlov, Moravia, were talented artists. One of their descendants, Charles Demuth (1883-1935), achieved world fame as a water-color illustrator and still-life painter. The contributions of Moravian Brethren from the Czech Lands were distinctly notable in the field of music.51 The trumpets and horns used by the Moravians in Georgia are the first evidence of Moravian instrumental music in America; Johann Boehner (1710-1785) of Zelená Hora, Moravia, is the first recorded Moravian instrumentalist. The program of music in Bethlehem was greatly stimulated by the arrival in 1761 of two talented musicians, Jeremiah Dencke (1725-1795), a Silesian, and Immanuel Nitschmann (1736-1790), a Moravian. Dencke is considered to be the composer of the earliest concerted church music known to have been written in America. The two Peter brothers, Johann Frederick and Simon, of Silesian or Moravian ancestry, had a particularly profound impact on the music life of Bethlehem. Johann Frederick Peter (1746-1813) was considered the first Moravian composer in America, having composed over 80 hymns; his string quintets are the earliest examples of chamber music in America. The American-born Johann Christian Till (1762-1844) of Bohemian/Moravian origin, who succeeded Johann Frederick Peter as organist of the Bethlehem church, was also a composer of note. Finally, a mention should be made of the de Schweinitz and Reichel families who had a great impact on the religious and cultural life of the Moravian communities in America. The two families came originally from Silesia which, as was pointed out earlier, was an integral part of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown. Conclusion [pageend27]Th e Re n e w a l a n d t h e Fo r ma t io n 23 Partly out of ignorance and partly because of Zinzendorf s personality cult, the role of the Brethren from the Czech Lands in the history of the Moravian Church, particularly in its formative years, has generally been undervalued.52 It should be clear that were it not for the apostolic zeal of Christian David, the open and hidden followers of the teachings of Jan Hus and Comenius would not have sought refuge in Saxony. Similarly, without the determination and persistent efforts of the Brethren from Bohemia and Moravia, the ancient Unitas would have never been resurrected. The pioneering spirit of these Brethren as well as their labors as missionaries around the globe in self-imposed diaspora have no analogy in history. It is also noteworthy that the number of native Moravians, Bohemians, and Silesians who immigrated to America is considerably larger than has been generally thought. It can be said that their unique cultural contributions and their broad-based imprint on the Moravian Church and the American civilization in general have been truly remarkable and everlasting.

Schattschneider If you drove to this conference through southeastern Pennsylvania, you may have noticed a sign pointing out the road to the town of Lititz. I expect that almost everyone in this audience recognized that name as referring to the ancient Bohemian estate where the village of Kunwald was located, the site of the founding of the Unitas Fratrum in 1457. Yet the “new” Lititz is in an area known for its heavily Germanic culture. This peculiarity is symptomatic of the historical relationship between the contemporary Moravian Church, or the Unity of Brethren as it is sometimes known, and the old Unitas Fratrum. The Moravian Church of today often appears to be heavily Germanic yet it claims its origins in the life of the Unitas. My task is to discuss briefly in what ways it displays continuity with the Unitas and in what ways it has changed. Continuity The very claim itself that the Moravian Church is descended from the Unitas is not accepted universally. R.R. Betts, for example, writes in reference to the Hussite movement: If it is regarded as fundamentally a religious and moral revolution, then it must be seen as enduring as long as the Hussite church retained its independence, that is until 1620, or even as a movement that still survives if, as can be reasonably done, the assumption is made that the Unity of Brethren, which has outlived persecution, proscription and exile, is an integral part of Hussitism.1 A somewhat different opinion is presented by J.K. Zeman: In contrast to the Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican and Mennonite traditions, there has been [pageend32]28 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l no continuing church body to preserve the Hussite heritage and to plead its cause in the land of its origin, or in other countries... The Moravian Church (the renewed Unitas Fratrum) traces its origin to Hermhut in 1727 but claims to be an heir to the ancient Unitas Fratrum and the Hussites. There were no organized Protestant churches in Bohemia and Moravia from about 1625 to 1780.2 In this statement Zeman has identified the first issue which needs to be dealt with when one wishes to discuss the continuity between the old Unitas Fratrum and the Moravian Church. The growth and vitality of the Unitas Fratrum in Bohemia, Moravia, Poland and elsewhere from its founding until the Battle of the White Mountain in 1620 are well known and have been the subject of considerable historical research. But what of the era from the 1620s to the 1720s? How could any institution exist for one hundred years in an unorganized way, as a virtual underground movement, as a “hidden seed,” to use Comenius’s term? The Roman Catholic Church and government authorities of the period sometimes expressed frustration over their inability to stamp out this “heresy” and thereby indirectly testified to the vitality of the movement. It was sustained in many ways. In their secret meetings held in remote locations, members of the Unitas read the Bible, scriptural commentaries and sang their own hymns. Sometimes these meetings were held close to urban areas such as in the utility sheds in the vineyards surrounding Prague. There was often traffic across the borders as Protestant clergy from Saxony, Silesia, Hungary, and Slovakia took risky secret journeys to provide the sacraments and preaching for their fellow Protestants. Sometimes members of the Unity went the other way, visiting Protestant centers beyond the borders of their own country, particularly to Lutheran churches in Silesia. When ordained clergy were not available, leadership was provided by the “brethren judges.” The structure of the Unitas provided for these lay leaders to preach and represent the pastor in emergency situations. The secret believers were also sustained by books written in the Czech language and printed in Protestant areas and then smuggled into Bohemia and Moravia: Bibles, prayer books, catechisms, and hymnbooks. The famous Bishop of the Unitas, Jan Amos Komenský (Comenius), spent most of his life in exile from his native land. But he never forgot his roots as he arranged to have books sent back, attempted to raise funds for the support of the church and, in general, did everything he could to keep alive the spirit of the Unitas. [pageend33]Un it a s Fr a t r u m 29 Sometimes a shortage of Roman Catholic priests meant that a priest would not be present in every village every Sunday and in his absence people would gather for their illegal Protestant rites. For a variety of reasons priests were sometimes lax in their duties and did not report Protestant activity even though they knew about it. The records also contain the stories of many individuals who suffered economically and physically for their adherence to the old faith. To carry on the beliefs and practices of the Unity in this era was never easy and often involved great risk of persecution. As the years passed, commitment to the Unity gradually faded in the interior of Bohemia and Moravia and remained strongest only in the border areas where foreign contacts could be maintained.3 One option which remained open to the secret adherents of the Unitas was that of emigration to friendly neighboring Protestant territory. In 1722 there began a twenty-year trail of emigrants across the border to Saxony to the estate of a young German pietist, Count Nicolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf. They were welcomed there and their numbers grew. Estimates of the exact number who went to live in the newly founded village of Hermhut vary but this town would eventually become the center of the “renewed” Moravian Church and remain so for many years. A conservative estimate places the number at about five hundred and fifty.4 By 1748 the population of Hermhut was nearly eight hundred and it is claimed six hundred and twenty five of that number were immigrants.5 Finally, it is estimated that by 1756 nearly two thousand people of Bohemian or Moravian background had joined the “renewed” Church.6 Another way to estimate their influence is to note that in the first generation of the “renewed” Church, twenty-four became clergy, including four bishops, and sixty-five became missionaries.7 The career of George Neisser may be cited as one example of the interesting mix of continuity and change which characterized the Moravian Church during the early eighteenth century’s years of transition. He was bom in Žilina, Moravia in 1715 and arrived with his parents in Hermhut in 1723. In 1735 he left Europe with the Moravians first for service in Georgia and then in Pennsylvania. He was eventually ordained and served Moravian congregations in Pennsylvania and New York City both as pastor and in many other capacities. He was an ardent supporter of the American revolution. A recent study of his life has drawn attention to [pageend34]30 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l several documents penned by him which are found among his papers in the Moravian Archives in Bethlehem. His List of Bohemian and Moravian Emigrants contains six hundred and forty-eight entries detailing the lives of persons who settled in Hermhut. The second item is also a list: it contains sixty-six dates dealing with Bohemian and Unitas history from 965 A.D. to July 4, 1776 which he noted was the American Independence day.8 His is the interesting story of a man who eagerly explored his own roots while in the midst of very active service in a revitalized version of his tradition. The role of Count Zinzendorf in the development of the “renewed” Moravian Church is a multi-faceted one which demands a paper much longer than this one. He was a charismatic leader who exercised extensive influence over the nascent fellowship until his death in 1760. That is, of course, an ex post facto judgement since for the first five years of Hermhut’s existence not even he was sure all the time about what was going on. The struggle was between whether there would develop a truly revitalized Unitas Fratrum or a renewal fellowship within the Lutheran state church. The situation was fraught with personality clashes and legal problems and it was not until the 1740s that the final form of the contemporary Moravian Church began to emerge clearly. The struggle was highlighted by a series of spiritual renewal experiences in the summer of 1727. After that summer the immigrants and the native Germans felt themselves bound together in a unique manner and ready to move on to carry out their understanding of God’s will for their new fellowship. Eventually this emerging denomination would be heavily influenced by the German Pietist movement and would also develop its unique form of community organization which would last until the 1840s. Yet it is interesting to note the points which continued to be found in this new form. In May of 1727 Zinzendorf and several of his associates drew up a set of forty-two laws which would govern community life in Hermhut. In July Zinzendorf read for the first time Comenius’s Ratio Disciplinae, that famous account of the church order of the Unity. He was struck with the similarity between this document and the rules the Hermhutters had adopted two months earlier. Here indeed was a living link with the past.9 The strongest institutional link between the Unity and the contemporary Moravian Church is its clerical orders. The first bishops of [pageend35]UMÍTÁŠ F RATRUM 31 the Unity were consecrated in 1467. By 1735 the situation within the “renewed” Church was confused. While those Moravians who remained in Europe might avail themselves of the services of the state church clergy, what about the missionaries who had been going forth from 1732 on? The need for separate Moravian clerical orders was emerging. So it was that the immigrant David Nitschmann, whose election was sanctioned by the lot, was sent to Berlin to be consecrated a bishop. The officiating bishop was Daniel Ernst Jablonský, the Reformed court preacher, who was also the grandson of Comenius and a Bishop of the Unitas Fratrum. Unity Bishop Christian Sitkovius of Thom, Poland sent approval of this action by letter. Thus the episcopacy was transferred from the Unity to the “renewed” Moravian Church. In 1745 the Church adopted all the ecclesiastical offices of the Unity: bishop, co-bishop, presbyter, deacon, and acolyte though it dropped the office of co-bishop in 1775.10 The Moravian Church would not reappear in an institutional form in the lands of its origin until the late nineteenth century. The Protestant Patent of 1861 permitted foreign evangelical churches to begin work in the Austro-Hungarian empire. Beginning in 1862 the Moravians at first worked as evangelists within existing Lutheran and Reformed congregations. The first Moravian congregation was established at Potštejn, Bohemia, on October 16, 1870 under the pastoral leadership of Eugen Schmidt, himself a descendant of Moravian refugees. The denomination gradually grew and received state recognition in 1880. There was dramatic growth during the nationalistic “Away from Rome” movement in the first years of the Republic. In 1921 the Ministry of Education recognized the claim of the Moravian Church to be the successor to the Unitas Fratrum, or Jednota bratrská, and legally restored its use of that name. By 1935 Jednota bratrská was an independent Province within the world family of Moravian Church Provinces.11 The Czech Moravians would suffer many difficulties during the World War II era and the years that followed, including our times. In 1988 the Province reported it had seventeen congregations with a total membership of 4,568; it was noted that while the total membership in the Province is steadily decreasing, the number of young people visiting worship services and Bible studies is increasing in some congregations. There is hope, the report concludes, in the growing interest among young people in the Bible and church life.12 [pageend36]32 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l A specific point of continuity between the Unitas Fratrum and the modem Moravian Church may be found in the hymn tradition of the denomination. The role of congregational singing in the Unitas is well known and that tradition has not disappeared. The 1960 hymnal of the Continental (or western European) Province of the Church cites five hymnals of the Unitas published between 1531 and 1661 as sources for some of the tunes found on its pages.13 In 1969 the American Moravian Church produced a hymnal containing fifteen hymn texts and fifteen hymn tunes from the Unitas.14 This book is currently under revision and it is expected that the new hymnal will also contain materials of Hussite origin. Finally, one may note a major theological emphasis which provides an enduring continuity within Moravian Church history. As expressed by a German Moravian theologian nearly thirty years ago, “the Brethren never thought of themselves as the Church, neither in the time of the old nor in the time of the renewed Unity. They knew they were only a part of the Church of Christ, in her totality invisible to the human eye, but present in all churches which call upon the Lord Jesus.”15 The ecumenical openness of the Unity throughout its history is the practical consequence of this theological insight. Change The elements of continuity between the Unitas Fratrum and the “renewed” Moravian Church are many. They were most strongly apparent in the transitional time of the early to mid-eighteenth century. They have become somewhat less obvious in our day due to changes in the subsequent history of the modem Moravian Church. Three areas of change have been particularly important. The Unitas was classical in its approach to theology. It laid a heavy emphasis upon carefully stated creedal formulations of its faith. While it never held any one of these to be an absolute-for-all-time expression of Christian belief, it did value this approach to the expression of theological truth.16 The “renewed” Church developed within the milieu of German Pietism. While the Pietists did not deny the validity of creedal formulations, they placed their main emphasis upon the religious experience of the believer. Theological truth was vindicated in the reality [pageend37]Un it a s Fr a t r u m 33 of the Christian’s experience and life, not in correctly formulated doctrinal statements. Even community organization such as the so-called choir system was developed to foster positive religious experience. Creeds became secondary. As a practical result, the Moravian Church even to this day has never fully integrated the creedal tradition of the Unitas into its current theological work. This is a task which awaits its fulfillment in the future. Although the “renewed” Church accepted the transfer of the episcopacy from the Unitas, it has radically altered the nature of that office. In the Unitas the functional model of the bishop was the Roman Catholic one with the exception that Unitas bishops were elected by their lay and clerical peers rather than appointed from above. But they worked as diocesan administrators. By 1735, when Nitschmann was consecrated the first bishop of the “renewed” Church, the broad outlines of a conferential form of Church government were already in place. The practical question was: what is the bishop to do? Over the years the function of ordination has been reserved to the bishops, as it was in the Unitas. but they are not administrators by virtue of office. They may be administrators but they are more likely to be local pastors. Tradition has assigned them two more general duties: to be a “pastor to the pastors” and to be committed to intercessory prayer and concern for the work of the Church as a whole. These are significant departures from the understanding of the episcopal office in the Unitas. Finally, the “renewed” Church has developed an ethnic and racial pluralism far beyond anything ever experienced by the Unitas. Members of the original Hermhut community were indeed Bohemians, Moravians and Germans but they soon moved out into other European countries. In 1732 they sent missionaries to black slaves in the West Indies. By 1735 they were in America and three years later they were establishing themselves in England. In subsequent years they have continued to move to other parts of the world. By the mid-twentieth century it was possible to speak of virtually autonomous Provinces of the Church scattered around the world voluntarily joined together in a federation called the Moravian Unity. Delegates from each of these Provinces attend a Unity Synod every seven years. The last Unity Synod was held in 1988 on the Caribbean island Antigua. Delegates were present from nineteen Provinces, representing eighteen nationalities, coming from twenty-four different [pageend38]34 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al countries. With its membership of a little over half a million, the Moravian Unity today may actually be smaller than the Unitas was at its peak membership, but it has evolved into a true world fellowship. And it carries its continuities from the Unitas Fratrum with it throughout the world. NOTES 1. Reginald R. Betts, Essays in Czech History (London: University of London, 1969) 129. 2. Jarold K.

[pageend39]Music of the American Moravians: First Tradition Thomas Sovik Central Europe served as the intellectual battlefield upon which the theoretical and practical traditions of the Latin West and the Byzantine- Slavic South and East were molded. Nonetheless, contemporary Western research has focused almost exclusively on the traditions of countries with languages of Germanic or Italic origin. What distinguishes the place of the Czechs in the history of music theory, and what distinguishes the impact of the Czechs upon the development of Western music, is that the pre- Hermhut traditions of the Czechs have been virtually ignored by Western musicologists. The Unitas Fratrum: Forerunner of the Moravian Church1 Organized insurrection against the Catholic Church in Bohemia began in 1391, culminating in 1419 with the establishment of the Czech National Utraquist Church — the first national church to be independent of Roman authority. The Unitas Fratrum, or Jednota bratrská (Brotherly Union), was an austere Protestant sect of the Utraquist Church; forerunner of the contemporary Moravian Brethren Church, the pacifist Unitas Fratrum was an active force in Bohemia-Moravia between 1457 and 1620. Although the 1508 Catholic Mandate of St. James demanded that all writings of the Unitas be burned and made the printing of new works a punishable offense, the Czech “heretics” flourished in rural areas. Between 1500 and 1510 the Unitas owned three of the country’s five printing presses; during the first decade of the century the Unitas was responsible for 50 of the 60 works printed in Bohemia-Moravia; by 1517, at the beginning of the Lutheran Reformation, it could boast a membership of over 200,000 followers. The sect published 11 monophonic hymnals, a complete Bible in the Czech language, a Czech grammar, and a Czech speller; Jan [pageend40]36 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l Blahoslav and Václav Solín, clerics of the Unitas, authored the only music treatises known to have been written by Czech Protestants during the Renaissance-Reformation. The oldest among union churches, the Moravian Brethren rose in opposition to the Catholic Church more than a century before Martin Luther attained immortality at the north portal of the Wittenberg Schlosskirche; at the outbreak of the Thirty Years’ War, armies of the Catholic Counter-Reformation nearly annihilated the pacifist Unitas. Much of the recorded history of its first tradition was destroyed outright in an attempt to purge the Czech kingdom of its heretics; much of what has survived into the twentieth century remains uncatalogued or has been “unavailable” to Western scholars. The bulk of Western research has centered upon either the long- continuing tradition of a German-Catholic polyphony in Prague, or the second tradition of the Brethren — a “Czech” Protestant movement that was revived in 1722 at Hermhut. This latter emphasis has resulted, at least in part, from researchers being able to work with German, rather than Czech, language sources; in turn, this accent has led “Moravian worship music” to be epitomized by the Liebesmahl (Love Feast) and Singstunde (Song Hour). What is little understood is that the structure and style of this music is not “Moravian” and that only a remote artistic relationship exists between the sixteenth-century Moravian Unitas Fratrum and the refugee society that was revived in Saxony and then transplanted to the New World in missionary outreach. The harmony, color, texture, and text of the American Moravians is decidedly German-Protestant. At what point in history, then, and to what degree, can the adjective “Moravian” be applied to the music of the Czech-Moravian people? The Treatises of Jan Blahoslav and Václav Solín Of particular interest to the music community are the activities of Bishop Jan Blahoslav (1523-1571). In addition to translating the New Testament into Czech and editing and publishing two editions of the Unitas’s hymnal, Písně chval božských (Songs Praising God), Blahoslav wrote the first music treatise in the Czech language.2 Although no copy of the 1558 edition of Blahoslav’s Musica has survived, at least two copies [pageend41]Music o f t h e Ame r ic a n Mo r a v ia n s 37 of the 1569 reprint remain extant in the National Museum Library in Prague.3 Attached to this reprint of the original edition are two supplements: “Some instructions necessary for those who wish to sing well” and “Teachings necessary for those who wish to compose songs.” Here, in Books II and III, Blahoslav augments his earlier instruction with remarks pertaining to conducting (e.g., the cantor’s management of the choir, physical arrangement of choir singers, use of the baton), pronunciation of the Czech language, and manners of text-setting the Czech language. No discussion of Blahoslav’s Musica would be complete without discussion of the 1561 Muzika of Václav Solin.4 Little is known about Solin (1527-1566); he is primarily remembered for having collaborated with Blahoslav on the printing of the 1561 and 1564 hymnals. One incomplete copy of Solin’s Muzika remains extant, also held by the National Museum Library.5 The separated portion of this volume had evidently been reattached at some point, as evidenced by a significant layer of yellowish paste that remains on the inside spine following the last existing page of text; unfortunately, the end of chapter 8, chapters 9 and 10, and the errata were at one point also separated and are now lost. It is not surprising that the Muzika of Solin, which followed its predecessor by only three years, is nearly identical in scope and purpose to the Musica of Blahoslav. Because all publications of the Unitas had been banned, we know with relative certainty that Blahoslav and Solin were writing only for members of their sect; because the worship music of the Unitas did not progress beyond vocal monophony (unison singing), a limited discussion of musica practica was all that was required for training laymen to read those service melodies that were unfamiliar to them. The applicable fundamentals of unison singing are amply discussed and illustrated by both Blahoslav and Solin; the theoretical justifications, mathematical ratios, and complex proportions of musica theorica are left aside. The single surviving copy of Solín’s Muzika, proven by handwriting analyses of the glosses (Müller 1892, Hostinský 1896, Dolanský 1901) to be Blahoslav’s personal copy, is heavily edited with marginal notes. These glosses range in substance from theoretical corrections and explanations to the comparison of particular observations to “ničemné psí kousky” [pageend42]38 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l (frivolous dog droppings). Were the glosses a personal attack on the author (Solin) by a jealous rival (Blahoslav)? In his monumental study Jan Blahoslav a Jan Josquin (1896) Otakar Hostinský provides substantial fact and inference to support the hypothesis that the glosses were written during a period of intense anger; indeed, Blahoslav may have been the reason that Solin’s manuscript is now incomplete, having tom it apart in a moment of rage. The Šamotulský kancionál During the synod of 1555 the Elders of the Unitas Fratrum decided that the 1541 hymnal, currently in use, should be newly arranged and printed; all copies had been sold out for some time and those held by many congregations were heavily worn. A committee of three was appointed to retain, alter, or exclude compositions contained in the current hymnal, and to select for inclusion other works composed by members of the sect; Blahoslav, because of his university music studies in Wittenberg (1544-45), was assigned the role of music editor. The new hymnal could not be printed in pro-Catholic Bohemia, or even in Protestant-tolerant Moravia, without grave danger. Poland, although predominantly a Catholic country, was much more tolerant of Protestant activities, and it was here, in 1559, at Šamotuly castle, at the printing press of the Unitas’s immigrant Alexander Aujezdecký, that the opportunity for publication of the hymnal arose.6 The committee had already worked on the hymnal for four years; the Elders decided that it was to be printed in its present state of revision. It appears, however, that Blahoslav continued to edit and correct the selected material even in Šamotuly, thereby delaying the printing of the hymnal. In 1560 the Elders sent Václav Solin to take charge of the printing. It is suspected that friction developed between Blahoslav and Solin over the sharing of responsibilities, and because Solin was probably not able to give full consideration to all literary and musical “corrections” deemed necessary by Blahoslav. The animosity between Blahoslav and Solin during the printing of the hymnal appears to have intensified with Solin’s preparation of the second Czech-language version of Muzika — a manual whose many examples would be drawn from the soon-to-be published Šamotulský kancionál (The [pageend43]Music o f t h e Ame r ic a n Mo r a v ia n s 39 Šamotuly Hymnal) and a work that would thereby overshadow Blahoslav’s manual, published only three years earlier. A comparison of the Musica of Blahoslav and the Muzika of Solin does much to justify Blahoslav’s indignation. Although it appears that he borrowed heavily from the treatise of Jan Blahoslav, Solin does not mention Blahoslav by name in his Muzika, referring his readers, instead, only to the “first Czech Musica.”1 Solin constructs his arguments and examples after the same models employed by Blahoslav; Solin omits identical, essential pieces of information; Solin uses identical, unprecedented Czech translations of Latin terms. The Šamotulský kancionál was published in June 1561; Solin’s Muzika was published in November 1561. In the Muzika, hymn-examples are referenced according to their placement in the Šamotulský kancionál, only someone who had actively participated in the publication of the hymnal could have so quickly drafted such a Muzika. One might well speculate that Blahoslav viewed Solin as not only the usurper of his editorship, but as the rival author who lessened the stature and marketability of his Musica. The Šamotulský kancionál, containing 735 songs in the Czech language, was completed in June 1561; the second edition, the Ivančický kancionál (The Ivančice Hymnal), appeared in 1564. Using a pedagogical approach that made the hymnal accessible to members who did not read music, 285 hymns are given only in text, with indications that these are to be sung to particularly well-known melodies. It should be noted that the Unitas understood the expression “píseň skládat” (to compose a song) to mean “to attach words to a preexisting melody.” (This type of “pragmatic composition” is often discussed as an innovative characteristic of the much-later Lutheran Reformation; also discussed as a “Lutheran” innovation is the practice of congregational worship singing in the vernacular language, a practice that had been instituted by Jan Hus at Prague’s Betlémská kaple as early as 1401.) Published as a companion work to the Šamotulský kancionál is Blahoslav’s Rejstřík (Register). Here, Blahoslav identifies the composers of 527 hymns contained in the hymnal; no such identification is found in the Kancionál itself, a purposeful omission that was not uncommon in Unitas and other Protestant hymnals of the era. In Rejstřík and in supplementary writings, Blahoslav provides a wealth of hymnologic [pageend44]40 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al information that otherwise would have been lost within a few generations. It is, for example, a fairly uncomplicated process to demonstrate that the Unitas’s hymn “Slovo syn Boží jediný, bez počátku” — appearing in the Šamotulský kancionál of 1561 — was to later reappear in Moravian hymnbooks as “Das ewige Wort, der wahre Gott.” It is Blahoslav, however, who identifies this hymn tune as the secular melody “Little Blue Bird on a Green Branch.” The Transmission of Thought and Practice Wittenberg served as a focal point for religious as well as musical activity during the sixteenth century; as the seat of a newly established university (1502) and as the starting point of Luther’s Reformation, the city became an important junction for German-Protestant and Czech- Protestant musicians. It is not surprising that the Elders of the Unitas Fratrum sent many of its novitiates to study in Wittenberg. Before the German and Swiss reformations, the Czech “heretics” could not find non-Catholic universities abroad, and the Unitas viewed the mainstream Czech Utraquists at the university as being as “impure” as the Catholics. In the mid-sixteenth century one could make the 450-kilometer river journey from Prague to Wittenberg in 12 days; upon arrival, the student could attend the lectures of Martin Luther and Philip Melanchton and exchange ideas with Protestants whose beliefs were very close to those of the Unitas. A number of now-famous theorists are known to have been active in Wittenberg during the years 1544-45, and Blahoslav likely came into contact with them during his study abroad. Hermann Finck matriculated at the university in 1545; Adrianus Petit Coclico, who later claimed to have studied with Josquin Desprez, is likewise first mentioned in the register of the university in 1545.8 In his Musica, Blahoslav recommends the treatises of two theorists, Coclico and Finck and, indeed, much of Blahoslav’s information and many tables and examples are taken from the Compendium musices (1552) of Coclico and the Practica musica (1556) of Finck. Likewise, Blahoslav draws material from the Musicorum libri quatuor (1512) of Václav Philomathes.9 [pageend45]Music o f t h e Ame r ic an Mo r av ian s 41 What can be reported with assurance about Philomathes is surprisingly little. Despite the authenticated use of Philomathes’s Musiconm by musicians in sixteenth-century Austria, Bohemia, Moravia, and Germany, despite the fact that the Musicorum was the most widely used music treatise in sixteenth-century Poland, and despite the fact that 15 extant copies from the six published editions attest to the sixteenth-century popularity of the Musicorum, the life and work of Philomathes receives no biographical entry in the 20-volume New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians (1980). What is known about Václav Philomathes is that he was bom in Jindřichův Hradec in southern Bohemia in the later portion of the fifteenth century, that he matriculated at the University of Vienna in 1510, and that in 1512 he published his Musicorum libri quatuor in Vienna. Philomathes’s Musicorum went through six editions, spanning the years 1512 to 1544. Georg Rhau, himself a well-known musician and perhaps the most influential of Reformation publishers, evidently thought a great deal of the Musicorum. He quoted extensively from the work in his own Enchiridion utriusque musicae practical, he wrote an introduction to the 1534 edition of the Musicorum; he published the Musicorum in 1518 in Leipzig (during his university tenure as professor of music theory) and again in 1534 in Wittenberg; in 1538 he published a Scholia, authored by Martin Agricola, of Philomathes’s Musicorum. The Musicorum of Philomathes is quite unlike the treatises of Blahoslav and Solin in terms of scope and purpose. The Musicorum of Philomathes is of a Catholic, rather than a Protestant-Unitas Fratrum, tradition; its subject is polyphonic (multivoiced), rather than monophonic (unison), composition; it is written in an academic Latin hexameter for use at the university rather than in the vernacular prose for use in simple parish schools; its use was not restricted to a single religious sect; its dissemination was not restricted to a single publisher or geographic area. The six different editions of Philomathes’s Musicorum present interesting variations, not only in type, style and spelling as one might expect, but also in regard to the musical examples. Some examples appear only in earlier editions while others appear only in later editions; some disappear only to later reappear, as if the inclusion of particular examples was at the whim of the particular publisher. What is invariable, however, is the poetic text in which the Musicorum is set. [pageend46]42 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al The writing style of Philomathes’s Musicorum, Latin hexameter, was not uncommon in music treatises of the period; printed books were expensive and beyond the financial reach of most; academic instructions were often printed in this cryptic, metrical, rhyming format so that a student could more easily learn to recite passages from memory — a few brief words related to the topic being all that was necessary to remind the student of the master’s instruction. Just as the Muzika of Solin is inseparable from the Musica of Blahoslav, so, too, does the Musicorum (1512) of Philomathes have a companion volume in its Scholia in musicam planam Venceslai Philomathes (1538), authored by the Silesian theorist and choirmaster Martin Agricola.10 The Scholia of Agricola, intended for use by students in Agricola’s Magdeburg Lateinschule, provides a wonderful opportunity for twentieth- century scholars to understand the music theory of the sixteenth century from a unique sixteenth-century perspective. Agricola’s prose commentary on the musico-poetry of Philomathes is a rare completion, clarification, and reexplanation of one sixteenth-century theorist by another sixteenth- century theorist. Philomathes’s cryptic hexameter is, to be sure, difficult to understand for one who has not attended the expository lectures of the master; where Philomathes provides a four- to six-line discussion, Agricola repeats the passage and follows with two or three pages of commentary. The Musicorum of Philomathes is heavily illustrated (albeit inconsistently so between editions) with musical examples; the Scholia of Agricola contains no musical examples, as if the student would have held the Musicorum of Philomathes in his left hand while holding the Scholia of Agricola in his right. This is, in fact, the arrangement proposed by theory-historians who have previously discussed the Scholia of Agricola. This view, however, is incorrect. A simple comparison easily demonstrates that the musical examples referred to by Agricola, in his Scholia of Philomathes’s Musicorum, are not the musical examples found in Philomathes’s Musicorum. Because of the widespread popularity of the Musicorum, and because Blahoslav was a well-educated, well-read, and well-traveled scholar-musician who had probable contact with Martin Agricola, Georg Rhau, and possibly Philomathes himself, it seems unlikely that either the Musicorum of Philomathes or the Scholia of [pageend47]Music o f t h e Ame r ic an Mo r av ian s 43 Agricola would have escaped Blahoslav’s attention. Perhaps it was Georg Rhau who introduced Blahoslav to the works of Philomathes and Agricola. Two editions of Philomathes’s Musicorum (1518 and 1534) and Agricola’s Scholia (1538) were published by Rhau; Blahoslav studied in Wittenberg (1544-45) during the period in which Rhau served as town councillor (1541-48). Blahoslav had a keen interest in publishing (establishing his own printing shop in Ivančice in 1564); it was not uncommon for Wittenberg students to be employed in Rhau’s publishing house as they pursued theological studies at the university. Agricola moved to Magdeburg in 1519 and remained there until his death in 1556. Blahoslav may have met Agricola in 1556, shortly before the latter’s death and at a time when Blahoslav was almost certain to have been working on a draft of his Musica, published two years later. Perhaps Agricola brought the Musicorum of Philomathes to Blahoslav’s attention if the work was as yet unknown to him; it seems probable that a meeting with Agricola would have made Blahoslav aware of at least Agricola’s commentary on Philomathes’s Musicorum. The question of whether Blahoslav actually met Philomathes cannot be answered with assurance, although Blahoslav may have been introduced to the somewhat older Philomathes by an intermediary. Blahoslav met Beneš Optat in Přerov in or about 1550;11 Optat had co-authored, with Philomathes, the Etymológia (1533) — the Czech grammar Blahoslav would later use in preparing his own Grammatika česká (1571). Did Jan Blahoslav rely upon either the Musicorum of Václav Philomathes or the Scholia of Agricola in the preparation of his Musical In the case of Philomathes’s Musicorum, the confirmation may be documented by the fact that Blahoslav took his tables to illustrate the differences between cantus durus, cantus mollis, and cantus fictus directly from the 1534 edition of the Musicorum. No such evidence has been found, however, that would categorically associate the Musica of Blahoslav and the Scholia of Agricola. Did Václav Solin have any knowledge of Philomathes’s Musicoruml Solin is, unfortunately, silent about those sources from which he drew information for his Muzika. An analysis of the treatise provides no evidence to demonstrate that its author knew the Musicorum of Philomathes or the Scholia of Agricola. [pageend48]44 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l Conclusion Through a study of the treatises of Blahoslav and Solin it is possible to understand the musica practica of the Unitas Fratrum prior to the Battle of White Mountain on November 8, 1620; through a study of the treatises of Agricola, Coclico, Finck, and Philomathes, it is possible to understand the musical practice of the Catholic and Lutheran traditions, both within Germany and within the Czech kingdom, that impacted upon the Unitas’s musicians.12 Evaluation of the treatises of Blahoslav and Solin reveals that no new musical system was proposed by the Unitas. Yet, as the first two treatises published in the Czech language, and as the only treatises published by Czech-Protestants during the entire Renaissance-Reformation, these treatises are significant because they prove a musical interaction between the theorists of Bohemia-Moravia and those of Wittenberg. These treatises shed light upon the relatively unexplored music and music theory of Protestant Bohemia-Moravia during the sixteenth century and, in combination with the Unitas hymnals, represent a genre of Czech- Moravian music that is truly “Moravian.” Further, the Musica of Blahoslav and the Muzika of Solin are significant in that they, in association with contemporary “mainstream” treatises, demonstrate that the development of music in the Czech kingdom remains inseparable from the development of music in Central Europe, and that the development of music in Central Europe remains inseparable from the development of Western music.

Six of Blahoslav’s works are known with certainty to have been published during his lifetime; Spíš o zraku (1550), the first spelling primer of the Czech language, Slabikář český (1551?); Musica (1558 and 1569 editions), Písně chval božských Šamotulský kancionál 1561 and Ivančický kancionál 1564), Nový zákon (1564 and 1568 editions), and Evangelia (1571). 3. Jan Blahoslav, Musica, to jest knížka zpěvákům náležitě zprávy v sobě zavírající, 2nd ed. (Ivančice, Moravia: Jednota bratrská, 1569). 4. Václav Solín is better known by the pseudonym Jan Josquin. Although the name “Josquin” is not of Czech origin, the use of that pseudonym in 1561 by a Czech author of relatively insignificant stature comes as no surprise. It is well documented in musicological studies of the Renaissance that numerous musicians took advantage of the widespread popularity of Josquin Desprez in promoting their own credibility. Over 40 “Josquins” are known to have been active in the century following Desprez’s death, including at least five in the Czech kingdom. A number of Czech historians have advanced possible identifications of Jan Josquin, many without support of academic investigation. For a biographical study, see note 1. 5. Jan Josquin, Muzika, to jest zpráva k zpívání náležitá, všechněm zpěvům se učiti Žádostivým ku požitku (Prostějov, Moravia: Jednota bratrská, 1561). Possibly a second copy is in the Herzogliche Bibliothek at Wolfenbuttel, West Germany. 6. Before the end of 1562 the equipment used by Alexander Aujezdecký to print the Šamotulský kancionál had been purchased and brought to Ivančice (the seat of Blahoslav’s bishopric) from Poland. For security purposes, the equipment was installed in the building that served as the Unitas Fratrum parsonage, with the actual printing and binding of materials performed by students of the school. The location of the illegal printing shop in southern Moravia was a closely guarded secret. At least two works, Nový zákon (1564) and Musica (1569, 2nd ed.) bear the Latin arcanum “in insula hortensi” (at the island among the gardens) as the place of publication. This was the assumed name, among the Unitas, for the town of Ivančice. In 1578 the printing equipment was moved from Ivančice to the estate of Jan Žerotín Králický; in 1620 Králice was overrun by Catholic forces. The printing equipment was moved to Náměšť nad Oslavou and, eight years later, to Lissa (Leszno) in Poland. The equipment was destroyed in 1665 in the great fire of Lissa. 7. It is unclear whether this omission should be attributed to the personal conflict raging between Blahoslav and Solín or to the fact that Blahoslav’s treatise was probably so well-known within his religious circle that a citation of the author’s name was unnecessary. 8. If Blahoslav had not met Coclico in Wittenberg, the two may have met in Königsberg. Before Easter 1549 Blahoslav was once again sent to study abroad, this time to the newly established university at Königsberg. Coclico matriculated at the university in September 1547, remaining in the city until 1550 when his housekeeper bore him an illegitimate son. 9.

In a letter to Zacharias, dated in Přerov 15 July 1551, Blahoslav states that Optat’s translation of the New Testament into Czech was based on Erasmus’s Latin translation (which was printed alongside the Greek). For a reproduction of this letter see Blahoslav, Grammatika česká, pp. vii-x. We do not know, however, to what extent Blahoslav depended on Optat’s translation for his translation of the New Testament from Greek, to what extent Blahoslav depended on Erasmus’s Greek translation, or if Blahoslav knew that Erasmus was dissatisfied with his own Greek translation, considering it to be “precipitated rather than edited.” See Roland Bainton, Erasmus of Christendom (New York: Scribner’s, 1969) 133; taken from Erosmi Epištole III, p. 117. 12. Several other treatises, authored by Czech Catholics or German nationals working in Bohemia-Moravia, warrant investigation.

[pageend51]The Moravian Brethren Unitas Fratrum and American Indians in the Northwest Territory Stanley J. Marsik During the time preceding the American War of Independence, the territory west and north of the Ohio River was still in the Indian domain. It was occupied and ruled by various tribes whose members were themselves relatively recent immigrants to the area. They were Miamis, Shawnees, Delawares, Wyandots, Mingoes and Ottawas as well as Iroquois. All of them, either separately or collectively, disputed possession of the land they occupied with the French and/or British. Today’s East-Central portion of Ohio — the region the Tuscarawas, Walhonding and Muskingum Rivers — was at that time the center of Delaware Indian activity. Originally an Eastern tribe, the Delawares were being steadily pushed northward and westward by advancing colonization. Their settlement in the area was symbolized by the establishment of their capitol at Gekelemukpechunk, the present-day Newcomerstown. Advancement of Western civilization was always accompanied by efforts to convert the natives to Christianity. Since the New World provided a refuge for those persecuted at home for various beliefs, it could have been expected that the natives in this part of the world would be subjected to conversion efforts from many directions. However, in the early days of the colonization of North America, no religious group attempted to spread the gospel among the Indians. Perhaps the new settlers had been too preoccupied with the defense of their own distinctive beliefs in their new environment and thus had no interest in attempting to implant their own faith to the red men. It was not until the arrival of the Moravian Brethren missionaries that the native Americans began to receive more than cursory attention from the numerous religious sects occupying or sharing their land. The Moravian Brethren settlers who came to America from Europe [pageend52]48 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al during the first half of the eighteenth century belonged to the oldest Protestant Episcopal Church, still in existence today. They trace their beginnings to the year 1457 when the followers of Jan Hus, in southern Bohemia, under the spiritual leadership of Petr Chelčický, established the Church of the United Brethren — the Unitas Fratrum. It was a reformed church, sixty years ahead of Luther’s Reformation and preceding the establishment of the Church of England by more than a century. Following a relatively short period of prosperity in Bohemia and Moravia, the Unitas Fratrum was almost destroyed during the Thirty Years’ War. Those followers unwilling to renounce the Church were forced out of the country and found refuge in Poland, Silesia, Hungary, Holland and England as religious exiles. Among those who left his native land was Jan Amos Komenský (Comenius), an ordained minister, who formed a direct link between the original and the renewed Church of the United Brethren. The renewal commenced early in the eighteenth century and since the church has been commonly called the Moravian Brethren. When Comenius left his country in 1627, he fell upon his knees and prayed that God would not altogether remove His Gospel from Moravia and Bohemia, but still preserve for Himself a “seed.”1 Recognized as one of the most learned men of his time, Comenius was consecrated by the dispersed Brethren from Bohemia and Moravia in 1632, and from 1648 to 1671 he held the office of a senior bishop and president of the Synod. Comenius was deeply concerned about the preservation of religious worship and about the continuation of a valid ministry and episcopacy on the part of the dispersed Brethren. His concern was shared by his colleague John Büttner. Together, they conducted a search for new leaders and their choice finally fell upon Nicholas Gertichius to oversee the congregation in Poland, and upon Petr Jablonský from Bohemia to oversee the dispersed Brethren from Bohemia and Moravia. The two designees were consecrated as bishops in 1662. Jablonský, who as a youngster had emigrated with Comenius, became his son-in-law; his son Daniel was chosen to succeed him upon his death in 1670.2 The “hidden seed” Comenius prayed for at the time of his departure from his native land was preserved in several places. Perhaps the “healthiest” place was in north-eastern Moravia. Fresh persecution at the beginning of the eighteenth century once again drove the pious Brethren from this area into exile. They were given asylum by Count Nicolaus [pageend53]Th e Mo r av ian Br e t h r e n Un it as Fr at r u m 49 Ludwig von Zinzendorf on his estate in Saxony. In 1722 the town of Hermhut was built for the protection of the Brethren from Moravia. The “hidden seed” then sprouted here and sprang vigorously into new life, so that within a few years the missionaries of the reconstituted Unitas Fratrum were carrying the Gospel to many parts of the world. It was through the grandson of Comenius, Daniel Jablonský, that the succession of the bishopric of the “ancient” Unitas Fratrum was transferred to the “reconstituted” Unitas Fratrum (Moravian Brethren). In 1735 David Nitschmann, bom in Suchdol near Nový Jičín in Moravia, was consecrated as the first bishop of the Moravian Brethren by Daniel Jablonský, assisted by the bishop for the Polish Brethren, Christian Sitkovius.3 One of Bishop Nitschmann’s responsibilities was to oversee the early movement of the Moravian Brethren missionaries to the New World. By 1735 a few Moravians had come to America not only to establish a retreat for their Brethren who might be forced out of Europe but, more importantly, to bring the message of salvation to the natives of the New World. The Brethren came to America with great philanthropic aspirations — to love the Indians as brothers, to teach them Christian ethics, agriculture, craft techniques, hygiene and not least, participatory civil government. Having themselves been the victims of Old World religious persecutions, the Moravians found it for a long time particularly rewarding to be able to inculcate their own economic, social and religious beliefs without having to resort to crippling harassment. By the middle of the eighteenth century the Moravian Brethren in America had established their headquarters in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, from where they began leapfrogging westward to carry the Gospel of the Cross. The initial contact of these new missionaries with the Northwest Territory, mostly in today’s Ohio, occurred in the early 1760s, when Christian Frederick Post and John Heckewelder attempted to bring the Gospel to the Delawares in the Tuscarawas River Valley. In the year 1763, Chief Pontiac’s rebellion broke out and the missionaries left.4 Almost a decade passed before the Moravians resumed work in the Tuscarawas valley and spread from there to the North and to the West, “rounding-up” Lake Erie as well. The movement and the work of the Moravian Brethren in the Northwest Territory was comprised to a large degree by the efforts of the principal Moravian missionary among the [pageend54]50 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al Delawares, the Reverend David Zeisberger and several of his assistants, of whom the most notable was John Heckewelder, mentioned earlier. David Zeisberger was bom in 1721 in Suchdol, Moravia. His progenitors belonged to the “ancient” Church of the Bohemian Brethren. At the age of five David and his parents, David and Rosina Zeisberger, escaped to Hermhut, Saxony. In 1736 the senior Zeisbergers were a part of the group which accompanied Bishop Nitschmann to the New World (today’s Georgia), leaving young David in Hermhut to complete his education. In 1738, with the help of General Oglethorpe, David joined his parents in Georgia.5 The following year war broke out between England and Spain, and the Spaniards of Florida threatened to attack the Georgia colony. And so now the Moravians, just beginning to enjoy their newly-found freedom, were once again on the move. This time it was to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania where they founded a new settlement which became, and still remains, the chief seat of the Moravian Church in America. In 1743 David Zeisberger was assigned to return to Europe with Count Zinzendorf to do church work on the continent. During his short stay in America he had recognized that America presented many opportunities, possibilities, and challenges. He had become very attached to the countryside and, above all, he wanted to be associated with the Indians. He was bitterly disappointed when the elders of the Church designated him for return to Europe.6 Bishop Nitschmann, arriving to bid him farewell on board the ship, noticed David’s depression and asked him what was the matter. He was deeply impressed by reply that he “longed to be truly converted to God, and to serve Him in this country.”7 The bishop advised David to ask the elders for permission to return to Bethlehem. The decision to allow David Zeisberger to serve Christ in America was indeed a wise one. His name was to become one of the mightiest in Indian mission work. His strength of character was described by John Heckewelder as follows: “He was of a humble, meek spirit, and always thought lowly of himself. ‘Self was the least of all the considerations that occupied his mind — universal love filled his bosom.”8 Shortly after Zeisberger’s return to Bethlehem, he began to learn Indian languages, and eventually mastered two and came to understand many others.9 In February 1749 David Zeisberger was ordained to the ministry.10 In the 1750s and 1760s, following his appointment as perpetual missionary to the [pageend55]Th e Mo r av ian Br e t h r e n Un it as Fr at r u m 51 Indians by Count Zinzendorf, Zeisberger was active among the Iroquois (Six Nations) and Delawares in New York and Pennsylvania,11 at times as a missionary and at times as a peacemaker during the height of the struggle between the ancient rivals, England and France, for the control of North America. When the peace agreement between England and France was finally signed at the end of 1762, Zeisberger could again devote his time to preaching to the Indians. At this time, Chief Pontiac’s Conspiracy was in its full force. While Pontiac’s fiery eloquence was inspiring his warriors to soak their the tomahawks with the blood of white men who were invading their hunting grounds, there were also Indians who were blessing the white men who had taught them how to sing hymns in praise of the Prince of Peace. The Moravian Brethren could inspire the Indians with notions of justice, charity and honesty — principles espoused by the Indians as their own. Perhaps the most significant expression of appreciation for Zeisberger’s work was his adoption by an Indian tribe. This act of “naturalization” was consummated with due ceremony, in the presence of the Indian Chief and his council. Zeisberger was thus invested with all the rights and privileges of a Monsey. This covenant was published at the headquarters of the Delawares in Ohio as well as those of all other friendly tribes.12 The first efforts of the Moravian Brethren in Ohio, led by Frederick Post and John Heckewelder, did not meet with success. The decade of the 1770s promised to be different. Early in 1771 Zeisberger, accompanied by his Indian Brothers, reached the capital of the Delawares and the seat of their Grand Council Gekelemukpechunk, on the Tuscarawas River. There, as the guest of the Chief Netawatwees (King Newcomer) he preached the first Protestant sermon within the present state of Ohio.13 Later the same year, on Zeisberger’s recommendation, the Mission Board in Bethlehem accepted Netawatwees’ invitation to send a mission to Ohio.14 Zeisberger was designated as the principal missionary and John Heckewelder was appointed his assistant. In the early spring of 1772 Zeisberger and his party started from Friedenstadt, on the Beaver River in Pennsylvania, on an odyssey which would bring him his greatest triumphs as well as his severest trials during the next four decades. Upon his arrival in Gekelemukpechunk, Chief Netawatwees suggested that the Mission should be established at Welhik-tupeek (the “Big Spring”). “Toward noon, to our great joy, we arrived at our destination [pageend56]52 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al by the great spring, there we encamped and even on this day reared our huts for ourselves and looked over the grounds again for the most suitable place for our Town.”15 Axes, saws and planes were put to work to build a town in the shape of a cross, with the church taking the honored position in the center, with the schoolhouse to its right across the street. “God’s Acre,” the cemetery, was fenced off at the foot of the cross within sight of the church.16 Rows of graves with inscriptions on the headstones may still be seen at the site near the reconstructed village, a short distance southwest of New Philadelphia in Tuscarawas County, Ohio. The town was called Schoenbrunn (Beautiful Spring) and it boasts several firsts. It was the first Christian town in Ohio, the first Ohio settlement with white inhabitants, the location of Ohio’s first church, and the location of Ohio’s first schoolhouse.17 It was a peaceful town in an ideal location, blessed by rich farmland, with green hills on the horizon. Life was full and happy for the “transplanted” Moravian Indians from the Beaver River in Pennsylvania, as well as for those who converted to the Faith from among the Ohio Delawares. Curious Delawares from the area were attracted to watch the building of structures they had never seen before, and to watch the tilling of the land by methods they had never known. They were impressed by the acres of neat rows of com, vegetable gardens, the cleanliness of the streets and the sight of cattle kept out of residential areas by fences. Their astonishment must have been complete on a bright morning in late August of 1772 when they heard Ohio’s first mission bell ringing out through the trees. That bell rose and fell with the fortunes and misfortunes of the Moravian Brethren in the Western hinterland. Scarcely had they settled in Schoenbrunn, when Chief Netawatwees requested another mission for the Mohicans arriving with Joshua, one of the early converts and now a Moravian elder. Joshua began to build the new town at the beginning of October 1772. By the middle of the month, David Zeisberger notes in his diary: “We came to our Mohican Brethren, where I conducted the first service for them and at the same time informed them that this place shall be known as Gnadenhutten (Tents of Grace), for which they were very glad...”18 This was the fourth Moravian mission in America named Gnadenhutten, though it was not to be the last. Both missions flourished and Christmas 1772 was celebrated in two churches within a few miles of each other in the Tuscarawas [pageend57]Th e Mo r av ian Br e t h r e n Un it as Fr at r u m 53 valley. Even though the Schoenbrunn church was larger, forty feet by thirty six feet,19 the church in Gnadenhutten had its own advantages, since it provided an atmosphere of cultured refinement heretofore unknown in Ohio, as Joshua brought forth hymn tunes from his treasured spinet. It was here that the Ohio Moravian instrumental music had its beginnings.20 In addition to John Heckewelder, Zeisberger soon received assistance from new men, all named John: John Roth, John Jungmann, John Schmick, and their wives. This handful of Moravians were thus entrusted with restraining the naturally independent spirits of native Americans and were expected to provide a bridge over the wide chasm between the traditions and cultures of the white and Indian worlds. The fact that they succeeded should be, at least partially, attributed to the way they approached their task. The Moravians did not attempt to impose upon the Indians their Moravian ways. Instead, they sought to combine the best features of Indian traditions with the ideals and traditions of the Church: they desired to become the Indians’ friends and through friendship instill principles which would enrich life for each individual; they offered opportunity for education to all children as well as adults; they taught the Indians skills in food production and in various trades, which increased their industriousness; and not least, they brought another dimension to the Indians’ spiritual life through music. The message of the Moravian Brethren spread through the Delaware nation. More and more Indians and their leaders joined the missions. When the influential chief Echpalawehund, who had spent Christmas at Schoenbrunn and was subsequently baptized Peter, joined the Church, the Delawares at Gekelemukpechunk began to realize that too many “big fish” were being caught in the “Moravian net.” Almost four hundred souls, many of them renowned warriors and council members, had already been drawn to the cross. Observing that certain rules which the missionaries imposed in the missions21 appealed to the Indians, the Delawares’ Council decided to institute their own reformation. Drunkenness, gambling and other immoral behavior were prohibited; morality guards were appointed and general house-cleaning took place within their community.22 Of course, what the Council failed to realize was that these measures were only partial steps toward something much more fundamental, namely Christian principles. Echpalawehund himself assured [pageend58]54 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al his countrymen that mere token efforts would be in vain and that faith in the Lord Jesus Christ must be the beginning of a genuine reformation. “Their good intentions, like the fire of the council at which they had been adopted, flared for a little while, and then lay in a heap of dead embers.”23 In the meantime, the converts were becoming more devout. Religion grew and bore fruit. The Christians represented a powerful party in the Delaware country and soon were granted full citizenship and equality among the Delawares. This act was duly ratified by ornamental belts of wampum adorned with a white cross at one end. The act read: “From this time forward we solemnly declare that we will receive the word of God, and that the believing Indians and their teachers shall enjoy perfect liberty throughout the Indian country, with the same rights and privileges enjoyed by the Indians. The country shall be free to all, and the believers shall have their right and share in it as well as the unbelievers. Whoever wishes to go to the Brethren and to receive the Gospel, shall be at liberty to join them, and none shall hinder him. But no heathen Indians shall settle in the neighborhood of the believers.24 Chief Netawatwees was no longer living at Gekelemukpechunk. He had moved, with most of his tribe, to build a new capital at the confluence of the Tuscarawas and Walhonding Rivers, the site of today’s Coshocton. The new Delawares’ headquarters were laid out in the form of a cross, in imitation of Schoenbrunn.25 The Christian Indians’ future appeared to be safe. Still, while many Delawares were delighted and enjoyed this new communion, there were some, including the ambitious Captain Pipe, who resented it and moved away from the vicinity of the Moravian missions, heading north, toward Lake Erie. As the year 1776 approached, the missionaries had good reason to be satisfied with their progress. The chapel at Schoenbrunn could hold five hundred persons and yet it was often too small to accommodate the worshippers who flocked to their towns.26 The principal employment of the converts was growing grain and raising cattle and poultry. Their plantations covered hundreds of acres of the rich land in the valley. The traders who came to Schoenbrunn to satisfy their curiosity would tell about the fame these Christian settlements enjoyed throughout the entire Northwest Territory.27 The mission schools were about to receive a boost. Zeisberger’s Delaware-Indian and English Spelling Book was being printed in Philadelphia, a book which would greatly ease the missionaries’ [pageend59]Th e Mo r av ian Br e t h r e n Un it as Fr at r u m 55 educational tasks. Zeisberger mentions in his diary on December 4, 1775: “School was opened again for the children, giving them great joy. Bro. David and Bro. Heckewelder divided their duty of conducting the school and teaching the Indian language. As we have no books for the children, we must write some for them for the time being, a considerable task since there are nearly a hundred children, but it is worth the effort if they learn something.”28 There was also a new request by the Indian chiefs for yet another town to be built for the younger Indians and their children. A nearby site was selected, south of Coshocton. The new community was started early in the spring of 1776 and was named Lichtenau (Meadow of Light).29 Netawatwee’s grandson Gelelemand, with his six children, was one of the first to build his house there. The years 1775 and 1776 were also momentous years for the original colonies further East. Zeisberger may have heard from the traders, coming through Schoenbrunn, about the gathering storm in the Colonies. But his mind was too preoccupied by planning how to spread the Gospel, to pay any attention to the political questions of the day. Little did he realize that the gathering clouds in the eastern sky would break into a violent storm of revolt against British authority and eventually disrupt the peaceful and tranquil life of the Christians in the Tuscarawas and Muskingum valleys, forcing them to move from one location to another for the next two decades. Zeisberger and John Heckewelder may have been screening applicants for church membership when the battles of Lexington, Concord, and Bunker Hill were being fought back in Massachusetts. One of the most important issues facing the Congress at the outset of the war was the status of the Indians. Their neutrality in the upcoming conflict had to be maintained if at all possible. Negotiations of treaties were held with various tribes. While American interest was in their neutrality, the British were interested in continued Indian resistance to the Americans, which would relieve pressure on their own forces in the East. The Delawares, due to the Moravians’ influence, pledged themselves to remain neutral. This position was logical for them since their location placed them between two antagonists: American pressure from Fort Pitt (Pittsburgh) and British pressure from Fort Detroit. It must have been a comfort to Chief Netawatwees that the Indian agent at Fort Pitt, Colonel George Morgan, understood Indian tradition and exercised a benevolent [pageend60]56 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al authority, thus enjoying complete confidence of the Indians. On the other hand, at Fort Detroit, General Henry Hamilton was well-known for his liberal bounty on scalps. Under his command were Indian agents who constantly incited Indian tribes to war. They persuaded Wyandots, Shawnees and Iroquois to ally themselves with the British and then applied considerable pressure on the Delawares to abandon their neutrality as well. Moreover, Captain Pipe, who became the Chief of the Wolf tribe, feared that his ambition of becoming a great warrior would remain undiscovered if he abided by the Delawares’ position, so he also clamored for war. But the Delawares stood their ground. They were well aware that their prosperity depended on the Christian members of their nation, whose industriousness was now well-known throughout the borderland. Unfortunately for the Delawares, their influential chief Netawatwees died around the turn of the year. Constant instigation by Pipe succeeded in splitting the Delaware nation into two camps. One camp opted for neutrality although, under the leadership of Gelelemand, sided with the Americans, while the other sided with the British. With this development the Moravian Brethren entered a very difficult period. They were faced with the task of preventing the smoldering war fires from flaring up, while at the same time keeping their own work going among the Indians. The Christians and their Delaware allies pleaded eloquently for peace and for the future welfare of their nation, but their voices seemed to be drowned in the beat of the war drums. Even the successes of the Moravian Brethren — their housing, their fields, their herds of cattle, horses and hogs, their roads — seemed to turn against them, since their settlements now attracted warriors seeking provisions and shelter. There were also reports that large parties of hostile Indians were on their way to Schoenbrunn to kill all the missionaries. Zeisberger feared that all the Christians were in danger and therefore felt compelled to quit the handsomest town the Christian Indians had so far built. The entry in his dairy for April 19 states: “Bro. David conducted the early meeting, and for the last time in this church at that... Immediately after this meeting, the roof was tom off the meeting house and all kinds of other things were done to it in order to ruin it for further use.”30 The following day the Moravian Brethren evacuated the site. Abandoning Schoenbrunn and moving to Lichtenau did not bring an end to the Christian Indians’ problems. The Muskingum and Tuscarawas [pageend61]Th e Mo r av ian Br e t h r e n Un it as Fr at r u m 57 valleys remained in the direct path of the American frontiersmen as well as of the Indians loyal to the British. The missions at Gnadenhutten and Lichtenau were constantly being harassed by various war parties and raiders from both sides. These unstable and at times chaotic conditions also resulted in lack of information about the battlefields in the Colonies, where the defeats of the British continued to mount. Instead, the Delaware Indians were subjected to a propaganda barrage by the British agents Alexander McKee, Matthew Elliot, and Simon Girty, with the help of Captain Pipe and his followers. They all spread rumors that the American armies were being cut to pieces by the English troops, that the Continental Congress no longer existed and that the whole country beyond the mountains was under British control. Moreover, the Indians were told that the Americans who had escaped the British were regrouping west of the mountains for the purpose of killing all the Indians. Under these circumstances the Delaware nation was on the brink of joining the war on the side of the British. It was only John Heckewelder’s return from Bethlehem, his repudiation of the rumors, and his producing a newspaper reporting the surrender of General Burgoyne’s army to General Gates at Saratoga that persuaded the Delawares to reaffirm their commitment to neutrality.31 Nevertheless, Zeisberger now wished to have all the Christian Indians concentrated in one place for their safety. Therefore, all converts from Gnadenhutten were brought to Lichtenau. Soon after that Zeisberger regained his influence in the Council at Coshocton and the Christians were able to enjoy a few days of tranquility. At subsequent treaty negotiations conducted in Pittsburgh, the Americans gained consent to free passage through the Delaware territory and to the erection of a fort on it. In the fall of 1778 they encamped at Tuscarawas and built Fort Laurens near today’s Bolivar. These developments so infuriated Governor Hamilton in Detroit, that he demanded the head or scalp of the Delaware Chief Gelelemand as well as that of Zeisberger.32 However, before his order could be carried out, early in 1779 Fort Detroit was taken and Hamilton became a prisoner of the Americans and was taken to a prison in Williamsburg, Virginia. With the “Hair-buyer” no longer in power, the border war was subsiding. Although Zeisberger had only recently concentrated his Christians in one place, he felt that real success of the Mission required a larger number of smaller communities with smaller churches. He also believed [pageend62]58 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al that, with the renewed calm in the area, the former inhabitants of Schoenbrunn and Gnadenhutten wished to return to their favorite locations. Since Schoenbrunn itself had been devastated by the war, Zeisberger decided to build a new Schoenbrunn for the former Schoenbrunn inhabitants on the western bank of the river, across from the site of the original location. Here and at Gnadenhutten the Christians suddenly enjoyed real peace and protection. Lichtenau, where John Heckewelder remained with his congregation, was the only town where the Christians were still subjected to perturbations due to its close proximity to Coshocton. The capitol of the Delawares remained a potential source of problems. It was therefore decided to move the congregation from Lichtenau closer to Gnadenhutten and New Schoenbrunn. Its new site, near Port Washington, was called Salem.33 The Moravians experienced no interference from the outside world at these new locations. This new twist in their fate, they hoped, would finally allow them to carry on their mission of the propagation of the Gospel. The positive aspect of no outside interference was, unfortunately, outweighed by the negative aspect — lack of news and contact with the outside world. The missionaries were not aware that their old nemeses, McKee, Elliot and Girty, had not ceased plotting for their destruction, this time on a much larger scale. The plan was to remove the Moravians from the area, peacefully or forcefully.34 To carry this plan out, they engaged the services of the Wyandot Indians, led by Half-King Pomoacan, along with Captain Pipe. Neither the missionaries nor their Indian brethren could foresee that they were about to enter a period in which they would be tossed about by a series of events beyond their control, which would truly test their devotion to their Faith. Early in September 1781, almost three hundred Indian warriors led by Pomoacan and Pipe were encamped west of Gnadenhutten. Their task was the removal of the Christian Indians and their teachers from the Tuscarawas Valley. In the center of their camp, under the British flag, was the tent of Matthew Elliot who had been given the rank of captain by the British. He had come to oversee the operation and to make sure that the Indians carried out their assignment. In a council with the Christian elders and the missionaries, Pomoacan tried at first a conciliatory approach: “You live in a dangerous place. Two exceedingly mighty and wrathful gods stand [pageend63]Th e Mo r av ian Br e t h r e n Un it as Fr at r u m 59 opposed one to another with extended jaws, and you, seated between them, will be destroyed by the one or by the other, perhaps by both, and will be crushed between their teeth... Therefore I take you by the hand, lift you up, and set you where I have my lodges. There you will be safe and can dwell in peace. Do not regard your houses, fields and property. Rise up and come with me. Take you teachers along. Hold your religious councils as you are accustomed to do. You will find an abundance of provisions in my country, and our English father beyond the lake will care for you. To tell you this I have come. ”35z The Christians would not be swayed by Pomoacan’s talk, although they may have realized that their fate had already been decided. They needed at least enough time to harvest their crops. But Elliot would not wait. Seeing that the warriors themselves were delaying the action, he had the missionaries imprisoned and subjected to indignities until they agreed to his demands. For their journey to the West, the Christians were allowed to take only what they could carry, pack on their horses or place into their canoes. It was a sad departure. Zeisberger and his fellow missionaries, together with their Christian brethren, were leaving behind more than eight industrious years of their accomplishments: rich plantations, herds of cattle and hogs, and three flourishing towns with their homes with all their belongings, and their commodious houses of worship. But worse than all the material losses was the blow they suffered by being unable to continue their mission of carrying the Cross to the Indians. The independence of the Indian Christians, as recognized in their relation to the Delaware nation, and which secured them Indian rights and immunities against the other Indian tribes, was destroyed. Within a month, General Cornwallis would surrender Yorktown to General Washington, ending the war. But the rising light on the eastern horizon was hidden from their view. For three agonizing weeks the Christian Indians were herded and goaded across central Ohio to the Sandusky River. There, Pomoacan and his Wyandots left them to their fate and rode on to their town, Upper Sandusky. The Christian Indians’ immediate concern was how to secure a shelter for about four hundred people against the upcoming winter. They were short of clothing and blankets. There was no visible food supply in the area. To compound the difficulties, within two weeks of their arrival to what is known in the history of the Moravian Brethren as Captives’ [pageend64]60 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l Town, Zeisberger received a summons from the new commandant at Detroit, Major De Peyster. Zeisberger was to appear to answer charges of appraising the enemy of the British maneuvers while still in the Muskingum Valley. The charges against the Moravian missionaries were brought by none other than Captain Pipe. In Detroit, when asked by De Peyster to repeat his charges in the presence of the missionaries, Pipe reversed himself and pleaded for their release. He was willing to accept the blame for what the missionaries were accused of.36 Major De Peyster acquitted the Moravians and ordered that they be provided with extra clothing and supplies of food. He also provided them with passports which “permitted them to perform functions of our office among the Christian Indians without molestation.”37 At this time the missionaries probably did not suspect how important their victory at the court in Detroit was for their future activity. It was, perhaps, the manner in which they conducted themselves during the hearing that gained them the respect and friendship of the British authorities who still controlled most of the Indians in the area. An official recognition of their missionary work among the Indians was certainly a major milestone for them to reach. Following their return to Ohio, the missionaries as well as their converts needed all the faith they could muster. The upcoming winter of 1781-82 was unusually severe. When the famine struck in Captives’ Town, about one hundred and fifty converts secured permission to return to their fields in the Tuscarawas Valley in order to harvest some of the com they had to abandon when they were forced to move to the Sandusky River area. While the Christians were back at Gnadenhutten, Salem and New Schoenbrunn, marauding groups of Indians returning from scalping raids on the Pennsylvania border found the “needy” Christians to be a good target of their looting. The Christians could hardly suspect that some of the articles now in their possession would shortly thereafter be used as evidence against them, in what was to become one of the dark pages of early American history. The marauding raiders were closely followed by incensed American militiamen hungry for revenge. They found the Christian Indians harvesting and preparing their com for departure to the Sandusky River. At first, the militiamen pretended to be friendly and sympathetic to their efforts in providing needed supplies for their famine-stricken brethren. But when the Indians surrendered their weapons [pageend65]Th e Mo r a v ia n Br e t h r e n Un it a s Fr a t r u m 61 peacefully, they discovered the real interest of the militia. Once defenseless, they were declared murderers and thieves and told to prepare for death. Declarations of innocence and explanations of how they acquired the articles fell on deaf ears. There was nothing left for the Christians but to prepare themselves for their fate as they had been taught by their teachers. They spent the night in prayer and in singing hymns. On the morning of March 8, 1782, ninety Christian Indians — fifty six adults and thirty four children — were literally butchered to death in the cooper’s cabin. They died near their beloved church, on the scene of some of the happiest moments of their lives. Two young boys escaped by feigning their death, before the triumphant militiamen applied torches to the buildings containing the mangled corpses. Their morbid appetite not fully satisfied, the militia than marched to New Schoenbrunn to kill more Indians. However, the Christians working on the fields there were forewarned and escaped into the forest to safety. The militia had to be content only with plundering and burning the village.38 “Here triumphed in death ninety Christian Indians March 8, 1782, Gnadenhutten,” reads the inscription on a lofty monument, erected to commemorate the death of the Indian martyrs. The Gnadenhutten massacre was a senseless act. The Delaware nation and affiliated nations of the West considered it a crime for which there was no excuse and no atonement. How ironic that some of the leaders of the Delawares tried for years to drive a wedge between the Moravian Brethren missionaries and their Indian followers, only to split their nation at a time when unity would have served them well. But this merciless killing of peaceful kinfolk was a despicable act that would never be forgiven. In reprisal, tribesmen hunted American militia and tortured those they caught with great delight. The grief of the Delawares for their kinfolk was not fully shared by the Chief of the Wyandots. At Upper Sandusky, Pomoacan lived in fear that the Christian Indians would retaliate for their losses and for the role he played in their removal from the Tuscarawas Valley. He renewed his efforts to separate the missionaries from their followers. In his letter to De Peyster in Detroit, he claimed that he feared that some misfortune might fall upon the missionaries as long as they remained at Sandusky, and he requested that they be removed at once. De Peyster, sensing potential harm to his “friends,” requested that the missionaries and their families [pageend66]62 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l come to Detroit immediately. Zeisberger, at this time still unaware of the Gnadenhutten massacre, consented to go. It was at Lower Sandusky, where the missionaries waited under the roof of two British traders for transportation across Lake Erie, that they received the news of what happened at Gnadenhutten. The news was brought by brother Joshua, whose two young daughters were among the slain.39 Before the missionaries were able to depart for the southern shore of Lake Erie, Zeisberger’s cup of sorrow was already filled to the brim with bad news when yet another communication from the interior arrived. It was a report that Colonel Williamson’s militia, on their way back to Pittsburgh, had also massacred the majority of the friendly Delawares encamped near the post who were under the protection of the American flag. Finally, the Brethren at Captives’ Town were forced to leave the site, by order of Pomoacan. Most of them took refuge with Shawnees and the rest moved to the vicinity of Pipe’s Town.40 In Detroit the missionaries were received in very kindly fashion by the commander. He explained to them that he had summoned them only because of threats made against them by Pomoacan and that a return to Sandusky would only bring more of the same. De Peyster wanted them either to stay in Detroit, where all their needs would be met, or to go back to Bethlehem for their own safety. However, the missionaries were adamant in their effort to bring the Christian Indians back together and remain with them to nourish their spiritual needs. “Nothing but absolute necessity could induce them to forsake their converts.”41 The commandant was deeply touched by this devotion to their mission and proceeded to secure permission from the Chippewas to allow the Moravians to resume their work on Clinton River near Lake St. Clair, near today’s Mount Clemens, Michigan.42 By way of further assistance to the missionaries, De Peyster dispatched a message to the Christian Indians in Ohio, relaying the news that their teachers were about to settle in the Chippewa country to resuscitate the Mission, and that all of them were invited to settle in Michigan. The missionaries themselves waited under De Peyster’s protection for their brethren to join them. In Ohio, among the Delawares, wounds of the Gnadenhutten massacre remained open. The Indians continuously kept their scouts on guard along the Ohio River against another surprise by the militia. About two months after Colonel Williamson’s militia returned from Gnadenhutten, a second [pageend67]Th e Mo r a v ia n Br e t h r e n Un it a s Fr a t r u m 63 campaign was organized for the purpose of attacking the Christian Indians in the Sandusky region. Some five hundred volunteers under the command of Colonel Crawford followed Williamson’s Trail to Tuscarawas, where they resupplied from the abandoned Christian towns with provisions and from where they moved on to Sandusky, arriving there at the beginning of June 1782. They might well have repeated here their slaughter of helpless Indians, but Captives’ Town was deserted, its huts in ruins, and the fields and gardens overgrown with grass. This time, it was Pomoacan’s brutal explosion that saved the Christian Indians from another massacre. The volunteers, deeply disappointed with this development, resolved to devote one more day to the search for the Christian Indians. However, they did not realize that they had already advanced too far and overstayed their visit. Their every move was being carefully watched by the Delaware warriors who were ready to respond to their nation’s cry for revenge. When the militia resumed their search, in place of submissive Indians they found braves, painted and plumed, with a burning desire to avenge the blood of their murdered kinfolk. During the ensuing battle the retreat by the militia turned into chaos, and many volunteers were captured, including Colonel Crawford himself. A terrible death by torture awaited these captives.43 In Detroit, in the meantime, weeks passed before any Indian Christians from Ohio came to join the missionaries. They were coming only a few at a time so as not to arouse the suspicions of the Shawnees and Wyandots. Late in July the missionaries with, a small group of Indians, decided to build their new Mission — New Gnadenhutten — west of today’s Mount Clemens, on the Clinton River. It would be their new home for the next four years. But New Gnadenhutten did not become the religious center Zeisberger hoped for. The Mission remained relatively small. The missionaries began to sense that the Chippewas were slowly becoming uneasy about the Christian Delawares who, they thought, were staying in their country too long, especially now, when the peace treaty between the United States and Great Britain had been concluded. Moreover, most of the mission members appeared to be straining psychologically. Their nostalgic memories of the Tuscarawas and Muskingum Valley lingered in their thoughts.44 This state of mind was being nourished by rumors that Congress was reserving the Muskingum [pageend68]64 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al land for the Christian Indians. Zeisberger and his fellow missionaries therefore decided to leave New Gnadenhutten in the spring of 1776 and rebuild their Mission in the Muskingum Valley. It had been a long time since the Moravians had evacuated one of their towns voluntarily. Regrets were expressed particularly by the Detroit merchants who found them to be “honorable people and better than all the inhabitants around.”45 Their return journey to Muskingum, across Lake Erie to Sandusky, began in trading ships, furnished by one of the Detroit merchants. From there they traveled east along the lake partly on foot, partly in canoes. Early in June the Moravians pitched their camp at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River, about the same spot where ten years later General Moses Cleveland would establish the site of the present city of Cleveland. Exhausted after the long, demanding journey, they decided to rest, plant their com and continue to the Muskingum after the harvest or the following spring. Aware of the ferociousness of Lake Erie during a storm, they moved inland and established a settlement on the east bank of the Cuyahoga River, near today’s Bedford. The place became known as Pilgerruh (Pilgrims’ Rest).46 At this time the Moravians did not suspect that their goal, the Tuscarawas and Muskingum paradise, was still more than a decade away, even though they were situated only about seventy miles from Schoenbrunn. Neither would they allow themselves to think that once they reached their goal, it would not be the utopia they were longing for. The land in south-eastern and east-central Ohio was about to be surveyed and opened to white settlers. Most Indians were not fully satisfied with the newly-negotiated treaties. In general, the situation in the region was very unstable. There was nothing encouraging for the Moravian Brethren in these developments. In addition, they had been advised by Zeisberger’s friend, William Henry, a member of Congress from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, “not to be in too great a hurry in settling on these lands.”47 Disappointed, but allowing reason to rule over their feeling, the missionaries decided to look a short distance from Pilgerruh, in the Black River Valley, near today’s Lorain, Ohio, to establish their new mission. With the help of the Ottawas they found a suitable place. Before they could grasp their axes to begin building their new home, the chiefs of the Delawares and Wyandots rushed in to inform them that they must come back to Sandusky, where, this time, they could live and [pageend69]Th e Mo r a v ia n Br e t h r e n Un it a s Fr a t r u m 65 worship God in peace. To avoid new provocations by Captain Pipe and Half-King’s Pomoacan warriors, the Moravians yielded to these demands and moved further west to the Huron River, but not to the Sandusky River. There, on the eastern bank of the river, near today’s Milan, they built New Salem,48 where 60 years later Thomas A. Edison was bom. New Salem, like Schoenbrunn and Gnadenhutten, became a thriving town and a center of Christianity in the Western Indian Country. In addition to fertile land in the area, the Christians were close to Lake Erie with its abundance of fresh water fish. On the other hand, at New Salem the Christians were never alone. Pack trains and traders detoured from their normal routes between Pittsburgh and Detroit in order to witness the new prosperity on the Huron River. Zeisberger tried to take his mind off the undesirable traffic through the town by devoting most of his time to the schools — there were three with a total of more than one hundred pupils. The community reached its pinnacle in 1790. The congregation numbered more than two hundred — largest number since the Gnadenhutten massacre.49 Although formal peace had been declared and the peace treaty between the United States and Great Britain had been signed, there was no peace in the territory north and west of the Ohio River. Urged on by a desire for change, adventure, land and new homes, settlers began to come in increasing numbers from New England, the Middle Atlantic states and the South. These intrusions were resisted by the Indians, who were still aided by the British. The new settlers, on the other hand, had the full support of Congress. Thus the problems between the two competing sides in the region grew increasingly severe. Captain Pipe informed Zeisberger that by the spring of 1791 no one who wished to be spared the effects of war should remain in the area between the Ohio and Sandusky Rivers, and that the Indian warriors were assembling at the Miami. In the fall of 1790 an American military expedition under General Harmar was sent north from Fort Washington (today’s Cincinnati) to “subdue” the Indians. However, the Indians were ready and dealt several severe blows to this contingent, forcing it to retreat back to its starting point. By the end of 1790, Zeisberger realized that the situation was again becoming serious for the Christian Indians. But where should they turn? Where could they go to be able to live in peace and guide their lives in accordance with the Gospel? Almost as if in desperation, Zeisberger wrote: “The world, which [pageend70]66 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al yet is great, and contains land enough, will soon be too small for them, a little handful of believing Indians, who are on this account reviled and despised, of whom the world is unworthy, because they believe in Jesus Christ.”50 Though prospects were grim, Zeisberger could still see a ray of light in the situation. Although the British had given up their hold on the Northwest Territory, they were still able to retain control of several strategic points, Detroit among them. Zeisberger hoped that in this difficult situation his friends in Detroit would not turn him down. In a most unexpected turn of events, help was offered by those who had previously planned the destruction of the Moravians — the trio of McKee, Elliot, and Girty. Elliot himself came to New Salem from Sandusky and offered to bring the matter of the Christian Indians’ safety before the Indian agent in Detroit, who was McKee. In the spring of 1791 Elliot brought news to Zeisberger that McKee had arranged with the Wyandots that the Moravians could settle on either side of the Detroit River.51 The missionaries thought it would be wise to accept the offer, break New Salem and go over the lake. The evacuation started in April. A fleet of canoes and a fully loaded sloop, provided by Detroit merchants, was heading north across Lake Erie. The live stock was herded overland and then ferried over the Detroit River. The new refuge, the Watch Tower, was built a short distance south of present Amherstburg. On Trinity Sunday, June 19, 1791, the first Moravian Service in Canada was heard by a congregation of Indians, whites, and black slaves who worked for Elliot on a nearby plantation.52 Watch Tower, like New Salem, was too close to white settlers and open to heavy traffic of traders moving up and down the Detroit River. In the fall of the same year, Zeisberger informed McKee that the Moravians wished to move soon, “for we must live with our Indians alone,” away from the white people who blamed them for every calamity that befell the neighborhood. Nor could they live among the heathen Indians, “for they corrupt our young people.”53 The question was where to move next? Muskingum Valley was still foremost on Zeisberger’s mind, but the situation in Ohio had not improved enough to provide any comfort. A reasonable solution appeared to be that the government of Upper Canada would grant the Moravians a permit to live beyond the currently inhabited portions of this new province, until the situation south of the lake stabilized. Zeisberger consulted with Judge [pageend71]Th e Mo r a v ia n Br e t h r e n Un it a s Fr a t r u m 67 William Powell from Massachusetts, then living south of Detroit in Canada. He advised presenting the request to McKee who, in turn, would bring it before the board of the new Province of Upper Canada. With this approach, McKee was able to advise Zeisberger in February 1792 to seek a suitable location on the Thames River.54 The missionaries and their brethren then waited only for suitable spring weather to be on the move again. The Detroit River and Lake St. Clair were clear of ice and open for navigation in the later part of March. On April 12, 1792, the loaded canoes and a “great boat” secured for the move by McKee pushed off the shore and started up the Detroit River and into the lake. Once on the Thames River, they proceeded east, past the last white settlement — the present Chatham, Ontario. This was as far as the “great boat” would go. Zeisberger with several Indians then went further upstream to search for a townsite. When they arrived at a “great bend” in the river, suddenly the country appeared much like that on the Tuscarawas or Muskingum River. This then would be their new home. And so the Moravian Brethren mission came to the Thames River in Upper Canada, in May of 1792.55 After so many difficult years of struggle, persecution and massacre, the Christian Delawares hoped that they had reached a place where they could live in peace and work for their salvation. Perhaps they even suspected that their new home would turn out to be the longest-lasting in the history of the Moravian Indian missions. Again the sound of their axes and saws echoed, this time in the heretofore unexploited primeval forest, and soon their houses would line both sides of the wide street in a town which would be called Fairfield. It was situated about twenty miles east of where the City of Chatham eventually developed. By the end of the summer the church became the center of the town’s activity. The same bell that had announced the arrival of the Moravian missionaries in Ohio from the cupola of the church in Schoenbrunn twenty years before now pealed the same message through the treetops on the Thames River. As much as the Moravians longed for isolation and privacy in their quest for spiritual life, they were again not able to stem the curiosity of “outsiders” who sought to find the secrets of their industriousness and their economic success. It may have been too much for the outsiders to comprehend that their faith and the satisfaction of spiritual needs, their [pageend72]68 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al education, and their brotherly love were the providing elements, rather than the results of, their organized living and self-governing, their desire for self-sufficiency, and all the other factors that appeared too unnatural for the Indians. In Fairfield the curiosity seekers were no longer just traders who would detour from their normal trading routes. In February of 1793 a messenger informed Zeisberger that the Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada, John Graves Simcoe, would like to detour on his way to Detroit and visit Fairfield, and during his stay discuss the role of the Moravians in his grand plan for the Great Peninsula.56 Thus, try as they might, Fairfield could not continue too long as an isolated community. In 1796 Detroit had passed into American hands. Many loyalists moved across the river into Upper Canada and soon began to come up the Thames River to acquire land on both banks. All this meant increased trade which, in turn, improved outlets for the Moravian Indians’ manufactured goods. Neither could the missionaries limit the spread of the Gospel to the Indians alone any more. They began to receive requests from white farmers in the area who felt the need for religious guidance and were inviting missionaries to their homes. Michael Jung became one of the beloved “traveling evangelists.”57 On the civic side, the missionaries recognized that their services were needed in the area to improve tolerance and keep peace between the Indians and whites. Thus they began to recognize that their missionary work did not end with their success in bringing prosperity to the Indians. They began to accept the developments in their neighborhood as inevitable and widened their activities accordingly. The Christian culture they brought to and maintained at Fairfield had a very significant impact on the life in that portion of Upper Canada. From Fairfield the missionaries were also able to follow the struggle for stability in the Northwest Territory, without being directly involved in it. After unsuccessful attempts by Generals Harmar and St. Clair to “control” the Indians in the West, President Washington assigned this task to General Wayne. In August of 1794, General Wayne’s force met the Indians at Fallen Timbers in northwestern Ohio and completely defeated them. Within a year, Wayne’s victory resulted in the Treaty of Greenville, between the Indians and the government of the United States. By this treaty the Indians ceded all land in Ohio east of a line, diagonally across the territory, from the mouth of the Cuyahoga River (Cleveland) to Fort [pageend73]Th e Mo r a v ia n Br e t h r e n Un it a s Fr a t r u m 69 Washington (Cincinnati). This treaty also ended a full generation of bitter and bloody warfare in the Ohio Valley. Could it be that the Moravian missionaries and their Delaware brethren could at last return to their cherished former home? Did they have the desire to do so, now that the opportunity arose? The Muskingum land had been surveyed by General Putnam and John Heckewelder in 1797 and the Christian Indians were welcome to return. But the thought of leaving Fairfield was upsetting to most members of the congregation. Now that they were settled, prosperous, useful and in demand, the lure of the Muskingum was gradually fading.58 Zeisberger hesitated to urge any of his followers to undertake another venture on the Muskingum and conveyed that message to Bethlehem. However, at Bethlehem, Bishop Ettwein was very much interested in reestablishing a mission in Ohio, which he hoped would bring the scattered Christian Delawares, who had remained in Ohio, back together. He expressed his belief to Zeisberger and hinted to him that he should be the one to bring several families from Fairfield back with him, as “seed” settlers. To Zeisberger, by that time seventy-eight-years of age, a hint from the leaders of the Church continued to be a command which was not to be questioned. In July 1798 he made one of the most difficult decisions of his life. If there was to be a mission on Muskingum and somebody was to bring the necessary “seed” settlers from Fairfield, that task belonged to him and no one else. He had no problem in obtaining seven volunteer families. They all loved and trusted him and were ready to follow him anywhere.59 For Zeisberger, leaving Fairfield was the most emotional farewell he had ever experienced. How many times had he built in the wilderness and forsaken his accomplishment for another wilderness in the name of the Gospel? Looking around proudly, he could recall that the homes of the far-off Hermhut were not any better than those of his Indians. He was leaving his flock fine legacy: a fine chapel, two schools, almost fifty comfortable homes, craft shops, storehouses, bams and farm buildings, and his own comfortable house.60 It was comforting to him that he was leaving the Fairfield community in the capable hands of Gottlob Senseman and Michael Jung. There would be many others after them, since Fairfield and New Fairfield, after the war of 1812, continued to be a spiritual center for the Ontario Delawares on into the twentieth century.61 [pageend74]70 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al Following his return to Muskingum Valley, David Zeisberger seemed to regain the physical strength he had lost during his long peregrinations. He probably realized that this would be the last Indian settlement he would build and was determined not to abandon it. The town was named Goshen. Here the venerable and apostolic Brother David would spend the last ten years of his fruitful life and labor for the salvation of the red man. Muskingum Valley was being rapidly settled by whites. The tracts which were set aside for the Christian Indians proved to be too large. The surplus land was therefore leased for the purposes of propagating the Gospel to white Moravian families and others from Pennsylvania. The site of Gnadenhutten, deserted and again a wilderness after the massacre in 1782, came to life again in 1797 when John Heckewelder returned to the site, burned off the brush and collected all the human bones he could find for burial in a common grave.62 The following year, 1798, when Brother David returned to the Muskingum Valley, John Heckewelder founded the present community of Gnadenhutten adjacent to the old Mission town when a handful of families from Pennsylvania came to settle in the area. Heckewelder was also called upon to perform other duties in his service to the new community, including that of a judgeship.63 The commencement of the new era on the Muskingum River coincided with a visit to Goshen by the new president of the Board at Hermhut, Bishop George Henry Loskiel. On this occasion the Bishop also called the elders of the Moravian Church and the representatives from the missions to come to Goshen for a conference at which they would discuss the future missionary effort in the West.64 It was perhaps symbolic that a conference dealing with the future direction of the Church was held in Zeisberger’s domain. The Church seemed finally to be coming to grips with the inevitable “Americanization.”65 Brother David himself made available his mature experience and many words of advice, particularly addressing the problems and approaches of younger missionaries. Bishop Loskiel must have been relieved to hear from this patriarch that in his opinion explorations to search out new fields where the Gospel could be preached solely to the Indians had almost ceased. The conference seemed to have officially sanctioned the effort to broaden the scope of the work within the Church in providing spiritual guidance beyond the Indian boundaries when the conferees approved a request by the white settlers on the west side of the Tuscarawas to organize their own congregation. This [pageend75]Th e Mo r a v ia n Br e t h r e n Un it a s Fr a t r u m 71 station was given the name Beersheba.66 The conferees, also at Zeisberger’s urging, gave their approval for a renewed effort to reestablish the mission on the Huron River for the Monsey tribe. Once again, the settlement was to be “seeded” by several families from Fairfield.67 The general situation at Goshen had not been evolving to Zeisberger’s satisfaction. An influx of settlers to the Muskingum Valley resulted also in an influx of traders — with the predominant commodity being liquor. At times Zeisberger felt that his town had been reduced to a weak body of debauched converts who were unable to guard their property.68 He fell into a deep melancholy. It was probably his mental rather than his physical state that made him feel his age, but he would not leave Goshen and his Indian flock. In his last public address, in the midsummer of 1808, he spoke of such awful torment for sinners after the judgment day that fear fell upon the whole town and he was able to order the "heathen" visitors out of Goshen.69 On November 17 of the same year Brother David, at the age of eighty seven, surrounded by his Indian friends, for whom he so devotedly labored for sixty-two years, died. He was buried beside the Goshen Church, next to his Indian brethren and his fellow missionary, William Edwards. In his long pilgrimage throughout the Northwest Territory, his many trials and tribulations, David Zeisberger came to his final resting place within a few miles of “home,” the God’s Acre at Schoenbrunn. Benjamin Mortimer, Zeisberger’s assistant for the last several years, stayed on to lead the mission at Goshen until 1824, when the land was ceded to the government.70 The Moravian Church, Unitas Fratrum, had been laid to rest in Goshen cemetery with David Zeisberger. The Church now became more and more Americanized,71 and by the middle of the nineteenth century one could see the membership on the rise among the white settlers. At the present time the Church continues to serve as a center of spiritual life to not fewer than eight congregations, primarily in the same area established two centuries ago — the Muskingum Valley. In the last twenty-five years people in Ohio have benefitted from the Moravian tradition through the Ohio Moravian Music Festivals. Recognition of the work done by the Moravian missionaries amongst the Indians in Ohio has risen since the Ohio Historical Society and the Gnadenhutten Historical Society undertook the restoration of the original Missions at Schoenbrunn and at [pageend76]72 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al Gnadenhutten. Both sites as well as the museums adjacent to them attract increasing numbers of visitors and students of early Ohio history. The restored Moravian church at Gnadenhutten has been used for weddings since 1982. The burial mound of the victims of the Gnadenhutten massacre remains undisturbed, except for flowers brought by visitors. Christian Delawares from Ontario continue to pay regular yearly homage to their martyred brethren in Gnadenhutten and to their beloved Brother David in Goshen. Further excavation and restoration continues. The legacy which is based on the early teachings of Jan Hus, Petr Chelčický, and Jan Amos Komenský (Comenius) has found a fertile soil. NOTES 1.

[pageend79]In the Footprints of the First Czech Immigrants in America Miloslav Rechcigl, Jr. It is generally believed that only a few individuals emigrated from Bohemia and Moravia to America before the revolutionary year 1848.1 On the Slovak side, the beginning of emigration to America has been placed even a quarter century later. The purpose of this paper is to discuss and document the early arrival of the visitors and pioneer settlers from the territory of today’s Czechoslovakia to American shores prior to 1848. If we look for commonality among the immigrants from the Czech Lands and Slovakia, most of them were of humble origin — artisans and craftsmen by trade, seeking better and happier lives in the New World than their native land could offer. Some were further motivated by the promise of new riches and adventure, while others by spiritual values and missionary zeal. On the whole, their traits and aspirations were not much different from other early immigrants in America. What makes them unique in some respect, however, was their competitiveness and a relatively high degree of accomplishments. News of the Discovery of the New World2 The news of the discovery of the New World reached the Kingdom of Bohemia as early as the first decade of the sixteenth century, during the rule of Vladislav the Jagiellonian (1471-1516).3 The definite proof of this is given by the existence of one of the early prints in the Czech language, Spis o nowých zemiech a o nowem swietie o niemžto jsme prwe žadne známosti nemeli ani kdy tzo slýchali (translation of Amerigo Vespucci’s Mundus novus), the origin of which was placed to about 1509. The printer and publisher of this rare publication is purported to be Mikuláš Bakalář (originally Štětina) who, by his own account, was bom in Upper Hungary [pageend80]76 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al (now Slovakia) and who later settled in Plzeň, Bohemia.4 First Visitors in the New World The first visitors from Bohemia in the New World were an anonymous group of Jáchymov miners who, prior to 1528, were sent to Little Naples (present Venezuela) to establish the silver mines there while in the employ of the banking house of the Walser family.5 However, when the first Czech or Slovak actually put foot on the North American continent has not been established. There has been speculation that such a person might have been Stephanus Parmenius (d. 1583) who in 1583 accompanied Sir Humphrey Gilbert (1539-1583) on his expedition to Newfoundland, Canada. There is, however, some dispute about his ethnic origin. The Slovaks claim him as their own,6 but so do the Hungarians.7 According to the published biography, Parmenius (originally István Paizsos) was bom of Christian parents in Turkish captivity in the pashalik of Buda, after 1541.8 According to popular Slovak literature, he was of Slovak descent bearing the name Štítnický. Further research is clearly needed to set the record straight. Be that as it may, it is a fact that Parmenius did not remain in Canada long and died the same year, while returning to England. The first documented case of the entry of a Bohemian on the North American shores is that of Joachim Gans of Prague who came to Roanoke, N.C. in 1585 with an expedition of explorers organized by Sir Walter Raleigh (1552-1618) and commanded by Raleigh’s cousin Admiral Sir Richard Greenville (1542-1591).9 It should be noted that this expedition originated from Plymouth, England thirty years before the Pilgrims set sails from the same port on their historic voyage to America. Joachim Gans was a metallurgist and alchemist of note who mastered the skills of dressing and smelting copper. “Master Youngham,” as he was affectionately called by the English, was held in considerable esteem by his fellow-colonists, which is not altogether surprising considering his unique skills and the fact that one of the goals of the expedition was to search for promising deposits of precious metal. Unfortunately, due to various logistical problems and particularly due to lack of provisions for the colonists and the inherent dangers from the Spaniards and the Indians, the expedition was abruptly called to an end on June 19, 1586 when Sir [pageend81]In t h e Fo o t pr in t s o f t h e Fir s t Cz e c h Immig r a n t s 77 Francis Drake (1546-1596) was asked to take the whole company of colonists back to England. The Pioneer Settlers from Bohemia According to available evidence, the first Bohemian who permanently settled in America was Augustine Herman (1621-1686).10 We hardly know anything about his background except, as he himself stated, that he was bom in Prague, the capital of the Kingdom of Bohemia. He was a surveyor and skilled draftsman, successful planter and developer of new lands, a shrewd and enterprising merchant, a bold politician, an eloquent and effective diplomat fluent in several languages, a versatile person of unusual stamina and great courage — clearly, one of the most conspicuous and colorful personalities of seventeenth century colonial America. While in New Amsterdam, where he first settled, he soon came to prominence. Thanks to his extraordinary success in business and growing prosperity, Herman became one of the most influential people in New Amsterdam, which led to his appointment to the Council of Nine to advise the Dutch Governor. One of his greatest achievements was his celebrated map of Maryland and Virginia, commissioned by Lord Baltimore, on which he began working when he moved to the Maryland province and which took ten years to complete. Lord Baltimore was so pleased with the map that he rewarded Herman with a large estate, named by Herman “Bohemia Manor,” and the hereditary title Lord. Frederick Philipse (1626-1720), Augustine Herman’s contemporary, became equally famous, in his own right.11 Partly because of his business skills and entrepreneurship, and partly because of inheritance from the two wealthy widows he married, Philipse later became the wealthiest person in the entire Dutch colony. Frederick Philipse’s origin and past are shrouded in mystery, just as Augustine Herman’s are. Early genealogists and historians concluded that he was of Bohemian origin. The famed U.S. Supreme Court Justice and diplomat John Jay, whose mother was the daughter of Philipse’s stepdaughter, and who himself married Philipse’s grand-daughter, wrote in his memoirs that Frederick Philipse descended from an aristocratic Protestant family from Bohemia who had to flee their native land at the outbreak of the Thirty Years’ War.12 [pageend82]78 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al Existing records document that other natives of the Czech lands lived in New Amsterdam, besides Herman and Philipse. In the archives of the Reformed Dutch Church is the record of a marriage between a Moravian by the name of Jeurian (possibly Jiří) Fradell and Tryn Hersker, which took place on February 26, 1645.13 There is also the record of a marriage of the widower Jeuraen Simon Fradell, who may be identical with the above. Several other Czech-sounding names appear in the Dutch records, including that of Hollar, Adam Unkelba, John Kostlo and Loketka.14 There is a strong indication of the presence of Czechs in colonial Virginia, as attested by early ship passenger lists. One Christopher Donak purchased land in 1655 in Northampton County, as did his fellow passenger John Doza. One Anna Dubes had taken land in 1652 in Lancaster County, while John Duch and Anna Simon settled in Northcumberland County in 1650 and 1653, respectively.15 Early records of the city of Boston refer to one Matthew Cenig (perhaps Čeněk) who died in Massachusetts in 1654.16 Furthermore, Czech-sounding names can be found among the early settlers of Connecticut.17 Early footprints of Czech settlers can be traced even to Barbados, which were occupied by the British in 1625. Thus, the ship Expedition, bound in 1635 for Barbados, had aboard one Richard Benes;18 the official list of inhabitants of the Parish of Christ Church of Barbados, published in 1679, included such names as Edward Marston, Anthony Slany and John Hudlice.19 There has been no attempt to research the fate or the origin of these individuals. There is a documented case of one native Bohemian, by the name Stephanus Steiger, or Styer, as his descendants spelled his name: an early settler of Germantown, Pennsylvania he was recorded as having purchased 200 acres of land in Montgomery County in 1727.20 One of his many descendants, Henry Delp Styer (1862-1944) was an army officer who rose to the rank of Brigadier General. In 1917 he was placed in command of the 181st infantry brigade at Camp Lewis, Tacoma, Washington; from there he went to the Philippines to take all available troops to Siberia. In August 1918 he was given command of the A.E.F. in Siberia and led the advance on the Amur River. He was later awarded the War Cross of Czechoslovakia. Mention should also be made of the American family of Huss, who [pageend83]In t h e Fo o t pr in t s o f t h e Fir st Cz e c h Immig r an t s 79 claims to be of Bohemian descent: the members of the family are convinced that they are related to the Czech martyr Jan Hus. According to one account, Jan Hus had a brother by the name of Leonard, whose descendants presumably emigrated from Bohemia to Holland, from Holland to England and eventually settled in America. The progenitor of the family in America bore the name Johannes Huss and lived in Chester County, Pennsylvania in 1765.21 The story, while intriguing and even plausible, could not be verified.22 The Moravian Brethren The first significant wave of Czech immigrants to America was that of the Moravian Brethren who began arriving in the first half of the eighteenth century.23 Moravian Brethren were the followers of the teachings of the Czech religious reformer and martyr Jan Hus and are the true heirs of Bohemian Brethren who found temporary refuge in Moravia and later in Herrnhut, Saxony, under the patronage of Count Nicolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf (1700-1760).24 Because of the worsening political and religious situation in Saxony, the Brethren had to seek a more permanent home and also a new territory where they could exercise their religious rights and expand their missionary activities. The recently discovered North American continent, with the abundance of fertile land and with its large Indian population, was ideally suited for their aims. After initial visits to St. Thomas in 1732 and Greenland in 1733,25 ten selected Brethren sailed in November 1734 to the English Province of Georgia for the purpose of colonization, arriving in Savannah in February 1735. Three of this group originated in Bohemia, five in Moravia and one in Silesia. In the summer of the same year, second group, under the leadership of Bishop David Nitschmann, a native of Moravia, followed. This group comprised twenty-five persons, the majority of whom again came from Moravia or Bohemia. Among the passengers on the ship which brought the Moravians to Georgia was John Wesley (1703-1791), the founder of the Methodist Church, who became acquainted with the Brethren, attended their services, worshiped with them and lived in their homes during his initial stay in Georgia. Through the efforts of Bishop Nitschmann the Brethren were soon organized into a congregation. Brother Anton Seiffert, a native of Bohemia, was appointed and ordained [pageend84]80 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al as their elder and preacher. The church which the Moravians built in 1736 was the first Moravian church in North America. Despite their efforts, the Moravians did not find Georgia ideal for their religious pursuits and in 1740 the majority decided to leave for Pennsylvania which offered better conditions. The third group of Moravian settlers, called by early Moravian historians The First Sea Congregation, arrived in Philadelphia on June 7, 1742. It was led by a native Moravian, George Piesch, and included seven Brethren from the Czech Lands.26 The largest contingent of Moravian Brethren ever to come to America arrived May 12, 1749, in New York, with the John Nitschmann Colony, with whom came Christian David of Hermhut, and Matthew and Rosina Stach, Moravian missionaries to Greenland. The leader of the group, Bishop John Nitschmann (1703- 1772), was a native of Suchdol, Moravia. Nitschmann’s Colony included some thirty persons who originally came from Moravia or Bohemia. It is beyond the scope of this paper to delve into the history or fate of various families of Moravian stock; however, a few brief comments about selected individuals of note may be in order. The following list (organized by dates of birth) contains some of the most prominent Moravian immigrants: Christian David (1691-1751), a Moravian missionary and the founder of Hermhut, called the “Bush Preacher” by some, the “Godly Carpenter” by Wesley, and the “Apostle” by Zinzendorf. Bom in Ženklava, Moravia, not far from Comenius’s parish of Fulnek, he was a devout Catholic in his youth and a flaming evangelist after his conversion. He was an impressive preacher even though he was entirely uneducated. He led the first refugees from Bohemia and Moravia in 1722 and had much to do with the founding of diaspora work. In 1733 he went to Greenland to found a mission there and returned there again in 1747. In 1749 he came to Bethlehem with the Third Sea Congregation. David Nitschmann (1696-1772), Bishop of the Moravian Church, was a native of Suchdol, Moravia, who emigrated to Hermhut in 1724, and was immediately engaged in evangelic work in Germany and Russia. In 1732 he went, together with Leonard Dober, to St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, as the first Moravian missionaries among the heathens. In 1735 he was consecrated the first Bishop of the renewed Moravian Church by Bishop Jablonský of Berlin, Comenius’s grandson, thus assuring the continuation of the evangelic work of the ancient Bohemian Unitas fratrum. The [pageend85]In t h e Fo o t pr in t s o f t h e Fir st Cz e c h Immig r an t s 81 following year he led the Moravian colony to Georgia. In 1740 he came to Pennsylvania and in 1741 purchased a tract of land on the Lehigh River where he formed a small colony, from the abandoned settlement in Georgia, which he named Bethlehem. He returned to Saxony in 1744, but later he extended his labors to New York and North Carolina. During his lifetime he visited the principal countries of northern Europe and the West Indies, making close to fifty sea voyages. In 1755 he returned to Pennsylvania and resided in Weissport, at Lititz and later at Bethlehem. John Nitschmann (1703-1772), a Moravian Bishop, a native of Šenov, Moravia, was a descendant of the ancient Brethren’s Church. Because of religious persecutions, in 1724 he relinquished his possessions in Moravia and emigrated to Hermhut where he engaged in evangelical work; in 1741 he was consecrated to the episcopacy. He immigrated to America in 1749 to fill the place of Augustus Gottlieb Spangenberg, the presiding bishop, who had established a Moravian colony at Savannah, Georgia. He remained in America until 1751, when he returned to Europe. Matthew Stach (1711-1787), a missionary, was a native of Mankovice, Moravia, who came to Hermhut in 1728. In 1733 he went to Greenland as a missionary. In 1772 he moved to Bethabara, North Carolina, taking charge of the little congregation and the boys’ school; later he became a member of the Committee of Oversight. George Neisser (1715-1784), a native of Žilina, Moravia, emigrated to Hermhut in 1723. He was the first archivist and diarist of Bethlehem, the first schoolmaster and the first postmaster. In 1748 he was ordained deacon and in 1775 presbyter. He was very active as pastor and vice elder in preaching the Gospel in Bethlehem, Nazareth, Lancaster, York, Philadelphia and other places. Nathaniel Seidel (1718-1782), Bishop of the Moravian Church and for twenty years the President of the American Provincial Board of Elders, was bom in Laubau, Silesia, the son of a Bohemian emigrant. He joined the Moravian Church at Hermhut in 1739 and came to Bethlehem in 1742 to engage in evangelic work. David Zeisberger (1721-1808), a famous missionary among the Indians, was bom in Suchdol, Moravia. In 1726, when he was five, his parents forsook their considerable estate and fled for conscience sake to Hermhut. After coming to America in 1738, he embarked on an intensive study of Indian languages, which provided a foundation for his illustrious missionary career among the American Indians, which lasted more than sixty years. David Tanneberger (1728- [pageend86]82 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al 1804), organ builder, was born on Count Zinzendorfs estate at Berthelsdorf, Saxony of Moravian parents. He immigrated to America in 1749 and settled in Bethlehem; later on he moved to Lititz, Pennsylvania. He was a skillful joiner, had a notably good tenor voice, and played the violin. He learned the organ building craft and soon became well known for his unique technical skills. Organs of his manufacture were in high repute and were shipped all over eastern Pennsylvania from his Lititz shop and even to such distant points as Albany, New York. He made organs not only for Moravian but also for Reformed, Lutheran and Roman Catholic churches. John Gottlieb E. Heckewelder (1743-1823), a Moravian missionary among the Indians, was bom in Bedford, England. He was brought to America by his parents (his father was a native Moravian) and educated in the Moravian settlement in Bethlehem. He was employed in the Indian missions established in Pennsylvania (1765-1771) and during 1777-1786, while in Ohio, he was an assistant to David Zeisberger. In 1781 he was captured by the British, accused of being an American spy, and eventually released to continue missionary work. In 1792, at the request of Henry Knox, Secretary of War, he accompanied Gen. Rufus Putnam to Fort Vincennes to plead with the Indians, and in 1793 he went on a similar mission to the Indians of the Lakes. Besides his missionary labors, he was a postmaster, justice of the peace and a member of the court of common pleas. He remained in Ohio till 1810, when he returned to Bethlehem where he engaged in literary pursuit.27 He was elected to the American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia. The Early Jewish Immigrants Guido Kisch’s classic book on the Czechoslovak American Jewish ethnic history, In Search of Freedom, contains a disarming statement that, prior to the middle of the eighteenth century, no Jewish immigrants from Bohemia are known.28 This information needs to be corrected. As was mentioned earlier, Joachim Gans, a Bohemian Jew, was a member of the first English settlement in Roanoke, North Carolina in 1585-1586. A claim has also been put forward that he was the first Jewish visitor in America.29 Gans must have been a man of strong religious convictions, [pageend87]In t h e Fo o t pr in t s o f t h e Fir s t Cz e c h Immig r a n t s 83 since upon his return from America to England he was arrested in 1589 in the seaport of Bristol for professing his Jewish faith. No record has been found as to the resolution of this matter or, for that matter, whether or not Gans returned to Bohemia or whether he remained in England. The second recorded evidence of the presence of Bohemian Jews in America can be found in a will filed in the Surrogate’s Office of the County of New York in 1740: “In the Name of God Amen the first Day of November 1740 I, Uriah Hyam now resident of the City of New York Chandler, give and bequeath onto my brother Enoch, living in Bohemia the sum of twenty pounds.”30 According to his will, Hyam was an owner of a Negro boy, whom he left to his youngest son Andrew Israel of the Island of Jamaica. Considering that he also left six pounds to the Congregation of the Children of Israel of New York, he was probably quite well off. The next documented reference to a Bohemian Jew can be found in the following advertisement: Elias Wollin of Bohemia, who has served in His Imperial Majesty’s Army as Chirurgeon four years infallibly and instantly Cures the Tooth Ach to Admiration, also Bleeds without any Manner of Pain, Cups in the Like Manner, Wounds, Swellings and Sores are also cured wonderfully by him in a Short Time, he has made sundry Cures of the Tooth Achs in the Presence of Many.31 Around the same time, Mathias Bush, a native of Prague, later a prosperous merchant and communal leader, settled in Philadelphia.32 There he was naturalized in 1749, one of the first to benefit from the Act of Parliament of 1740, authorizing the naturalization of foreigners after a seven year residence in the colonies. There are numerous records revealing Bush a prominent member of the Jewish community in Philadelphia. He is known to have owned property in Philadelphia and Northampton counties, Pennsylvania, and Frederick and Hampshire counties, Virginia. On October 25, 1765 he affixed his signature to the Philadelphia Merchants Non-Importation Act, the first American document of civic rights on record. During 1782 and 1783 he served as collector of taxes for Germantown. Bush left numerous descendants, some of whom still living today. His son Solomon Bush (1753-1795) was a soldier in the American Revolutionary War.33 In 1777 he was appointed Deputy Adjutant General of the State Militia. He was seriously wounded during [pageend88]84 Cz e c h o s l o v a k a n d Ce n t r a l Eu r o pe a n Jo u r n a l a skirmish against the British and taken prisoner. Freed, Bush was made a Lieutenant Colonel in the Continental Army (1779), the highest rank held by a Jewish officer in the Revolutionary Army. His grandson John Altamont Phillips (1806-1862) was a successful Philadelphia lawyer34 and the latter’s son Henry Phillips (1838-1895) was a numismatist, philologist and translator of note.35 Another great-grandson of Mathias Bush, Hon. Henry Myer Phillips (1811-1884) was elected to the House of Representatives in the Thirty-fifth Congress.36 There was another Phillips family of Bohemian descent, not related to the above, living in Philadelphia at that time. The progenitor of the family, Jonas Phillips (d. 1794), son of Phineas Phillips, emigrated from Bohemia to London, England in the mid-eighteenth century and several members of the family later moved to the United States. One of their descendants, Barnet Phillips (1826-1885) was a prominent journalist on the staff of The New York Times.31 Many members of the family who remained in England, intermarried with the leading families of the British aristocracy. Among their descendants who gained particular distinction was Sir Benjamin Samuel Phillips (b. 1811) who was elected Lord Mayor of London in 1865.38 Joseph Karpeles, the son of Wolf Karpeles of Prague, came to America around 1783-84 and lived in Philadelphia during 1784-85.39 According to a preserved letter, the famous financier of the American Revolution, Haym Salomon (1740-1785) engaged Karpeles to represent him in a legal dispute concerning an inheritance worth eight hundred ducats, which was supposed to be decided by a court of arbitration. Both parties to the ligation were required to deposit a personal check of four thousand ducats to guarantee their acceptance of the decision. This event reveals the responsibility entrusted to Karpeles as well as the esteem in which he was held. The First Slovaks in America If his Slovak identity could be firmly established, Stephen Parmenius (d. 1583) would be the first Slovak to reach the American shores.40 He was the contemporary and friend of Richard Hakluyt, who, as a historian, accompanied Sir Humphrey Gilbert on his exploratory voyage to [pageend89]In t h e Fo o t pr in t s o f t h e Fir st Cz e c h Immig r an t s 85 Newfoundland in 1583. On the return trip to England, Parmenius drowned when the boat Delight encountered a violent storm and sank at the southern end of Nova Scotia, with the loss of nearly one hundred lives.41 The individual of indisputably known Slovak origin to visit the territory of the United States was Isaac Ferdinand Sarosy. Trained as a Protestant preacher, Sarosy came to Pennsylvania in 1695 to join the colony of Francis Daniel Pastorius (1651-1720) at Germanopolia, later renamed Germantown. According to Pastorius’ account, Sarosy could not get used to the primitive conditions of the colony and would not undertake to do the preacher’s work without fixed compensation. Disillusioned, Sarosy left Pennsylvania for Maryland whence he intended sailing to Europe. Whether he returned to Europe or remained in America is not known.42 Another Slovak brought to the shores of America in the eighteenth century was an adventurer by the name of Andrew Jelik (ca. 1730-1783).43 In an effort to avoid military draft, after a series of mishaps and adventures, including a shipwreck, he finally drifted to the coast of England, from where he sailed with a Dutch captain bound for the New World. He spent some time on American soil but soon left for Europe as a crewmember of a Dutch ship. Excitement and adventure seemed to follow him all his life, including capture by pirates, being sold to slavery under a Turkish master, and an encounter with the cannibals. A detailed account of his adventure can be found in his autobiography. There was another adventurer of Slovak descent whose name is tied to America, Count Moric Benovský (1746-1786), a native of Vrbové, in the Tmava district.44 He was a soldier of fortune and a globe trotter, whose various exploits are detailed in his two volume memoirs, preserved in the British Museum.45 One of his more memorable encounters was his takeover of the French Colony of Madagascar and his success in having himself proclaimed King of the Island. In 1782 we find him in Philadelphia with letters of recommendation from Benjamin Franklin, offering General Washington through General Baron Steuben “his blood, his skill and his courage to serve the United States, of which he is desirous to become a citizen;” his offer was respectfully declined. Count Benovský was not easily put off, and a month later, through the French Minister to the United States, he submitted a plan to General Washington proposing that he would raise in Germany a body of troops consisting of three legionary corps of cavalry, infantry, grenadiers, chasseurs and [pageend90]86 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al artillery, the whole amounting to 3,383 effective men, and after their transport to America they would be subject to the order of the United States and take the oaths of fidelity and allegiance. The proposal was laid before Congress which, upon the recommendation of a committee, rejected the offer. Benovský arrived in America again in 1784, when two Baltimore merchants supplied for him a 500-ton vessel, Intrepid, on which he sailed on his second expedition to the Island of Madagascar, where he was killed. Benovský’s younger brother Francis, a Lieutenant of Lauzun’s Hussars, died in America in 1789. According to Slovak sources,46 the first immigrant of Slovak descent who permanently settled in America was Major John L. Polerecky (1748- 1830). However, in studying the early records of the Moravian Church, I came recently across the name of an individual from Bratislava who lived in the Moravian community of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in the mideighteenth century. He was Anton Schmidt (1725-1793), a tinsmith by trade, who emigrated with his parents “for conscience sake” and came to Bethlehem in 1746. He must have been an adherent of the renewed Unitas fratrum since he was buried with other Moravian Brethren in the Old Moravian Cemetery in Bethlehem.47 Furthermore, he was listed in the Register of Members of Moravian Church.48 Very little is known about him otherwise, except that he was married twice, once to Anna Catherine Riedt (in 1747) with whom he had five children, and the second time to the Jewess Beata Ysselstein who bore him six children. The most celebrated early settler of Slovak origin in America was the already mentioned John L. Polerecky, Major of Lauzun’s Polish Lancers, a grandson of Major Matthias Polerecky (1662-1709) of Mosovcie, Turiec County in Slovakia, who had lost his life in the Hungarian War of Independence.49 Born and educated in France, Major Polerecky was a member of the Allied French Military Force engaged in the American Revolutionary War. At the conclusion of the War, he decided to stay in America and settled in Dresden, Maine, where he held the office of Town Clerk for many years.50 NOTES [pageend91]In t h e Fo o t pr in t s o f t h e Fir st Cz e c h Immig r an t s 87 1.

It is amusing that early in history a noted German scholar, Franz Löher put forth the view that America was not discovered by Columbus but rather by his contemporary, Martin Behaim (1459-1507) of Nürnberg (see Löher’s Geschichte und Zustande der Deutschen in Amerika, Cincinnati: Eggers & Wulkop, 1847). The first chapter of this book, entitled “Martin Behaim der Entdecker Amerikas,” opens with the statement: “Not to Italians, Spanish, French, and English only belongs the honor of having discovered the new continent beyond the sea, explored it, settled it, and made it blossom. The Germans, from Martin Behaim, the discoverer of America, to Alexander von Humboldt, the investigator of the nature of that land, have an equal claim to all the achievements there which the European peoples inscribed for themselves upon the pages of history. ” Loher celebrates Behaim not only as the first European to view the coast of America off Brazil, in the year 1483, as he claims, but also as the instructor in western navigation of both the putative later discoverers and explorers, Columbus and Magellan. Thus in his view, Germany should be doubly credited with the discovery of the New World. Although Löher’s claim was disputed and ridiculed (see for example Joseph Schaeffer’s editorial comment: “Knowledge is not Enough,” Wisconsin Magazine of History 23 (1939): 89-109), Behaim was known to take part in the expedition of Diego Cao (1485-1486) that followed the coast of Africa to Cape Cross. His most important work, which places him among the greatest geographers of the Renaissance, was his terrestrial globe, the earliest extant one known, that has been preserved in Nürnberg. What role this globe played in the discovery of the New World, is not known. Of course, Behaim was not a German; rather he was of Bohemian descent. The name Behaim is the old German equivalent of the currently used term “Boehme” (Bohemian) which, prior to the usage of family surnames, was usually given to individuals who came from Bohemia or were at least of Bohemian origin. According to family tradition, as related by the authoritative Ottův slovník naučný, vol. 3 (Prague: J. Otto, 1890, 618-19), the Behaim family emigrated to Nürnberg from Bohemia after the death of the Czech Duke Vratislav I. 3.

[pageend95]Distinctive Characteristics of Slovak Immigration to America Joseph Stasko As the title suggests, I intend to avoid any historical description and detailed statistics of Slovak immigration to the United States. My purpose is to provide a condensed account of the social, cultural and political presence of the Slovak ethnic group in American society. The fact that the Slovaks have always lived at the crossroads of cultural and ideological streams, amidst the power struggles of various races and nations, alerted them to external pressures and taught them to adjust to circumstances. They have relied upon their Christian faith and personal endurance and their inbred hard-working, industrious, generous, and peace-loving disposition. By nature, Slovaks are a migratory people.1 In the last 250 years they migrated from the mountainous regions of their homeland to Hungarian Plains or to the great cities; indeed, the “wandering” became a way of life, an escape from desperate poverty.2 Once “wandering” got into their blood, it grew to addiction.3 In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries over 250,000 Slovaks settled in the farming regions of Hungary4 fleeing famine, cholera and unemployment. In the second half of the last century a mass emigration of Slovaks left their country looking for a means of survival. The majority of them emigrated to the New World — first the United States, and later Canada and Argentina. Their flight recalls the exodus of Armenians and Jews from the Soviet Union or the boat people. With the memory of poverty still fresh in their minds, Slovaks gratefully accepted the lowest-paying and most dangerous jobs. Their fervent faith in God, their love of the old country, their close-knit community and their language and customs clustered them into distinctive groups, thus protecting them from [pageend96]92 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al melting into the mainstream of American life. Today’s statistics support data that over two million Americans pride themselves on being of Slovak origin and approximately 750,000 of them acknowledge their Slovak roots.5 Although we can trace individual Slovaks in America to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries6, the mass immigration occurred in the last two decades of the last century and at the beginning of the present one. All subsequent immigrations had been limited in number and more diverse in motivations. The following periodization of the waves of Slovak immigration to the United States will help to identify and analyze each period.7 1880-1914 Pre-World-War-I Immigration 1919-1938 Post-World-War-1 Immigration 1945-1947 Post-World-War-II Immigration 1948-1967 Post-Communist Takeover Immigration 1968- Post-Dubček Immigration 1880-1914: The Pre-World-War-I Immigration This is the so-called “mass immigration” of the Slovaks, caused by social problems of Europe and specifically of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Workers, laborers and peasants with or without land, all struggled for their physical survival. They fled famine, disease, and unemployment. The news of an open door policy to America spread rapidly and motivated thousands of Slovaks to seize the opportunity to search for work. Once in America, these much despised uneducated people with an illiteracy rate of 20.6% proved their human and economic worth.8 Among the unfortunate mass of uprooted Slovaks there were also Slovak priests, teachers, journalists, and members of the professions. The latter fled their home country mainly for political reasons; they were persecuted by the Magyars for their allegiance to Slovak nationality. Altogether, this immigration totaled approximately 650,000.9 Through the assiduous efforts of Slovak leaders over a period of thirty years, the Slovaks underwent a remarkable social and cultural reorientation. With newly gained responsibilities at work and in Slovak communal life, they experienced for the first time the pleasure and [pageend97]Dist in c t iv e Ch ar ac t e r ist ic s o f Sl o v ak Immig r at io n 93 satisfaction of individual dignity. These immigrants laid the foundations for the social, cultural and political organizations that still form a solid frame of Slovak ethnic life in America. They founded 277 different fraternal, civic, religious and cultural organizations, eleven of which still prosper; they built 325 churches and 200 parish schools; they founded religious societies (there are currently approximately 650 priests and monks and about a thousand sisters). Between 1885 and 1918 they published 109 newspapers, 42 almanacs and scores of books and pamphlets; they organized folk festivals, theatrical and gymnastic performances, and picnics. They preserved the Slovak language, customs, foods, and wedding, baptismal and funeral ceremonies. They defended Slovak national interests and claims for freedom and self-government (Apponyi, 1910 and Karolyi, 1914). They formed favorable conditions for the liberation of the Slovak nation from the Magyar yoke during World War I. With the Czechs they created the Cleveland Agreement (October, 1915) and the Pittsburgh Agreement (May 30, 1918) which later became a bone of contention between the Czech government and the Slovaks. They introduced the Cyril and Methodius cult among the Slovaks in America and built 32 churches consecrated to the saints’ names. They helped the Slovak leadership at home with money and moral support by publishing their articles, studies and books in America. They successfully refuted Magyar invectives against the Slovaks in America and publicly chastized the Slovak pro-Magyar priests, who betrayed their own nation. Between 1900 and 1912, they sent more than 500 million crowns to Slovakia.10 1919-1938: The Post-World-War-I Immigration Between 1919 and 1925 about 34,000 Slovaks returned to the old country in the hope of finding jobs or obtaining some of the land distributed by the new Czechoslovak government. Most Slovaks from America found no jobs or land, however, and were forced to return to the New World. Many others applied for visas but were denied entry to the USA by the restrictions imposed by the new immigration laws of 1921 and 1924.11 Nonetheless, between 1919 and 1938 74,000 Slovaks immigrated to America.12 [pageend98]94 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al Existing Slovak communities fully absorbed the new immigrants, who participated in the cultural and political activities sponsored by Slovak organizations. Their greatest contribution was in the political arena, to which they added arguments for Slovak autonomy in their homeland. Frequent visits of Slovak religious, cultural, and political leaders stimulated their activities. During the inter-war period Slovak life in America was strongly affected by the Czech government’s disregard of Slovak national claims stipulated in the Pittsburgh Agreement. Only the small number of American Slovaks belonging to Czech or Czechoslovak organizations supported the official Czechoslovak national policy. Although some preferred the progressive acquisition of national self-determination, a majority grew impatient with and distrustful of the Czechs and turned separatist. Disagreements between the Czechs and the Slovaks gave rise to long-lasting animosity and created mutual cultural aloofness. 1945-1947: The Post-World-War-II Immigration The political scene of Europe after World War II was chaotic. People of various ethnic backgrounds migrated from Central and Eastern Europe to the West to escape the Soviet Army, Communist violence and persecution. Many Slovaks reached American shores and benefitted from America’s generous asylum policy. A number of the refugees were politicians, writers, journalists, and military men who had supported the Slovak state. Over 7,000 received affidavits from relatives or compatriots enabling them to emigrate to America and approximately 3,000 Slovaks came to the United States under the allowed quota after several years in European transit camps.13 For these immigrants the liberation of Czechoslovakia meant the destruction of the Slovak state, the introduction of Communist ideology in Slovakia, and national dependence on the Prague government. The similarity between their political views and those of existing Slovak organizations in America facilitated their integration into the cultural and political arena. They saw the struggle for Slovak self-rule as a struggle for self-determination and culturally disassociated themselves from the Czechs and from the concept of Czechoslovakia in general, an attitude that proved [pageend99]Dist in c t iv e Ch ar ac t e r ist ic s o f Sl o v ak Immig r at io n 95 both politically and culturally unproductive because it closed the doors for cooperation with their home country, with other Slovak groups abroad, and with the Czechs in America. In spite of their isolationism, however, these immigrants played — and still play — a major role in Slovak life in America. They founded new cultural institutions and organizations, such as the Slovak Institute in Cleveland and Rome; the Slovak Writers’ and Artists’ Association, and the Federation of Slovak Journalists and Newspapermen. They were also instrumental in founding the Institute of Saint Cyril and Methodius in Rome. On the literary front, they founded and published literary magazines, like Most and Literárny almanac, and produced hundreds of books. This immigration is also credited with founding the series Slovak Studies whose four subseries — Historica, Philosophica, Politico, and Bibliographica (all written in languages other than Slovak or Czech) — have been recognized and highly acclaimed by scholars. Many of its members have become teachers, professors at colleges and universities, or scientists and have achieved public recognition. Their children are career-oriented, half-Americanized and have a much broader outlook on life. 1948-1967: The Post-Communist Takeover Immigration Between 1948 and 1967 approximately 5,000 Slovaks immigrated to the United States. The majority of them had been leading figures in public life in Slovakia. Ideologically, they were strongly anti-Communist and fought for the restoration of an independent, democratic Czechoslovakia. Existing Slovak organizations and previous immigrants did not welcome these newcomers because their political leaders were not in favor of Slovak independence. They therefore founded their own political organization, the Permanent Conference of Slovak Democratic Exiles, which eventually became a constituent member of the Czechoslovak “umbrella” organization, the Council of Free Czechoslovakia. Culturally, they allied with the Czechs in Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences. By publishing studies relevant to Slovak history and cooperating with the Czechs, they have broadened the Slovak political spectrum and added a new political vantage point to the Slovak cause. [pageend100]96 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al The precise number of these immigrants cannot be established by official statistics, though an approximation may be made by counting applications for United States citizenship. 1968-cont.: The Post-Dubček Immigration Not all Slovaks who left Czechoslovakia after the Warsaw Pact Invasion in August 1968 were “Socialists with a human face.” Many malcontents were merely students, technical workers or non-aligned doctors, lawyers, writers, scholars and scientists. Of the 11,000 who came to the West, 6,000 joined their fellow Slovaks in America. Many pursued successful careers in the professions, taking full advantage of American freedom and opportunity. Less politicized than the previous immigrations and more moderate in their political views and attitudes, they were reluctant to join existing Slovak organizations and formed pragmatic groups with non-ideological principles. Only recently have they begun to take part in activities promoting cultural plurality and democratic principles. Although the Slovak World Congress, an organization formed in 1970 to facilitate contacts among Slovaks throughout the world, came about primarily to involve this new group, only one third of them joined. The generation which lived under socialist indoctrination and political pressure has avoided public involvement in the disputes of the older generations. Although their national feelings are strong, they have no chauvinistic overtones. Their attitude has had a sobering effect on Slovak relations and reflects a much more objective view on the issue of Czecho-Slovak cooperation. Clearly, this wave does not want to blend together with the previous waves of immigration. Certain features of Slovaks in America make them distinguishable from other ethnic groups. They include allegiance to certain church and religious organization, close family ties, specific child-rearing patterns, and kinship structures. The use of Slovak at home and at ethnic events is prevalent. Slovak customs, costumes, dances, songs, ceremonies, weddings, baptisms, funerals are all preserved as is a love of the old country and strong nationalistic feelings, personal generosity, assiduity, sociability, and cheerfulness. Respect for authority makes Slovaks law-abiding citizens with minimal criminal records. Some characteristics, [pageend101]Distinctive Characteristics of Slovak Immigration 97 however, tend to inhibit Slovaks in full participation in the cultural and political process: a lack of entrepreneurial spirit, limited ambition for specific cultural and scientific pursuits, including academic careers, and a tendency toward acculturation with surrounding ethnic clusters. The migrations of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries were all spontaneous and unprepared. There was little social responsibility to curb exploitation of innocent newcomers. The complexity of this demographic, social, and political problem had an enormous impact on the individual and communal psychology of the Slovaks. The texture of American society in the second half of the nineteenth century was culturally and politically nurtured and determined by the “old stock” or Anglo-Saxon population and the view of American history which taught that only pilgrim forefathers and their descendants were responsible for the growth of America and recognized no serious contributions by “foreigners.” Although this notion was diluted by the influx of non-Anglo-Saxon immigrants, it took time and humiliation before the plurality of ethnic cultures, races, and religions were included in the definition of America. Judged by the criteria of the “old immigration,” the Slovaks fit the stereotypical picture of all East European ethnics: they were considered barbaric, of an inferior race, uneducated, and dangerous. Faced with this prejudice and discrimination, the Slovaks of the mass immigration remained in their ghettos away from the malice and scorn of the domineering culture. They felt their ethnic group as an extended family which took care of itself by setting up organizations, old-age homes, loan funds, charitable societies as well as church and cultural associations. Time did not dissolve these Slovak communities completely; it changed them while preserving their distinctiveness. The assimilatory influence of American society, according to Glazer and Moynihan, operates effectively on all. Assimilation changes the children of immigrants and sometimes even the immigrants themselves. Many lose their language and alter their culture. It is reasonable to expect, they say, a new American type to emerge, a new nationality in which it is a matter of indifference whether a man is of Anglo-Saxon, German, Italian, or Jewish origin.14 The power of assimilation affects various groups differently. Some ethnics melt quicker than others. Some exhibit common American [pageend102]98 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al characteristics, but retain distinctive features. Michael Novak believes that the American dream is culturally pluralistic and America is “a nation not of atomic individuals, but of dynamic, interacting groups, each of which brings forth its best to help build a just and equitable society”; he believes that “people who are secure in their past and joyful in their present cannot but be helpful in their future”; he calls this the “new ethnicity.”15 Howard F. Stein in his research among third- and fourth- generation Slovak-American families and institutions comes to the conclusion that “Slovak-American ethnicity over the past century has dramatically changed from a relatively homogenous public expression of community form, function, structure, meaning and relationship to a far more heterogenous, individualized private matter. This privatization of ethnicity had led many scholars to conclude that ethnicity has disappeared. This is nonsense: it has been repattemed, some elements retained, others given up.”16 The post-World-War-II immigrants somewhat revitalized ethnic awareness among Slovaks. Because of their higher educational level the more recent immigrants have blended into the mainstream of American society with greater ease. There is, however, a substantiated belief that for a period of a few more generations the Slovaks in America will remain ethnically alive, aware of their distinctive identity and cultural specificity.

[pageend107]Baltimore’s Czech Community: The Early Years Eva Slezak Of the many ethnic groups in Maryland, one of the least visible these days are the Czechs. At one time Baltimore City boasted an active, thriving community of 12,000 to 15,000 people of Czech descent; today few of the former colony remain. This paper will endeavor to present an overview of the early history of the Czech community in Baltimore. By focusing on a few individuals and institutions, from its origins to shortly before the turn of the century, this brief introduction will give some sense of the environment in which the early Czech “osada” (colony) flourished. Even though the Czechs called themselves “Češi,” the outside world referred to them as Bohemians, a term that will also be used in this paper. In the second half of the nineteenth century, Baltimore was a bustling, prosperous and rambunctious port city. Blessed with a natural harbor and a convenient crossroads location, it soon became the hub of activity not only for commercial transportation and transactions, but also a transfer point for immigrants going to the Midwest, the latter becoming even more attractive to shipping lines because of the lower port of entry tax and the proximity to railroads. Newcomers disembarked at Locust Point where the North German Lloyd Line’s steamers — Braunschweig, Leipzig, Berlin, Baltimore, Bremen, Nürnberg, and Ohio — brought passengers seeking new life. Weekly crossings continued until the outbreak of World War I. Between 1868 and 1900, 600,000 immigrants flowed through the port; some stayed, but most stopped only long enough to touch dry land before they boarded trains at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad terminal which took them to points west.1 Even though Czechs may have arrived in Baltimore as early as 1845, [pageend108]104 Czechoslovak and Central European Journal one of the earliest settlers to be known by name (and identified as Bohemian) was Thomas Cermak2, who landed in Baltimore in 1847, at the age of 19. He began learning the butcher trade, but lured by the California gold fever of 1849, went West. Drifting to Texas, he established a cattle ranch, but after some difficulties, including Indian attacks, he returned to Baltimore shortly before the Civil War. After the war he returned to Baltimore once again and resumed his trade as a butcher.3 Although not listed in the city directories, he is listed in the 1868 Police Census of Baltimore City, as living in the 20th Ward, in the northwestern part of the city. By then he was 36, married to Margaret, 31, with four children: William (8), Frank (6), Mary (3), and Alphons (8 months). He stayed in contact with his countrymen as is evidenced by his signature on a letter dated December 19, 1877. A faithful Catholic, he and several other members of St. Wenceslaus sent a letter to the newly appointed Archbishop James Gibbons, citing the deplorable conditions existing at the church and school. The letter notes that about 200 Bohemian families belonged to the congregation.4 By this time there was a fairly sizeable and noticeable Bohemian colony, concentrated in the eastern section of the city, as at the time of the Civil War and shortly thereafter Czechs began to appear in considerable numbers. Supposedly, about ten families, the vanguard of the Bohemian colony, came before 1860. Records indicate that in 1870, 789 people of Czech stock came to Maryland. In 1880 the immigration had risen to 1169; in 1890 there was an increase to 1554 and by 1900 the number had nearly doubled to 2813. Although some individuals went into the counties, the majority of Czechs settled in Baltimore. The settlers were employed predominantly in industry and commerce.5 The majority of Czech immigrants in Baltimore were Roman Catholics. A noted Czech immigrant who left his mark on Maryland, especially Baltimore, was John (Jan) Nepomucene (Nepomuk) Neumann (1811-1860), from Prachatice. Inspired by the ideal of St. Paul as a missionary, he resolved to spend his life as a priest in America. His interest in the Redemptorist order led him to Baltimore and on January 6, 1847, he became the first Redemptorist priest professed in America. In 1848 he became an American citizen. During his ten-year tenure in Baltimore, Neumann continued his mission and exhibited his skills as an organizer and builder. He was the first canonical rector of St. Alphonsus [pageend109]Bal t imo r e ’s Cz e c h Co mmu n it y: 105 Church and for a short while was even superior of all Redemptorists in the United States. He left Maryland when he was installed as Bishop of Philadelphia in 1852.6 In 1870 the eight to nine hundred Czech Catholics still had no church or a regular Czech-speaking priest. Autumn of that year saw the arrival of Father Valentine (Wendulin) Vacula from Bohemia. Prior to his coming, the Reverend John N. Berger, a Czech-born Redemptorist priest and nephew of Bishop John Neumann, had been attending to the immigrants. His duties as curate of St. Alphonsus Church precluded full-time service to the Czechs and he worked hard to bring a Bohemian priest to Baltimore. Father Vacula worked energetically and within a year and a half he had bought a former German Lutheran Church for $11,000. On May 26, 1872, this church was dedicated in honor of St. Wenceslaus. The church seated 400 and was intended to serve Czechs, Poles and Lithuanians. The next decade was plagued with upheavals, dissensions and controversy. Vacula’s successor, the Reverend Alois Heller, was able to pay off most of the debts which had accrued, but because of failing health he had to leave. In the years that followed, there were frequent changes in pastors with interim leadership provided by the Redemptorist Fathers, specifically the Reverend Anthony Urbanik, or Urban, as he was known. Despite all the problems and occasional setbacks, a parochial school was established, the parish was growing rapidly and in 1885 a former Universalist Church was purchased for $21,000. It seated nine hundred; the congregation, including Poles and Lithuanians, numbered about 5,000. The final and permanent move was in 1901 to the church’s present site on Ashland and Collington Avenues.7 The move followed the parishioners’ trend toward relocating in the northeast section of the city. Two Protestant churches also existed. The Mt. Tabor Bohemian Methodist Episcopal Church held services in the Appold Church on Chase Street near Washington Street. The Bohemian and Moravian Presbyterian Church was located on Ashland Avenue near Washington Street. The congregation was organized in April 1890 by Rev. Vaclav Losa, a Moravian. At that time, he had a congregation of fifteen persons. Their services were held in Faith Chapel, on Gay Street and Broadway, until 1898, when their own building was completed. By then the congregation had grown to a membership of ninety and had a Sunday-school with 165 [pageend110]106 Czechoslovak and Central European Journal children. The new building and lot cost $12,000. Funds raised by the members were augmented by the Presbyterian Association and private contributions from the American and Bohemian communities, both in Baltimore and out-of-state.8 Another great influence in the Czech community was Sokol. An attempt to form one in Baltimore was made several times in the 1860s but did not succeed until July 6, 1872. On the anniversary of Jan Hus’s burning at the stake, the Sokolská Jednota Blesk came into being in a cigar factory office, the office of Ad. R. Melcher, the factory’s bookkeeper. This factory, formed in 1870 by John D. Kremelberg, the Austrian consul, employed many Czechs.9 The sixteen founding members were V.J. Shimek, Ad. R. Melcher, Jos. Karas, V.E. Hirsauer, Jos. Shimek, Fr. Štetka, Jos. Houska, Josef Sip, Jan Mendlin, Stepan Skoch, Fr. Mathaus, Jan Degenhard, A. Chotek, Jos. Frohan, Jos. Mathas and Ant. Mathas.10 That very day, the following officers were elected: President V. J. Shimek, Vice President Fr. Mathaus and Treasurer Jan Mendlin. The goals set forth were education of the membership and perpetuation of the Czech language and song, the teaching of gymnastics, and sponsoring cultural events. Activities were held in various places, including Shimek’s Hall, also known as Bohemia Hall. In 1902 Sokol found a home in the building on Gay and Preston Streets where Shimek had relocated his Bohemia Hall.11 Today both former Bohemia Halls still survive, serving as churches in the local black community.12 One of the pioneer families listed in the 1870 Federal Census was the Shimek family. The father, Joseph, was an organ builder. His son Václav, also known as Wenceslaus, later Americanized his name to Vincent or just plain V.J. Not only did he inherit his father’s skills and business acumen, but also his political astuteness and leadership qualities. “Colonel” V.J. Shimek became known as the “Mayor of Baltimore’s Bohemia” and remained the guiding light until his death in 1912 of tuberculosis,13 a prevalent cause of death in Baltimore in the early part of the twentieth century. V.J. was born in Klatovy and came to Baltimore as a young man of 15.14 By the age of 22 he was operating a barrel-organ factory. He also had a factory in Philadelphia for a number of years. His establishment on North Broadway, only a few doors from his residence, housed a hall [pageend111]Bal t imo r e ’s Cz e c h Co mmu n it y: 107 available for meetings and dances, a restaurant and a printing concern. For some time he led a Bohemian weekly paper, The Telegraf, and also contributed to other Bohemian publications in the United States. He kept in contact with other Czech communities in cities like Chicago and New York as well as those in rural areas. He participated in many Bohemian societies. Like his father, his activities were not limited to the Bohemian community as is manifested by his active membership in numerous German societies.15 As part of his generous nature, he would greet newly arrived countrymen whenever he could, shepherding them to safety, shelter and food. As he was in contact with local firms, he helped people find jobs. Baltimore’s politicians and newspapers recognized him as a political force in East Baltimore by dubbing him “the Bohemian Mayor of Northeast Baltimore.”16 On October 3, 1872, V.J. and his brother Frank became United States citizens,17 and in 1873 V.J. married Mary B. Kletzen. His mother-in-law, Lena Kletzen, was a property owner in her own right.18 The young couple resided with her in her home on Barnes Street. Before his marriage, V.J. had lived across the street with his parents, brothers and sisters.19 Mary, his wife, was bom in Maryland, which indicates that her parents, Joseph, a tailor, and Lena, a tailoress, had immigrated by 1854.20 Joseph enlisted in the 6th Maryland Regiment, Company K, on September 8, 1862, at the age of 36.21 Lena’s foresight and business acumen were revealed when she applied for the bounty February 23, 1863; Joseph’s pay was to be sent to her.22 By 1866 Lena owned the house on Barnes Street. She and her daughter signed a petition in 1873 requesting the Mayor and City Council to construct sewers in the area. This petition was significant because the majority of the signers were Czech.23 Funds were appropriated for the request.24 The same names frequently appeared on documents. It was a close-knit community, mostly Bohemian, but also with Germans and Americans who in many instances had grown up near each other. Thus, their knowledge of civic rights and how to obtain them through political channels was rather sophisticated as is exemplified by various additional petitions. In 1880, residents of Barnes Street requested compensation for water damage.25 On another occasion, in 1884, several citizens asked Mayor Ferdinand C. Latrode “for the appointment of an Interpreter in the [pageend112]108 Czechoslovak and Central European Journal City Departments. All other Large Cities have one but Baltimore City.” The petitioners recommended Frank Shimek, “as he speaks Five (5) Different Languages....”26 Despite the fact that V.J. Shimek never held an elected office, he built a power base that greatly benefitted the community. Another prominent community leader was Joseph Klečka. In 1880 he lived next door to V.J. Shimek27 and was a pallbearer for Joseph Shimek, V.J.’s father, in 1890.28 Klecka’s son August acted as a City Councilman from 1915 to 1933 and a United States Marshall until his death in 1946.29 His younger brother, Joseph, Jr., became the first Maryland lawyer of Czech descent. His much younger brother, James, also became an attorney and later a judge of the People’s Court in Baltimore.30 Bom in Nehodiv, a small village near Klatovy, Klečka came to America in 1871, a mere lad of 17. Upon his arrival he found few of his countrymen and a dubious welcome. In those days the unwary foreigner was persecuted in many ways and pitched battles were not uncommon. Due to his large size, Klečka became a leader among his countrymen. His first six months were spent as a day laborer in the iron-ore banks of what is now northeast Baltimore. After familiarizing himself with the American language, he struck out for the Eastern Shore near Oxford, Maryland, where he engaged in fishing which proved so renumerative that he was able to acquire his own boat, the Bohemia. On his visits to Baltimore, he fell in love with a Bohemian girl, Maria Hranicka, who would not marry him because of the time he spent at sea. When in 1874 he sold the boat and returned to Baltimore, he married her and assisted her in tailoring. But, due to his size, the needle was not for him, so he opened a saloon, “Český Hostinec,” at 1513 Ashland Avenue in 1875. That enterprise proved very successful, with his wife in the kitchen arranging free food and specialties for the day. To increase the size, he later purchased the neighboring two houses for the “Elk Bowling Alleys. ” Along with Anton Steigler, he became involved as a sponsor for Bohemian immigrants who entered the port of Baltimore on the North German Lloyd steamers at Locust Point.31 At the saloon Klečka met and talked to many business people as the sponsoring not only meant loaning the immigrants money, finding them a home, but also finding them a job that they were suited for. One family named Huebel was picked up at the [pageend113]Bal t imo r e ’s Cz e c h Co mmu n it y: 109 dock in the morning, placed in a house on Ashland Avenue and by noon the same day Mr. Huebel was working as a tool maker.32 After the Bohemians paid off their sponsored loans, they looked to Pop Klečka, as he was called, for someone to loan them money to purchase a home. As loans or mortgages were hard to obtain, especially for immigrants, many bankers took advantage of them. One morning, Joseph, Sr. was discussing the situation and his willingness to help at the breakfast table with his two sons, August and Joseph, Jr., who suggested that Pop Klečka get nine men together and start a savings and loan. He drew up the articles of incorporation and received a charter on May 1, 1900 for the Bohemian Building, Loan and Savings Association “Slavie” Incorporated.33 The original meeting took place May 14, 1900 on the second floor above Joseph Klečka’s saloon at Ashland Avenue and Dallas Street. The twenty assembled members elected the following directors: Joseph Klečka, Sr., Jaroslav Franc, Anton Stiegler, Anton Švejda, František Kyzr, Vaclav Sudak, Joseph W. Coufal, Vaclav Kaden, Ondrej Kucká. The Board of Directors elected Joseph Klečka, Sr., President and Anton Švejda, Secretary. The first order of business was the collection of $79.50 and entered in the records as $45.00 to savings and $34.50 to assessments; $5.00 to be spent for books necessary to conduct the associations’ business. Twenty persons attending the first meeting pledged anywhere from $4.00 to $20.00, totalling $138.00.34 Almost twenty years prior to Slavic’s inception, six men met on the second floor of Anton Rytina’s Bar, 1919 East Fairmount Avenue, on August 23, 1879. They organized The Fairmount and Chapel Streets Permanent Building, Savings and Loan Association No. 1 Inc. On October 20th that same year it was incorporated with a total membership of 27. Of the thirty-four dollars collected for deposits, $2.50 were designated to purchase a ledger. The first officers were: Anton Rytina, President; Francis Korbel, Vice President; Joseph Sott, Secretary and Jan Moravec, Treasurer. On November 20, 1879, the first annual meeting was held; total deposits were $311.75. Until 1948 all records were kept in the Czech language.35 Its basic philosophy of service remained constant, thus enabling Fairmount Federal Savings Bank to survive various national and state bank crises, ready to continue into the next century. Although Joseph F. Shimanek, manufacturer of carriages and wagons, [pageend114]110 Czechoslovak and Central European Journal did not have an extraordinary career, his success was typical of many of his countrymen. He learned the blacksmith trade from his father. In 1870 he sailed for America and arrived in Baltimore. At first he followed his old trade, working for various large wagon-making firms in the city. In time he went into partnership with Frank Levy to establish a firm on Ashland and Chapel Streets. He later bought out his partner, and in 1877 Shimanek married Annie Kalal.36 In December of that year, he was a signer of the letter to Archbishop Gibbons, referred to earlier. In Baltimore, the name Ruzicka was for many years synonymous with excellence in bookbinding.37 Vaclav, his wife, and six children emigrated to this country in 1879, arriving on July 21 aboard the ship Leipzig.38 Forty-four years old, with little money, with no knowledge of the English language, he used his skill at bookbinding to establish a business that was flourishing by 1882.39 His son, Joseph, expanded the business beyond the borders of Maryland to North Carolina, actively participating in the trade until his death in 1966.40 These brief biographical sketches illustrate the character of the community. Most were tradesmen, either self-employed or working in surrounding factories or shops. The Czech adage, “řemeslo má zlaté dno” (“trade/craftsmanship has a golden bottom/or foundation”) certainly held true. Tailoring, shoemaking, carpentry and masonry were among the more prevalent trades. One entire block of Broadway was known as “Tailors Row.”41 If, as sometimes happened, one’s chosen trade was not in demand, the immigrant learned another, created his own job or started a business. Saloon-keeping in particular became popular and profitable. One interesting facet of Baltimore’s version of the “hospoda” (beer-hall) was the loaning of money. These loans enabled people to purchase their own businesses, tools and most of all, their own homes. One did not ask how much you make, but rather how much you save.42 The Czechs usually came with their families. An informal survey of segments of the 1880 Federal Census shows a nuclear family (both parents) with a range of 1 to 9 children, the average about 4 to 8 in number, often in two year intervals. The predominant names for women were Sophie, Annie, Frances or Fannie, Barbara, Mary, Tema, Catherine or Kate with an occasional Florence, Lena (Magdeline), Rosa, Louisa, Lizzie or Elizabeth, Josephine, Dora and Eugenia. Popular names for men [pageend115]Baltimore’s Czech Community: 111 were John, Joseph, Frank, James, Thomas, Charles and Michael. With less frequency appeared George, Adam, Peter, Lewis (or Louis), Anton, August, Andrew, Albert, William and Stephen. Women generally stayed home — keeping house was the occupation noted in the Census. They may have done piece-work at home which was not uncommon in those times: Baltimore was a center of the garment industry. Women whose husbands were tailors were listed as tailoresses while young women in their early teens or twenties were often listed as berry-pickers, servants, or they did sewing at home. One exception was the young woman who was a shoemaker like her father. Young male teenagers were either at school, errand boys, picking berries, laborers, or apprentices to their fathers’ trades, especially tailoring and shoemaking or repair. It is never adequate to mention only the outstanding luminaries. One must remember the innumerable people whose names may never appear, but whose individual efforts are immeasurable. Versatility and adaptability ensured the success and prosperity of the Bohemian colony. Their reputation as hardworking people led them to be sought after as workers. Each influx of immigrants brought increased vitality and people eager to work for and participate in the American dream. These early settlers — the pioneers — built the foundations for Baltimore’s Bohemia which continued to be the nucleus for the next generation’s social and political activities. The twentieth century was to reap and enjoy the harvest of the nineteenth century’s investment. For whatever reasons — economic, political, religious — they came to stay. Although a number of local studies and papers have been produced, a full history still remains to be written. The threads of Czech contributions are still to be gathered and woven into the colorful tapestry of Czech-American history. NOTES 1.

[pageend119]Slovaks in Cleveland, 1870-1930: Neighborhoods, Politics and Nationality Relations Michael J. Kopanic, Jr. Cleveland is the home of one of the largest Slovak communities in the United States, yet it has hardly received the attention it deserves from scholars of Slovak ethnic and immigration history. Since Jan Pankuch published his pioneering Dejiny clevelandských a lakewoodských Slovákov in 1930, no one has written a thorough study which would focus on the development of one of the largest Slovak communities in a city which boasted a population of over 900,000 and became the sixth largest American city in the first half of the twentieth century. According to the 1920 census, about 35,000 Slovaks lived there after World War I. It is estimated that by 1970 about 70,000 people in the Cleveland area claim Slovak ethnic roots.1 This paper will present findings from my research on Slovaks in Cleveland in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The treatment is in no way definitive; rather, it is intended as a general introduction to be followed by a more comprehensive study. The range of topics covered include the establishment of Slovak neighborhoods, their political involvement, and nationality conflicts. Beginnings Slovaks first began to trickle into Cleveland during the 1870s. Unlike the Czechs who had established a colony in the city since the ill-fated revolutions of 1848, Slovak migration to Cleveland coincided with the rapid expansion of the steel and oil industries in the late nineteenth century. For the majority of Slovaks who moved there, Cleveland was not [pageend120]116 Czechoslovak and Central European Journal their first stop. Most came to Cleveland only after having worked in many of the coal mines and factories of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia, and Ohio. Well-known for their hard work for low wages, Slovaks easily found employment in the steel mills, machine shops, oil refineries, and other heavy industries in the city. Their migration to Cleveland from other parts of the United States and Canada continued through World War II.2 Others came to Cleveland in waves from particular villages and counties. Chain migration was most common during the early years of Slovak settlement in Cleveland. Relatives sent money home and friends heard the news of opportunities in the new land. After World War I, migration from other parts of the United States increased. New immigration laws restricted the number of Slavic people who could settle in America.3 The earliest Slovaks in Cleveland settled near their places of employment, on the banks of the Cuyahoga River, in the area which was then referred to as the Hay market area. They first lived around Hill, Berg, and Fourth Streets, in mixed neighborhoods populated by Poles, Czechs, and other Slavs with whom the Slovaks could communicate. Most typically, the earliest Slovak arrivals were young, single males who took up residence in one of the many new boarding houses which sprung up to house the rapidly expanding immigrant labor class at affordable prices. They later either sent for their sweethearts from back home, or returned to the Old Country after having saved enough money to buy a sizeable amount of land, or married one of the young Slovak or Slavic immigrant girls. Sometimes young males would make several trips back and forth to Slovakia before finally deciding to settle in America.4 The Neighborhoods and Churches As industry in Cleveland expanded and moved outward, the Slovak population followed. By the 1880s more and more Slovaks were settling in the lower Buckeye Road area in the eastern suburbs from what is now East 78th Street to Woodhill Road. The area became heavily populated with both Slovak and Magyar immigrants from Hungary who shared a common cultural background, and frequently some knowledge of Slovak, Magyar, or a bit of both.5 The Buckeye community grew rapidly after [pageend121]Sl o v ak s in Cl e v e l an d , 1870-1930: 117 1885. The desire to found their own church was a high priority once the Slovaks had sufficient numbers to warrant it. Previously, Slovaks were attending the Slovak German Franciscan Church of St. Joseph on Woodland Avenue, about a twenty minute walk from the oldest Slovak settlement. Rev. Stefan Furdek, a young Slovak priest from the Czech parish of Our Lady of Lourdes, offered a Sunday mass with a Slovak sermon. As more Slovaks moved to the east side, they naturally wished to found their own parish. Since Slovaks and Magyars could more easily build a church if they cooperated with one another, with the aid of Father Furdek they jointly founded the Roman Catholic parish of St. Ladislaus in 1887. The marriage of convenience did not last. Conflict ensued over which language would be used at mass. After Diocesan arbitration, the Slovaks maintained ownership of the church and paid the Magyars $1,000 for their past contribution at St. Ladislaus. The Magyars proceeded to found their own Church of St. Elizabeth, just a few blocks away on Buckeye Avenue.6 Future Slovak settlement in the area tended to be north of Woodhill, eventually as far as 116th Street, while many remained nearer the valley and close to St. Ladislaus. Magyars preferred to live closer to St. Elizabeth on the lower part of Buckeye, while later some moved in the Buckeye area atop the hill and farther east than many Slovaks. The neighborhoods remained mixed and many Slovaks and Magyars worked for Eberhard Manufacturing Co., National Screw and Tack Co., Mechanical Rubber Co., and other industrial companies in the valley adjacent to the Buckeye area. Surveys done during the late twenties showed that about ninety percent of all Slovaks worked in industry.7 As the Slovak neighborhood expanded and moved up the hill, St. Ladislaus Church became too small and the parish of St. Benedict’s was established in 1928 near East Boulevard (Martin Luther King Drive today) and Buckeye Road. Next to the church, Slovak Benedictine monks founded St. Andrew’s Abbey in 1928, and the first boys’ secondary school in the United States, Benedictine High School. The church, school, abbey, and neighborhood combined to make the Buckeye neighborhood one of the most active and vibrant Slovak settlements in America.8 While the Buckeye community continued to grow, Slovaks did not confine themselves to only a few areas. They moved to diverse parts of the city as the number of new jobs and new workers to fill them streamed [pageend122]118 Czechoslovak and Central European Journal into Cleveland. Internal migration continued within the city and on its outskirts. The original Slovak settlement near town moved eastward; Slovaks responded by building the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Greek Catholic parishes of St. Martin, Holy Trinity Evangelical, and St. John the Baptist (this included Rusyns) between East 20th and East 25th Streets.9 The pattern was clear: wherever Slovaks moved, they soon found the need to build their own church and a school. The ethnic neighborhood revolved around these institutions. They were the center of social life as well as their place of worship. Singing society practices, fraternal organizations’ meetings, celebrations, drama performances, and club meetings frequently took place in the church basement or hall. A Slovak church provided an additional motive to try to settle in a particular community. One Slovak noted that when his family decided to move to Cleveland, proximity to a Slovak church was a primary consideration in the decision.10 M. Mark Stolarik has pointed out that many Slovaks settled within a walking distance of about ten blocks from their church. As industry grew, so grew Slovak communities in other parts of the city. The expansion of the steel industry and the hiring of many immigrants at the American Steel and Wire Plant in the then suburb of Newburgh led in 1903 to the founding of St. Mary of the Nativity Church at East 93rd and Aetna Road, and the St. Joseph’s Byzantine Church at 9321 Orleans. Rusyns comprised about three-fourths of St. Joseph’s congregation.11 National self-awareness among Byzantines was less focused than among Roman Catholics and Lutherans. Religion ranked higher on the people’s priority list and they considered themselves Greek Catholics first, and “Slavish,” Slovak or Rusyn in ethnic origin second. The exclusivity of all major religions which the Slovaks adhered to and a condescending attitude of Roman Catholics toward the smaller Byzantine rite reinforced the primacy of faith.12 Nonetheless, the Slovak and Rusyn people lived in the Newburgh area together in relative harmony. As more Slovaks found jobs in the Cuyahoga Valley mills, they moved to the near west side in the ethnically mixed area bordered by Franklin, Fulton, West 19th and West 38th Streets and Columbus Avenue. According to local sources, the area was a rough working class neighborhood which was highly protective of its turf.13 In 1903, Slovaks established the Roman Catholic church St. Wendelin. It eventually became one of the largest ethnic Slovak parishes in Cleveland and counted over [pageend123]Sl o v ak s in Cl e v e l an d , 1870-1930: 119 700 families. As the Slovak colony expanded southward to the so-called Tremont area on the border of the gully near steel factories, Lutherans founded Dr. Martin Luther Evangelical Church at 2139 West 14th Street in 1910 and Greek Catholics attended the Church of the Holy Ghost on Kenilworth Avenue nearby West 14th Street.14 Slovak Catholics who wished to have a church and school closer to their homes petitioned the diocese in 1917 for a new church. After several years of refusals by the stubborn Bishop Farrelly, Slovaks in the Tremont area affiliated themselves with the Polish Independent Catholic Church and in 1917 founded the parish of St. John’s Independent Slovak Catholic Church at 2425 West 11th Street. In the twenties, the new Bishop Joseph Schrembs, who was more diplomatic in dealing with ethnic parishes, brought these secessionists back to the Roman Catholic hierarchy. The restored parish was renamed Our Lady of Mercy in 1922.15 Less information is available about the Congregational and Baptist churches on Cleveland’s west side. In both of these Protestant denominations, Slovaks and Czechs cooperated more with one another, partly because their smaller numbers necessitated a pooling of resources. In 1882 Rev. H.A. Schauffler was instrumental in founding the Bethlehem Church at Broadway and Fowler in the heart of the Czech community. He also aided in the establishment of the Theological Institute for Slovak Congregational Preachers in Oberlin and a Slavic Girls Bible School known as Schauffler College. At first, most Slovak congregationalists attended Bethlehem Church, but those on the west side still preferred a closer parish. Thus with Father Schauffler’s assistance, the Czechs constructed Cyril Chapel, which was later named Cyril Slovak Congregational Church as Slovaks came to outnumber the Czech members. The church also held services in the nearby city of Lakewood (west of Cleveland), although no chapel was ever built there.16 Members of Cyril Church also assisted in founding two Baptist congregations in Cleveland, one on Tremont Street on the south side and another on the west side at the comer of Scranton Road and Clark Avenue. The two parishes joined into one parish at the latter location. The Slovak Baptist Church merged with the Czechoslovak Baptist Church in 1921 and adopted the latter title. In 1925, some of the Czech members established a mission on the east side as well, on the comer of Corlett Avenue and [pageend124]120 Czechoslovak and Central European Journal East 127th Street. Both churches survived until the 1950s. Because of the very small numbers of Slovaks who belonged to the Baptist denomination, they assimilated more rapidly than the Catholics or other Protestants who have held services in their native Slovak tongue until the 1980s.17 Another Slovak section developed on the Northeast side of town in the predominantly Slovenian neighborhood when factories sprung up along the shores of Lake Erie. Large employers included Pittsburgh Paint and Glass Co., Otis Steel Co., Cleveland Stamping and Tool Co., and a plant of the American Steel and Wire Co. Most Slovaks lived between St. Clair and Payne Streets from East 40th to as far as East 55th Street. At East 51st Street and Superior Avenue Slovaks founded the parish of St. Andrew Svorad in 1906.18 Many Slovaks also moved to Lakewood to work at the National Carbon (today Union Carbide) plant on Madison Avenue and West 117th Street. The company bought nearby land and sold small inexpensive lots which many immigrants could afford to rent and eventually buy. Once they had moved into the area, Slovaks quickly founded their own churches. Since it was quite a burden to commute to Holy Trinity in central Cleveland, Lakewood Slovak Lutherans established Saint Peter and Paul. Eventually two other evangelical churches, Pentecostal and Gethsemane Churches, branched off due to congregational splits.19 Roman Catholics built Saint Cyril and Methodius Church at the comer of Lakewood and Madison Avenues.20 Greek Catholic Slovaks and Rusyns jointly founded St. Gregory’s at the comer of Thrush and Quail Streets.21 By 1905, even Slovak Calvinist founded a Presbyterian Church in Lakewood.22 Slovaks nicknamed the area Bird Town because many of the streets were named after birds (Robin, Lark, Quail, Thrush, and Plover). It was also called “Little Slovakia” because of the huge concentration of Slovaks, although a sizeable number of Poles and Rusyns lived there as well. The area remains a self-contained community with many businesses thriving to this day.23 According to the Immigration Bureau, in 1915 there was also a group of Slovaks in the area east of Broadway closer to downtown. These Slovaks attended either St. Martin’s or Father Furdek’s Czech parish of Our Lady of Lourdes.24 A small minority of Slovaks were not churchgoers. In fact, it appears that a few hundred socialist-oriented workers settled in the northern part of the Czech Broadway colony as well as on the near West and Southside, close to the [pageend125]Sl o v ak s in Cl e v e l an d , 1870-1930: 121 factories in the Cuyahoga Valley. The few Slovak freethinkers may very well have felt more comfortable in the largely Czech neighborhoods. It is still an area we know little about because sources are sparse and former members are still afraid to talk because the McCarthy anti-communist investigations of the 1950s.25 Another mixed area which requires additional research is the area just below Riverside Cemetery in southern Cleveland. Although there were no Slovak churches in the region, several industries provided plentiful employment in this area north of Brooklyn (Barkwill Brick Co., Cleveland Gas, Light and Coke Co., Electric Controller and Manufacturing Co., and Empire Rolling Mills). Some Slovaks here attended the Polish Catholic Church of St. Barbara.26 In summary, Slovaks were scattered across the city of Cleveland, in fact more so than most any other ethnic group. For example, Magyars tended to group themselves in two parts of town, the Buckeye area and the West Side. Czechs were concentrated in three areas: Broadway, the West Side, and the area north and east of the Buckeye area. This dispersion of the Slovaks in Cleveland had the less than desirable result of making the Slovak community more fragmented and less unified than for instance the Poles or Slovenes.27 This was one of the reasons why, despite the fact that there were over 35,000 Slovaks in the area by 1920, they were not able to maintain their own Slovak Hall (Národný slovenský dom), while every other large immigrant group from Central Europe built a non-denominational place for entertainment, plays, fraternal meetings, dancing, etc.28 The lack of a Slovak Hall also illustrates the disunity within the Slovak community. Most frequently, Slovaks held their social events at their individual churches and socialized less with Slovaks of other religions. For citywide events such as plays or lectures sponsored by the Slovak League, they used one of the Czech Sokol Halls on Buckeye Road or Clark Avenue and for very large gatherings they rented one of the German halls or Gray’s Armory.29 Why were Slovaks more fragmented than other nationality groups? One might cite a lower level of national consciousness as one reason; however, after moving to the United States many actually became more aware of their national identity. Some Slovaks in Cleveland preferred to be identified as Magyars (Hungarians) because of the higher social status associated with the latter group in the Old Country. The pastor of St. [pageend126]122 Czechoslovak and Central European Journal Benedict’s parish noted a propensity of many Slovak girls to marry Hungarian boys.30 Nationally-conscious Slovaks deplored those who visibly adopted the Magyar cloak and labeled them “Magyarones” and traitors to the nation. Generally, Slovaks attached less of a stigma to those who succumbed to Americanization, but community leaders were constantly urging their people to stay involved and also to instill national pride and consciousness in their children.31 Slovaks almost always attached a much greater value to their religious affiliation and faith than to their nationality origins. Father Furdek reinforced this belief with his slogan “Za Boha a národ” (For God and the nation); he meant it to remain in that order. Wherever Slovaks went, their churches followed. And once a Slovak church was built, more Slovak immigrants flocked to the area.32 In the national Slovak socialist newspaper published in Chicago, Rovnosť ľudu, Cleveland socialists constantly lambasted their fellow countrymen for being under the yoke of priests and ministers (most of their attacks were on Catholics) who allegedly blinded them and hindered their material progress.33 However, clerical opposition did not prevent some workers from belonging to the socialist-influenced Slovenský robotnícky spolok (SRS) and still regularly attending religious services.34 Regardless of the preachers’ denunciations of socialism in their native land as godless, some Slovak socialists had seen no contradiction in working for socialist goals and retaining their religious faith. In the new world, adhering to Christianity and socialism was part of an ongoing tradition.35 Politics Cleveland Slovaks became involved in both international and local politics; however, they played a much smaller role in city and state politics than other nationalities such as the Czechs or Poles. The first record of Slovak political action is traceable to September 1893, when Michal Rais, Jan Puhalla, and Jan Pankuch organized a Slovak Republican Club, which Pankuch called “a poor man’s club.” The Club organized lectures to teach Slovaks how to become American citizens and reached out to political candidates with issues that concerned Slovaks. In addition to serving as a prelude to a beer social after every meeting, the Club [pageend127]Sl o v ak s in Cl e v e l an d , 1870-1930: 123 became a fraternal self-help group for local Slovaks. It later changed its name to Clevelandská slovenská jednota and dropped its political functions as the original Slovak neighborhood near the center of town dispersed and the Democratic Party mobilized the vote of many Slovak Catholics. But the young Slovak Democratic club did not become very active until the mid-twenties.36 More extensive political involvement took place when specific issues spurred the Slovak population. For instance, when the Magyars tried to place a statue of Louis Kossuth in Cleveland Public Square in 1902, Slovak societies spearheaded the movement which brought forward other nationalities from around the city to protest. They launched a petition drive which canvassed neighborhoods across the city, and obtained signatures not only from their own people’s fraternal organizations and from other Slavs, but also from the Germans, the Irish, the Jews, and many other ethnic groups. The petition merely stated that only American heroes should be placed in public square and not those of any particular nationality.37 By keeping their demands moderate, the anti-Kossuth coalition forced the city government to rescind its permission to place the statue in Public Square. The local Magyars had to seek another site in the city outskirts in the University Circle area, where Kossuth stands to this day. The Kossuth controversy temporarily united Cleveland Slavs in the Slavic Alliance, but without specific issues to rally around, the organization faded within a couple years.38 After the Kossuth incident, there is little evidence of much Slovak involvement in city politics until the twenties. The local Slovak press did praise Mayor Tom Johnson for his support of a lower streetcar fare, and called this achievement one of the greatest in the nation which all cities should emulate.39 Few other politicians received much praise or harangue with the exception of occasional endorsement around election time. About sixty percent of the Slovaks voted Democratic according to local parish records.40 Slovak political involvement did not escalate again until international incidents sparked their indignation — the passage of the Apponyi Education Acts of 1906, which Magyarized many more Slovak grammar schools, and the Čemová Massacre in Slovakia. At Čemová, Hungarian gendarmes shot and killed unarmed people who were trying to allow a Slovak priest, Rev. Andrej Hlinka, to bless their church after he had been refused official permission because of his Slovak nationalist [pageend128]124 Czechoslovak and Central European Journal views. In defense of the people in the homeland, Rev. Furdek helped found the Slovak League, a national Slovak political organization in Cleveland.41 The Slovak League would assume a leadership role in helping Slovakia sever its ties with Hungary and later sided with the Czechs in forming a new Czecho-Slovak Republic. Czechs and Slovaks concluded the Cleveland Agreement in October 1915, which would work for an autonomous Slovakia in the new state. Both during and after World War I, the League organized fund drives to help the new government and to aid Slovakia in recovering from wartime deprivation.42 When Slovaks did not attain the autonomy they thought they had been promised in the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Agreements, Jan Pankuch and Jan Feriencak led an attack on Czech policies in the New Republic in the newspaper Denný hlas. The Slovak press closely monitored events, laws, and feelings in Slovakia.43 During the mid-twenties, Slovaks began to pay increasingly more attention to local politics. Slovak Democratic and Slovak Republican Clubs worked to get their fellow countrymen elected to political office with moderate success. After several unsuccessful tries, John Šmolka and Stephen Zona were finally elected to the state legislature. George Tenesy served as a local judge, Frank W. Sotak as the state Attorney General, John Spanus as Lakewood city councilman, Julius Badzik as aide to the county prosecutor, and George Matovitz served as chief of police for two decades.44 Despite these achievements, the number of Slovaks in political office was far from proportionally representative of their large numbers in the community. The Slovaks did not pool their votes for their own candidates as effectively as other nationalities did. In a 1925 issue of Hlas, an article complained about the poor political organization of Slovaks. They often would become active in a campaign only a month or two before an upcoming election. In some of the Lakewood elections, only half of the Slovaks were voting for their own nationality candidate.45 As a group, Slovaks shied away from local politics, most probably because they thought political activism would have little impact on their daily lives. They were more concerned with the more mundane tasks of building churches, schools, and buying and paying for their own homes. They became most politically active when an issue associated with their [pageend129]Sl o v ak s in Cl e v e l an d , 1870-1930: 125 homeland was involved — during the Kossuth Statue Controversy, when Count Apponyi of Hungary visited the city (he was hissed at by a crowd of Slovaks at the railroad station), when Czechoslovakia was emerging as a new independent state.46 Nationality Relations How well did Slovaks get along with their fellow immigrants and native Americans? First, there appears to have been little conflict with English-speaking Americans. Once Slovaks had decided to remain in the United States and become citizens, they strove to make their communities in Cleveland part of America. While they transplanted many of their former customs and traditions from the Old World, they readily adapted themselves to the new environment with the help of fellow Slovaks (especially family), the churches, and fraternal organizations. The freedom they found in America enabled them to have their own press, use their language without fear, and spurred national consciousness. Newspapers such as Hlas and Jednota frequently praised the merits of their new homeland.47 Relations with other nationality groups varied, depending on circumstances. Magyar-Slovak relations in Cleveland became strained when Slovaks in Hungary suffered increasing pressure to Magyarize.48 The tension appears to have ebbed during World War I, but as soon as it was clear that the Czecho-Slovak Republic was there to stay, nationality issues appeared to be less of a problem. Slovaks found a new bone of contention with the Czechs when the war was over.49 When Slovaks first settled in Cleveland, they cooperated with Czechs more because of their small numbers. For instance, some Slovaks belonged to Czech fraternal organizations before the founding of Jednota, the National Slovak Society, and other Slovak fraternal associations.50 While most Slovaks belonged to Slovak churches, some parishes had mixed congregations. Mostly Czechs, but some Slovaks too, attended Our Lady of Lourdes Church. Parish priests had to be diplomats as well as spirituell guides. When Father Furdek first came to the parish, Czech parishioners barred the doors so he could not enter. When Furdek died in 1915, the entire congregation grieved over its loss. Furdek’s replacement, [pageend130]126 Czechoslovak and Central European Journal Rev. Oldřich Zlámal, arrived at his new post only to find disharmony among Slovaks and Czechs. Within four years, he unified the parish and altered ethnic barriers to friendship.51 Slovak-Czech friendship was also true among the socialists. In the period 1909-1911, Americké dělnické listy printed regular announcements of the meetings of Slovak labor clubs such as Pokrok.52 Following the establishment of a Slovak section of the Socialist Party in May 1911, references to lovaks were less frequent and nearly disappeared by 1914. The founding of the Slovak Workers Society in 1915 and the split in the world socialist movement further separated the two groups. The Slovak Workers Society followed the Comintern line while more Czech socialists adhered to social democracy. While they may have cooperated with one another at the factory, the two peoples socialized with one another infrequently on social occasions.53 After World War I, Slovak-Czech relations worsened as controversy over the Pittsburgh Agreement escalated. Slovaks also accused the Czechs of using their donations from the Million Dollar Collection for the Czech lands, while never putting any of their money into Slovakia. When the Slovaks collected money for the Štefánik Monument in Wade Park, Czechs did not contribute or attend memorial services. Denný hlas asked where were these so-called Czechoslovaks when it was a Slovak hero who was being honored. Throughout the twenties, Slovak-Czech relations remained cool and, ironically, the two groups drifted farther apart from one another after they formed a common state.54 During the twenties, the increasing Americanization of the youth mitigated many of the earlier tensions among East Central European immigrants. In many ways a district such as Buckeye area resembled their old homeland. Magyars and Slovaks lived next to one another, did business with one another, and married one another. Although aware of their ethnic differences, the American-raised youth placed less emphasis upon them. As each year passed, the Old Country seemed farther away and old world prejudices, although present, receded to the background.55 Conclusion and Afterward By the late 1920s, Slovaks in Cleveland were a significant part of the [pageend131]Sl o v a k s in Cl e v e l a n d , 1870-1930: 127 many vibrant ethnic communities in the city. But the Slovak community was one of the more scattered and disunited ethnic groups. Religious, social, and political differences among Protestants, Catholics, Christians, and socialists made it appear as if several Slovak communities existed. Slovaks were most united as World War I came to a close, and as the people could rally around the creation of an independent Czecho-Slovakia. Without the stimulus of something, the homeland, to work for together, Slovaks drifted apart again during the twenties. Despite their large numbers, Slovak had settled in widely different areas of the city. There was relatively less interaction among Slovaks in different parts of the city than among other, more united ethnic groups such as the Poles or Hungarians. Slovaks tended to stick to their small neighborhoods and focused their social activities around their nearby church. The Slovak National Home in the Buckeye Area could not make ends meet because Slovaks on the west side of town did not want to cross the Cuyahoga Valley to attend social events. The smaller number of non-clerical professionals may partially explain this. Slovaks relied more on their clergy to provide local leadership. There were comparatively fewer efforts to organize the Slovaks as a political power to be reckoned with in city politics. While neighborhood and local church loyalties hindered citywide unity, they helped preserve Slovak identity and cemented friendships which could endure. Strong Slovak commitments to their churches helped preserve their national identity and the national language longer than would otherwise have been the case. While many Czech neighborhoods were splitting up even before World War II as they moved further out of the city, Slovak neighborhoods remained relatively intact until after the war.56 Following the World War II, suburban flight from the city further fragmented the Slovak communities. Many Slovaks moved to southern suburbs such as Parma and Brecksville, and most of the old neighborhoods have been torn asunder. Some Slovaks still get together for ethnic festivals and church reunions.57 Others commute to old Slovak parishes every Sunday. Most of the youth has lost its strong ties to its ethnic past and do not speak Slovak, the language which tied the old immigrants and the second generation together. Youth will rarely go out of their way to regularly attend a Slovak church or participate in Slovak [pageend132]128 Czechoslovak and Central European Journal events. Although the ethnic revival and the recent democratic revolutions have helped bring greater contacts with Slovak nationals and renew Slovak pride, it has touched only a selective few. The old Slovak communities are more scattered than they ever were. NOTES 1. When Slovaks first began to settle in the city, there were only 92,000 people. By 1910, Cleveland was a city of 560,000 and still growing. See The Birth of Modern Cleveland, 1865-1930, Thomas F. Campbell and Edward M. Miggins, eds.

Beal’s “The Sixth City: Cleveland in Three Stages of Urbanization,” 21-53. 2. Over half the Slovaks this author interviewed said that their families first settled in the coal mines of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, or southern Ohio. They came to Cleveland when the mines closed or in search of better pay and improved working conditions. Cleveland was frequently one stop of many: Slovak immigrants were highly mobile and frequently switched jobs and localities since during the early years they did not own property which would tie them to one place. This seemed to be even more of a pattern after World War I. See Susan Megles, M.

See Dr. Stephen Szabo’s Thirtieth Anniversary Album of the First Hungarian Reformed Church (Cleveland, 1979). The parish first had a church in 1891 on East 79th Street and later moved to its present location when a new church was built in 1979. Most of the Slovak parishioners were Magyarized Slovaks. One will find no mention of Slovaks in the anniversary book because of the tense history of Slovak-Magyar relations. 23.

The Slovak Workers society most often used the Czech Sokol Hall on Clark Avenue. However, the overwhelming majority of Slovak social events took place at local churches. This reinforced the religious particularism of the Slovaks. 30. Rev. Baska’s 1930 survey of St. Benedict’s parish, Archives of the Slovak Institute. 31. Extremely valuable are the numerous articles in Furdek (1924-30) which provide a close look at some of the concerns of the older generation about the youth losing Slovak culture because of the increasingly frequent use of English, the attractions of American popular culture, and ethnic intermarriage. In the twenties, the issue of young people losing their parents’ language and drifting away from their Slovak heritage became a major issue in the Slovak press. American-born and educated Slovaks frequently cited practicality and the generation gap as one of the main reasons for the decline of Slovak. The shortage of qualified Slovak nuns and teachers accelerated the process of assimilation which became even more popular during World War I, when peoples from Austria-Hungary strove to prove their loyalty to the United States and American values. Also useful for understanding the youth are articles in Jaro, the Jednota supplement for youth in the twenties. In 1928, Slovak Catholic youths founded The Catholic Slovak Students Fraternity “to promote Slovak interests and to instill in our hearts love for our mother language,” Jaro 21 March 1928: 1-3. Students frequently met once a month for an evening of informal Slovak camaraderie and entertainment, which would usually involve singing.

This information comes from a survey of St. Ladislav, and Our Lady of Mercy parishes conducted by Fr. Louis Baska and is in the archives of the Slovak Institute. The known percentages of Slovak Catholics in the Slovak Workers Society were no more than two or three parishioners per church, but there were possibly some who attended church and did not report their SRS membership. A check of SRS membership lists with local church registries would help verify this; however, a fire consumed the central offices at the Slovak Workers Home in Chicago. This was learned during a conversation on July 1, 1988 with Palo Hodos in Chicago. Hodos formerly wrote for the Slovak workers newspaper Ludový denník (1935-1945), which succeeded Rovnosť ľudu (1906-1935). Rev. Baska’s survey listed 5 socialists belonging to the parish of St. Ladislas, and there were very likely some who kept their political sympathies private for fear of social ostracism. While it is true that most Slovaks in Cleveland were of peasant stock and had little experience with any type of labor organization, leaders of the Slovak labor movement in the United States drew on the organized labor experiences of pre-war Hungary which were decidedly socialist in their orientation. Although a small Slovak Christian Socialist movement had developed before World War I, in America these experiences never translated into more of an organized response than the pronouncement of the parish priest from pulpits of his Sunday sermons, and the attempt to guide Slovak believers to adopt a moderate response to the labor movement in the United States. Although genuinely sympathetic to workers who experienced the blatant oppression such as the shootings of Slavic workers at the Lattimer Massacre in Northeastern Pennsylvania in 1898, the clergy always stressed the need for the uplifting of the soul and preserving the faith. Heavy involvement in the labor movement was something to be feared, especially since the socialist-influenced Slovak organizations adopted a strongly anti-clerical tone in their newspapers. Further information about Slovak socialist workers may be found in Slováci vo svete 2 (Martin: Matica slovenská, 1980) 112-27, and Miloš Gosiorovsky’s “K historii slovenského robotnického spolku v USA,” Historica. Sborník Filozofickej Fakulty Univerzity Komenského, 12 (1961-62): 3-75. Both tend to lay undue stress on the importance of the SRS in the history of American Slovaks but, on the other hand, many Slovak-American writers completely neglected to mention the role that Slovak socialists did play in America. 35.

During 1918 and early 1919, the editor was quite generous in his treatment of the Czechs and looked forward to the new republic with great hope. In mid-1919, one will note a sharp shift against Czech domination in Slovakia and a movement towards active work for Slovak autonomy and fulfillment of the Pittsburgh Agreement of 1918 which had promised Slovakia its own parliament and administrative autonomy. 44.

German had become the language of the country and Czech history had been forgotten in the dust of castle archives and monastic libraries. In 1784 the Royal Bohemian Society of Sciences was founded and in 1791 a chair in Czech language and literature was established at the university in Prague. Studies of Czech history began to be published. A few Bohemian nobles began to feel pangs of regional, if not outright Czech, consciousness. These early steps led the way to the Czech National Revival. The process of reawakening quickened its pace during the next century. Other institutions were established, such as the Bohemian Museum in 1818 and the Matice Česká in 1831, and early national leaders studied and wrote about Czech language, literature and history. Josef Dobrovský (1753-1829) wrote a history of the Czech language as well as a Czech grammar book. Josef Jungmann (1773-1847) wrote a history of Czech literature, prepared a Czech dictionary and translated numerous foreign works into Czech. František Palacký (1798-1876) wrote a monumental history of the Czech nation, based on research in libraries and archives. During this period long-abandoned Czech works were republished and once discarded documents were brought to light.1 A similar phenomenon is occurring among the Czechs of Texas today. This study will look at one aspect of that phenomenon — the writing of Texas Czech history. Czech language and literature in Texas were not assassinated as they were in seventeenth-century Hapsburg Bohemia. They were gradually abandoned in the natural process of assimilation into the surrounding American community. However, Czech history in Texas did not need to be rediscovered: it needed to be discovered. It never had been [pageend139]CzEc h -Ame r ic a n His t o r io g r a ph y: 1964-1987 135 suppressed; it simply had not been properly written. Two monumental works on the history of Czech Texas were published in the 1930s. Naše dějiny, prepared by the Národní svaz českých katolíků v Texasu (1939), chronicled the history of Czech Catholic parishes, recorded the biographies of prominent Czech Catholic leaders and included related materials of interest to the Czech Catholic community in Texas. Czech Pioneers of the Southwest, written by Estelle Hudson and Henry Maresh (1936), recorded a more general history of Czech settlement in Texas as well as the biographies of early Czech settlers in the state. Although the importance of these pioneer works of Texas Czech history cannot be overemphasized, like the early histories of the Czech nation published in the late 1700s they were merely a first step that paved the path for more rigorous endeavors. Yet during the next generation few took to the path, except for the occasional amateur genealogist who would document his own family history or the history of his church. It was not until the 1970s that Texas Czech historiography came alive in a flurry of activity as dozens of Texans of Czech origin began to study and write about the history of their community. There were several reasons for this great surge of activity: a general interest in “tracing one’s roots”; a new interest in ethnic heritage, which also saw the spread of folk festivals across the state; the activity of organizations such as the Czech Heritage Society of Texas; the work of individuals such as Albert Blaha of Houston and Doug Kubicek of Hallettsville, and the dual celebration of the United States Bicentennial in 1976 and the Texas Sesquicentennial in 1986. Perhaps the most important factor in the proliferation of publications on Czech Texas has been the development of fast and inexpensive printing technology. Until recently, the family historian had to make a sizable investment to publish his work; now he can run off copies as needed for only a couple of cents a page. Most of the current works on Czech Texas are published and printed by the author. The most remarkable aspect of the historiography of Czech Texas today is the people involved in it. With the exception of Doug Kubicek of Hallettsville they are not professional historians; with the exception of Dr. Clinton Machann of Texas A&M University they are not professors. They are housewives and retirees; they are white-collar workers and farmers; they [pageend140]136 Czechoslovak and Central European Journal are teachers and other professionals; they are a cross-section of the Texas Czech community, by and large without formal training in the methodology of historical research and writing. A few are quite fluent in Czech, but the majority can boast only a moderate knowledge of the language, and some have nearly no knowledge of Czech at all. Most come from Czech families that have been in the United States over a hundred years, and a few individuals are Czech only by marriage. All are united, however, by a love of the heritage of their Czech ancestors and a desire to preserve the history of the Czech community in Texas. These amateur family historians are doing a remarkable job of documenting the past of Czech Texas. They have written histories of various localities as well as of the Czech community as a whole. They have written histories of churches and fraternal organizations, family histories and biographies of individuals. They have extracted Czech names from the United States census, from county marriage records, from land transfer records, from applications for naturalization and from immigrant passenger lists. They have compiled tombstone inscriptions from cemeteries, obituaries from newspapers, and birth, death and marriage entries from churches. They have translated and republished rare and valuable source material, thereby providing a wealth of information for future family and professional historians alike. Of course, the problems facing them pale in comparison with those facing our illustrious eighteenth and nineteenth-century predecessors. Problems, however, do exist. Because most of the people involved are amateurs, they must write in their spare time. Theirs is a hobby that requires hard work, long hours, and a full pocketbook. Moreover, they must “play it by ear,” that is, develop their own methods and techniques. Yet the result is a historiography refreshingly frank, simple and honest; lack of professional polish is outweighed by enthusiasm. Unfortunately, not everybody shares their enthusiasm. Many members of the Texas Czech community are not interested in their work; some even seem to fear it. They believe that if a stranger asks too many questions about their family, he must be trying to establish a claim to their land. Certain church officials are reluctant to open their records, and many people simply refuse to be bothered with things the importance of which they cannot understand. Although Czech Texas historians are spared imperial censorship and official suppression, they still must fight apathy [pageend141]Cz e c h -Ame r ic an Hist o r io g r aph y: 1964-1987 137 and narrow-mindedness. Still, their greatest problem lies in gathering source material. Although early studies and histories exist, they are often rare and hard to find. Fortunately, Albert Blaha of Houston has taken it on himself to republish many old sources, thus reducing the magnitude of the problem. But for the most part, the new historians must resort to primary sources — census records, church records, county records, etc. — which are often in a bad state and sometimes all but illegible. They are also rife with inconsistent spelling. The American officials who kept the records often wrote down Czech names as they sounded to them. Špaček, for example, became Spotcheck, Buček — Bootjack,2 and so forth. The names of villages in the Old Country can be even more illusive, what with archaic forms, German variants, and inflection. Much of this material is hard to get to: it is dispersed among countless churches, libraries and courthouses across the state. Some records are officially closed to the public by state law; other records are unofficially closed to the public because of the attitude of a particular priest or minister; and a wealth of valuable information vanished forever with the deaths of old-timers who were never interviewed and with the destruction of their papers by family members who did not know any better. Eventually the problem of accessibility will be at least partially rectified by researchers who continue to extract, compile and publish. Finally, there is a scarcity of modem studies on Czech Texas. Today’s family historians represent the first generation of systematic study. Lacking as it is in professional polish, it will provide the basis for future generations of historians who will revise, correct, and reinterpret. Where will the road of Texas Czech historiography lead? We have covered much ground, but much remains to be done. We need to promote interest in our Czech heritage, encourage the study of Czech language and history, and solicit support for Czech-related programs and activities. We need to enlist more researchers and coordinate their work so all existing records are consulted. We need to encourage people to write their family histories, and give them whatever assistance they may require. We need to encourage churches and organizations to compile comprehensive accounts of their past and organize and open their own archives. We need to record and transcribe the information stored in the memories of our older generation before it is lost. We need to locate documents and [pageend142]138 Czechoslovak and Central European Journal journals before they are burned as trash. We need to see these sources published and placed in libraries across the state and we need to start a comprehensive computer index covering individuals, places and topics found in all works and materials on Czech Texas. Finally, we need to establish an independent, fully-funded central library and archive where Texas Czech materials can be collected, preserved and studied by future generations and where Texas Czechs can leave their own collections, confident that they will be taken care of and put to good use. Special tribute is due two individuals who have made especially important contributions to the historiography of Czech Texas: Doug Kubicek and Albert Blaha. In 1982 Doug Kubicek of Hallettsville founded Naše dějiny, a magazine of Texas Czech genealogy, history and culture. The magazine, which is published six times a year, not only disseminates valuable information to the Texas Czech community; it gives family researchers a regular public forum and the amateur historian a place to publish his work. The magazine has been so successful that it has attracted subscribers and contributors from other states and from out of the country. Kubicek’s publishing company, Old Homestead Publishing Company, has also published several works about the Texas Czech community. Albert Blaha of Houston has done more than anyone to promote the study of Texas Czech culture and history. He is best known for his Czech Genealogist’s Handbook, the authoritative source for the family historian of Czech Texas. Blaha also founded the Czech Heritage Society of Texas, an organization that promotes the study of Czech history, culture and heritage. Both in conjunction with the Czech Heritage Society and on his own, he has organized genealogy seminars and workshops in all parts of the state. He has translated and republished rare source materials on the history of the Czech community in Texas. He has coordinated the extraction and publication of Czech names from various records, and he has discovered and published many old records himself. He has sponsored a series of books entitled Czech Footprints Across the Bluebonnet Fields of Texas, collected and microfilmed important Czech periodicals, and has encouraged scores of Texas Czechs to study their own family history and Czech heritage by giving them invaluable free information and assistance. Three organizations also deserve mention. The Czech Heritage Society of Texas, or CHS (the aforementioned creation of Albert Blaha), [pageend143]Czech-American Historiography: 1964-1987 139 which was founded in 1982, is a state-wide organization with county chapters that promote and sponsor Czech activities and projects. The CHS regularly holds genealogy workshops, encourages and promotes historical research and writing, and serves as a major medium of mutual contact for family historians. Czech Club Historical Society of Dallas, which was founded in 1976, is also dedicated to the preservation and promotion of Texas Czech history, heritage and culture, and holds genealogy workshops, hosts lectures, and encourages research and writing. In 1979 it established a library that now contains some 1,500 items; it is located in the Czech Catholic Union of Texas (KJT), Lodge Number 111 in Dallas. The library’s holdings include items from non-Czech Slavic groups of Texas as well.3 Although the Slavonic Benevolent Order of the State of Texas (SPJST) is a fraternal benevolent society, it is of interest to Texas Czech historiography because of its outstanding library of Czech materials. The library, which was begun in 1963, is located in the SPJST headquarters in Temple. Its holdings include over 20,000 volumes, the vast majority of which deal with Czech or Texas Czech topics.4 Like their eighteenth- and nineteenth-century predecessors, the family historians and researchers of Czech Texas are engaged in uncovering and studying long forgotten records, translating and republishing valuable old works, compiling and publishing primary sources, and writing new historical studies. This is not to imply that the efforts of a few Texans of Czech ancestry in any way approach the importance and magnitude of the contributions of Dobrovský, Jungmann and Palacký, who saved the Czech nation from cultural oblivion and laid the foundation for the establishment of Czechs and Slovaks as independent peoples. We twentieth-century amateur historians are merely trying to preserve the Czech aspect of our American identity, and record the history of Czech Texas before it is lost.

Bicha In this paper I attempt to evaluate the writings on the history of the Czechs in North America which have appeared in print or in accessible manuscript form during the past two decades. While my focus is on scholarly works, I also refer to non-scholarly contributions as long as they adhere to acceptable criteria of accuracy. I was forced to impose some arbitrary restraints on my coverage. For example, I excluded most of the pamphlet-type material which commemorated the centennial observances of the few American communities in which settlers of Czech origin predominated. I also excluded writings on essentially diplomatic subjects, such as the role of Czech-Americans in the creation of Czechoslovakia as an independent state, and on later diplomatic relations between Czechoslovakia, the United States and Canada. In short, I chose to emphasize material related to long established Czech-American communities. Writing on Czech-American history since the mid-1960s falls into three basic categories — the general, the thematic, and the state- or locality-oriented. In the general category, four studies, each significantly different in focus and quality, have appeared in recent years. The first, and the most ambitious one, is Joseph Cada’s The Czechs in the United States (Washington, D.C.: SVU Press, 1981); the manuscript was deposited in the University of Chicago Library in 1976. In this work Cada discusses virtually every aspect of Czech-American life from the earliest settlements to the post-World War II “waning of Czech America.” Cada’s treatment is somewhat idiosyncratic, reflecting his interest in certain specific aspects of the subject. The role of Czech-Americans in the creation of the Czechoslovak state and the efforts of the Americans to assist beleaguered Czechoslovakia between 1938 and 1945 receive most attention. Almost equal attention is given to the religious conflict in Czech [pageend149]Cz e c h -Ame r ic an Hist o r io g r aph y: 1964-1987 145 America between what is described as the “traditionally spiritually oriented” and the “humanistically oriented” Czechs. Less attention is given to such topics as immigration, settlement, institutions, non-religious radicalism, and the press. In spite of that, this work is the most objective one. The work contains the most comprehensive bibliography on the subject compiled so far. A study of a very different orientation is The Czechs in America, 1633-1977 (Dobbs Ferry, N.Y.: Oceana Publications, 1978) compiled by Vera Laska. Published as part of a similarly structured series on ethnic groups, this is essentially a chronology and a fact book. In addition, it contains an anthology of thirty-eight documents of varying content and purpose relating to Czech-American life, and a selective bibliography. As a reference tool, the work fulfills admirably its purpose. Distinctly marginal as scholarship is Panorama: A Historical Review of Czechs and Slovaks in the United States of America (Cicero: Czechoslovak National Council of America, 1970). “Panorama” is a term which inadequately describes the content of this volume. Better descriptive terms for it would be “vignettes,” “miscellany,” “potpourri,” etc. It contains a few short, derivative articles and a number of bibliographical sketches. In many ways, the character of this book is reminiscent of the annual almanacs once published by such newspapers as Svornost and Katolík. A general study of considerable merit is John Gellner’s and John Smerek’s The Czechs and Slovaks in Canada (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1968). The background for this study’s origin was the Commemoration of the Centennial of Confederation in Canada. The authors accentuate the Slovak contributions to Canadian history. This emphasis is justified by the numerical predominance of Slovaks over Czechs in Canada. The chronological perspective of immigration to Canada is very different from that to the United States. While most of the American Czechs are descendants of immigrants who arrived in the New World prior to 1914, Canada’s Czech population in 1919 barely exceeded one thousand. Large-scale immigration began only in the 1920s. The most significant immigration of Czechs to Canada occurred only after the 1948 Communist coup. Another influx occurred after the Warsaw Pact intervention of August 1968. Naturally, this period is not covered in this [pageend150]146 Czechoslovak and Central European Journal study. Thematic studies on Czechs in America are more numerous than the general accounts. Their quality is uneven. Most of them explore Czech-American religious life, which is an important topic if we study the Czechs as an immigrant/ethnic group. Three studies deal with aspects of Czech Catholicism or, to use Cada’s idiosyncratic phraseology, the “traditionally spiritually oriented” members of the group. (Czech- American Protestantism has not been the subject of recent scholarship). Joseph Cada’s, Czech American Catholics, 1850-1920 (Chicago: Benedictine Abbey Press, 1964) is a general treatment of the subject, emphasizing the formative period of the Catholic establishment. Peter Mizera’s Czech Benedictines in America, 1877-1901 (Chicago: Benedictine Abbey Press, 1969) is much more limited in scope and deals only with the Benedictines of St. Procopius Abbey in Chicago and Lisle. The focus is on their educational and missionary work. Both of these book-length treatises exhibit more piety than scholarship. Josef J. Barton’s “Religion and Cultural Change in Czech Immigrant Communities, 1850-1920” in Randall M. Miller and Thomas D. Marzik (eds.), Immigrants and Religion in Urban America (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1977) is a far more sophisticated study, in spite of the fact that the author relishes sociological jargon and esoteric constructions. He devotes this essay to the broad cultural context in which the Czech immigrants functioned, a context in which Catholicism was only one component. Barton deals principally with the disaggregation of the traditional peasant village culture in southern Bohemia and eastern Moravia, the creation of mutual aid and religious-oriented voluntary societies as integrative substitutes for traditional forms, and the transplantation of associationist attitudes to America. They led to the formation of religious-based sodalities and, finally, to parishes which sponsored the reenactment of religious village festivals. Barton’s study contrasts the entirely secular interpretation of the survival of Czech village institutions in Karel D. Bicha’s “The Survival of The Village in Urban America: A Note on Czech Immigrants in Chicago to 1914,” International Migration Review, 5 (Spring 1971). The other large body of Czech immigrants, the liberals and freethinkers or, to quote Joseph Cada again, the “humanistically oriented,” group, has attracted limited scholarly attention. In “Settling [pageend151]Cz e c h -Ame r ic an Hist o r io g r aph y: 1964-1987 147 Accounts with an Old Adversary: The Decatholicization of Czech Immigrants in America,” Social History = Histoire Sociale, no. 8 (November 1972), Karel D. Bicha attempts to explain the intellectual origins and early organization of the immigrant free-thinkers. Bruce Garver’s “Czech-American Freethinkers on the Great Plains, 1871-1914,” in Frederick C. Luebke (ed.), Ethnicity on the Great Plains (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), is essentially an elaborate survey of the institutions created by freethinkers from the Dakotas to Texas. Garver explores educational and cultural societies, Sokol, fraternal associations and the ephemeral “svobodné obce” (free societies) fashioned by the most militant of the liberals. A study illustrating the variability of Czech religious attitudes from traditional piety to thorough-going agnosticism, is Christopher Jay Johnson’s “An Oral History Study of the Religiosity of Fifty Czech-American Elderly” (Ph.D. dissertation, Iowa State University, 1981). While the immigrant freethinkers represented a peculiar and largely indigenous species of religious radicalism, Czech-Americans also participated in radical political and economic movements between the 1880s and 1920s. This aspect of the Czech experience in America is the subject of Kenneth Cink’s “Czech-American Radicalism in the United States, 1849-1924” (Master’s thesis, University of Chicago, 1969). Thematically, Cink’s study is unique but the sources which he used are standard. Essentially, Cink examines the Czech contribution to the anarchist phenomenon in Chicago and New York during the 1880s, the early socialist activities of such individuals as Lev J. Palda, and the more consequential role of the Czech “foreign language federation” within the Socialist Party of America, subsequent to its creation in 1901. Interestingly, he concludes that socialism for the Czechs was never a doctrine but merely a form of “labor action.” The bulk of the material related to the history of the Czechs in America published during the past twenty years deals with issues of settlement and ethnic life in specific states and communities. From a scholarly perspective such works have a degree of artificiality. There is no intrinsic reason why Czechs in Chicago should function differently from Czechs in Cleveland or why the behavior and activities of rural Czechs in Nebraska should differ from that of their counterparts in Iowa [pageend152]148 Czechoslovak and Central European Journal or Oklahoma. These studies often fail to explain if and why such genuine differences exist. The revival of ethnic consciousness among most groups in the 1960s and 1970s virtually necessitated literary output mainly on community or state themes, but they are mostly of limited scholarly merit. Several state- and locality-oriented publications aim to illuminate our knowledge of the Czech experience in America. Wisconsin, the first state of widespread Czech settlement, is discussed in two articles by Karel D. Bicha. The first, “The Czechs in Wisconsin History,” Wisconsin Magazine of History, 53 (Spring 1970), is a survey of Czech life in that state up to 1890; the second, “Karel Jonas of Racine: ’First Czech’ in America,” Wisconsin Magazine of History, 63 (Winter 1979-1980), is an assessment of the life and work of the most prominent of early Czech-American leaders. Minnesota, which acquired a sprinkling of Czech-born settlers by the mid-1850s, is the subject of C. Winston Chrislock’s “The Czechs” in June D. Holmquist (ed.), They Chose Minnesota (St. Paul: Minnesota Historical Society, 1981). Chrislock explores community and institutional life among Minnesota’s Czechs from the 1850s to about 1975, and his contribution is a model state-level study. Of interest to Czech Minnesota is Esther Jerabek’s translation and edition of the letters of Josep Kaplan, an early settler in south-central Minnesota, “Letters to Bohemia: A Czech Settler Writes from Owatonna, 1856-1858,” Minnesota History, 43 (Winter 1972). (These letters originally appeared in Czechoslovakia in 1970, edited by Josef Polišenský). Kaplan was neither a prolific nor an inspired letter writer and his correspondence with his friends and family in Bohemia, containing description of pioneer life, borders on the banal. Czech life in Iowa has also inspired a few literary efforts. Among these is Anna Johnson’s “Rough Was the Road They Journeyed,” Palimpset, 58 (May 1977), recollections of life on a Czech farm near a village with the decidedly non-Czech name of Pocahontas. Another study is by the Czech Heritage Foundation, The History of the Czechs in Cedar Rapids (Cedar Rapids: Lilly Printing Company, 1972), which updates material originally published in 1944 in the Iowa Journal of History. The Czech experience in northeastern Iowa inspired Gerald Pecinovsky’s centennial pamphlet, Protivín: A Czech Settlement (N.p.: n.p., 1978) and Cyril Klimesh’s They Came To This Place: A History of Spillville, Iowa [pageend153]Cz e c h -Ame r ic an Hist o r io g r aph y: 1964-1987 149 and Its Czech Settlers (Sebastopal, Calif.: Methodius Press, 1983). Klimesh’s book-length account of the village of his birth is written with grace and grounded in birth and parish records, county plat books, tax records and appropriate newspaper sources. Nebraska, a major center of Czech-American rural life, is the subject of two collections of essays and miscellaneous texts edited by Vladimir Kučera and Alfred Novaček, Czechs and Nebraska (Ord, Neb.: Quiz Graphic Arts, 1967) and Czech Contributions to the Progress of Nebraska (Ord, Neb.: n.p., 1976). Neither contains new insights or new material. Far superior is Joseph Svoboda’s “Czechs: The Love of Liberty,” in Paul A. Olson (ed.), Broken Hoops and Plains People (Lincoln: Nebraska Curriculum Development Center, 1976). Svoboda’s essay is an excellent treatment of all of the relevant facets of Czech life in Nebraska, and, in an appendix, he offers a catalog of currently operative facilities, institutions and resources in the state. A useful study of Nebraska is John Kleinschmidt, “The Political Behavior of the Bohemian and Swedish Ethnic Groups in Nebraska, 1884-1900” (Master’s thesis, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, 1968). Czech settlers in the southwest are the subject of somewhat longer treatises. Karel D. Bicha, The Czechs in Oklahoma (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1980), is the only study of Czechs in that state, nearly all of whom had previously lived in Nebraska, Kansas or Texas. Czech Texans were the subject of a number of studies of variable quality. Among these are the pamphlet The Czech Texans, published by the Institute for Texas Cultures in 1972, and two doctoral dissertations, authored by Clinton Machann and William P. Hewitt, respectively: Hewitt’s “The Czechs in Texas: A Study of the Immigration and the Development of Czech Ethnicity, 1850-1920” (Ph.D. dissertation, University of Texas, 1978) is the poorer of these closely parallel accounts. Machann, with James W. Mendl as co-author, published a revised edition of his dissertation, entitled Krásná Amerika: A Study of the Texas Czechs (Austin: Eakin Press, 1983). The volume is an adequate treatment of emigration, religion, the press, assimilation, and the social structure of Czech farming communities. An interesting addition to the literature on Czech Texans is Josef Barton’s “Land, Labor and Community in Nueces: Czech Farmers and Mexican Laborers in South Texas, 1880-1930,” an [pageend154]150 Czechoslovak and Central European Journal essay which appeared in Frederick C. Luebke (ed.), Ethnicity on the Great Plains (Lincoln, Neb.: University of Nebraska Press, 1980). This comparative study explores why tenant farmers of Czech origin ordinarily became farm owners while their Mexican counterparts tended to descend to the status of farm laborers. Barton found the answer in the size of Czech families which insured a more adequate and productive labor force on the farm. Barton’s essay should be read in conjunction with Wesley Valek, “Oral History and Czech Immigrants in Ellis County, Texas, 1873-1917,” International Journal of Oral History, 8 (November 1987). Finally, a few studies address the problem of the survival of ethnicity and/or community among Czech-Americans. The most elaborate of these is David M. Stasa, “A Comparative Study of the Detroit and St. Louis Sokols’ Efforts to Preserve Czech Culture Since World War II” (Ph.D. dissertation, St. Louis University, 1957). A brief article by Jay Corzine and Irene Dabrowski, “The Ethnic Factor and Neighborhood Stability: The Czechs in Seulard and South St. Louis,” Missouri Historical Society Bulletin, 33 (January 1977) confirms Stasa’s conclusions for St. Louis. The argument of both studies is that, in spite of the decay or outright destruction of Czech neighborhoods and the consequent elimination of ethnic parishes, the Czechs of St. Louis and Detroit sustained their ethnicity and a sense of integral community. They found ethnic sustenance not in the parish or a fraternity but in a revitalized Sokol movement, albeit one which emphasized social activities rather than physical culture. Considering that Sokol had been declining since the 1920s, the St. Louis- Detroit phenomenon is quite remarkable. Whether it is unique to these cities, or part of a broader pattern, is an important, but thus far unresolved question. A unique supplementary study of cultural survival is James R. Gentry, “Czechoslovakian Culture in the Buhl-Castleford Area,” Idaho Yesterdays, 30 (Winter 1987). On the other hand, Karel D. Bicha, in “Community or Cooperation? The Case of the Czech-Americans,” East European Monographs, no. 73 (1980), expresses doubt that Czech- Americans ever created a real sense of community and notes the apparently permanent division of the fraternal societies into Catholic and secular organizations to support his view.

All three publications were issued as part of the “The Peoples of North America” series, under the Senior Editorship of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. However, it appears that Senator Moynihan’s involvement has been limited to a short (4 pages) introductory essay, “A Nation of Nations,” which has been reprinted in every monograph of this series. The essay is of general character and does not mention any of the three ethnic groups under review here by name. Each monograph is supposed to tell the “story of a specific immigrant or native population, describing its history, examining its culture, and following the achievements of its people up to the present as they continue to enrich the continent that proudly claims them.” Judging from the format, the print, the style, the illustrations and the cover, it is quite apparent that the series has been primarily intended for a young reader, probably on the eight grade level. These types of publications hardly ever receive any notice in the scholarly press, although they deserve close scrutiny, considering their mass distribution and their potential impact on young people. Books for young readers are in certain ways more difficult to write than scholarly works. In order to appeal to young audience, they must be readable, interesting, enjoyable, informative, unbiased and above all, non-polemical. Due to space limitation, the material has to be carefully selected to assure that it is truly representative and that it captures the soul and the spirit of the nationality in question. Using these criteria, Paul Magocsi’s volume on Carpatho-Rusyns is clearly the best of the three. The author is a historian of world reputation, the most eminent expert on Carpatho-Rusyn cultural history and as such he has been able to present a well-balanced picture of the history of the Ruthenians in their old homeland, the events that led to their emigration to the New World and their life and contributions in the American setting. The mastery of his discussion of the complex religious issues of the Ruthenian society and the truly representative [pageend156]152 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al selection of the prominent individuals in America of Ruthenian origin is a flection of the author’s first-hand knowledge of the subject matter. The monograph is based on Magocsi’s earlier Our People: Carpatho-Rusyns and their Descendants in North America. Mr. Stolarik, a Slovak-born historian, currently the President of the Balch Institute for Ethnic Studies in Philadelphia, is the author of The Slovak Americans. Stolarik is also not a novice to the area of American ethnic history, having written several studies on the subject. The monograph starts with a brief overview of Slovak immigration, followed by a historical survey of Slovakia, the early history of Slovak settlers in the New World, the development of Slovak communities in America, the cultural life of Slovak immigrants, and the current scene with reference to ethnicity. On the whole, the author succeeds in covering the most important aspects of Slovak immigration; to illustrate Slovak contributions to America, he employs well-chosen examples of accomplished individuals of Slovak descent. The only criticism I have against Stolarik’s work is his sour discussion of the Slovak-Czech relations. He talks at length about the events that led to the founding of “Czecho-Slovakia,” about Masaryk’s betrayal to give Slovaks home rule, about the Munich Agreement that “brought the Slovaks a step closer to autonomy” and finally, when “Hitler took Slovakia under his protection, while the German troops occupied Bohemia and Moravia ... after 1,000 year of foreign rule, the Slovaks finally had their own state.” Yet hardly a positive word is said about the life of the Slovaks during the twenty-year history of the Czechoslovak Republic between the two World War — “the great experiment in Czechoslovak Independence which has left a remarkable record in the annals of history,” as Professor James T. Shotwell amiably characterized it. Elsewhere (p. 26) Stolarik states: “Because the Czechs outnumbered the Slovaks by more than two to one, and because Czechoslovakia, a parliamentary democracy, granted each citizen one vote, the Czechs easily denied the Slovaks demands for equality,” and further, that “Masaryk and his followers expected Slovaks to give up their language and culture and to merge with the Czechs,” statements which are debatable, at best, and which should not have been included without documentation. Opinionated statements like these are inappropriate in general, and even more so when aimed at young audience. Stephanie Saxon-Ford, the author of the last monograph under review, seems to have depended primarily on secondary sources, some of which are quite outdated (although her grandfather reportedly comes from Czechoslovakia). Despite her efforts to present a factual account of the history of the Czechs in Europe and in America, it is evident that she is not familiar with the nuances of the subject, including the sense of Bohemian history, and is probably not proficient in the Czech or Slovak languages. Here are some examples; there is no Queen Libuše (p. 19) not even in legend, but rather Princess Libuše; the correct name of a Czech settlement is [pageend157]Re v ie w s 153 Litomyšl, not Litomysy (p. 14, 109); Rosewater’s first name was Edward, not Edgar (p. 110). On page 23 find “Ceski-Moravska Kronica’and on page 89 “Slován Amerikánsky.” It is also difficult to understand why the author is using German names for Czech towns, e.g. Eger instead of Cheb (p. 102) or Brün for Brno (p. 48). The author states that the Czech migration to America began in the 1630s with he arrival of Augustine Herman (p. 39). According to the latest evidence, the first Bohemian on the North American continent was Joachim Gans of Prague who came to Roanoke, N.C. in 1585 with the expedition of explorers organized by Sir Walter Raleigh. There is also no proof that Augustine Herman came to America in 1633; his arrival most likely occurred at least a decade later. In this connection, it is also hard to understand why the author chose an amateurish picture of A. Herman, which makes him look like a fool rather than the handsome self-portrait found on his Maryland map. The section on Moravians (p. 40) suggests that “although individual Czech names are hard to locate in the annals of immigration, Czechs were almost certainly in the group of Moravian Brethren who arrived in America from England between 1741 and 1762.” There are a number of inaccuracies in this statement. According to my own research, at least 300 Moravian Brethren came to America from the Czech lands in the mid-eighteenth century. In fact, the first arrival of the Moravian Brethren in America, practically all of whom came form Moravia or Bohemia, occurred in 1735 rather than 1741 as the author states. Jan Amos Komenský (Comenius) was not the last bishop of the Moravian Brethren (p. 43) — he was a Bishop of Bohemian Brethren but certainly not the last. With reference to the question of Czech-Slovak relations, this monograph suffers from the same faults as Stolariks’s; in fact, it appears that this particular section (p. 30-34) closely mimics Stolarik’s polemical statements if not the wording itself. It is incomprehensible to survey Czech history without due attention to the Masaryk’s era of the First Czechoslovak Republic. The author’s selection of the contributions of Czech Americans is also questionable. To be sure, Kroc, Ceman (also claimed by the Slovaks), Forman, or Navrátilová are frequent headliners, but hardly typical or representative. It would have been more appropriate to choose individuals such as Aleš Hrdlička, the physical anthropologist, Frederick G. Novy, the microbiologist, Francis Dvornik, the historian, René Wellek, Rudolf Firkušny, Maria Jeritza, the soprano, Jon Voight, senator Roman Hruška, or the Nobel laureates Thomas Cech, and C.F. and G.T. Cori, among others. The omission of the role of the Jews is particularly glaring, considering the fact that the first individual from Czechoslovakia to put foot on the American shore was a Jew. Furthermore, the contributions of Czechoslovak Jewry to American civilization has been quite phenomenal and clearly out of proportion to their numbers. Here are just a few names: Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, Governor of Illinois Henry Horner, U.S. Senator George H. Bender, [pageend158]154 Czechoslovak and Central European Journal the suffragette Anita L. Pollitzer, the economist Joseph A. Schumpeter, the psychologist Max Wertheimer, the organizer and director of the Rockefeller Institute Simon Flexner, the composer Eric W. Korngold, the architect Leopold Eidlitz and many others. The publisher and the editors of “The Peoples of North America” series would be well advised to give greater care to the selection of the authors and have the manuscripts critically reviewed by individuals knowledgeable in the subject area. Miloslav Rechcigl, Jr. Dayd r e ams an d Nig h t mar e s: Cz e c h Co mmu n ist an d Ex-Co mmu n ist Lit e r at u r e , 1917-1987. By Peter Hruby. East European Monographs. (Boulder, Co.: East European Monographs, Published jointly with the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences, 1990). 362 p. 0880331873. In the preface to his book, the author writes: “[The purpose is] to explore both the reasons and unreason of writers who hoping to improve the lot of their compatriots and of the world served governments that were often behaving not as fallen angels but rather as a fanatical gang of criminals. The authors discussed in this book engaged themselves politically as writers and citizens. Therefore the historian has the right to consider their work in connection with their life from the perspective of their political beliefs, their influence on developments as well as their responsibility or its lack.” The above statement, infirm conceptually as well as stylistically, delineates the book’s intellectual parameters. After one has read but a small segment, one discovers that this is essentially an anti-communist pamphlet replete with simplifications and exaggerations. There are also parts which are written with a more scholarly hand, to be just, but there is seldom any doubt about the author’s objectives. Communism as an ideology and its followers are to be put to shame, while the historical conundrum of why so many prominent Czech men and women of letters succumbed to the allure of the doctrine is only of secondary importance to the author. The issue of moral accountability is of course not as simple as Hruby would like us to believe. Should we really regard an author at all times as a public figure whose activities form an indivisible whole? If so, should not his private life also be subjected to the same principle? Should we regard the aesthetic merits of an author’s work less favorably because we find his public and private life objectionable? Or vice versa, should we judge his public and private life less harshly because of the high aesthetic standards of his work? The quandary does [pageend159]Re v ie w s 155 not end here. How shall we judge a work which was consciously designed to promote ideas which we regard as harmful but which, as is frequently the case, had precisely the opposite effect? Should such author be regarded as a hero or as a villain? These issues have troubled commentators for centuries, and the personalities in dispute have included Villon, Milton, Rousseau, Balzac, Dostoyevsky, Wagner, Nietzsche, Pound — just to name a few. Hruby does not make the slightest attempt to frame a coherent methodology for the exploration of these issues. Instead, he retreats into a sanctuary of ambiguous semi-professionalism: his study “is a personal review,” his “point of view is... not of a literary historian, but of a political scientist.” However, the text of the study flies in the face of these assertions. The inquisitorial pathos, with its self-assured distinction between right and wrong, raises claims that go well beyond personal impressions. Structurally, the book mimics much more a popular literary history than a study moored in the field of political science. Large parts of the 300-pages book are quotations from literary works loosely strewn with interpretative comments. Hruby’s interpretations are far from confined to ideological or political concerns. The political scientist enunciates sweeping aesthetic formulas. Otakar Březina, for example, is proclaimed unequivocally “the greatest nineteenth century Czech poet” (p. 14). He even chances into the realm of musicology and psychology, the latter discipline employed to conclude that the Czech left was a “socio-pathological” event. The book deals with some thirty Czech authors who at one time or another were members of the Communist party. There is no apparent correlation between the degree of an author’s association with the Party and the amount of attention Hruby will allot him. Thus a separate chapter is devoted to Hašek, albeit his ties with the movement were — according to Hruby’s own account — only nominal, and the chapter adds nothing to what is universally known about the author. The same may be said about Ivan Klíma who is discussed in a 23-page chapter despite the fact that his work is almost exclusively anti-totalitarian. That Klíma was, for a short period, a member of the Party is for all practical purposes irrelevant. On the other hand, Vítězslav Nezval, whose life and work is the key to understanding the post-World War I left-wing literary generation, is discussed rather unassertively. Only passing attention is given to Pavel Kohout, who more distinctly than anybody else epitomizes the tragedy of the post-World War II generation of Communist leanings. What we are witnessing is Zhdanovism in reverse: the more an author was affected by the Communist ideal, the less worthy is he of critical acclaim even if his art remained essentially unaffected by that ideology. In Hruby’s eyes, a writer’s association with the Communist movement is akin to a cardinal sin. He sees his own role as that of prosecutor and judge, his responsibility being to find an appropriate slot for the offender in the register of shame. His evaluation of the authors’ participation in the movement is essentially devoid of historical sense. Obviously, from the vantage point of 1990 things look very different than [pageend160]156 Czechoslovak and Central European Journal they did to those who lived through the various stages of the Communist revolution. Thus to the young post-World War I generation, Communism did not and could not appear as being run by a “gang of criminals.” While Lenin’s rule was ruthless, it was a far cry from the Stalinist senseless terror which came only a decade later. Moreover, through a large part of the twenties, Russia was a country of considerable artistic freedom, a hotbed of avantgardist trends. To anticipate the country’s later dogmatic uniformity required clairvoyance rather than political acumen. As Hruby sees it, the sin of affiliation with the Communist movement may be mitigated by recantation, but atoned only by militant anticommunism. He ignores the fact that an author’s age, the time of his death, within the framework of extrinsic historical events, invariably played an important role in his personal involvement with Communism. Thus Ivan Olbracht who is the study’s bete noire, may have been simply unlucky because he died in 1952, rather than innately more depraved than the other members of his generation. Had he died before or during World War II as Hora or Vančura did, he would have been perhaps treated more benevolently by Hruby just as the they are. By the same token, it may be reasonably assumed that had Olbracht lived through the 1960s, he too would have rejected Soviet-styled Communism as decisively as numerous other old-timers (Drda, Pujmanová, etc.). The discussion of individual authors results too often in bizarre garble. The chapter on Olbracht, flatulently titled "Bitter Hatred and Sad Eyes,” is especially suitable for the demonstration of Hruby’s method. Here Hruby’s point of departure is Freud-enkindled diagnosis of Olbracht’s early work which allegedly reflects a deeply seated conflict with his authoritarian father. This conflict eventually develops into young Olbracht’s hostility towards society in general. This Oedipal distemper manifests itself in brutal scenes and morbid imagery found in his early works with the color red playing a dominant role. On the basis of a few discontinuous quotations, Hruby concludes: “The future Communist propagandist was obviously enchanted by the red color [sic] before he was able to transfer his perverse obsession with bloody red into red flag, and his bourgeois antibourgeois hate into Marxist class hate” (p. 153). On Olbracht’s first novel, Podivné přátelství herce desenia (1918) Hruby comments: “It is a melodramatic, badly written story, concerning a love affair between two men (with strong homosexual overtones) and a woman who sleeps with both of them. The style of writing was typical of the cheap novels of that genre” (p. 154). A bold statement on the part of a political scientist who had assured us in his introduction of not harboring the ambition of a literary scholar, especially in view of the fact that the novel has been commented upon enthusiastically by such leading Czech critics as Arne Novák. Given Hruby’s disdainful evaluation of this novel, it is noteworthy that he would apportion two full pages to its discussion, and only one paragraph to Olbracht’s masterpiece Nikola Šuhaj, whose artistic merits he reluctantly admits, as he does those of Hory a staletí, a work to which he reserves but a single sentence. This imbalance is of course calculated and can be [pageend161]Re v ie w s 157 found in varying degrees in other chapters of the book. Its purpose is evident: an author who deserves in Hruby’s eyes to be condemned on ideological grounds must have his stature cut down as an artist as well, and at all cost. Even in his masterpiece Olbracht remains a "literary sadist" (168). Olbracht’s legacy is summed up as follows: "Destroy and kill: kill the imperialist, kill the bourgeois people, kill the enemy both obvious and hidden, kill the system, kill, kill, kill" (p. 307). Had Hruby’s book appeared at the height of the Cold War, one could have understood its purpose, although one might not have necessarily approved of its method. Reading it in 1990 leaves one with an acute feeling of embarrassment. It is not an enjoyable sight to see the jewels of Czech literature dragged into propagandistic sludge in the name of now moot political goals. Paul I.
