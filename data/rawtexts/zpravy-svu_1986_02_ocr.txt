The first Czech refugees from religious persecution by the Habsburg Counter Reformation during the Thirty Years War (1618-1648) arrived in New York (then New Amsterdam): most prominent among them was Augustin Herman, later known as the “Lord of Bohemia Manor”. During the eighteenth century Moravian Brethren immigrated and established the Moravian Brethren Church of America, with centers in Bethlehem, PA., and Winston-Salem, NC. But while a great many Czech and Slovak immigrants settled in the United States beginning in the 1860’s, before 1939 it was rare for a university professor, writer or artist to leave Czechoslovakia for permanent settlement abroad. Then came World War II. The Nazi onslaught precipitated" the emigration or escape of some 20,000 persons: among these exiles, at least one-tourth were 23 The CBC video program “Fifth Estate” with commentary by Martin Zapletal, and the documentary “Ohrožená Evropa” narrated by Vladimir Škutina will be shown at selected times throughout the Congress (Room 108, Snell Engineering Center). HISTORY CZECHOSLOVAK SOCIETY OF ARTS AND SCIENCES [pageend23]intellectuals. At the War’s conclusion, some returned to Czechoslovakia. Many, however, remained in the United States, Canada, England, France or other Western countries. A still greater exodus began in 1948 after the February coup in Czechoslovakia. In the decade following that coup, over 60,000 people escaped to the West; it is estimated that about one-tenth of these émigrés, or some 6,000, were intellectuals, scholars and profesionál people. Most of them found their way to the United States, Canada and Australia, while a few hundred established themselves in Western Europe and various countries in Central and South America, Asia and Africa. In the 1950’s it became increasingly difficult for Czechs and Slovaks to emigrate from Czechoslovakia either legally or by illegal crossing of the borders, and the influx of Czech and Slovak refugees into the United States was reduced to a trickle. But after the liberalized Dubček regime was crushed by the invasion of the Warsaw powers in August 1968, another large exodus followed, again largely consisting of intellectuals, some of whom were admitted to the United States or Canada, while this time a majority stayed in Western Europe. During the nineteen-fifties, intellectuals who had managed to leave Czechoslovakia and gain permanent residence in the United States felt increasingly the need to maintain and develop Czechoslovak culture, while in Czechoslovakia history was being rewritten as if Orwell’s 1984 had been advanced by thirty years, and the writings of past and present Czech and Slovak authors were on the proscribed lists. In 1958, a group of scholars led by the late Professor Václav Hlavatý, a mathematician at Indiana University, and Dr. Jaroslav Němec of the National Library of Medicine, began to organize these intellectuals all over the world into a society of arts and sciences. In 1960 the Society became incorporated as a non-profit corporation. Its activities, as outlined in its bylaws, consist in supporting and coordinating the educational, scholarly, literary and artistic endeavors of the Czech and Slovak intelligentsia abroad; out the Society s iundamental concept has oeen broadened into that of an organization open to all scholars, regardless of national background, who are genuinely interested in the advancement of Czechoslovak scholarship. By a ruling the U.S. Treasury-Department in 1962, contributions to the organization are tax-deductible. The Society is known among Czechs and Slovaks as SVU, an abbreviation of its name in the Czech or Slovak languages. From its inception the Society has maintained its non-political character and refused to become an instrumental of the cold war. The membership, of course, is opposed to any totalitarian ideology, be it of the right or the left, knowing that culture and freedom are inseparable. 24 [pageend24]PUBLICATIONS The Society has started an ambitious publishing program. Among its first publication was a monograph on the composer Antonín Dvořák, by the composer Karel B. Jirák, late of Roosevelt University. In 1963, Mouton & Co. of the Hague published Essays on Czech Literature by René Wellek of Yale University. Papers delivered at the Society’s first two congresses (1962 and 1964) were published by Mouton & Co. under the titles Czechoslovak Contributions to World Culture and Czechoslovakia, Past and Present respectively, both edited by Miloslav Rechcigl, Past President of the Society and Head of Research of the Agency for International Development. In connection with the 300th anniversary of the death of Jan Amos Comenius (1592-1670) several English translations of Comenius’ works and a volume of essays on Comenius (papers delivered at the Society’s 1970 Congress) were published, partly in cooperation with the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures of the University of Michigan. The same cooperative effort also produced a unique bilingual (English and Czech) Anthology of Czech Poetry, edited by Alfred French of the University of Adelaide. In 1971, the Society published, with the; cooperation of the University of Michigan, a collection of brilliant essays in the Czech and Slovak languages, Studies in Verbal Art by Roman Jakobson of Harvard University. Several other publications followed: a biographical directory of members (the latest edition appeared in 1984), a number of publications in the Czech language — a novel, poetry, essays and others. Recently the Society has published a monograph on Czechoslovak military justice during World War II in the English language and has instituted a new series of occasional papers. On the occasion of the USA Bicentennial, the Society published a monumental bibliography on Czechs and Slovaks in North America, the result of the meticulous work of librarian Esther Jeřábek, a second-generation author of Czech descent. In the summer of 1979, the second edition of Alfred French’s Anthology of Czech Poetry was published. In 1980, the Society came out with another bilingual edition of poetry: Jaroslav Seifert’s The Plague Monument, with English translations from the Czech by Lyn Coffin and with collages by Jiří Kolář. A bilingual edition of Jiří Orten’s Elegies, again with translation by Lyn Coffin was published in 1982. Since 1959, the Society has been publishing in informative newsletter Zprávy SVU(News of SVU); since 1964, it has also been publishing a quarterly for literature, philosophy and the arts, called Proměny (Metamorphoses). Since the Spring of 1980, the Society has been publishing its English language Bulletin for members and others who do not speak Czech or Slovak. In 1983 the Society began publishing its English language journal Kosmas, Journal of Czechoslovak and Central European Studies. The Journal is published semiannually. 25 [pageend25]THE WORLD CONGRESSES Present membership is close to 1600. Dr. Jiří Nehněvajsa of the University of Pittsburgh is the Society’s President.
