REFLECTION FOR EASTER, 1988 By Fr. Charles E. Hankins, O.S.B. Supreme Chaplain, FCSU О n Easier Sunday we celebrate the victory ol hte over death Jesus Christ transcended fear, hatred, sin. and death ' 0 death where is your victory? 0 death where is your sting?" (i Cor 15.55). We celebrate the fulfillment of his life and ministry, and our fulfillment as a Christian people The Easter event transforms the whole of God's creation II actually changes our whole way of looking at God and at life's meaning and pur pose, if we let it. This implies we have a choice to make, and with this choice comes a consequence The life of Christ, culminating in his suffering, death and resurrection, gives us a road map to follow on our journey through life. We can either choose to proceed on the correct path or follow our own way The former leads to happiness and peace, while the taller ends with despair and turmoil The American and Canadian Automobile Associations provide road maps for their members Carefully they will chart the most direct route to a destination The Church does the same for its members by teaching that Jesus is the way to salvation. Following him will lead us safely lo eternal life. Just as the disciples chose io experience the presence of Jesus resur reckon, now we have come to celebrate this historical event. Christ is alive' He is nsen' The resurrection power ol God always and everywhere is telling us that through life's turmoils and tribulations our suffenng is not without meaning, that with death comes a new beginning We will rise with Jesus and sing a new refrain The story of Easter then, is the story of the faith that Jesus inspires in those who believe in him This is the day the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be glad1" Л Эйфру and" 'Blessed 'Laster to Я fl CATHOLIC FRATERNAL WEEKLY JE DNOTA (THE UNION) (USPS 273500) ' Official Organ of the First Catholic Slovak Union of the UnitedStates and Canada VOLUME 97 JEDNOTA.

Christ willingly died for our sins shamefully on the Cross: His temple ordeal of holy week evidently was not a loss. He rose on His own from the grave blocked by a stone door, death and sin are conquered and He doesn't suffer any more. An empty tomb on Easter Sunday brings us peace and love: it only goes to prove of what God s heart was made of. “Death, where is your victory? Where's the bitter sting?" many still do not believe, yet Alleluias everywhere ring. Without the sorrow of Good.

The huge stone is roiled back and the Lord is not even there, yes, Christ has risen as He so often predicted here and there. Christ appeared even to the apostles in the cenacle room: in spite of their doubt as to what happened at the tomb The denying Peter came second to the sepulcher in the garden, he was so happy because the Galilean has granted him pardon. ' Weeping bitterly" Peter is now made the rock of the Church: here on in the 'gates of hell" will not leave it in a lurch. His disciples in the breaking ol the bread recognize Him again.

"My Lord and my God" and He supplies his need Good Lord, how can we thank You for alt that You've done? hanging on the cross in apparent defeat. You really won Your Resurrection is Your pledge of our everlasting union: to this day we can be united with You in Holy Communion.

Ohio, or that traveling to the West Coast is too expensive. To these observations might I. as President of our Society, state that it has been the policy ol our Society to treat all of our membership with equal representation and ■t would be grossly unfair to our total membership if our Board of Directors were to meet only in the City ol Cleveland, or Youngstown or Pittsburgh All members of our Society are lo be treated equally, and we must, if we are a fraternal organization. meet periodically in diflereni cues in which we have Society membership to make these areas more aware of our presence, our interest in their specific areas, and then specific problems To those who maintain that traveling to a distant city incurs increased cost to the Society, might I point out (hat travel to the San Diego area io day is just as ехрепэѵе as a trip from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, to Chicago. Illinois, or from Cleveland. Ohio, lo Middletown, Pennsylvania So to those m our membership who feel that the Board of Directors travels to cities outside of Cleveland is an inordinate expense, let me allay those fears by stating that any increased costs are far outweighed by the public relations benefits obtained by visiting different areas periodically, areas that have not been visited by members of our Society for many, many years In welcoming the Board of Directors to the San Diego area, permit me to indicate that the Jednota membership in California has done an outstanding job m representing Slovak interests m the United States and Canada and many prominent Slovak leaders, who are also Jednota members, reside in the State of California Mr. Ray Plutko. whose column on geneoiogy appears in our JEDNOTA newspaper, originally comes from the California area, but now resides m Nevada Mrs El Nora Rusnak, who resides here in San Diego, has been very active in putting on the youth programs emmating from the Slate of California and which have appeared at ihe Youth Festivals ol the Slovak World Congress.

WEDNESDAY. MARCH 23. 1988 Medjugorje Messages: One Bishop Rejoices, Another Sees Fraud By John Thavia (Second in а five-part series) MEDJUGORJE. Yugoslavia (NO) — The story ol Medjugorje can be told as the story of two Yugoslavian bishops: one who rejoiced and one who saw deception and disobedience. The bishops have become spokesmen for opposite sides of a bitter controversy over the reported Marian apparitions, which began in the- small Yugoslavian village in 1981. Archbishop Frane Franie of Split- MakaísKSťSsíítthat until the church mekes-elihai judgment the bottom line at Medjugorje is spiritual renewal among local Catholics and thousands of foreign visitors. ‘One snowy weekday evening. I went there myself and found the church overflowing with people. Everyone was confessing, praying on their knees and receiving Communion. I was amazed," said Archbishop Franie, whose archdiocese is less than an hour's drive from Medjugorje. The fasting, the confessing, the conversion: I thought, this can only be the fruit of supernatural events," he said But Bishop Pavao Zanie of Mos- tar-Duvno. the diocese that includes Medjugorje, sees deception and division in the church locally, and possible embarrassment lor the universal church. "II is a trick. There is a lot of slyness and a lot of exploration of people going on." said Bishop Zanie. He said that "not one" of his diocesan priests believes tn the Med jugorje events. The bishop has unsuccessfully tried to stop pilgrimages to the site. The bishops spoke with National Catholic News Service in Yugoslavia and in Rome. "Mary sees that her children are sick and in danger, so she's calling us to the basic 'medicine' " of prayer and fasting, said Archbishop Franie. He said he had seen spiritual conversion and physical healings at Medjugorje ' The effect is one of conversion, m Yugoslavia. Germany. France, the United States and elsewhere." the archbishop said. But he added that most ol his own priests "don't even want to hear of Medjugorje." But he said "Medjugorje completed my theology.” Bishop Zanie said he at first defended the young visionaries and the possibility that Mary was appearing daily to them. But that changed after the Virgin was said to have sided against him in- favor of two local Franciscans who had been suspended from their ministry. The suspensions were tied to a longstanding feud in which Franciscan friars have refused to transfer control of several parishes in the region to diocesan clergy.

Bishop Zanie said, he received a letter from one of the visionaries warning he would be judged by Mary and Christ unless he accepted the apparitions. "I mailed the letter to the Vatican the same day. For me, the question was decided," he said. He noted that Catholics are never required to believe in Marian apparitions. The Franciscans at Medjugorje say the jurisdictional dispute is irrelevant to the apparitions. Bui they add that the idea of-Mary criticizing a bishop is not unrealistic* "After all. bishops have made many, many mistakes," said Father Philip Pavích, a U.S. Franciscan at Medjugorje. "In my modest judgment. Mary can ask a bishop to be more-ptu dent," said Archbishop Frant?,- "Even we bishops should accept warnings from heaven " Brshop Zante. rn a sermon-last June in Medjugorje, announced he was forbidding priests to celebrate Mass there if they led pilgrimages or attributed a supernatural character to the events "I was certain it would be ignored. but I purposely raised the issue so the world would know the bishop thinks il is very important." Bishop Zanlc said. The Yugoslavian bishops' conference had previously discouraged pilgrimages to Medjugorje. The policy'at Medjugorje is Io consider the bishop's order unenforceable. Based on interviews there in mid-February. it was clear that most pnests accompany rather than organize the pilgrimages. But most, especially the Medjugorje Franciscans, also describe the ap pantions as authentic. The word "if" is rarely used. "Why shouldn't we be free to believe or not?" said Father Slavko Barbaric He tells pilgrims that the Vatican took the issue out of Bishop (Continued on Page 6) ST. PETER A tough fisherman who knew the deep waters of Galilee when fish weren't biting experienced some dire poverty. His Impetuosity prompted him to cast his nets Instead for souls whose hardened hearts apparently seemed so dead. Christ left Peter about as far as one can throw a stone to pray to His heavenly Father in Gethsemane all alone. In the garden Christ crimsoned roots with blood and wept; not being conscious of Christ's agony Peter soundly slept. Neuer before was any person that cold before a hot fire facing a maiden He denied, his Master and became a liar. ■‘Your speech betrays you" that you the Galilean resemble substituting a sword for prayer faith begins to tremble. As nets tangled In Galilean waters "he knew not the man" his conscience bothered him. so in disgust he swore-ran. As a channel of grace God used the crowning of the cock He never gives up. Tears turn Peter Into a Church's rock. Moses struck a rock and its gushing waters caused fears but, Christ's wounded eyes caused Peter to go into tears. Peter reminds us of hope and God's mercy, not our behavior; if we never sinned we couldn't ever call Christ. "Savior." Even a flicker of faith will help us reach our final goal to gain pardon and above all. to save our immortal soul Matthew Bonk, O.S.B.

KRAJSA, KSGG MISS LIBERTY BECKONED NEARBY ELLIS ISLAND: THE IMMIGRATION EXPERIENCE Chains unshackled at her feet, the Statue of Liberty holds aloft the torch that has lit the way for millions of Immigrants to begin new Ilves. In, the New York Narrows early in the century, .transatlantic steamers anchored at Quarantine while In- speqlors and immigration officials boarded to survey the latest ar- гіѵйТ&чэШцитіап cargo. Jbej^ai bulk of immigrating passengers — those in third and fourth class and steerage — were put on barges there or aL receiving piers upstream. and ferried to Ellis Island, the U.S. Immigration station. No name is more closely linked with massive American immigration than Ellis Island's. For three decades — 1892-1924 - the greatest tide of incoming humanity in the na- tion's history swept through this narrow portal in Upper New York Bay. From Its opening in 1892 to its closing In 1954, more than 17 million newcomers arrived al Ellis Island. Today almost half of all living Americans can trace their heritage to one or more family members who first stepped onto American soil at Ellis Island. While Miss Liberty beckoned nearby, the thirty-three structures on this Island became theater for an enormous and repetitious drama. The masses of crowded Europe — manual laborers, domestics, uprooted peasants, blacksmiths. displaced artisans and families — trooped off the barges, up the quay and into the main building. They were received Into the ground floor baggage room where they deposited their worldly belongings before climbing the flights of stairs to the Great Hall for medical and legal examinations. The medical exam began as the immigrant climbed the stairs Into the Great Hall. Doctors were walling at the top of the steps, watching the immigrants as they climbed. Was the immigrant breathing heavily? We he limping? Did he have any type of a physical deformity that would hinder him from finding a Job here in the United States, or as a result of which he would become a public charge? When the immigrant reached the top of the stairs, he would walk in a circle in front of the doctor. The doctor would examine the Immigrant's hair and face. The inspector was also looking for any typy of contagious disease, whether it be curable or incurable. If the inspector suspected that the immigrant had a medical problem, he would take the immigrant out of line and mark his clothing with a piece of chalk — and "L" for lameness, an "H" for suspected heart disease, and an "E" for eye problems. The immigrant then entered the Great Hall and would remain until he could be taken upstairs for a full examination. Prior to 1911. the Great Hail was divided by metal passageways. In 1911, the staircase that ran from die baggage room into the center of the Great Hall was removed and staircases were put in on either side of the room. At that time, wooden benches were arranged in rows across the room. After the immigrant completed his medical Inspection, he would sit on the benches, working his way across the room to the legal inspectors. Legal inspectors had In front of them the ships' manifest sheets — lists of all the passengers that had arrived on the steamships that day. Each immigrant wore a manifest tag on his clothing with two numbers on ii. It Indicated to the inspector the page and the line on the page of the manifest sheet that the immigrant’s name appeared. Beside the immigrant's name the sheet contained answers io questions he had presumably been asked in Europe before he was sold his steamship ticket. The steamship companies were responsible for the immigrants and were supposed to conduct medical and legal examinations before they sold the immigrant a ticket. The inspector at Ellis Island would merely re-ask the questions. There were approximately 30 questions asked in about 2 minutes. They were asked in English, but the immigrant would have an interpreter as needed. The questions went something like this: "What is your name?" "Where were you bom?" "Where arc you coming from?" "Where are you going?" "Have you ever been to the JEDNOTA (USPS 273500) Catholic Weekly Issued Every Wednesday Publisher and Proprietor FIRST CATHOLIC SLOVAK UNION of the United Statefl of America and Canada JOSEPH C.

United States before?" "Do you have any relatives here?" "Where do they live?" "is there anyone who can come out to meet you on Ellis Island?" “Who paid for your passage?" "Doyou have any money — let me see it?" "Do w have any skills? ' "Do,' you have a trade?" "Do you have a job waiting for you here in tňe United States?" "Are you an anarchist?^.' > “Are you a póly-^ gamlsl?" "Do you have a criminal record?" If the Immigrant answered any of these questions improperly, he would also be taken out of line. Then, he would receive an "SI" on his clothing In chalk. He would be detained until he could appear before the Board of Special Inquiry — the legal examiners on Ellis Island. For 80 percent of the immigrants, the average stay on Ellis Island was only 3 to 5 hours. Twenty percent were detained for either a medical or a legal reason, and between 1892 and 1924 only two percent, approximately a quarter of a million people, were excluded from admission to the United Slates. If one was detained for a medical reason, he would be given a full physical examination. If one had a curable medical problem, he would be cared for in the hospital building across the ferry slip until he was well enough to go on to the United States. If one had a contagious, incurable disease, he could not be admitted to the U.S. He would be cared for in the contagious disease wards on the far side of the island, until a steamship could take him back to Europe. Trachoma was the most common medical reason for exclusion. It was a very contagious, then Incurable, disease that resulted in blindness. It was very common in the Mediterranean area. If an immigrant was detained for a legal reason, he would appear before the Board of Special Inquiry. This Board had 5 members — a stenographer, an interpreter, and 3 voting members. A 2 out of 3 vote determined if the immigrant would be allowed to remain in the United States. The Board's decision could be appealed to the Commissioner of the island, and as high as the Secretary of Commerce and Labor who. at one time or another, had overall control of the immigration processing in the United States. One of the more prevalent legal problems was contracted labor. The Alien Contract Labor Law. passed in 1885. prohibited American employers from bringing immigrants to the United States either to work for lower wages than American workers were willing to accept or to break up strikes here in the United States. If an immigrant was found to be "contracted labor.” it would be grounds for his exclusion. However, most immigrants who were held on Ellis Island were considered temporary detainees. Many Were waiting for a relative or friend to pick them up on the island or were awaiting money or directions lo a final destination. For those who were detained, their stay was financed by the steamship company. The company was considered legally responsible for every Immigrant, until he or she was admitted to the United States. If one were excluded, the steamship company was required to provide free passage to his port of origin. If a person were under the age of twelve, the steamship company would provide for him and one parent to return. The dining room at Ellis sold foods with which most immigrants would be familiar — thick soups, stews, fresh breads, milk, and fruit. And there was a chapel in which all the various religious groups could worship. Most people were processed the day they arrived. Those required to stay longer were quartered in dormitories or In the Island hospital. Charitable agencies maintained offices on Lhe island to assist newcomers or help them get In touch with relatives and friends on the mainland. The betrothed were summoned and marriage often took place on the spot. Out of sheer expediency, unexpected matches were sometimes made. Landing cards were issued to those who passed muster. Ferries shuttled passengers the mile to Manhattan or lhe scant 300 yards to the New Jersey piers. Offices for exchanging currencies. purchasing railroad tickets and sending telegrams did business on the island. Most contingencies were mel but in the babble of many spoken languages, communications often went awry. On one occasion a group of 16 immigrants destined for Amsterdam Avenue. Manhattan. arrived in Amsterdam, an up-state New York community. Approximately one-third of the immigrants admitted through Ellis were ferried back to Battery Park in Manhattan and settled in the New York City area. The remaining two-thirds bought railroad tickets on Ellis Island and awaited ferries that took them to New Jersey and on to major terminals where they caught trains to destinations throughout lhe United States. Until the 1880's, the individual states had exercised what little control of Immigration was necessary. A vast underpopulated country held open the door and welcomed foreigners. But in the latter half of the 19th century as the number of newcomers began to spiral, fear and conern about the social and economic effects of the country's long standing open door policy also began to rise. Notwithstanding the swell of Irish immigration in the 1840s and 1850s, as a result of the potato famine, the status quo — state control — remained until the 1870s. But in that decade, without catastrophe elsewhere contributions, more than 280.000 immigrants a year were streaming into the country. The need for a clear national immigration policy became overwhelming. Under congressional pressure. America's open door on immigration was closed. Yielding to constituent demands successive Congresses enacted more regulations and restrictions. Not only individuals but nationalities came under scrutiny. The laws said who were admissible.

DUKAKIS-ROBB? By Michael Novak Knowing of my collection of "Best Bumper Stickers." a friend reported a new gem to me, first spatted In Florida: TANNED. FIT AND READY NIXON IN '88 A Jest, of course. The former President has already written in the London Times that the GOP ticket In 1988 will be Bush-Kemp. And now the outlines of the Democratic ticket are also fuzzily appearing in the crystal-ball: Dukakis and a Southerner. Most people seem to be thinking Dukakis-Gore. But Dukakis- Robb might be better, except that Robb, the son-in-law of Lyndon Johnson, is now campaigning for a senate seat. Robb would awaken echoes of the old winning Democratic traditions: "Landslide Lyndon." So it now looks like: “Bush- Kemp. Dukakis-Gore." The problem Dukakis faces is the obverse of the quip about Jimmy Carter: "With one foot in Massachusetts, Dukakis is going to have to put the other foot in Georgia — which should give him a pain tight about Washington." At the Democratic convention in Atlanta, light bulbs will pop as Dukakis embraces Jimmy Carter. Bert Lance. Andy Young and Jesse Jackson. What a walk down memory lane! George Bush. U.S. News and. World Report says, is the candidate comedians most like lo Joke about. Many of those jokes are ethnic Jokes about high New England WASPS. Unlike other ethnic Jokes. WASP jokes usually have the twist that the butl of the Joke ends up being more admired. For example; "In the U.S. there are 240 million citizens. Of these, 123 million arc women, 53 million Catholic. 29 million black. 17 million Hispanic. 6 million Jews, and 2.8 million Episcopalians. Of these groups, which does not consider itself a minority?" My advice to the Vice-President is to be proud of being ethnic, and to praise such ethnic foods as cucumber sandwiches, sandwiches of any kind without crust, and fruit punch. He should also speak openly about the Great WASP Secret. Mostly, WASPS tend to talk Incessantly about "the individual.” Truth is. like everybody else, they owe all they háve — their good habits, their manners. their Serce ambition — to their families. High WASPS are a great family people. But they never talk about it- Catholics. Jews, and Southerners always talk about family. Mario Cuomo puls his mother on television, Mike Dukakis never loses a chance to talk about his "immigrant family.” and his Jewish in-laws are gangbusters, too. Families are going to go toe-to-toe, ancestor to ancestor, in 1988. The reason is simple. Family is what most Americans worry about today. There are drugs in the schools, and AIDS appears in nightmares. The values kids are taught by television. rock videos, and even the public schools sometimes make the heart sink. Since long before this contemporary turmoil, family has been the most talked-aboul reality among Catholics, even Woody Allen often jokes about this. Catholics tend to think of Size and geography prepared Ellis Island for its role. Castle Garden, the former opera house at the tip of Manhanntan that had served as the immigration station since 1855. lacked the capacity to process the masses of people coming to America. In 1890 the new Immigrant Bureau closed the facility and converted the naval arsenal on Ellis Island to its purposes. It opened on January 1. 1892, and five years later when lhe original wooden buildings burned down. 33 brick buildings were constructed to handle the flow. Massive immigration ceased after 1924, but Ellis Island continued lo serve as an immigration center though portions of the facilities were turned to other uses. The island became a detention and rehabilitation center during World War II. From 1942 to 1946 it was a Coast Guard training center. It was closed and vacated by the government in 1954. The premises deteriorated as the buildings were vandalized and ravaged by weather. The decline ended in 1965 when Ellis Island was turned over to the National Park Service. It was reopened as an immigration museum and became an integral part- of the Statue of Liberty National Monument. In 1975 Congress appropriated funds to clean up and stabilize a portion of the main buildings, and in 1976 the island was opened to the public for tours from May through October. It is presently closed for extensive restoraton. The restoration of Ellis Island is designed to commemorate the courage and contributions of all those who immigrated to the U.S. from every area of tlie world. The station, just a few thousand yards from the Stalue of Liberty. is being restored by the Park Service in conjunction with the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation. Inc., for its centennial in 1922. themselves as members of a family, even before they think of themselves as individuals. This is an important electoral polni. Ronald Reagan knew it well. His campaign slogan in 1980 was: "Family. Work, Neighborhood, Peace, Strength." When he talked that way. he sounded like an Irish Catholic (which his father was). He needed the Catholic ethnic vote. He got it. George Bush and Michael Dukakis will have to talk family language, too. Why? Because the 1988 election will be decided by the nation's most dramatic swing voters, the 25 million or so Roman and Orthodox Catholic voters largely concentrated In the band of high-electoral vote states from Massachusetts to Wisconsin. Seventy-six percent of white Protestants across the country voted for Ronald Reagan. But Catholics tend lo oscillate between Democratic and Republican presidential candidates. Catholic voters have three political characteristics.- (1) They vote in higher proportion than any group besides Jews. (In some locations, such as Chicago, they take this obligation seriously enough to vote from the grave.) (2) They are concentrated in the dozen highest electoral-vote states. Including Florida. Texas and California. ,|3) They have voted as high on the Democratic side as 76 percent for Lyndon Johnson. and as low as 44 percent for Walter Mondale. As a rule of thumb, in order to overcome the downstate Republican vote, the Democrats need at least 60 percent of the (Continued on Page 6) [pageend4]JEDNOTA, WEDNESDAY.

Washington Letter Rethinking Private Answers To College Financial Aid Problems By Stephenie Overman WASHINGTON (NCI - A private initiative touted as an alternative to government fund ing to help parents beat high college tutuon costs Is being reevaluated by the Catholic college that pioneered il and by others that followed its example. Duquesne University in Pittsburgh began the first prepaid tuition program in 1985 for alumni. It expanded the program the following year to include non-alumni. The prepaid plan is one alternative far parents who must anticipate paying tuition costs that have escalated at twice the rate of Inflation But for economic and federal policy reasons, that alternative may be in Jeopardy Falling bond interest rates and sharp tuition increases have forced the Duquesne Univeristy board to review the program. Other college and state programs also are on hold while waiting for an Internal Revenue Service ruling on the plan's tax Implications Under the prepaid tuition plan, parents begin early to save for college tuition by paying a lump sum to the college when tlieir children are very young. The college invests the money, which accumulates interest and is used to pay tuition when the child enrolls in that college The Chronicle of Higher Education reported that financial aid to college students rose to a record of $20.5 billion in 1986- 87 but that the increase did not keep pace with the cost of attending college. Most student aid money comes from die federal govern ment, but that share has been dropping, with spending on financial aid by states and colleges (Continued on Page 6) in the Library-Museum under proper atmospheric conditions to ensure their preservation for future generations.

Fox Lake. IL (312) 587-4588 FROM OUR JEDNOTA HISTORY By Anthony X. Sutherland, Ph.D. EDITOR JOZEF HUSEK ARRESTED IN CLEVELAND, OHIO, IN 1917 The history of the First Catholic Slovak Union is filled with examples of fights and quarrels, some originating from legitimate differences of opinion or political philosophy, but many Just the result of jeal ously or downright maliciousness. When attempting to understand these quarrels it is often difficult to determine how much of a particular quarrel was based on real differences of opinion and how much on just personal animosity or personality conflict. Such was the case of the debate of 1916 1917. be tween Jozef Husek. editor of Jednota and Rev. Jan Lfscin- sky. editor of Ženská Jednota and Obrana. During the first twenty years or so of its existence, the First Catholic Slovak Union was solely a male organization, as was the First Catholic Slovak Ladies Union a female organization. After ihe adopllon of the "new system." or payment according to age. the First Catholic Slovak Union began to admit female members. Within a few years there were over 13.000 female members in the previously all male society. The Society had found a new source of membership. giving it added strength. In 1917. Jozef Husek began to write articles urging women to join the First Catholic Slovak Union. Rev. Jan Liscinsky. editor of Ženská Jednota, and others In the women's society (which itself had begun to accept male members) considered Husek s articles an attack on their society. The arguments between the two societies — specifically between Husek and Liscinsky — continued. Soon Liscinsky moved Zen ska Jednota lo Cleveland. Husek wrote. "Our organ. Jednota. has served our sister organization for many years free of charge, and for many other years almost free of charge. Without Jednota our sister organization would nol be what il is today, the greatest and richesl women's organiza tion. We desired and still desire today its further progress. Wc are ready to give it brotherly assistance at every opportunity" He said since the Jednota had always helped its sister organization, it was difficult for him to understand when they said. "We do not need you, wc do nol want you." The arguments between Liscinsky and Husek over the two organizations, and over other matters as well, escalated into a bitter quarrel. President Anna Ondrej and Honorare President Anna Hurban of the First Catholic Slovak Ladies Union came to the annual meeting of the First Catholic Slovak Union in Cleveland in January. 1918. to ask for peace. Anna Ondrej said they were instructed by their organization to come to the meeting to seek an end to the debate. They argued that the whole affair was a personal quarrel between Husek and Fa ther Liscinsky. and asked them to put a stop to it in the future. The supeme officers were satisfied witli this appeal for peace But soon after. Jozef Husek was arrested by the Cleveland police as he was leaving one of the sessions. He was taken to the city police station on charges of libel brought up by Father Liscinsky Husek feared he would have to spend the night In jail, bul he was bailed out by Michal Bosak and Jan Pankuch. With the help of a lawyer. Jan Feriencik. the matter was soon settled. The supreme officers of the First Catholic Slovak Union drew up a resolution saying that they were not responsible for any personal actions of Jozef Husek. They were confident that the mailer was mainly a personal debate between Father Liscinsky and Jozef Husek and there it should rest. And so it did.' Within a short time peaceful relations returned between the two organizations. Zenska Jed nota was moved back to Middletown. and soon there began the talk of merging the two societies. C.

WEDNESDAY. MARCH 23, 1988 ŕ- LIGHT ONE CANDLE It is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness. (Christopher Motto) By Father John Catoir Director of The Christophers EXTREMISM ISN'T THE ANSWER TIME magazine (Feb. 1, 1988) ran an article on the crisis in our schools entitled.- "Is Getting Tough the Answer?" School principal Joe Clark. Lhe rigid disciplinarian from Paterson, N.J. was fcatureíLon the cover wielding a baseball bat. When you consider the discipTuť^roblems he had to face In that school, you can underfitalld his attitude, even If you disagree with his extreme measures. In the 1940’s the leading school problems were running in the hallways, talking in class, wearing improper clothes and chewing gum. In the 1980's they are drug abuse, pregnancy, suicide, assault on teachers and arson. Abuses such as these create extreme reactions like bullhorns and baseball bats. Without commenting on lhe pros and cons of the education debate I'd like to draw a comparison with the problem of church discipline. In the 1940 s the leading Catholic Church problems were missing Mass on Sunday, birth control, mixed marriages and teenage drinking. In the 80s we face a more serious array: widespread divorce, abortion, the rejection of church authority, teenage pregnancy, drug abuse and suicide- It’s no wonder that some Catholics are angry. Many of those whose children went astray blame the church for being too permissive, and they tend to become fiercely conservative, resisting change at all costs. Conservative-thinking Catholics are right when they try to prevent lhe church and society from deteriorating further but the tactics of some only fuel the fire of strife and division. They consider this a necessary prophetic role. Occasionally one of my "liberal" columns attracts angry mail from conservatives; at other times my more "conservative" columns will draw fire from liberals. By choice I find myself somewhere in the middle along with the vast majority of Catholics who see the good on both sides. Since my column appears tn 150 periodicals it’s impossible to answer every letter or agree with everyone’s opinion, but I do respect the sincerity of anyone who takes the time and trouble to write me. 1 keep every one of them in Mass and prayer. However, in my opinion, extremism on either side is counterproductive. "Our senses can grasp nothing that is extreme; too much noise deafens us: too much light binds us: too far or too near prevents us from seeing. ” (Pascal) For а free copy of lhe Christopher News Notes.

In 1980-81 die federal government contributed 83 percent of the aid. but only 74 percent last year. Ann Rago, director of public relations at Duquesne, said "the time was ripe" when Duquesne began its program in 1985 but the bond rate dropped from 10.8 percent in 1985 to 8.52 percent while tuition increases jumped from 6 percept to 7.95 percent. Tuition for the 1987-88 school year is $6.825 and will increase to $7.350 next year. "When it began, a lump sum program lor an infant (who would be| enrolling In the year 2005 wasS4.45O " she said.

Evenbody knows (bat the real dynamo in education is the family, not the school. (Examine the family effect on Asian educational achievement). My advice to Dukakis: Re member the Persian Conquest of Athens. Remember Alexander the Great Greeks were fighters once. Don’t be a wimp Don't threaten to invade Panama because of "a treaty;" say it with gusio! Ethnics are tired of being kicked around, first as ethnics, now as Americans But then, in a book in 1972.

The university is "evaluating every year." Ms. Rago said. It's not that we’re considering scrapping the program forever." The university has looked at other ways to help rparents and students pay tuition but no plan is being implemented in place of the prepaid tuition program, she added. Ms. Rago said there have been about a dozen "copy-cat programs" at other colleges. Also a handful of state governments. starting with Michigan, began prepaid tuition plans. But some state governments have held off on the program, waiting for the IRS to rule on its tax status Officials expressed concern that parents will have to pay income tax on interest earned when the state invests the payments, making the program less attractive to them Ms. Rago said Duquesne was waiting for a private IRS ruling and said the tax status was not a factor in the decision to review the program. But it has been a factor for Canisius College, a Catholic school in Buffalo. N.Y. Sue Banchich. director of public information at Canisius, said the program "is on hold right now. awaiting the IRS ruling A prepaid room and board program is also on hold. A program at another Catholic college, the University of Detroit, is also being re examined. Twenty-one people participated in the Canisius program, which began in 1986. and "many, many more were interested" when it was put on hold. Ms. Banchich said. She also said Canisius had a better bond rate than Duquesne and parents were required to invest more money. so the plan was not hit by the economic problems that affected Duquesne. The university did not make any money from the program. Ms. Banchich said, but for parents and students, "it's a hedge against inflation and not knowing where the government will turn with financial aid. It’s kind of an Insurance policy.” State Visits to the Vatican: Orchestrated Minuets of Diplomacy (Continued (ram Page 1) an issue, other factors must be weighed. Is the visitor coming to Rome primarily to see the pope, or is (he Vatican one stop among many? Is the head of state sufficiently important in his or her country to warrant an official reception? Does he or she represent a Catholic country, and is the Vatican diplomat posted there a nunoo or pronuncio? Perhaps most importantly, is the visiting head of state willing to endure an official visit's more formal protocol? Most visits to the Vatican by world leaders and heads ot state are "private " Reagan's two visits were private — one prior to establishing lull diplomatic relations and one during the president's trip to the 1987 economic summit. While Queen Elizabeth II was received in an official visit m 1S80, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's visit a month later was private. Ortega, in a last-minute arrangement on the eve of a key U S. congressional vote on contra-aid funding. had a private visit Private visits are often nearly as elaborate as any official visit, particularly in the case of a leader like Reagan But like all such minuets of diplomacy, there is a great deal of flexibility m what is allowed, from a public exchange of speeches to a simple televised handshake for the people back home. The dress is simpler, the honor guards fewer, the accompanying dignitaries fewer for most private visits The rarity of an official visit is underscored by ihe fact that m the past year only Waldheim and Argentine President Raul Alfons«! opted lor all the flourishes internationally isolated by accusations he was involved in German war crimes in the Balkans. Waldheim's first foreign wsil as a head ol state was to the Vatican last June Austria pushed hard lor such a visit A Vatican spokesman noted the country "repeatedly requested" it. Ultimately, the demands ol protocol left little doubt that Waldheim would receive the official visit he coveted. He represented an important Catholic country with full diplomatic relations with the Vatican, and he came to Rome lor the sole purpose of seeing the pope. The biend of 20th-century diplomacy and centunes-old tradition which characterize an official visit to the Vatican is evident from thejirsi. moment of arrival A caravan ol dark-blue Alfa Ro meos races at wheel-squealing speed across St. Peter s Square, then comes to a sudden halt before a picket of Swiss Guards dressed in Renaissance uniforms and armed with swords and halberds — a combination spear and battle-axe. In an official visit, the Vatican arranges for the transportation ol the guest and the Italian police escort that brings the diplomat to (he Arch of Ihe Beils, to ihe left ot the basilica, where the Swiss Guards wait. There are exceptions, such as Queen Elizabeth's insistence that she arrive in her own Rolls Royce. Reagan arrived by helicopter at a heliport in the Vatican gardens. Si Peter s Square, as well as ihe church, are closed tor the duration ot an official visit.

WEDNESDAY. MARCH 23ľ 19ВЙ~ ' PRESIDENT KRISTOFIK’S REPORT ‘ * (Continued Irom Page 1) PREFACE tremely productive meeting lor this Board of Directors. As we discuss the annual financial statement of our Society for 1987. our progress in (he implementation of our corporation concept, and our outreach to our younger membership through college programs such as the language and literature program at the University of Pittsburgh, let us also exert our best efforts to solidify our relationships with our California membership and all poten- beU^-rCaliiornia membership from among the Slovak population residing ^-4 hi^G < - ’’ There is great promise for increased membership in our western states Let us as a Board of Directors, put into effect those programs which will increase this membership by simulating greater interest in product sales by our recommenders, by programs which educate our recommenders to the quantity and quality of our products, and to the programs of our Society which promote fraternalism, and the interests of the Slovaks as a people and as a nation. Let us pray, that during this week, we will be the beneficiaries of the wisdom which we pray the Holy Spirit will endow upon all of us who participate at this Board of Directors Meeting. We pray also that the Slovak community in San Diego and all of our local officers in this state will continue their efforts in behalf ol the First Catholic Slovak Union, and in behalf of our Slovak Community nationwide. Joseph R. Krlstoflk Chairman — Board of Directors First Catholic Slovak Union Catamaran Hotel San Diego, California March 21. 1988 1987’ What a year! A stock market crash rivaling the stock market cotlapse ol 1929. A balance ol trade showing the highest deficit trade balance in American history. The value of the American dollar at all-time lows. The price of gold dropping. Oil prices dropping and oil becoming a glut on the world market. The forecast of an economic recession or downturn racing throughout the equity markets. But yet, for the First Catholic Slovak Union. 1987 was a very good year. The First Catholic Slovak Union suffered no financial setbacks during the stock market collapse of October 19,1987, for one very simple reason — the First Catholic Slovak Union did not invest in stocks during 1987. In fact, the First Catholic Slovak Union has not invested in stocks over the past twenty- five years. The First Catholic Slovak Union has had very conservative management, whose investment philosophy has been lo protect Society interests despite the lures of high investment returns in the stock market, and whose philosophy has been to invest in the relative safely of the bond markets for security and long range financial appreciation The Society’s investment philosophy has also been directed to land appreciation and land development programs, which have also added to the financial growth and stability of our Society during 1987 Our annual statement for 1987 indicates that our Society’s premium income for the 1987 fiscal year was $6,032,372, and of this amount $659,049 went into surplus, making our total surplus at the end of 1987 to be $8,739,884. Over $2,761,100 went into reserves, which served to increase our total assets in 1987 to $57,598,173. Our outside, independent, certified public accountants, our actuary, and our internal auditors will give this Board of Directors a full report on the financial activities of our Society over this past year, and each of these reports will be published for the information of our membership.

The entire story can be evaluated only after all the other futuristic programs of the Society are taken into consideration, and in my annual report to the Board of Directors, as President, I will touch on all areas which affected our financial and fraternal performance during 1987, and just as importantly, areas which will affect positively our annual reports next year and during all the upcoming years in the future. - -, Before going to a dfepartment-by-department evaluation of our Society’s performance during 1987, let me for a moment digress to explain to this Board of Directors, and through this Board to our membership, the extreme seriousness of the problems which have hindered our Society's progress and income during this past-^ear. These problems were the creation of district officers of our Society in the Cleveland, Ohio, area. These problems were unnecessary and unjustified Society harassment. There were problems which created unnecessary, unjustified legal and administrative expense for our Society exceeding $45.000 during 1987 alone. There were problems which have cost our Society loss of prestige and embarass- ment to its Board of Directors and Supreme Officers. These are problems which must be discussed, and resolved finally by action of this Board of Directors at this Annual Meeting. On July 11,1987, the officers of the Rev. Stephen Furdek District of Cleveland, Ohio, without giving any notice to the Executive Secretary or Supreme President as mandated by the Society's Bylaws, filed a letter of complaint with the Insurance Department of the State of Ohio, alleging violations of the Bylaws of the Frst Catholic Slovak Union by the Supreme President of our Society. In their allegations, the Rev. Stephen Furdek District complained to the Insurance Department of the State of Ohio that the Supreme President had exceeded his powers, failed to comply with certain provisions of Chapter 3921 of the Ohio Revised Code, had dissipated Society assets, and was conducting business FRAUDULENTLY or in a manner hazardous to the members of the First Catholic Slovak Union. The complaints to the Insurance Department of the State of Ohio were filed in behalf of the Rev. Stephen Furdek District by its President, Stephen J. Kandra. and its Secretary. John S. Golias. For the record, it should be noted that Andrew Putka. Esq., represented the Rev. Stephen Furdek District at meetings with the Insurance Department of the Slate of Ohio located in Columbus. Ohio, In a second complaint. IN VIOLATION OF OUR SOCIETY BYLAWS, the Rev. Stephen Furdek District alleged to the Supreme Court of the First Catholic Slovak Union, that violations ol our Society Bylaws were made by the Supreme President of the First Catholic Slovak Union, and requested his suspension, expulsion, or dismissal as Supreme President. The Rev. Stephen Furdek District also contacted all of Ihe twenty districts of ihe First Catholic Slovak Union asking them to join the Furdek District in its actions before the Insurance Department of the State of Ohio, and before the Supreme Court of the First Catholic Slovak Union. Only the Frank Holly District of Uniontown, Pennsylvania, whose President is Mrs. Audrey Balazik, joined with the Furdek District in this complaint. Without going into detail, as most of this material has already been published in our JEDNOTA newspaper, the Insurance Department of the State of Ohio, after listening to the complaints of the representative of the Rev. Stephen Furdek District; after conducting an investigation on its behalf; and after conducting an investigation on its own behalf; and after having considered all the evidence presented to the Department of Insurance, found our Society, its Supreme Officers, its Board of Directors, and its Supreme President, to be fully innocent of all charges brought before the Insurance Department of the State of Ohio. In vindicating our Society and the Supreme President of all charges, the Insurance Department further found no reason tor a Show Cause Hearing, confirmed to our Society that all the business transactions conducted by our Society to date were legal under Ohio Statutes, and more importantly, ruled that the Rev. Stephen Furdek District of Cleveland. Ohio, had violated our Society Bylaws by not seeking remedies to their complaints within the forums of the Frst Catholic Slovak Union as specified in our Bylaws, before coming to the Ohio Department of Insurance. This unnecessary action by the Rev. Stephen Furdek District has cost our Society over $45,000 in Ihe 1987 fiscal BULKMATIC TRANSPORT COMPANY DRY AND LIQUID COMMON/CONTRACT CARRIER SERVING 48 STATES.

This is another $45.000 that could have appeared on the bottom line of our 1987 Annual Statement in the Society surplus column. Instead, it was spent to defend the First Catholic Slovak Union against a fruitless and unethical attempt to discredit our Society in the fraternal insurance system, and with the Ohio Department of Insurance, This harassment by the Rev. Stephen Furdek District is not expected to cease until this Board of Directors takes Ihe necessary steps to prevent these attacks upon our Society. Legal and administrative costs can be expected to continue during 1988. The Rev. Stephen Furdek District again complained to the Insurance Department of the State of Ohio that our Society was again violating the Bylaws of the First Catholic Slovak Union by appointing a "Mr. William B, Leahy, Esq." as the new legal counsel for the First Catholic Slovak Union For the record, these charges were filed with Ihe Ohio Insurance Department by Attorney John Vintilla, Esq., who is not a member of the First Catholic Slovak Union. In his filing, Attorney Vintilla indicated to the Insurance Department, mistakenly, that Ihe Supreme President has instituted this appointment, and that the Board of Directors of the First Catholic Slovak Union endorsed this action by the Supreme President. As the Board of Directors well knows, there has been no appointment to the office of Legal Counsel; in fact, following provisions of our Bylaws, the Supreme President has advertised in our JEDNOTA newspaper a vacancy in this supreme office. However, again additional legal costs were created for our Society in refuting these new allegations before the Insurance Department, and again 1988 will continue to see needless legal and administrative expenses because of the harassment by the officers of the Rev. Stephen Furdek District. Another extreme action, generated by a report of our internal auditors filed with the Board of Directors at its Semiannual Meeting in August. 1987. precipitated the dismissal ol the Executive Secretary. Mr Joseph R Vehec. from the duties of his elected office by action of the Supreme President on September 24, 1987. and as mandated by our Bylaws This action was upheld by a vote taken in the Executive Commit- * ( tee; a subsequent vote taken at a Special Meeting of the Board 1 of Directors, and upheld at an Appeal Hearing by the Supreme Court of the First Catholic Slovak Union held on January 9. 1988. in Cleveland. Ohio. It should be noted that Attorney John Vintilla, Esq., was the attorney of record representing the dismissed Executive Secretary, Mr. Joseph R Vehec. Brother Cyril M. Ferenchak, Treasurer of the First Catholic Slovak Union, was appointed by the Supreme President and confirmed by vote of the Executive Committee to assume the office ot Executive SecretaryfTTeasurer until replaced or reelected at the 43rd National Convention of the First Catholic $ Slovak Union which will be held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in August 1988, just five months from now I am pleased lo report that there has been no work interruption as the result of the dismissal of our former Executive Secretary, and the normal business procedures at our Home Office continue smoothly and efficiently. Two other matters remained to be explained, the resignation of Brother Frank Feltovic ol Perth Amboy. New Jersey, our former Auditor, and the resignation ot our former legal counsel. Attorney Virginia L. Sirotnak. On August 31. 1987. immediately following our Semiannual Board of Directors Meeting in Cleveland. Ohio, our late legal counsel resigned her office as counsel to our Society. Many rumors were circulated throughout our Society that there were serious internal problems within our organization, yet nothing could have been further from the truth. In conversations with our late legal counsel. I J was assured that her resignation had little to do with any internal problems within our Society. Her major difficulty had to do with the amount of time that she was able to devote to our Society business as compared to her private law practice, and a potential upcoming judicial appointment. She stated that her major reason for resignation was because of the extreme amount of work she foresaw with the complaints filed with the Insurance Department ol the State of Ohio, and complaints filed with the Supreme Court of the First Catholic Slovak Union by the Rev. Stephen Furdek District of Cleveland, Ohio. This was л her primary reason for resignation — an increased workload ' — which she felt was strictly political in nature, and of no real benelil to our Society. Sadly, in October. 1987, our former legal counsel was called to her eternal reward, and both I. as President, and Brother Ferenchak, as Executive Secretary/Treasurer, were present to pay final respects in behalf of our Society. In the instance of Ihe resignation of Brother Frank Feltovic, in personal conversations with Brother Feltovic, I was advised that his resignation was lor personal reasons, and he indicated no dissatisfaction or problem within his area of auditing responsibility I believe that Brother Feltovic also addressed these sentiments to other members of the Board of Directors. As I suggested earlier, during the course of our Annual . । Meeting, financial reports will be presented by our outside, in- * dependent Certified Public Accountants. Coopers & Lybrand; by our Society Actuary, Bruce & Bruce Company, our Executive Secretary/Treasurer, Brother Cyril M. Ferenchak; and our internal Auditors, of which Brother Steven G.

Alt questions relative lo our annual statement for 1987 can be presented during these presentations. At each meeting of the Board of Directors in the past, I have presented reports which encompass all areas of our Society's business operations outside of financial reports. At this juncture. I would like now to touch upon each department in our Society, so that this Board of Directors may have a fuller understanding of the scope of our internal operations. EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE - The Executive Committee of our Society meets monthly and is composed of five . members, one of whom is a Canadian representative, and * which jointly conducts all business of our Society between Board of Directors meeetmgs. The Executive Committee has continued its excellent performance in the area of disposing low-yielding bonds at limes when bond prices are high, and buying higher-yielding corporate and government issues when bond prices have peaked during a decline. We continue to use the consultation services of the CS McKee financial investment firm, which continually monitors our bond portfolio prior to making buy or sell recommendations. One issue that must be addressed at our Convention in August 1988’ is the belief that major financial decisions can ř only be made at National Conventions of Ihe First Catholic * Slovak Union. Nothing can be further from the truth. The Bylaws of the First Catholic Slovak Union mandate the Executive Committee and Board of Directors to conduct the business of the Society between conventions, and the authority of these two administrative bodies is defined by the Bylaws. The National Convention of the First Catholic Slovak Union is the supreme legislative and judicial tribunal of the First Catholic Slovak Union, but the administrative functions and fiscal responsibilities have always been in the domain of the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee of our Society. If major financial decisions could be made only at conventions of the Society, normal business could be transacted only lour days every three years. MEMBERSHIP AND MARKETING DEPARTMENT - One of the most important departments in our Society is our Membership and Marketing Department, which is the responsibility of our Vice-President Thomas J. Guidish, F.I.C., and our Marketing Director, John J. Yencik. Congratulations must again be extended to the Membership and Marketing Department. since, in 1987, our Society sold $32.197,454 in insurance sales, and $1.225,351 in annuity products. In offering congratulations to these two key marketing personnel, congratulations must also be extended to the recommenders of our Society who exerted their best efforts to accomplish this objective. We had. during 1987. a new million dollar producer, Brother Thomas Hricik of Greensburg. Pennsylvania, who personally sold S1,403.400 of Society products. It is an honor to welcome . Brother Hricik into the million dollar producers circle ol honor. * and we pray that he will not only continue his efforts in 1988 but exceed his accomplishments during the 43rd National Convention Campaign A vote of thanks is also extended to all of our recommenders who made a $32.000.000 sales year in 1987 possible. NEW HOME OFFICE QUARTERS IN INDEPENDENCE, OHIO — On October 15. 1987, our Society signed the legal documents which gave our Society title to a new. three story office building located in Independence. Ohio This building is located in a sprawling business and industrial complex located on Rockside Road, just off the exit ramp from Ohio Interstate 77. The address of our new Home Office quarters is 6611 Rockside Road, and our Society will occupy the third floor which contains approximately 7.200 square feet of usable space. Occupancy of these quarters for our Home Office pur- 4 poses is now scheduled for early April. 1988. and an official ' dedication of our new facilities will be held shortly thereafter We have been fortunate in obtaining Crown Life Insurance Company of Toronto, Ontario, as a tenant, as well as CBS Records, a division of the Sony Corporation, as tenants for our first floor office space. This newly purchased property has already appreciated considerably since its purchase, which is again evidence of the proper decision making processes of this Board of Directors of the First Catholic Slovak Union I have stated to our membership on many occasions that this Board of Directors has been the most productive in the history of our Society, and the financial statements of our Society over the next few years will continue to attest to the accuracy of this statement. JEDNOTA, INC. HOLDING COMPANY — The concept of a Holding Company lor the First Catholic Slovak Union s nonrelated business activities has proven to have been a good decision by Ihe Board of Directors of the First Catholic Slovak Union for many reasons, the most important of which has to do with protection of our tax-free status as a nonprofit fraternal organization. The most importa'nt development to come from the Holding Company to date has been the issuance ol the first dividend from Jednota. Inc. Holding Company, lo Ihe First Catholic Slovak Union. The Board of Directors of Jednota. Inc has for 1987, declared a dividend of $115 per share of com- mon stock owned by the First Catholic Slovak Union, for a return to the Society of 8.65% on its common stock investment in Jednota. Inc. This is the first time in Ihe history of the First Catholic Slovak Union that it has been the recipient of a dividend from one of its own wholly-owned corporations, a process which is expected to be continued and dramatically increased in the months and years to come. The Fraternal Monitor magazine ol February. 1988. carries an article entitled. "How to Improve Your Leadership Skills " I mention this article since in the section entitled "Dealing ť with Decisions, it states that "Another aspect of effective leadership measures decision-making abilities. Whenever you make a decision, you take a risk Risk taking surely builds up considerable stress. As a result, we find people who subconsciously believe it's better not to try rather than tail Yet avoiding the stress of decision-making may be a disservice lo the company, its employees, or its customers." Over the past two years, in the implementation of the holding company concept, we. as a Board of Directors, have taken many risks, taking steps which have built up quite a bit of stress upon this Board, but now we can see that it has been .the correct decision, and the Board of Directors is lo be congratulated for making these forward-looking decisions, and its ability to lead our Society into the twenty-first century The Jednota Holding Company is incorporated in the State of Ohio and has been doing business as a corporation since the first of January, 1987. JEDNOTA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION The Jednota Communications Corporation is composed of two separate sections, the Jednota Press and the Jednota Communications departments Ever since the printery operation moved into its present location in 1975, at each Board of Directors Meeting at least half of the Board’s time was attributed to the problems" of Ihe printery operation and ihe financial losses attributed to this operation. The printery operation was under particularly harsh and abusive attack from 1976 through 1979, as can be evidenced by reading the Board of Directors Minutes during this time period, and attacked somewhat less critically from 1979 through 1982. With subtle internal changes which began in our printery operations in 1983. coupled with the IRS challenge of our non-related business activities, subsequently ground was laid for the institution of the corporation concept as we presently find in our printery operation It is pleasing to report to this Board of Directors and our membership, that during the last quarter of 1987 and early 1988. our printery building has undergone major internal changes. New presses have been purchased for increased pro duction, modem security and fire prevention systems have been installed, and a major renovation of office quarters has been accomplished. During 1987, the printery operation enjoyed a positive cash flow operating as a corporation, and showed a profit which permitted a dividend to be paid to the Jednota, Inc. Holding Company. During the second quarter of 1988, we will totally move into our Orphanage Building, the working quarters of our Editor and his staff, Ihe working quarters of the Curator of the Slovak Museum and Archives, the Society book inventory, and somewhat later, the entire Slovak Museum and Archives itself. This move is part of an overall plan to reduce Society internal costs incurred by space rental in the printery building by the Society for these fraternal Society functions. The Jednota Communications Corporation was incorporated in the State of Ohio as of January. 1987. The President of the Jednota Communications Corporation is Thomas J. Guidish. JEDNOTA PROPERTY CORPORATION - Our Jed nota Property Development Corporation has been very active since the beginning of 1987. but activity was restricted due to the hold put on our property negotiations by the Insurance Department of the Slate of Ohio because of the complaints filed by the Rev. Stephen Furdek District of Cleveland. Ohio. As everyone in our Society is aware, our property holdings in Middletown. Pennsylvania, are approximately 315 acres. We have had 44 acres zoned and sub-divided for development purposes, and have permits granted for putting a ramp from the Olmsted Connector onto our Jednota acreage. We have had offers to purchase all of our 44 acres by a single interested concern, and we have had offers for the purchase of individual sub-divided lots. We have also had offers for a joint venturing of our 44 acre sub-divided site, and are presently evaluating each of the various propositions offered our Society by interested parties. Brother Regis Brekosky is the President of the Jednota Property Development Corporation, which was incorporated in January, 1987. Land development is another area in which increasing income to our Society is being forecast through increased dividends generated by joint venture operations, or outright sales of certain parcels of our property. JEDNOTA GENERAL CORPORATION - The Jednota General Corporation has to date no functions assigned to it, since its primary role is dependent upon the completion of our Orphanage Building remodelization. and spinoffs from our printery operations. It is not anticipated that any profits will be generated by the Jednota General Corporation during 1988 Brother Cyril M Ferenchak is the President of Jednota General Corporation, which was incorporated in January. 1987 CONCLUSION — It is a fact that 1987 was a very good year for the financial operations of our Society. It is also a fact that 1988 and each year hereafter should, because of the groundwork laid by this Board of Directors, be even better financial successes. This has happened because you, as Ihe Board ST. MARY'S SERVICES MATERNITY COUNSELING Professional Education Newborn Adoption 5725 N.

Today, as we approach the 100th Anniversary of the founding of our Society, we can feel secure that we have taken the steps necessary to make and keep our Society a viable organization for the next century In retrospect, you, as the Board of Directors, can now compare our operations with any other Slovak fraternal organization. We are the only Society today with a commercial printing operation which is an independent corporation We are the only Slovak society with a land development corporation We are the only Slovak fraternal with a Slovak museum and archives of national significance, and we are the only Slovak fraternal that now has the ability to effect Slovak opinion worldwide through the publication of our national newspaper, the JEDNOTA, and through publication of books, newspapers, and other periodicals. What does this mean to the Slovak Community al large9 Il means that the upcoming young person ol Slovak background can no longer use the excuse that there is nothing in Ihe Slovak world with which he or she can identify personally. Today there exists a Slovak language and literature progam on the university level with which all Slovak students can iden tify. There exists a Slovak museum and archives which is designed to protect the Slovak heritage and culture in the United States and Canada, and with which our Slovak youth can now personally identify. There are Slovak corporations owned by a Slovak organization with which any young Slovak can identify. if he is a member of the First Catholic Slovak Union. These are significant contributions to the Slovaks as a people. and credit must go to you. the Board of Directors of the First Catholic Slovak Union, for having the courage, and for having the determination of making the First Catholic Slovak Union the leading Slovak fraternal in the United States and Canada. Let us be thankful that our Society has to date been the beneficiary of the many blessings which have been bestowed upon the Slovak community worldwide over the past several years. Without question, the dream of Father Furdek is slowly coming to pass, as we begin our venture in the world of American business and education. Notre Dame Recruits Minorities NOTRE DAME.

WEDNESDAY. MARCH 23. 1988 JEJ AMERICKÁ SVOKRA Napísala MÁRIA K. SINÁKOVÁ (Pokračovanie) Katka vpadla jej do reči a dôvernou otázkou: "Prešli uż dva roky a ja sa začínam obávať. Prosím vás. poraďte mi, či by вот mala navštíviť nášho lekára ? Pred manželom nechcem o tom.hovoriť, aby som jeho obavu daromné nezväčšovala. Myslite, že sa kynožim, keď sa tak sama od seba zatváram, robiac si úsudky? Tie dva roky urobili zo mňa akúsi nerozhodnú osobu. Namrzená sama na seba v duši som si dávno zapísala, že keď nie za tie dva roky, tak nikdy sa nedožijem byť matkou." A hltavým pohľadqm pozorujúc juniora zabanovala: “Oi by sme aj my nemohli anjelika ’ Odpusťte, slečna, že sa rozčuľujem, ale Ženié ma to až do zbláznenia. Modlím sa, aby som i ja mohla pritisnúť na prsia svoje dieťa. Obávam sa, môj manžel si bude namýšľať, že sa toho nikdy nedožijeme. Prečo práve my ?” zaho- rokovala, vystierajúc ruky ku dieťaťu a odmlčala sa. Ošetrovateľka vložila dieťa do jej lona a povedala jej, aby ho normálne držala. Katka poslúchla. Potom položila ruku na Katkino plece a riekla: "A teraz vám poviem, pani Vantalová, že vaše obavy sú nepotrebné. Dva roky! Akože si môžete namýšľať také nepodstatné veci? Urobím s vami stávku, že o rok mi poviete: ošetrovateľka mala pravdu.’ Hore hlavu! Nestraťte dobrú vôľu a nerobte zo seba rozčúlenú ženu. Poviem vám, čo sa stalo nedávno. Zavolali ma do istého domu. Taká istá nehoda ako tu pri vás. Po 27 rokoch manželstva narodilo sa prvé dieťa. Tá dáma nestratila nádej 27 rokov, prečo práve by len po dvoch rokoch mali by ste byť beznádejná? Vy nebudete čakať 27 rokov!" Keď ošetrovateľka zbadala milé prekvapenie na Katke, ako jej slová blahodarne účinkujú na ňu. pohladila jej ruku. Katka sa prebrala zo vzrušenia a vyrozprávala ošetrovateľke, ako aj ona sa opozdene narodila po bratoch, ako došla do Ameriky. Ošetrovateľka ju posmelila a zdôraznila: "Dúfam, že odteraz sa prestanete obávať o potomka." Obe sa chutne rozosmiali. Katka sa vrele poďakovala ošetrovateľke, ktorá ju vytrhla z bludného snenia, z nezmyselnej obavy. Už viac jej srdce nebude rozorávané. Musi si uvedomiť, že je navštívená šťastenou. Dostala sa do takého milého a sladkého ovzdušia, ktoré jej pripomínalo nebo. A vystúpil aj otáznik, dokedy bude jej život v takej slasti ovplývať. Chmúra jej viac nesmie škodiť. Sústredí myšlienky. Zachráni sa, kým je ešte dosť času pred priepasťou, do ktorej sa nechala pomaly strhávať. Po prvý raz zatúžila po telesnom pokoji. Chlácholila sa, že sa jej bude dobre žiť. Nesmie viac dovoliť myšlienkam zaletieť tým smerom, ktorý ju dosiaľ obkľučoval. S novou rozhodnosťou, dobrou, rozhodnou, budujúcou vôľou napred! Ošetrovateľka nechala Katku tíekať kočiarik. Príjemný vetrík ich ovieval. Teraz nerozprávali toľko ako predtým. Katka videla v ošetrovateľke opatrnú, starostlivú a veľmi rozumnú opatrov- ničku dietok, hoci bola ešte slobodná. Došli k námestiu. Dobre jej padlo, že sa mala s kým zhovárať. Nevyšli na boulevard, len sa prechádzali okolo parku. Slniečko bolo vysoko. Včerajšia búrka zahnala horúčosť. Dnes pocítila akýsi zvláštny pokoj. K večeri mala všetko schystané, ale teraz si želala, aby ich toľko nesedelo pri stole, či tým myslela len Róberta, keďže na iných domácich bola navyknutá? Opatrnosť pri stole ju akosi odrazu zunovala. Blížili sa k domu. Začula známu trúbu auta. Utiahla sa od vchodu do dvora. Dávid sa už práve krútil s autom do dvora. Jeden jediný pohľad na neho bol hodný viac než akýkoľvek liek. Rozbehla sa k Dávidovi, opustiac vozík, a už sa ani nepamätala, či ho potisla do rúk ošetrovateľky. Len vtedy si všimla, keď sa ocitla po boku Dávida a pozerala sa do jeho očí ako do zrkadla. Ošetrovateľka ju nasledovala s vozíkom a vošla dnu. “Zajtra nepracujeme.” povedal Dávid. “Voľačo nám chybuje zo zásob, a preto pol dňa budeme sviatkovať " “To nie je možné!" vyvalila Katka oči a spamätajúc sa. doložila: “Zajtra je už zase piatok. Tie týždne tak utekajú." Ponáhľala sa do kuchyne, aby prikryla stôl, ’kým sa Dávid vráti preoblečený. Netrúfala, že by Veronka a Róbert prišli na večeru. Keď zacengal telefón, bola istá, že je to Veronka. Ale bola to Milka, ktorá jej oznamovala, že ani ona, ani sestra nebudú dnes doma večerať. Prídu domov o siedmej hodine a zajtra ráno všetci pôjdeme do letného domu. Nech to povie Dávidovi. Katka sa nazdávala, že je to dobrá novina, ale Dávid jej odpovedal, že by bol najradšej, keby letný dom mohol predať ešte túto nedeľu. Katka sa trochu zarazila nad mrzutou odpoveďou. No uznala, že Dávid dnes asi tvrdo pracoval, preto nie je dobrej nálady. A vedela aj to, že od začiatku nevedel sa nijako oduševniť za letný dom Vedela porozumieť dnešnej manželovej nevrlosti. Na druhý deň predpoludním sa všetci uhostili v letnom dome. 2eny sa usilovali prichystať obed. Róbert a Viliam boli pohrúžení v hlbokom rozhovore o politických a robotníckych pomeroch. Usalašili sa pod stromom pri vode, kde ich Dávid zanechal, lebo NAJVÝHODNEJŠIA CESTA A NAJLACNEJŠIE Letecke lístky k použitiu do konca ma,-a. 1988 N e tv York, Vienna, New York $520.00 Chicago, Vienna, Chicago $680 00 Los Angeles.

Dávid bol hneď ochotný ukázať im celé zariadenie. V spoločnosti boh dve ženy, ktorým sa dom odrazu zapáčil. Dávid sa uspokojil s cenou, akú bol určil agentovi už dávnejšie, totiž sedemtisíc päťsto dolárok. Kupec ani ženy nenamietali nič proti sume. “Keď som bol posledne v New Yorku," pokračoval Róbert v hovore, "rozprávalo sa tam ešte v jeseni, že na budúci rok nastanú nám krušné časy. A už je badať, že depresia je nám za pätami. Ľudia sa nijako nemôžu zmieriť s poriadkami v ostatných časoch. Všetko sa kníše. Predpovedá sa, že dôjde k vážnej hospodárskej kríze. A vraj nie je možné, aby burza na Wall ulici mohla prevádzať aj naďalej také špekulácie. Obeh peňazí zastane. Každý, kto ešte má nejaké groše, bude ich pevne držať. Tak sa zdá, ako by sme už teraz žili na požičanom čase, lebo všetko ea začína kolísať. Majetky vyskočili na cgne do takej náramnej výšky, že sa nebude môcť splácať úrokoábr. Kredit je dosť veľký, ale čo z toho, keď niet prostriedkov — peňazí. A také poriadky vraj nás majú zachrániť od depresie.” Vilo s nedôverčivým hlasom odporoval: “Ale ako niečo podobné by sme mohli očakávať, keď práce je všade dosť a robotníkov málo? To sa môže všetko napraviť. Ľudia obyčajne sa vždy tak ľakajú počas prezidentských volieb. A pamätajme, že nežijeme v takých pomeroch ako pred dvadsaťpäť alebo tridsať rokmi. Žijeme v roku 1928! Od minulej svetovej vojny každý sa teraz najlepšie vpracúva do terajšieho rozpoloženia, Len si všimnime: Nikdy predtým robotník nemal také výhody, aké má dnes; robotník má tak svoje pomery zlepšené, o akých ani milionár nesníval, povedzme pred dvadsiatimi rokmi. A preto sa tak strachujeme, lebo máme voľby." Dávid sa vrátil a pozorne načúval rozhovoru. Unavenosť a starosť, aká ho ráno tiesnila, začala ho poznovu tlačiť. Začal sa mrzieť sám na seba. Prejde to, ale potrebuje oddych aspoň za deň. Róberta zaujímali pomery v krajine. Skúmavo pozrel na Dávida a Vila, začal hovoriť: “Veď už aj v dielňach môžeme jasne vidieť, že sa čosi chystá, a rozumie sa, aj v úradovniach. Najviac ma prekvapilo minulý týždeň, keď ma náš advokát upozornil, že istá veľká obchodná spoločnosť s potravinami, ktorá mala v prenájme našu budovu za posledných sedemnásť rokov, nechcela obnoviť zmluvu s nami. A viete prečo? Vraj preto, lebo ide zatvoriť niektoré svoje obchody, čiže namiesto 700 obchodov bude vlastniť len nejakých 500. Depresia sa očakáva ešte tento rok. A keby sa to prevlieklo ešte jeden rok, nasledujúci rok istotne zaľahne na nás depresia, či máte vedomosť o tom, že mnohí vedeli o takej situácii ešte pred rokom ? Keby to neboli vedeli, zaiste by nás spoločnosť bola požiadala už dávnejšie o obnovenie zmluvy, ako to robievala každých päť rokov. Neviem, ako budeme tento rok postupovať. Otec mi ešte nepovedal slova o depresii, ale mi nakázal, aby som v ničom nepodnikal obchod rozširovať, kým sa nevráti z New Yorku, čo bude asi o dva mesiace. V septembri ta odcestuje za obchodom." Vilo sa в úsmevom ozval: “Myslím, že ty si mal minulý rok prevziať celý obchod pod svoju správu. Alebo som ťa dobre nerozumel ? Či je už otec zase v práci? Vyzdravel už?" Róbert významne poznamenal: “Viete, akí sú tí naši veteráni v obchode. Aj keď sa rozhodnú, že oddajú obchod na mladšie plecia, ale kým len vládzu, radi sa pozrú na nás. ako sa usilujeme, aby boli istí, že všetko tak ide, ako keď oni viedli obchod. Otec pôjde do New Yorku sa dôkladne dozvedieť o to, čo sa už od roka pošuškáva. Ba ešte pred dvomi rokmi začalo sa povrávať, že depresii sa nedá vyhnúť.” Dávid sa pozrel na švagra čudným pohľadom, ako by len teraz začal chápať zmysel ním prednesených slov. Kde ea on pohyboval, dosiaľ nepočul hovoriť o depresii. Preto vravel: "Komu sa chce pracovať, vždy nájde zamestnanie, a to bez ohľadu na prezidentské voľby alebo akékoľvek voľby. To vždy tak bolo i bude, že istá časť ľudí nebude pracovať, hoci by si im kladivo vložil do rúk. Koľkých starších i mladších chlapov som sa pokúsil vyučiť pripraviť a zavesiť dvere na aute. Ani každý desiaty sa neulepi na prácu. Majú všelijaké výhovorky. Len nedávno moji dobrí priatelia ušli. Jeden je u marinárov a druhý v armáde. Povedali mi, že preto sa zverbovali, lebo nemohli natrafiť na prácu, ktorá by im bola po vôli. Možno aj od vojska by ušli, keby mohli." Róbert zhovievavo prikývol hlavou: “Môžeš mať čiastočne pravdu, ale čo sa hovorí na Wall ulici, to skúsenému človekovi musí byť závažné a na rozmýšľanie.” “Čo sa mňa týka," hovoril Dávid, “neviem toho veľa a priznávam ea, že dosiaľ som vážne neuvažoval, či môže, alebo či nemôže nás zastihnúť depresia. A to ani preto, že ma nikdy burza nezaujímala. Ale povedz mi. Róbert, ako by burza v New Yorku mohla padnúť, keď sú tam uložené toľké bilióny?” "Nuž to je tá pravá záhada,” usmial sa dobrosrdečne Róbert, že keby tie bilióny boli tam uložené, nehrozila by nám nijaká kríza. Avšak tie peniaze nie sú tam uložené. A keby ľudia prestali kupovať účastiny, všetko by ea tam muselo rozpadnúť. Rozpráva sa, že vláda sa zamieša do burzových špekulácii, aby sa predišlo hospodárskej kríze. Pozri, Dávid, keď kúpiš účastiny, musíš za ne platiť v hotovosti. Keď sa stane, že si šťastlivý a tvoje účastiny stúpajú na bodoch, môžeš ich predať s pekným zárobkom. Lebo našiel sa zase iný človek, ktorý bol unesený stúpajúcou cenou a nazdáva sa. že na účastinách zarobí. Povedzme, neskôr ty investuješ ešte väčšiu sumu peňazí a tiež zarobíš na účastinách. Možno tvoja Investícia dvadsať alebo aj viac percent od tvojho kapitálu. Banka od tvojho vkladu ti nemôže toľko platiť. Všetko išlo krásne, stúpilo na cene. Mali sme blahobyt, lebo peniaze zarábajú peniaze, keď ľudia pracujú. Ale náhle pricą^zasekne. investícia tiež zasekne; obeh peňazí je menší, čiže peniaze tiež zaseknú. A tak sa stane, že keby si chcel za svoje hotové peniaze kúpené účastiny predať, dostal by ai za ne menej, ako si ty za ne platil. Ale keď si kúpil účastiny na takzvanú “marrin", čiže na splátky a ich cena rýchle klesá, musíš doplácať na každý upadnutý bod. A keď sa stane, že také účastiny padnú príliš nízko a ty prestaneš na ne doplácať, stratil si celú sumu, koľko si z& ne zaplatil. Dúfaš však, že nadídu lepšie časy, kolesá priemyslu sa rozkrútia a ty zase budeš môcť zarábať veľké percentá na Investíciách. Kupovanie a predávanie účastín je práve tak hazardné ako gamblovanie, čiže karbaníctvo pri kartách: vyhráš — prehráš. Deväťdesiat percent ľudí vždy takmer prehrá. Kto kupuje účastiny, požičiava peniaze na slepo a lakomí sa na desať ale i viacpercentný úrok. Ináč je tomu, keď máš jwnlaze Vložené v banke Hoci dostávaš len malý úrok od nich, predsa sú bezpečnejšie než Isť s nimi Z cirkevných dejín Považského Podhradia OKRES POV. BYSTRICA Považské Podhradie leží medzi Veľkou Bytčou a Považskou Bystricou, teda na našom malebnom Pováži. Podľa Katolíckeho Slovenska z roku 1933, strana 55, fara v Považskom Podhradí jestvuje od roku 1789. Má filiálky: Orlové a Sebešťa- nová. Farárom tam bol v roku 1933 Anton Blaha. Podľa historického výskumu zo Slovenska v Považskom Podhradí nebolo v minulosti kostola. Veriaci chodili z celej farnosti, aká je teraz, do kaplnky, ktorá bola a ešte aj je v kaštieli v obci Orlové. Tam sa striedali grófi z Maďarska, Rakúska, Poľska a naposledok to odkúpil nejaký Ružička, ktorý je pochovaný v Žiline. Po Ružičkoví kaštiel prevzali Považské strojárne a teraz je tam múzeum. V kaplnke chybuje už veľa cenných vecí. V Podhradí postavili kostolík v roku 1860. Nasledujúci du- ■ chovní pastieri tam pôsobili: 1860 František Valter. Je pochovaný v Podhradí. 1871 Anton Simko. 1880 Jozef Janecz. Bol tam až do roku 1909. Nasledujúcich 6 rokov je neuvedených v záznamoch. 1915 Matej Burlas. Bol tam jeden rok. Narodený v roku 1883. 1916 Steían Bergendy. Ten tam pôsobil do roku 1927. 1927 Gašpar Košťál, narodený v roku 1888. 1928 Anton Blaha, narodený v Dol. Tižine. Bol tam do roku 1935. 1936 Ján Lovišek-Rabček, Bol tam až do roku 1947. Dalších 5 rokov dochádzal] zastupovať duchovní z iných farnosti. 1952 Tibor Strnisko. Tento zomrel v roku 1986 v Austrálii. 1959 Andrej Rosa ako mla- l z dý kaplán. í 1962 Ján Slivka. Je pochovaný v Podhradí. Potom tam boh na čas Otco-. via Sebik a Ivanka. 1964 Otec .Gézé. salezián. Bol vysvätený v Južnej Amerike. 1973 Alexander Fabian, sa- lezián, rodák zo Starého Tekova pri Leviciach. Pôsobil tam 9 rokov. Je tam aj pochovaný. 1982 Andrej Rosa, prelože- » ný z Turzovky, kde pôsobil 22 Y I rokov ako farár. Posledný rok • v Turzovke išiel na dovolenku do Juhoslávie. No za niekoľko dní musel Juhosláviu opustiť pre chorobu. Tak veľmi onemocnel, že si v Turzovke zo železničnej stanice nevládal niesť, ani cestovný kufor. Išiel hneď do nemocnice v Čadci, tvorila: sa mu pri srdci voda. Potom si žiadal preloženie na menšiu farnosť. Dali ho znova do Považ, , Podhradia, kde v mladosti pô- * I sobil v roku 1959. V Podhradí ho už choroba neopustila a po 3. rokoch tam aj zomrel. 1985 Ladislav Porubčín. Bolo to už jeho druhé miesto po: A. Rosoví. Prvýkrát bol na Ro-: sovom mieste v Turzovke. Keď ale v Podhradí po 3. rokoch O- tec Rosa zomrel, dali tam Otca: Porubčina za farára. Tento tam pôsobil 2 roky a ľudia si! ho veľmi obľúbili. Teraz je farárom v Považskom Podhradí Milan Bričkovský. rodák zo Žiliny. Otec Porubčín je nateraz fa- rárom v obci Bolešov. okres Po-- ’ važská Bystrica. Tam sú filiálky: Kamenčany, Pominovcc. Podhorie. Slávnica, Piechov a Sedmerovce. Podľa informácií zo Slovenska od statočnej Slovenky podáva Imrich Stolárik hazardovať. Napríklad môj otec nikdy neveril v hazardovanie, gamblovanie s peniazmi." * Róbert hovoril rozumne, základne. Bola to akoby malá poučná prednáška. Týmto vysvetlením Dávid sa cítil ako občerstvený ; Dosiaľ si nikdy nevzal toľko času, aby sa základne informoval o newyorskej burze, alebo vôbec o kupovaní a predávaní účastín- na burze. On vedel pracovať a sporiť. Podľa otcovej náuky ukladal, ťažko zarobené peniaze do banky. Účastiny, ani divoká hra na kone v dostihoch ho nezaujímali. Obchod, to už áno. Ale keďže tak dobre zarábal, vždy sa dal odhovoriť otcom, aby obchodu dal pokoj. Banuje, že sa nedal na obchodnú dráhu. Bol prchkej povahy. Keď si niečo zaumienil a hneď to nedosiahol, škriepil sa. domáhajúc sa uplatnenia svojho práva. Nerozvažný čin potom zahovoril tým, že keď sa ožení, vtedy bude rozhľadnejší, ucelenejší a bude mať aj zrelú myseľ — vtedy sa pustí do obchodu. Nezabudne na ten veľkoobchod s uhlím, do ktorého mal príležitosť ísť tak jednoducho a ktorý dnes tak prosperuje. Simon mu radieval: “Dávid, máš úspory, nenechaj ich v banke ležať za malé úroky, । vlož ich do obchodu, tu ti prinesú väčäi zárobok než v banke alebo v práci." Slová a ich význam od svojho dobrého priateľa len toť nedávno začal chápať. Všetci traja mladí ľudia boli hlboko pohrúžení v rozhovore, keď ich Veronka vyhľadala a volala na nich: “Že ea vám chce takto debatovať! Musíte byť ešte nehladní, keď ste sa nehlásili k jedeniu.” Vyzvala ich. aby šli dnu, lebo vraj ani ony, ženy nechcú byť v dome samotné. Veselo sa pobrali k domu. Keď Dávid a Vilo vošli do izby. Róbert tichým hlasom povedal Veronke: “Nemyslíš, že dnes by sme mali ostať všetci doma a dobre si odpočinúť? Zajtra by ste sa nemuseli potiť pri horúcom sporáku. Vezmem vás všetkých na znamenitý obed, aký možno dostať len na vidieku." Nadvihol Veronku a krútil ju niekoľko ráz okolo. "Drahá moja, ako ty myslíš, tak zrob, ja budem spokojný." Pobozkal ju a kráčal popri nej dnu. ' "Äno," stačila mu povedať, "ponáhľajme sa! Všetci na nás čakajú." Katka práve vychodila z bočných dvier s veľkou papierovou škatuľou, v ktorej boli naukladané odpadky. Chcela ea náhliť. Róbert ju zočil, e jedným skokom bol pri nej. vzal jej škatuľu z rúk a vravel: “Katka, čo ai to dovoľuješ? Toľko mužov je nás tu a ty sa zaneprázdňuješ vynášaním takých veci! To je naša práca." Katka sa vzpierala, že ona to ochotne urobí, veď to patrí ku , povinnostiam kuchárky, ale Róbert nedbal na jej výhovorky, * a obsah škatule — papiere a smeti — vysypal do drôteného koša. Potom sa ponáhľali k domu. Róbert jej hovorí: “Katka, bolo by to odo mňa nezdvorilé keby som ťa požiadal, aby si mi dovolila prečítať tvoju novelu? Veronka mi o tom už viac ráz spomenula, že od dlhých rokov píšeš novelu. Obdivujem tvoju trpezlivosť, ako aj schopnosť. Ja obdivujem každého spisovateľa,” opravoval sa. “Mám pred nimi zvláštnu úctu." “Ďakujem ti za dôveru," odpovedala Katka, "ale musíš mi odpustiť, že moju novelu ti nemôžem dať čítať, keďže všetky rukopisy som spálila.” “Spálila si rukopisy?” zdesene sa pýtal. “Domnieval som sa, ц že azda tvoja novela bola už preložená do angličtiny. Mieniš poznovu začať písať novelu? Ako som vyrozumel, tú prácu si už niekoľko ráz písala a prepracovala. Musí ťa písanie náramne zaujímať. Akže sa rozhodneš niekedy novelu skončiť, odporúčam ti, daj ju preložiť do angličtiny.” (Pokračovanie) [pageend12]PRAVDA U MÔJHO STOLA MARIÁNSKY ROK Matka Róże j milosti JEDNOTA. WEDNESDAY. MARCH 23. 1988 Page IS KVETNÁ NEDEĽA BY JOZEF C. KRAJSA, KSGG SPRÁVA REDAKTORA 1988 Drahý brat predseda KriStofík: Tento rok 1988 zaznačuje môj 25. rok ako redaktor JEDNOTY, KALENDÁRA JEDNOTY a Jednota Annual FURDEK. Tiež zaznačuje môj 30. rok ako hlavný ú- radník Prvej Katolíckej Slovenskej Jednoty, slúžiac ako hlavný dozorca, podpredseda pre Pennsylvaniu a jeden rok ako pod- predseda-red aktor. Číslo zo 6. januára 1988 začalo 97. ročník a číslo vydania ohromujúce 5131. Týchto 5131 vydaní bolo neprerušených a tým IKSJ nikdy nevynechala publikovanie jej týždenného úradného orgánu. To je skutočne výkon, ktorý je pravdepodobne neprekonateľný. Americký biskup, horlivý čitateľ novín, mi raz písal: “Keby sme nemali slovenskú katolícku tlač, ako JEDNOTA IKSJ, americkí Slováci by ju museli stvoriť." Je to vysoká úcta dobročinnosti a veľkodušnosti členov a organizácie. Slovenská ročenka organizácie KA- LENDAR JEDNOTA je vo svojom 91. roku; anglická ročenka Jednota Annual FURDEK je vo svojom 27. roku. Je to povšimnutia hodná literárna snaha a veľké uznanie organizácii. Pre tieto publikácie počas tak mnohých dekád organizácia zasluhuje pochvalu za kontinuitu tlačeného slova. Naša história ukazuje, že všetky tieto publikácie boli založené na životoch a ideáloch členov a slovenského národa. Ich ú- mysel bol pričiniť sa a dať čitateľom pravý náhľad na život, cirkev, slovenské dedič stvo a náš slovenský fraternalizpnísľ Tieto publikácie sú "láskoi/v činnosti”. Presvedčenie môže byť rozličné a niekedy sa môže mýliť, ale láska sa nikdy nemýli. V mnohých meniacich sa generáciách v histórii amerických Slovákov vždy bola túžba po úctivosti a dobrote a tolerancii a ľudskosti a po spravodlivosti — a sú správne — a my musíme naďalej v nich veriť, aby iní po čase mohli vidieť, ako sme žili a čo sme vykonali. Dnes sa zdá, že niektorí sa dožadujú úplne otvorenej a slobodnej tlače.Kato- licka, slovenská a fraternalistická tlač nesie so sebou vážne zodpovednosti a ešte viac v styku medzi sebou. V tomto ohľade nemôže byť nikdy celkom slobodná, lebo je obmedzená žiadosťami spoločného dobra Zimná olympiáda v Calgary, Kanada J. A. Mikuš Televízia zo skvelého technického a potenciálne výchovného vynálezu stala sa v ostatných rokoch prevažne vuigár- . nym, skoro ohlupujúcim pros- triedkom. Jej programy často podrývajú kresťanskú civilizáciu. Preto televízne prenášanie zimných olympijských hier bolo vítanou zmenou. Milióny ľudí vo svete ich sledovali. Bola to prvotriedna povznášajúca medzinárodná udalosť, tak odlišná od výčinov anarchie a terorizmu, ktoré nás znechucujú / skoro každý deň. Všetky výkony športových disciplín boli obdivuhodné. Nie- - ktoré sa stali svetovým rekordom. Tzv. “aerial ski jumps" s kotrmelcami -vo vzduchu boli vari po prvý raz na programe lyžiarskych pretekov. No najväčší obdiv vzbudil tanec krasokorčuliarov na ľade. To je naozaj šport, ktorý dosiahol v ostatných desaťročiach neslýchanej dokonalosti. Je vždy neobyčajným pôžitkom pozorovať klasických ta- Д nečníkov na parkete, alebo toreadora pri býčích zápasoch. No sledovať krasokorčuliarov, či jednotlivcov alebo páry, v tanci na ľade je najvyšším estetickým pôžitkom. Je neuveriteľné. čoho je ľudské telo v tomto ohľade schopné. Tanec na ľade je najrýdzejšou eleganciou pohybu. Všetky figúry sú založené na rovnováhe pohybo- vej dynamiky. Sú to umelecké pohyby dômyseľne koordinované a vyvážené v čase a priestore podľa určitého rytmu. Boli krasokorčuliari, čo tancovali tango (La cumparsita), partie z opery Carmen, Strau- ssove valčíky, ba i moderné juhoamerické tance. Zo známych melódii poslucháči mohli počuť: (Frére Jacques, dormez-vous?; РІЯІ9ІГ8 ď amour - chagrins ď amour; Paria mi d’ amore - Moriu; Dvořákovu Humoresku, ba i chýrnu hymnickú pieseň Ave Maria, gratia plena. Na rytmus tejto piesne naladil svoje pohyby ku podivu všetkých poslucháčov sovietsky závodník Petrenko. Iste to urobil ako jemný protest proti utláčaniu náboženstva v Sovietskom zväze a pod komunizmom vôbec. Krásavica Elizabeth Witt z Východného Nemecka upútala na seba pozornosť miliónov divákov. Nepochybne, letné či zimné olympiády sú najkrajším mierovým závoděním národov malých či veľkých. Áno, okrem veľkých boli tam zástupci aj mnohých malých národov a štátov. Žiaľ, zdá sa, že Slovákov nebolo ani v hokejovom mužstve Cesko-Slovenska, ktoré prehralo proti Sovietskemu zväzu. Okrem toho komentátori uvádzali česko-slovenský hokejový team ako český. Toto musí u- Slovenská sv. omša v Owosso, Michigan V snahe udržať tradíciu, budeme mať 10. apríla 1988 popoludní o 2. hodine slovenskú sv. omšu v kostole sv. Jozefa v Owosso — 925 E. Oliver Street. Celebrantom bude náš obľúbený slovenský Otec Semir Mi- kuš, duchovný osady sv. Cyrila a Metoda v Detroite. Po в v. omši budeme mať občerstvenie v školskej hale. Prosíme Slovákov zo stredného Michiganu o návštevu. Karol Piaček — pre cirkev, pre slovenský národ a pre našu fraternalistickú spoločnosť. Nech spoločné dobro včerajška, dneška a všetkých zajtrajškov je naďalej naším cieľom, JEDNOTA je fraternalistický žurnál oznamujúci a kronikujúei úspech a návrhy organizácie, jej Členov, slovenského národa a cirkvi v hĺbke rozjímavého čítania. JEDNOTA a katolícka tlač, ako to povedal arcibiskup Fulton J. Sheen, je “ .. vyučovacím prostriedkom... ktorý nás prenesie ponad kategórie novín a neurobí ju rekordom rozpadávajúcej sa základiny, ale trúbou zvolávajúcou do boja.” Explózia vedomosti zdvojnásobňuje pohotovú informáciu a na základe tohto tvrdenia potrebné sú kolektívne zmeny na prispôsobenie sa k meniacim potrebám. Katolícka tlač musí naďalej plniť svoju podstatnú a nevyhnutnú funkciu slúžiť spoločnému dobru. Pápež Pavöl VI komentujúc o katolíckej tlači, povedal: “Co nadovšetko sa môže očakávať dnes od katolíckeho novinára, je, že odmietne rozhorčené kontroverzie, že sa vynasnaží povzbudzovať poro zumenie v tele cirkvi a že bude pomáhať svojim čitateľom nadobudnúť postupne ten zmysel cirkvi’, ktorý bude riadiť ich posudok medzi tak mnohými nesúladnými mienkami.” JEDNOTA má zodpovednosť nezapríčiniť zbytočnú starosť, neznepokojiť ľubovoľne alebo nezbedne a nepestovať zvár- livosť. Náš cieľ je pozitívny a inštruktívny — naša filozofia je nie negatívna a my sa snažíme zdôrazňovať objektivitu a presnosť. Niet otázky, ako vo všetkom inom, sme stále v procese zmeny. Neideme dozadu do minulých dní alebo ciest. Náš terč je u- smernený na väčšiu dospelosť a musíme niesť skúšky prechodu, aby sme mohli vyvinúť úprimnú zodpovednosť a slúžiť pravde. V docielení tohto zmýšľania a našich cieľov láskavo berieme na známosť spoluprácu a pomoc hlavných úradníkov, okresov, spolkov, členov, výborov, prispievateľov a dobrovoľníkov. S bratským pozdravom Jozef C. Krajsa, redaktor tvrdiť všetkých Slovákov v rozhodnutí pracovať za vlastný štát, aby pod vlastnými farbami brali účasť nielen na olympijských hrách, ale aj v európskej kultúre a politike Jediný moment, ktorý mi počas tých hier pripomenul Slovensko, bola melódia, podľa ktorej tancoval jeden sovietsky krasokorčuliar. Bola to melódia tejto slovenskej piesne: Svieti mesiac, svieti. ale nič nehřeje. Miloval som dievča. ale bez nádeje. Nádeje, nádeje, vy ma len kojíte, ale vy ma s milou nikdy nespojíte. Zaujímavé, že Kírov ruský balet pred rokmi tancoval v New Yorku podľa rytmu slovenskej pieane: Išiel Macek do Malaciek š o š o v íc k u mlátiť, zabudol si doma cepy — musel sa on vrátiť. Rusi iste majú pozoruhodný zmysel pre rytmus, keď si zvolili tieto slovenské piesne pre svoje výkony. RlM — Taliansky katolícky časopis IL REGNO uverejnil dokumentovanú štatistiku o stave diecéznych kňazov, ktorých je nateraz 36.575. Z toho počtu 3.033, tj. 8.3% má už vyše 75 rokov. 28 % ešte vykonáva pastoračnú službu, lebo niet mladých kňazov, ktorí by ich mohli nahradiť; iní pracdjú ešte v rôznych diecéznych úradoch. K tomuto počtu starých kňazov sa pridávajú ešte chorí, takže spolu ich je 3.729, Čiže 10%. V Taliansku je 319 kňazských starobincov Rozpamätaj sa, svätá Panna Mária, že nikdy nebolo počuť, že by bol niekto opustený, kto sa utiekal pod tvoju ochranu a teha o pomoc alebo príhovor žiadal. Aj ja — touto dôverou povzbudený — k tebe, Matka, Panna panien, sa ponáhľam, k tehe зд uchyľujem, ja úbohý hriešnik- Matka večného Slova, nezavrhni moje slová, ale ma milostivo vypočuj a vyslyš. Oroduj za nás Matka dobrotivá, aby sme sa stah hodni prisľúbení Kristových, Aj toto oslovenie Panny Márie má pôvod v Písme svätom, veď anjel tak pozdravil Matku Božiu: "Zdravas, milosti plná!" Ak svätý Pavol mohol napísať v liete Korinťanom: "Milosťou Božou som,tým, čim som!" (1 Kor 15-Л0Л tým oprávnenej- áie mohla povedať Panna Mária. "Veľké veci mi urobil Mocný a sväté je jeho Meno” (Lk 3. 49). Niet azda slov, ktoré by sa väčšmi zneužívali, ako slová "láska" a "milosť”. Láskou sa často zakrýva najzmyselnejsia vášeň. Pod slovom milosť niektorí často rozumejú slabosť a chudobu ducha. Aj napriek tomu slovo milosť ostáva pojmom v duševnej spáse najdôležitejším. Milosť znamená nadprirodzený život, ku ktorému je potrebná ako milosť posväcujúca, tak aj pomáhajúca. Keď anjel nazval Pannu Máriu milostiplnou, nebolo to oslovenie nadsadené, ale číra pravda- ty si od Boha naplnená vo vrcholnej miere milosťou, preto máš najvyšší stupeň nadprirodzeného života; dostala si pomocnú milosť pre tvoj život v Bohu a pre tvoje zameranie na dosiahnutie blaženej večnosti. Omilostenie Márie zodpovedá — lebo všetko u Boha má svoje úlohy: byť totiž Matkou Božou a mať účasf na vykúpení ľudstva ako druhá Eva. Je preto samozrejmé, že Pannu Máriu nemôžeme nevidieť v jej ú- lohe na našej spáse, že ona patri k nám ako naša Matka a my k nej ako jej dietky. Vieme, že sú aj dietky, ktoré sa hanbia za svoju matku, lebo je chudobná, nenápadná, skromná, že má pripadne aj chyby. Aj Mária bola chudobná, ale bohatá nadprirodzeným bohatstvom a nadzemskou krásou. Od prvého okamihu jej pozemského jestvovania vyzdobil ju nebeský- Otec posväcujúcou milosťou Božej Rodičky’. Oprávnene mohol pri jej omilostení zvolať Duch Svätý ako ženích v Piesni piesní: "Však si len krásna, moja priateľka, však si len s p a n i 1 a" (Veľ 1, 15). A my tak zo srdca spievame: Celá krásna, si Mária. Táto pieseň zaznieva v našich domoch Božích pri mnohých príležitostiach, najmä pri májových pobožnostiach, ružencových v októbri a na všetky mariánske sviatky, keď veriaca radi prichádzajií do kostola uctiť si Matku matiek i Matku cirkvi. (KN) O. Matúš Bonk, O.S.B. Drahí bratia a sestry v Kristu! Kvetnou nedeľou aa začína veľký týždeň, a to preto, lebo sa nám v ňom sprítomňujú veľké udalosti našej spásy. Matka Cirkev ako múdra Matka a Učiteľka chce, aby sme aj my, jej dietky, nielen si jednoducho pripomenuli umučenie a smrť Pána Ježiša za nás, ale aby sme tieto udalosti aj prežívali. Máme pašie, čítanie umučenia Pána Ježiša. Cirkvi nejde iba o to, že Pán Ježiš zomrel. Ale ide o to, aby sme ako jedna, spoločná, vykúpená rodina prežívali Ježišovo utrpenie, smrť a vzkriesenie. Dnes čítame celú rozpravu o umučeni Pána, a to často aj zvláštnym spôsobom, spievaním pašií. Pašie nám pripomínajú ohromnú lásku Božiu, lebo ako sv. Ján nám píše: — Boh poslal na svet svojho jednoro- deného Syna, aby sme Jeho prostredníctvom mali život. (IJn 4:9) Táto láska sa nezakladá na tom, že by sme my najprv boli milovali Boha, ale že On si nás zamiloval a poslal svojho Syna ako obetu zmierenia га naše hriechy. — Vo Veľkom týždni Cirkev sv. chce, aby sme preživali Božiu lásku práve tak, ako to robieval svätý Pavol, keď písal Galaťanom: — S Kristom som ukrižovaný a nežijem už ja, ale Kristus žije vo mne. A kým ešte žijem v tele, žijem vierou v Božieho Syna, ktorý si ma zamiloval a seba samého vydal v obeť za mňa. — (Gal: 2:20) V tomto krátkom čase pravdaže nemôžeme vysvetľovať celé pašie, teda len tak na krátko spomíname iba udalosti Jeho života pamätihodné, a to, Ježišovu opustenosť, mlčanlivosť a Jeho svätý kríž. Veď Jeho celý život bol poznačený hlbokou opustenosťou. Prežíval ju, keď ešte navštívil Svoje mesto Nazaret. Ešte Jeho vlastni krajania, ba ani príbuzní nechceli mať vôbec nič s Nim do činenia. Muselo Ho veľmi zabolieť, keď ľudia chceli od Neho vidieť iba divy a zázraky. Najväčšiu opustenosť pocítil v záhrade Getsemanskej, kde Jeho apoštolovia tak tvrdo zaspali a chrápali, ako keby dakto drevo pílil a od kríža na Kalvárii poutekali ako zajace. Cítil sa aj opusteným od Svojho Otca, preto hlasným, zúfalým hlasom zavolal: “BOŽE môj, Bože môj. prečo si ma opustil?" Co sa týka Jeho mlčanlivosti, hoci Ho ohovárali, vysmievali sa z Neho, pľuli do Jeho svätej tvári, rúhali sa Mu a zbili do krvi, táto Nevinnosť nevypustila ani slovíčka zo svojich úst. Koniec koncom, táto mlčanlivosť obrátila stotníka, ktorý keď spozoroval, že Nevinnosť všetky protivenstvá trpezlivo znáša, zvolal: “Naozaj tento človek je Syn Boží!" Každý z nás na tomto svete má svoj osobitný, ťažký kríž, ale tento kríž nie je ten istý a samý pre každého z nás. Kristus Pán nám povedá: “Kto chce za mnou ísť. nech zapre sám seba, vezme svoj každodenný křiž a nasleduje ma." (Mk: 8:35) Kríž v očiach moderného sveta je neúspech, potupa, hanba, čosi, čomu treba sa vyhýbať a od neho len utekať. Kríž nám býva veľmi nepríjemná vec, zlo, protiví sa našej ľudskej prirodzenosti. Ale predsa kríž spolu s Ježišom sa môže premeniť na dobro, z veľkého utrpenia na našu spásu. Kríž bez Krista je veru neznesiteľný, ale s Kristom je to celkom iná vec. Bez Krista sme nič a s Ním všetko. Kríž ako keby nám chcel povedať, že kto mlči, ten svedči, že, bez utrpenia niet koruny; bez nemoci a staroby neuvádíme prázdny hrob v deň súdny; bez nášho ubičovaného tela nebude vzkrieseného tela; ak neprijmeme korunu tŕňovú na našu hlavu, oči naše nikdy nezazrú svetla večného života. Niet vzkriesenia bez smrti; niet úspechu bez obety. Však bez smútku Veľkého piatku nedožijeme sa radosti Veľkej noci. Veď ako nás svätý Matúš napomina: "Lebo, kto chce zachrániť svoj život stratí ho; ale, kto stratí svoj život pre mňa, nájde ho." (Mt: 16:25) Moji Boží ľudia v Kristu zhromaždení! Cieľom pašií i celého Veľkého týždňa je. aby sme ich osobne takto prežívali a aj so stotnikom zvolali; "Naozaj toto je Syn Boží, ktorý trpel a zomrel za nás, aby sme žili." Ö Bože, prameň nekonečného milosrdenstva a nesmiernej dobroty. Ty nás učíš, že pôst modlitba, skutky kresťanskej lásky, sú liekom proti hriechu. Láskavo prijmi vyznanie našej slabosti a ked klesáme pod ťarchou povinnosti a vidíme Teba na kríži pribitého, prosíme Ta. pozdvihni nás svojou milosrdnou rukou. Amen!

MARCH 23, 1988 Kvetná nedeľa PROCESIA alebo SLÁVNOSTNÝ VSTUP EVANJELIUM Požehnaný, ktorý prichádza v mene Pánovom Čítanie zo svätého evanjelia podľa Marka. — Keď sa približovali k Jeruzalemu, ku Betfage a Betanii smerom na Olivovú horu, vyslal Ježiš dvoch učeníkov a povedal im: "Choďte do dedinky, ktorá leží naproti. A hneď keď do nej vstúpite, nájdete priviazané osliatko, na ktorom doteraz ešte nikto nesedel. Odviažte ho a priveďte! Ak by vám však niekto vravel: ‘čo to robíte?’ — povedzte- “Pán ho potrebuje' — a hneď vám ho zasa sem prepustí." A keď odišli, našli osliatko, priviazané o dvere vonku na ceste. I odvinzali ho. No niektorí z tých, čo tam stáli, vraveli im: "Cože to robíte, že odvažujete osliatko?" Oni im odpovedali, akc im prikázal Ježiš. I nechali ich. Priviedli teda k Ježišovi osliatko, položili naň svoje plášte, a on si sadol naň. Mnohí prestierali svoje rúcha na cestu a iní zasa zelené ratolesti, nasekané na poliach. A ti ,čo išli pred ním. i tí, čo išli za ním volali: "Hosana! Požehnaný, ktorý prichádza v mene Pánovom' Požehnane Kráľovstve nášho otca Dávida. ktoré sa približuje! Hosana na výsostiach!" Počuli sme slovo Pánovo. PRVÉ ČÍTANIE Tvár som si neschoval pred potupou ale viem, že nebudem zahanbený Čítanie z Knihy Izj’.áša proroka. — Pán mi dal jazyk uče- rtícky. aby som slovom vedel posilniť mdlého; povzbudil ráno, ráno mi povzbudil ucho, aby som počúval ako učiteľa. Pán mi otvoril ucho Ja som neodporoval, nazad som neustúpil Chrbát svoj na stavil som tým. čo bili, a lica svoje tým. čo trhali. Tvár som si neschoval pred potupou a slinou. Pán pomáha ml. preto nebudem pohanený. Preto som sl sťa kremeň zatvrdil tvár a viem, že sa nezahanbím. Počuli sme slovo Pánovo. MEDZISPEV Vysmievajú ma všetci, čo ma vidia, vyškierajú sa, pokyvujú hlavou- "Na Boha sa spoliehal, nech ho vyslobodí, nech ho vytrhne, ak ho miluje’" Bože môj, Bože můj. prečo si ma opustili Veď okolo mňa stoji mnoho psov, obkľučuje ma svorka zločincov. Puky mi prebili a nohy moje tiež, spočítať môžem všetky kostí svoje. Bože môj. Bože můj, prečo si ma opustil! Rozdeľuj si rúcho moje a o môj oder hádžu kocky. Ale ty. Pane, neodstupuj odo mňa. podpora moja, na pomoc sa mi ponáhľaj. Bože môj. Bete můj. prečo si ma opustil' O mene tvojom vyrozprávam bratom svojim, budem chváliť teba vprostřed zhromaždenia: "Vy, ktorí bojíte sa Pána, chváľte ho semeno Jakubovo všetko .oslavujte ho a bojte sa ho. všetko semä Izraelovo' Bože můj. Bole môj. prečo si ma opustil! DRUHÉ ČÍTANIE Uponižil sa a preto ho Boh povýšil Čítanie z Listu sv. Pavla apoštola Filipanom - Ježiš Kristus, hoci bol Božej prirodzenosti, nemyslel si, že sa musí pridržiavať svojej rovnosti s Bohom, ale ako človek sa jej pozbavil, prijal na seba prirodzenosť sluhu. stal sa podobným ostatným ľuďom, a aj navonok pokladaný iba za človeka Uponižil sa s bol poslušný až na smrť, a to na smrť kríža. Preto ho Boh povýšil a dal mu meno nad všetky iné mená, aby na meno Ježiša skláňalo sa každé koleno na nebi, na zemi a v podsvetí, a každý jazyk aby vyznával na slávu Boha Otca, že Ježiš Kristus Je Pan Počuli sme slovo Pánovo. PRÍPRAVA NA EVANJELIUM Kristus bol poslušný až na smrť, a to na smrť kríža. Preto ho Boh povýšil a dal mu meno nad všetky iné mena. EVANJELIUM — PASIE Umučenie nášho Pána Ježiša Krista podľa Marka O dva dni mala byť Veľká noc a slávnosť nekvasených chlebov. Veľkňazi a zákonníci nľadali spôsob, ako by sa mohli Ježiša podvodom zmocniť a zabiť ho. Hovorili totiž: "Nie vo sviatok, aby sa ľud nebúril1“ A keď bol Ježiš v Betanii, v dome Simona Malomocného a bol za stolom, prišla žena s alabastrovou nádobou pravej a veľmi drahej nardovej masti. Rozbila alabastrovú nádobu a vyliala mu Ju na hlavu. Ale niektorí sa medzi sebou nad tým horšili a povedali- “Načo zmámiť takú masť’ Veď táto masť sa mohla predať za viac ako tristo denárov a rozdať chudobným!" I šomrali na ňu. Ale Ježiš povedal: “Nechajte Ju! Co Jej robíte ťažkosti? Dobrv skutok mi prcukazala. Lebo chudobných vždy budete mať medzi sebou, a keď chcete, môžete im dobre robiť, mňa však nebudete mať vždy, čo mohla, urobila; vopred pomazala moje telo na pohreb. Veru, hovorím vám, kdekoľvek na celom svete bude sa hlásať evanjelium, bude sa rozprávať na jej pamiatku aj o tom. čo mi urobiła." A Judáš Iškariotský, jeden z dvanástich, odišiel k veľkňazom, aby im ho zradil. Ke ď to počuli, zaradovali sa a sľúbili mu dať pemaze. Hľadal teda vhodnú príležitosť ,aby ho zradil A v prvý deň nekvasených chlebov, keď zabíjali veľkonočného baránka, povedali učeníci Ježišovi: "Kde ti máme ísť pripraviť, aby sl jedol veľkonočného baránka?" I poslal dvoch svojich učeníkov a povedal im: "Choďte do mesta a tam vás stretne človek, ktorý ponesie džbán vody. Nasledujte ho! A kde vojde, povedzte pánovi domu: 'Toto ti hovorí Učiteľ: Kdeže je pre mňa sieň, kde by som jedol veľkonočného baránka so svojimi učenfknflV A on vám ukáže veľkú miestnosť, prestretú a pripravenú. Tam nám pripravte!” Učeníci teda odišli, prišli do mesta a našli všetko tak, ako im predpovedal. I pripravili veľkonočného baránka. A keď zaujali miesta za stolom a Jedli, povedal Ježiš: "Veru, hovorím vám, jeden s vis, čo je so mnou, ma zradí." A oni sa začali zarmucovať a vypytovať rad-radom: "Nie som to azda Ja?" On im však odpovedal. "Jeden z dvanástich, čo omáča so mnou ruku v mise. Syn človeka síce ide. ako je o ňom napísane, ale beda človekovi, ktorý zrádza Syna človeka! Lepšie by tomu človekovi bolo, keby «a nebol narodil." A keď Jedli, vzal Ježiš chlieb, požehnal, lámal a dával im ho a hovoril: "Vezmite, toto je moje Telo.” A vzal kalich, požehnal a podal im ho a pili z neho všetci. I povedal im: "Toto je Krv moja, novej zmluvy. ktorá bude vyliata za mnohých. Veru, hovorím vám. viac už nebudem piť z plodu tohto viniča až do toho dňa, keď ho budem piť nový v Kráľovstve Božom." A keď dospieval: chválospevy. wšli na Olivovú horu. Vtedy im povedal Ježiš: “V túto noc sa všetci pohoršíte, lebo je napísané: Udriem pastiera, a rozprchnu sa ovce.' Ale po svojom vzkriesení predidem vás do Galiley." Peter mu však povedal- "Keby sa aj všetci pohoršili, ia sa nepohorším!" Ale Ježiš mu povedal: "Veru, hoverim ti. že dnes, tejto nocí, skôr ako sa kohút dva razy ozve, tri razy ma zaprieš." On však tým horllvej- šie uisťoval: "I keoy mi bolo treba spolu s tebou zomrieť, ne- zaprem ťa." Ale tak isto hovorili aj ostatní. A prišli na pozemok, ktorý sa volá Getsemani. Tu povedal Ježíš svojim učeníkom "Sadnite si tu, kým sa pomodlím." A vzal si Petra. Jakuba a Jána a zmocňovala sa ho hrôza a úzkosť. I povedal im: "Smutná ie moja duša až na smrť Ostaňte tu a bedlite!" A poodlšiel trocha od nich, padol na zem a modlil sa. aby ho — ak Je možno — minula táto hodina. I povedal: "Abba — Otče! Ty môžeš všetko: vezmi tento kalich odo mňa, avšak nie čo ja chcem, ale čo ty'" A keď sa k rrim Ježiš vrátil, našiel ich spať. I povedal Pet rovi: "Simon, spíš? Ani jednu hodinu si nemohol so mnou bedliť? Bedlite a modlite sa. aby ste neprišli do pokušenia. Duch Je síce ochotný, ale tel? nevládne. A znova sa vzdialil a modlil sa tú Istil modlitbu. A keď sa zas vrátil, našiel ich spať; ich oči holi totiž obťažené a ani nevedeli, čo mu odpovedať A keď prišiel k nim Ježiš po tretí raz, povedal im: "Spite ďalej a odpočívajte! — Dcsť už! Prišla hodina; hľa. Syn človeka bude vydaný do nik hriešnikov' Vstaňte! Poďme1 Hľa, ten, čo ma zradil, sa priblížil.” Vtom hneď, kým ešte Ježiš hovoril, prišiel Judáš Iškariotský, jeden z dvanástich ч s ním zástup s mečmi o kyjmi, vyslaný od veľkňazov a starších. Zradca im dal znamenie: "Koho pobozkám, to je on. Chyťte ho a veďte obozretne!" Ä\|ceď došiel, hneď pristúpil k nemu a vravel: •'Učiteľu, buď pozdravený!" A pobozkal ho. Oni však položili ruky na neho a zajali. A jeden z tých, čo tam stali, vytasil meč, udrel veľkňazovho sluhu a odťal mu ucho. I ozval sa Ježiš a povedal im: “Ako na zločinca ste vyšli s mečmi a kyjmi, aby ste ma zajali. Denne som bol s vami a učil som vás v chrúme, a nezajali ste ma. Treba však, aby sa splnili Písma " 4 Vtedy ho všetci opustili a zutekali. Ale akýsi mladík, odetý plachtou na holom tele, íšňl za ním; i chytili ho. On však pustil plachtu a utiekol im nahý. A Ježiša odviedli k veľkňazovi. I zhromaždili sa tam všetci veľkňazi, starší z ľudu a zákonníci. Peter ho nasledoval zďaleka až do veľkňazovho nádvoria. Prisadol si k sluhom a ohrieval sa pri ohm Veľkňazi a celá vpľrada zháňala svedectvá proti Ježišovi, aby ho vydali na smrť, ale nič nenašli. Mnohí totiž svedčili pro ti nemu falošne, ale ich svedectvá sa nezhodovali. Tu vystúpili akisi falošní svedkovia proti nemu a vraveli: "Počuli sme ho voriť: "Ja zborím tento rukou vybudovaný chrám, ale za tri drú vystavím iný, už nie rukou vybudovaný." Ale ani takto sa ich svedectvo nezhodovalo. Tu sa najvyšší veľkňaz postavil do stredu a opýtal sa Ježiša: "Nič neodpovedáš? Cože to svedčia títo proti tebe?" Ale nn mlčal a nič neodpovedal. Znova sa ho teda opýtal najvyšší veľkňaz: “Si ty Mesiáš, Syn požehnaného Boha?" I povedal Ježiš: “Ano, som. A uvidíte Syna človeka sedieť na pravici Moci Božej a prichádzať na nebeských oblakoch.” Tu si veľkňaz roztrhol rúcho a vravel: “Ci ešte potrebujeme sved- Ą kov? Počuli ste rúhanie. Co sa vám vidí?” A všetci usúdili, že si zaslúži smrť. Tu niektorí začali pľúvať na neho, zakryli mu tvár, bili ho päsťami a vraveli "Prorokuj!” — AJ sluhovia ho zauškovali. A keď bol Peter na nádvorí, prišla k nemu veľkňazova slúžka. Len čo zazrela Petra, яко sa zohneva. a pozrela na neho, vravela: "Aj ty si bol s Ježišom Nazaretským.“ Ale on to poprel: "Ani neviem, ani nerozumiem, čo hovoríš ” Keď potom vyšiel na preddvone, ozval sa kohút. A keď ho slúžka znova zazrela, začala vravieť okolostojacim. "Tento je z nich.“ On to však zasa poprel. Ale o krátky čas okolostojaci znova vraveli: "Naozaj si znich, veď si aj Galílejčan." On sa však začal preklínať a prisahať "Nepoznám toho človeka, o ktorom mi hovoríte.” A $ hneď sa kohút po druhé ozval. I rozpamätal sa Peter na slovo, ktoré mu bol oovedal Ježiš: "Skôr, ako sa kohút dva razy ozve, tri razy ma zapřeš." A zamyliac sa nad tým. zaplakal A hneď včas ráno radili sa veľkňazi so staršími, zákonníkmi a s celou veľradou: zviazaného Ježiša odviedli k Pilátovi a vydali mu ho. Pilát sa ho spýtal: "Si ty kráľ židovský?" On mu odpovedal: 'som, ako hovoríš1" Veľkňazi však mnoho žalovali na neho. Tu sa ho Pilát znova spýtal: "Nič neodpovedáš? Pozri, čo všetko žalujú na teba!" Ale Ježíš ešte nič neodpovedal, takže sa Pilát divú. I- Na tento sviatok prepúšťal im jedného väzňa, ktorého si vyžiadali. No s povstalcami, čo sa pri vzbure dopustili vraždy, bol väznený Istý Barabá*. Tu sa přihrnul zástup hore a začali žiadať si to, čo im robieval. Pilát im odpovedal: "Chcete, aby som vám prepustil kráľa židovského’" Vedel totižto že mu ho veľkňazi vydali zo závisti. Ale veľkňazi pobúrili ľud. aby im $ radšej prepustil Barabáša. Pilát im znova povedal: “Co teda ' urobiť s človekom, ktorého vy voláte kráľom židovským?" Oni však skrikli znova: "UlrriSul ho!" Avšak Pilát im povedal: "Cože zlého urobil?" Ale oni ešte väčšmi kričali: “Ukrižuj ho!" Pilát, keďže chcel urobiť ľudu po vôli, prepustil im Barabáša. Ježiša dal zbičovať a vydal ho. aby ho ukrižovali Vojaci odviedli Ježiša na nádvorie do vládnej budovy a zvolali celý prápor. I obliekli mu šarlátový plášť, z tŕnia upliet lí veniec, položili mu ho na hlavu a začali ho pozdravovat • "Pozdravený buď, kráľ židovský'" A trstinou ho bili po hlave, pľu valí na neho, kľakali sl pred nim na kolená a klaňali sa mu. A keď sa mu naposmievali, vyzliekli ho zo šarlátu, obliekli ho do jeho rúcha a viedli hc ukrižovať. Vtom istý Šimon Cyrén sky, Alexandrov a Rúfov otec, vracal sa z poľa a šiel tade; toho donútili niesť kríž. A tak ho viedli na miesto Golgotu, čo v preklade znamená Lebečné miesto. A ponúkli mu víno, zmiešané s myrhou, ale ho neprijal. I ukrižovali ho. rozdelili si jeho rúcho, a losovali, čo kto má dostať. Bola tretia < deviata > hodina, keď ho ukrižovali Vina jeho hola označená nápisom: kráľ židovský. A ukrižovali s nim aj dvoch zločincov .jedného sprava a druhého zľava Tak sa teda splnilo Písmo, ktoré hovorí: "Medzi zločincov ho pripočítali." I ti, čo išli vedľa, rúhali sa mu potriasaním hlavy a vraveli: "Aha, ty, čo rúcaš chrám koži a vo troch dňoch ho staviaš. zachraň sa. zostúp z kríža:" Podobne sa mu posmievali i veľkňazi spolu so zákonníkmi a vraveli si navzájom: "Iných zachraňoval. seba nemôže zachrániť. Mesiáš, kráľ Izraela nech teraz zostúpi z kríža, aby sme to videli a uverili mu!” Eešte aj tí ho hanobili, ktorí boli spolu s nim ukrižovaní. I prišla šiesta (dvanásta) hodina a nastala tma po celej ze ml až do deviatej (tretej > hodiny. A o deviatej (tretej) hodine Ježiš zvolal veľkým hlasem "Eloi, Eloi. lama sabaktani?" — čo v preklade znamená- "Bože môj. Bože môj, prečo si ma opustil?" Keď to počuli niektorí z okolostojacich, povedali: "Pozri- že. Eliáša volá!" Tu ktosi odbehol, naplnil špongiu octom, nastokol ju na trstinu, dal mu plť u vrave): "Počkajte, uvidíme, či príde Eliáš, aby ho sňal!” Ježiš však zvolal veľkým hlasom a vypustil ducha 4 Všetci kľaknú. Chvíľa ticha A chrámová opena sa roztrhla na dvoje od vrchu až do т spodku. Keď stotnik, ktorý stál naproti nemu, videl, že takto dokonal, povedal: "Tento človek bol naozaj Syn Boží." Boli tam však i ženy, ktoré sa zďaleka na to dívali Medzi nimi bola Mária Magdaléna. Mária, matka Jakuba Menšieho a Jozefa i Salome, ktoré ho nasledovali, keď bol v Galilei a posluhovali mu; a tiež mnohé iné, čo spolu s ním došli do Jeruzalema. A keď sa zvečerilo — bol to totiž pripravený deň. to Jest deň pred sobotou — prišiel Jozef, rodák z Arimatey, vynikajúci člen veľrady. ktorý i sám očakával Kráľovtvo Božie, smelo pred stúpil pred Piláta, a vyžiadal si Jeižovo telo. Pilát sa však zadivil, že Ježiš už zomrel. Keď sa to od stotnika dozvedel, mŕtve telo daroval Jozefovi. Jozef zas nakúpil plátna, sňal ho z kríža, zavinul ho do p’átna a položil do hrobu, vytesaného v skale, a ku vchodu privalil kameň. Mária Magdaléna však a Mária Jozef o w va matka, pozorovali, kde ho položili. Počuli sme slovo Pánovo.

Skrze Krista, nášho Pána. HOSANA... UKRIŽUJ HO... ! "Tento človek bol naozaj Syn Boží" (Mk 15. 39) V roku 1900 zúrilo v Cíne ukrutné prenasledovanie katolíkov. V jednom meste revolucionári obsadili misijnú školu. Zam kli všetky dvere, okrem jednych. Do tých na dlážku položili kríž. Kto do kríža kopol, bol prepustený na slobodu, kto nie. ten bol na mieste zastrelený. Prvých sedem študentov koplo do kríža a boli pustení na slobodu. Nato vybehla istá študent ka. Keď na zemi zbadala kríž, kľakla si a pobozkala ho Bola na mieste zastrelená. Ostatných 150 študentov nasledovalo jej přiklad a nasledovali ju aj do neha. Slovo Božie tejto Kvetnej nedele nás vedie na ulice Jeruzalema, kde sa Kristovi privoláva: "Hosana’', ktoré volanie sa zanedlho zmenilo na: "Ukrižuj Ho!" Stretnime Krista, pobozkajme mu rany vo viere a láske, aby sme boli spasení. 1. Hosana. ;. Ukriíuj Ho! Touto Kvetnou nedeľou sa zahajuje Veľký týždeň, týždeň nášho spasenia. Je to vlastne oslava posledného príchodu Svna Božieho. Ježiša Krista, do Jeruzalema, aby za našu spásu trpel, zomrel a vstal z mŕtvych. Posvätnou liturgiou Kvetnej nedele. Zeleného štvrtka. Veľkého piatku a Veľkonočnej soboty sa tie to udalosti prežívajú a sprítomňujú. V prvom čítaní tejto sv. omše (Iz 50, 4-7) prorok Tzaiáš predvídal Vykupiteľa, ako "trpiaceho služobníka Božieho". Nebeský Otec, ako hovorí prorok, mu dal: "jazyk učenícky”, aby zvestoval posolstvo spásy celému svetu. Spásu však môže zvestovať a vydobiť len ten. ktorý je sám bez hriechu, je nevinný Prorok však predvída, že práve pre jeho nevinu, sa Vykupiteľovi dostane potupy, poníženia a odsúdenia. Prorok dokladá a ho vori: "Chrbát svoj nastolil tým, čo ho bili a líca tým, čo trhali. Tvár si neschoval pred slinou ... ale vedel, že nebude zahanbený, že napokon zvíťazí...! Sv. evanjelium tejto Kvetnej nedele, teda pašie (Mk 14. 1-15, 47) ktoré sa dnes v celej Cirkvi čítajú dosviedčajú, že Vy- a kupiteľ, Ježiš Kristus už dokončil svoje verejné účinkovanie. Ide ho dovŕšiť svojim vykupiteľským dielom, svojim prebor kým utrpením, smrťou a svojím zmŕtvychvstaním. Izrael ako vidieť, jeho poslanie nepochopil. Oni očakávali Vykupiteľa, ktorý' by ich oslobodil z politického poddanstva Rimanov Na duševné otroctvo hriechu, ktoré má večný dosah, si akosi ani nepomysleli. Preto na Kvetnú nedeľu Kristovi tak nadšene privolávali: ’Hosana", ktorý prichádza v mene Pánovom." (Mt 1, 10) Keď ak- Kvetná nedeľa prešla a keď ku žiadnym politickým zmenám nedošlo, uvedomili si. že od Krista, pokorného . tesára z Nazareta, nemôžu nič očakávať. Veď jeho náuká milo- srdenstva a odpúšťania ich nedovedú k tomu, po čom oni tak túžili. Preto na neho -ak zanevreli, že svoje volanie “Hosana’' zmenili na volanie: "Ukrižuj ho" a viedli ho na Veľký piatok, obťaženého s krížom na Golgotu, aby ho ukrižovali. Možno Judáš bol najlepším výrazom toho, ako celý Izrael pri tejto príležitosti zlýhal. Nevinný Kristus Judášovi, ba aj celému Izraelu ponúka duševnú slobodu, spásu z ich otroctva hriechu. Berle na seba bremene kríža, aby im dokázal, že to vážne myslí, ale Judáš a predáci ľudu pri tom vyjednávajú len o hmotnom zisku. Hovorili o odplate časnej, 30 strieborných, ale na večnej im nezáležalo. Izrael sa nezoamntal ani vtedy, keď vidia Ježišovu ne- vinu, ktorý ešte aj svojho zradcu nazýva "priateľom” a ani vtedy. ked pred súdom stojí, ako stelesnená dobrota a láska. Príbeh pašii potom opisuje, čo všetko musel Kristus pretrpieť. kým sa dostal na drevo kríža. Keď si ale pripomenieme predpovede o Vykupiteľovi, vidíme, že toto všetko sa stáva pod ft ľa plánu nebeského Otca, že je to vlastne Kristov prechod z nik hriešnikov, ktorým milostivé odpúšťa, do víťazstva svojej slávy, kde bol jestvoval od večnosti. Na toto všetko nebeský Otec dosviedča, keď за pri Kristovej smrti trasie zem. keď slnko nevydáva svetla, keď mŕtvi vstávajú z hrobov a vydávajú o Kristovi svedectvo s tým stotníkom, ktorý pod krížom volal: "Tento človek bol naozaj Syn Boží!” 2. V tomto Veľkom týždni stretnime Krista často, pobozkajme mu rany vo viere a láske, aby sme prijali jeho spásu. Nevinný Syn Boha živého, Ježiš Kristus prešiel toľkým pokorením preto, lebo nás nekonečne miloval. Bola by to prinaj menej surovosť, keby sme mu nedali odpoveď v láske a keby 4$ sme nezanechali hriech, ktorý bol jedinou príčinou toho všetkého. Sv. Pavol v druhom čítaní tejto sv. omše (Flp 2. 6-11) nás chce dojať tým, že nám pripomína, ako nesmierne sa Kristus za nás uponižil. Hovorí, že On; "Hoci bol Božej prirodzenosti, nemyslel si, že sa musi pridržiavať svojej rovnosti s Bohom .. uponižil sa a bol poslušný až na smrť kríža. Preto ho Boh povýšil a dal mu Meno nad všetky iné mená, aby sa na Jeho Meno skláňalo každé koleno na nebi a na zemi." Tým, že nás Ježiš predišiel do svojej slávy obťažený ťaž kým krížom, dal nám na jave, že On našim trampotám dobre rozumie, že je na ceste nášho života s nami a že nám chce pomáhať niesť naše kríže a znášať naše sebazaprenia. Kristovo víťazstvo nad svetom a satanom je zárukou aj nášho víťazstva, ak pravda, vo všetkých príkoriach života ostaneme s ním pev ď ne spojení vo viere a horúcej láske. Nato, aby ako Vzkriesená Pán nám bol čím bližšie, nato ustanovil Prevelebnú Sviatosť Oltárnu a svoje Slovo vložil na strany Sv. písma. V prevelebnej Sviatosti Oltárnej nám zane chal svoje oslávené rany, aby sme z nich čerpali posilu a po techu. Keď Ho pri sv. prijímaní prijímame v živej viere a ho rúčej láske, prežívame s ním chvíle jeho Poslednej večere, krá čame s ním na Kalváriu a prežívame Jeho slávu vzkriesenia. Slovami Sv. písma ku nám stále hovorí, vedie nás, aby sme na ceste života nezablúdili. Naša agónia s Kristom je tým hlbšia, ak svet aj s nami pohŕda. ako pohrdol Ním. Veď v nás, ak sme napríklad chudobní, nemocní, v pokročilom veku, alebo inej pleti a sme zato pohŕdaní, to sú rany, kforých sa aj v našich časoch dostáva Kristovi, S Kristom sme spojení, ak nás to nevinne osočujú, keď nami pohŕdajú a keď sa pri tom za nich modlíme s Kristom, aby Im Boh odpustil, lebo nevedia, čo robia. Uvedomme si pri tom. že služobník nemôže byť nad svojho Majstra! Kristus jediný môže našu slzu osušiť a posilniť n;ís, aby sme pod údermi biča neklesali a vytrvali s Ním na ceste, ktorú nám do slávy On svojimi krvavými Šľapajami vyznačú. On vie o nás. Nebuďme ako ti, čo raz volajú: "Hosana” a, ak Kristus s nimi "nesúhlasí", volajú: “Preč s ním, ukrižuj ho." A Kristus musí znovu a znovu volať slová medzispevu tejto sv. omše: "Bože môj. Bože môj, prečo si ma opustil." Uznajme ho v živej viere a láske že; “Tento človek bol naozaj Syn Boží", náš Boh a Spasiteľ, ktorý nás nekonečne miluje! Kvetné nedeľa 27 Nedeľa---------------------- Lýdia 2B Pondelok-----------------Dorotej 29 Utorok----------------- Mieroslav 30 Streda — Ján Klímach. Kvlrln 31 Štvrtok--------Zelený štvrtok 1 Piatok------------Veľký piatok 2 Sobota------------Biela sobota ZELENÝ ŠTVRTOK: VEĽKÉ TAJOMSTVO "Rozumiete, čo som vám urobil?" (Jn 13, 151 Život človeka je akosi vždy spojený so stolom. Okolo stola si ľudia sadajú, aby jedlom posilňovali svoje 'telá. Okolo stola si sadá rodina, aby sa spolu modlila a aby sa neraz aj zamyslela nad starosťami každodenného života. Okolo stola si sadajú vladári a štátnici a vynášajú zákon, ktorými zaväzujú milióny svojich občanov. No, v dedinách ľudstva nebolo pamätnejšieho zasadnutia okolo stola, ako bolo to, ktoré sa odohralo pri Po slednej večeri Pánovej. Milióny slov a tisícky piesní už odzneli, keď sa človek zahĺbal nad veľkým tajomstvom tej večere Pánovej, keď sa Ježiš opýtal svojich: 'Rozumiete, čo som vám urobil?” Tým veľkým tajomstvom je sv. Eucharistia, ktorú Pán Ježiš ustanovil pri Poslednej večerí. V nej Ježiš uskutočnil svoj Božský plán, ako cstane s nami aj potom, keď odíde do neba. Veď v nej nám zanechal svoje vzkriesené Telo a svoju Krv, večne živé. Sv. Eucharistia je teda pamiatka toho všetkého, čo Ježiš povedal a urobil na naše spasenie. Sám si to tak prial, lebo svojej Cirkvi dal rozkaz: “Toto robte na maju pamiatku." Ľudská spoločnosť má rôzne pamätnosti, ktorými si pripomína svojich hrdinov. Stavia im pomníky, ich menám zasväcuje rôzne budovy. No, sv. Eucharistia je niečo nekonečne väčšieho, neprekonateľného. V nej sám Syn Boha živého prichádza na náš oltár, pri sv. omši, pri Premenení. Sv. omša je teda stretnutie sa človeka so svojím Bohom. Vo sv. Eucharistii teda sám Boh prebýva s nami. Vo všetkých iných sviatostiach prichádzame do styku so Vzkrieseným Ježišom. No. vo sv. Eucharistii prijímame samého Ježiša. Preto ju právom nazývame: Prevelebná Sviatosť Oltárna. Prevelebná Sviatosť Oltárna Je však veľké tajomstva, ľudsky nepochopiteľne, ale Echu možné. Boh je Všemohúci a preto On môže premenil' podstatu chleba a vina na svoje Telo a Krv. Musíme sa však pokoriť a v hlbokej viere prijať tak veľké tajomstvo, v ktorom sa nám sám Boh dáva pre naše dobro a spasenie. Najväčším dôkazom dobroty Ježišovej, živým a prítomným v Prevelebnej Sviatosti Oltárnej jej účinky na nás, pútnikov na ceste do večnosti. Ježiš v nej pretvára náš celý život, ak ho prijímame v živej viere a horúcej láske. Neraz sa pozastavujeme nad zmenami ohľadom sbiženia sv. omše a iných liturgických úkonov. Ak chceme byť povďační Ježišovi za Jeho láskavú prítomnosť s nami v tomto veľkom Tajomstve, dovoľme mu, aby nás viedol k svätosti života. On to môže, lebo je Najsvätejší! Veď- "Kalich dobrorečenia je účasťou na Jeho Krvi", (2 113) na cene nášho spasenia. VEĽKÝ PIATOK: HĽA. BARÁNOK BOŽÍ "Preč £ ním: Ukrižuj ho"! (Jn 19, 15) V časoch Kristových nebolo hroznejšieho spôsobu popravy. ako bolo ukrižovanie. Izaiáš, ako sme čítal! v prvom čítaní tejto Posvätnej Liturgie (Iz 52. 13; 53-12) túto hrôzu križovania predvídal. Hovorí, že Mesiáš bude: 'Neľudsky znetvorený a jeho obraz bude pod človeka. Bude muž bolesti a útrap.. " Prorok ale dokladá, že Mesiáš toto pretrpí pre naše hriechy, veď: "Bol prebodnutý pre naše hriechy, strýznený pre- naše neprávosti... obetoval sa preto. že sám chcel.” V pašiách, ktoré sme dnes čítali (Jn 18, 1-19, 42) sv. Ján opisuje hanobný príbeh súdu nad nevinným Ježišom. Hovorí o tom, ako ho vodili Jd Kajfáša k Annášovi a napokon ku Pilá tovi, len aby sa ho zbavili. Rozsudok smrtí už bol vopred rozhodnutý. Darmo sa Pilát priznáva. "že na ňom nenachádza viny", nahuckaný dav zúrivo kriči: "Preč s nim! Ukrižuj ho!” Potom nasledovala hrôza samého ukrižovania. Popravu pre viedli kati, ktorí už boli na svoju "prácu" navyknutí Veď videli už mnohých na kríži zomierať, videli ich smrteľné úzkosti, za- trpkosť a neraz počúvali rúhanie sa a klianie aj samých katov. Tak sa neraz stalo, že prv, ako začali s ukrižovaním, najprv odsúdenému vyrezali jazyk, aby nemohol kliať. Nič takého nebolo v prípade križovania Ježiša. Jeho nevina, jeho jemnosť, jeho svätá trpezlivosť i v tom najväčšom potupení, dojala aj samých katov. V hlbine svojich sŕdc cítili, že ich Kristus nebude kliať, ale skôr blahoslaviť Keď napokon na kríži pribili nápis, že ho križujú preto, lebo sa robil kráľom, každému svitlo v hlave, že Kristus zomiera v rukách veľkňazov a zákonníkov za hriechy celého sveta ako nevinný Baránok Boží. Zatmením slnka, zemetrasením a vstávaním mŕtvych z hrobov, keď Kristus zomieral, nebeský Otec dosvedčil, že prijíma obetu svojho Syna a že brány nebeské sú už zase otvorené, lebo Ježiš premohol smrť в zlého ducha, ktorý ju zavlnil. Preto sme na Veľký piatok neprišli do kostola, aby sme lamentovali nad nevinnou smrťou Ježišovou, ale skôr, aby sme mu poďakovali za jeho víťazstvo s aby sme sa skôr tešili, že môžeme byť spasení. Sv. Pavol v druhom čítam tejto Posvätnej Liturgie (žid 4. 14-16; 5; 7-9) nám hovorí, ie Kristus sa svojou poslušnosťou až na smrť kríža stal pôvodcom nášho spasenia, pravda, ak ho budeme nasledovať a plniť vôľu Božiu. Pavol hovorí: "Veď v Kristovi nemáme veľkňaza, ktorý' by nemohol spolucítiť s našimi slabosťami, ale takého, ktorý bol vo všetkom podobne skúšaný, ako aj my, okrem pravda hriechu. Pristúpme teda s dôverou k tronu milosti, aby sme obsiahli milosrdenstvo a našil milosť nám na pcmce v pravom čase." Toto by sme mali pochopiť najmä dnes pod krížom, keď sme svedkami toľkej Lásky, ktorá presahuje všetky ľudské pochopy! Ježiš nás miloval a miluje a chce nám pomôcť, aby jeho krv nebola pre nás máme vyliata. Ak kedy, tak na Veľký piatok by sme mali skoncovať s hriechom, který toto všetko narobil... Preto dnes, keď prijmeme Telo Ježišovo pri sv. prijímaní, pokryté ranami за naše hriechy, uvedomme si. že "On je Baránok Boží”, ktorý sa obetoval, aby sme my mohli začať žiť životom dietok Božích. Nestaňme si už viac do radov nemilosrdných hriešnikov, ktorí ešte stále volajú: “Preč s ním! Ukrižuj ho!” Hriešnici by ho radi ešte raz ukrižovali, aby len zabili hlas svojho svedomia. No my. horúcou láskou sa snažme zahojiť rany Ježišovi, ktoré sme mu svojimi hriechami narobili a často k nemu volajme slovami medzispevu tejto Liturgie: "K tebe sa. Pane, utiekam, nech nie som zahanbený na veky." (2 30) Otec Augustín J. Záú SLOVO BOŽIE JEDNOTA. WEDNESDAY. MARCH 23. 1988 Page 15 [pageend15]Page 16 JEDNOTA. WEDNESDAY.

I met a Slovak man coming Irom the village of Gerlach on his way to the Tatra hotels where he hoped to sell his basketfull of colorfull "kraslice'' to the nch tourists His hands were stained up to his wnsts, indicating his use of natural dyes The beauti ful eggs marked him as a master ol his craft Some eggs are pierced at each end with a pin and the contents are blown out. making the egg as fragile as a piece of fine porcelain, but long lasting if given proper care. Among the highlanders, ' hor- ruad". there is a greater variety of ex oting and emcöona' desgns on their eggs than found among (he people living in the low lands, (geometnc designs and circular mobfs) It could be an expression of their joy lor having made it through the harsh winters and where the soil к poor in contrast to the people living in the fertile low 'ands With the kras'ice" we see the greatest variety of harmoneous or namentaton that can be found only in "Stovenske kroje" (Slovak natrona' costumes) Among the Slovaks, as wefl as with other Slav peoples, Easter is their most important holy season The beautifully deccorated Slovak eggs, "krasbee" or called ’písanky"..by Slovaks in eastern Slovakia are'sy* nonomous with ihe observance of Easier. Even before Christianity, the egg symbolized fife; and the painting of eggs expressed what was a joyful happening, a reawakening, the сот-ц mg of Spring. Since then Spring has continued to be a joyous time in the Chnsban community, a reawakening of life with the Resurrection ol Chnst Decorations on the egg may be either scratched, painted, etched, with aad or the egg may be given a distinctive color. When the scratching technique is employed, the egg. covered with a wax or laquer is scratched using a stylus, or a sharp razor point to create geometric designs, plants, animals, flowers or a crucifix. Some prefer lo use a fine paint brush dipped in aniline or natural dyes to decorate their eggs As Americans, we enjoy the benefits of living and working in a society which encourages us to preserve our ethnic ancestry. As Americans of Slovak ancestry, we have a rich and noble tradition which comes to us from Slovakia. Slovakia is a land ol beauty and richness. One ol the most precious treasures of Slovakia is its rich and abiding faith. The celebrating ot Easter is the most important least ot the Church year. In Slovakia, it is not merely celebrated on Easter Sunday but it is prepared lor long in advance and its festivities continue after the feast itself. Because Slovakia is a land of many picturesque towns and villages. where folk traditions thrive, we have many and varied customs, dress, dialect and folk art. Because of the deeoiy rooted farth of the Slovak people, religious holidays are the chief events of the, year Palm Sunday and Morena Besides the spmtual preparation of penance during Lent, there are other customary ways of prepanng for Easter. For example, each mem ber of the family is given a small bouquet of budding willow branches bound with colorful nbbons. On Palm Sunday, each takes his own bouquet to the church to be blessed and places it in a special spot in his home. The afternoon of Palm Sunday is spent lightheartediy. with special tun for the children They form a figure of straw called Morena, (goddess of death), dress it in old women's clothes, and carry it with chants from the upper end" of the village down lo the waler where they drown it The people associate winter with death and the drowning of the Morena is a sign ol winter's end The Palm Sunday festivities also include the bringing of spring to the vilage Spnng is represented by a leafy bough which the girls decorate with colorful ribbons and pamted egg shells They carry it from house to house singing an appropriate song. -Each housewife gives ihe.. children candies or eggs lor the pleasure ot seeing Ihe colorful branches In Slovakia green boughs are accepted as symbols of life and good health Holy Week The bit of merriment on Palm Sunday gives way again to the Imai solemnity of Holy Week From Wednesday evening to Friday night the villagers meet nightly al the church and the cross for prayers and a traditional vigil with the crucified Christ On Holy Thursday each household has an abundant supply of green vegetables on the table to mark ' Green Thursday" - Zeleny štvrtok Fnday is an absolute fast day for young and old Only one meal is served on that day.

Orava and Liptov, it is customary to pant the eggs by plunging them into the colored molds made from plants or wood. In this way a design is printed on the eggs Another way is to cover them with a layer ol col ored wax to make pretty patterns, this is done in Eastern Slovakia. In Centra! Slovakia, m the upper Hron district, kraslice are colored with molten bees-wax or put into colored decorations In Bratislava district the etching of designs on the eggs is a done after the eggs have been ’ pamted In Trenem and the upper Vah district the etching is done with needles Sometimes it is done with straw Záhone in Western Slovakia does it with adhesive patterned textures The popular custom of adorning Easter eggs in various ways reaches considerable artistic heights This expression of Slovak culture contains a long-standmg traditional beauty it requires talent ingenuity and a sense of beauty on the pan of the girls and women of Ihe Slovak countryside Easter Monday is a man's day Preparation for the fun is made weeks ahead by the boys who cut choice willow branches and dry them mto straight bows They are skillfully braided mto a korbac — a braided whip The whip is colorfully tied with bright ribbons The lads are up very early in the morning for they must splash all the girls with cold water and whip them.

The distinctive mark of the day is. of course, the gaily pamted Easier egg May God protect and guide you In His very loving way. And grant you many blessings on this Joyous Easter Day. The Beautiful Easter Basket Tradition Among ihe Slavs the custom of bringing an Easter Basket to Church on Easter Sunday is an age old tradition. It stems from the desire of the Christian community to ask God's blessing on the foods that will break ehe Great Fast (Lent) and from which they have abstained from during this period. The religious significance attached lo the foods eaten are symbolic of Chnst Himself, our true Passover Foods traditionally blessed for Easter, the feast of the Lord's Passow from death to life, are the foods which God prescribed for the ancient Passover meal: lamb, bread, wine and bitter herbs. Children's baskets of candy and eggs may be included in the blessing service. EGGS — Brightly decorated eggs are a symbol of the New Life that is ours in Christ Eggs are a sign of hope and resurrection. Jesus comes forth from the tomb as the chick breaks the shell at birth- Because of the special meaning, it is fitting that the eggs to be blessed be decorated’with symbols of Easter. Alleluia, and so forth. PASCHA — The Easter Bread — A sweet, yeast bread rich in eggs, butter, etc. Symbolic of Christ Himself who is our True Bread. Usually a round loaf baked with a golden crust decorated with a symbol indicative of Christ. Sometimes a cross (*) of dough is placed on top encircled by a plait giving it a crowned effect or Greek abbreviations for the name of Christ. The letters XB indicate the Slavonic for Christ is Risen. SAUSAGE — A spicy, garllcy sausage of pork products. indicative of God's favor and generosity. Sausage is an ethnic addition to enhance the celebration; its links remind us of the chains of death which were broken when Jesus arose BACON — A piece of uncooked bacon cured with spices. Symbolic of the overabundance of God's mercy to us. HAM — Ham celebrates the freedom of the New Law whish came into effect through Jesus resurrection, in distinction to the Old Law which forbade сенат meats The flesh meat popular with the Slavs as the main dish because of us richness and symbolic of the great joy and abundance of Easter. Some may prefer Lamb or Veal. This is usually well roasted or cooked as well as other meals so that the festivity of the day will not be burdened with preparation and all may enjoy the feast. CHEESE — A custard-type cheese shaped into a ball having a rather bland but sweet taste indicative of the moderation that Christians should have in ail things. Also, creamed cheese is placed in a small dish and both are decorated with symbols made out of cloves or pepper balls. HORSERADISH — Represents the bitter herbs prescribed in the original Passover meal as a reminder of the bitterness and harchness of life in Egypt. It reminds us of the bitterness and suffering of Christ which culminated in the Resurrection. SALT Reminds us to flavor our dealings with’others by the example of Christ. LAMB (BUTTER) — This favorite dairy product is shaped into a figure of a Lamb.
