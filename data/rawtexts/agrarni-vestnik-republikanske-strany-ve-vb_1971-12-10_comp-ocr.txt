'i t ■ Í-, ' It was befere the First Woyld War when he was still a student at Vienna University that Dr. Cerny became interested in politics - and especially in the activities of the Czech Agrarian Party whose main program was the social advancement of the peasant masses. The Agrarian Party j/as the leading Czech party at the Vienna Parliament At that time, Cerny became a member and cofounder of the Party’s academic youth organization. In I9I8, when the Czechs and Slovaks founded an independent state, -the Agrarian Party delegated Dr. Cerny to the Prague Revolutionary Parliament. He served as a member of Parliament during the twenty-year existence of prewar democratic Czechoslovakia, which is also called the Masaryk Republic. */ / ' _ In 1934> Dr. Cerny became Minister of the Interior. At that time, the pressure and subversion of Hitler’s German Reich against Czechoslovakia had become extremely dangerous in the agitated Sudeten area. Dr. Cerny built an excellent administrative system and police force to assure order through democratic procedures. This administrative system helped to preserve Czechoslovakia as an exemplary democratic country even in her most difficult days. _ 'S I After the 1938 Munich sellout, Dr. Cerny tried to preserve national unity and stability in dismembered Czechoslovakia. »Z J When the Nazis occupied the truncated country, Dr. Cerny took a strong stand against the occupation, retired from public life and became part of the anti-Nazi underground. With complete disregard of their political affiliations, he gave financial and moral support to the families whose members had either lost employment, were in prisons and concentration camps or had been executed by the Nazis because of^patriotic activity. From the (.very beginning of the war, Dr. Cerny believed in an Allied victory and inculated his belief in the members of the underground in order to keep their morale high. When it the end of World War II, the Soviet armies advanced into East Central Europe, the agrarian leaders of these countries who had suffered under the Nazi occupation were again persecuted, this time as notorious anti-communists. At that time, the Soviet scheme was supported by some non-communist politicians who were ignorant of the ultimate aim of the Soviet Union and local comma ..sts. AGRÁRNÍ VĚSTNÍK [pageend1]- 2 - Dr. Černý was jailed but the court that tried him refused to condemn him. Even during those days of terror and political confusion there were still brave patriots in responsible positions who opposed the trend. Letters supporting Dr. Černý were sent to the court by the survivors of Nazi persecution testifying to his patriotism and his courage during the occupation. In ^tating its grounds for acquittal, the court attested: "...Dr. Cerny was an apostle of uncompromising patriotism and of social and political peace; he demonstrated his love for the Czechoslovak Republic in our nation’s most difficult days.” ✓ z After the communist putsch of 1948, Dr. Cerny left Czechoslovakia with his wife, stayed in Germany and France for awhile and finally settled in the United States - first, in Washington, D. C. and later in New York. In exile, Dr. Cerny renewed the activities of the Czechoslovak Agrarian Party, became a Vice President of the International Peasant Union, a member of the Council for a Free Czechoslovakia and, later, a member of the Committee for a Free Czechoslovakia.

Dr. Josef Černý měl značný podíl na vnitřním vývoji čs. politiky a na budovaní svobodného demokratického státu v době před Mnichovem.Významná byla jeho činnost i na poli mezinárodním doma i v exilu - v Mezinárodním Agrárním Bureau, International Peasant Union, Assembly of Captive European Nations'.. Osobně velmi skromný, človek ušlechtilého charakteru; svojí objektivností, smyslem pro spravedlnost získal si uznaní všech.. V hlubokém smutku skláníme se před Majestátem smrti velkého syna českého národa, politika a Evropana, člověka zlatého srdce, vzácného přítele, který dlouho bude živ v naších srdcích..
