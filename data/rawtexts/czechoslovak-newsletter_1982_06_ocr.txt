CZECHOSLOVAK NEWSLETTER PUBLISHED BY THE COUNCIL OF FREE CZECHOSLOVAKIA 420 East 71st Street, New York, N.Y. 10021 Vol. VII, No. 6 (69) June 1982 CONTENTS Disarmament—East and West No Cheers for GI’s 3 The Trial Charter 77 on Terror Letter to President Reagan p. 1 p. 4 p. 4 p. 5 Memoraundum from the Free Representatives of Central and East European Nations . . . p. 6 News from Normalized Czechoslovakia .... p. 7 DISARMAMENT—EAST AND WEST At the time when hundreds of thousands demonstrated against nuclear arms in New York, the Soviet police staged a crackdown on a fledgling independent disarmament group in Moscow whose objective was to be as free of official control as disarmament movements in the United States and Western Europe (The New York Times, June 14)• People in the oommunist-dominated countries are no less opposed to nuclear weapons than elsewhere in the world, but they are more cynical. They have been exposed to too many “spontaneous” conferences, meetings, and appeals—all under strict party and government control. They have become accustomed to read into communist propaganda just the opposite of what it preaches. Also, they are distrustful of the peace movement in the West, suspecting that some of its elements are manipulated by Soviet agents to serve Moscow’s power political goals. A proliferation of peace pronouncements follow the same line in Moscow as in the capitals of its client states: The Western nations, particularly the United States, are warmongers whereas the Eastern Bloc, the “peace camp,” defends peaoe against the “imperialist” West. At the same time young people are told that serving in the armed forces is an honorable and sacred patriotic duty. Military education in Czechoslovakia as in other Bloc countries starts early. “Elements of military education are a special subject in the educational effort of nursery schools and kindergartens,” the head of the military education department of the Slovak Ministry of Education noted. He said that this is done “to strengthen socialist patriotism as well as the students* proletarian and socialist internationalism” (Czechoslovak Newsletter, Vol. VI, No. 10, 1982). 1 [pageend1]2. X But when the World Women’s Congress was held in Prague in October 1981, a group of Czech women sent it a letter which stated among other things: "To impress us you play eloquent trump cards—peace, war, the neutron bomb. We have to hold our tongues, be careful, look to see who is listening, whether we are being shadowed, whether our telephones are tapped before we utter a oomplaint. We live in constant fear. Out of fear we raise our hands to approve resolutions, to pledge voluntary work. We have sent hundreds of letters to your Congress ... so at least we learned from the press. . . . You look to the side of the Soviet Union, the power of peace, against American imperialism, the instigator of nuclear catastrophe. Who really are you? . Are you naive or hypocrites? It is tragio that some of you should oome from countries where there is oppression, hunger, cruel conditions, and that you should be honest. Excuse us, but you should not have spoken about it here. • . • Peace is valueless if it protects life without rights, happiness, and civility but only a wretched life .... You try to convince us that the neutron bomb is worse, for instance, than being beaten to death by the police .... You muddle ideas .... Our positions are irreconcilable." Totalitarian systems inherently prohibit unofficial, independent manifestations. It is inconceivable that a peace rally should take place in Moscow where officials and government representatives would not be permitted to speak (unlike the case in New York on June 12). But the germ has been planted. Spontaneous antiwar activities have already taken place in East Germany and Hungary, while the Charter 77 human rights movement in Czechoslovakia issued a declaration addressing the "unofficial" peace movement in the DDR, undoubtedly reflecting the feeling of the overwhelming majority of the people in Czechoslovakia. Charter 77 to the DDR Peace Movement Charter 77 issued the following declaration addressed to the "unofficial" peace movement in East Germany: "Charter 77 extends its full support to your peace efforts and shares your concrete goals. As stated in our Document No. 13 of this year Can open letter to the peace movement in the West], we believe that everywhere in the world, in every country, ordinary oitizens, individuals as well as unofficial groups, should strive for the right to live in a just peaoe, i.e., free from militarism and nuclear arms of mass destruction, but also in safety thanks to external as well as domestic peace, to live a life where citizenship means responsibility for observing human rights. Militarism, which we oppose, is dangerous for both the international and domestic spheres. We are glsd that such an unofficial grassroots peaoe movement originated in the German Democratic- Republic, in that part of the former European power which was so deeply involved in the militarization of Europe in the first half of the 20th Century .... We know that Professor Robert Havemann, who died recently, signed your peace appeal. We express our deep sorrow for the passing of this courageous German." Prague, April 21, 1982 [signecj Dr. Radim Palouk, Anna Marvanova, Ladislav Lis, Charter 77 spokespersons [pageend2]3 In the above-mentioned issue of our Newsletter we wrote: ’’Military training of young people in the ’peace camp* is of little interest to the West’s pacifists. Yet the Western public should be aware of this so that there should be no repetition of the 1930s and the underestimation of the militarism of Hitler’s Germany. Tanks and weapons alone do not attest to the enormity of communist militarism. We can only warn—in the interests of our country and in the interests of world peace.” NO CHEERS FOR GI’S The month of May is the time when the Czechoslovak mass media celebrate Czechoslovakia’s liberation in 1945 the end of World War II. People hear of the ’’heroic and fraternal” sacrifice made by Red Army troops to free the Czeohs and Slovaks from the Nazi yoke, but ignored is the American role in the country’s liberation. Official spokesmen fail to mention how many American soldiers were killed, though these are not forgotten by the citizens of western Bohemia. On May 15 and 16, the U.S. ambassador in Prague, Jack F. Matlook, visited western Bohemia and laid wreaths at sites where monuments had been erected to commemorate the fallen American soldiers. Accompanied by staff members of the embassy and their families, Ambassador Matlook visited Cheb, Kolové^, Litice, Vitejovice, Kaspersk/ Hory, Sušice, Pole, and Lnáre. In its Czechoslovak broadoast, the Voice of America announced his itinerary in advance and a considerable number of people waited for him and his party. On his first stop in Cheb, Ambassador Matlock noted that 37 years ago, on April 17, 1945, advance units of the U.S. Army crossed the border of Czechoslovakia and a week later the First Infantry Division liberated Cheb, the first of several Czech towns and villages, to be followed by Bor, Klatovy, Plzetó, and Sušice. Ha said that the G.I.’s were greeted enthusiastically everywhere, but he also mentioned the Czechs and Slovaks who fought at home and in the allied armies, and the Poles whose Warsaw uprising ended so tragically. Ambassador Matlock also spoke of Britain standing alone against the Nazi onslaught before the German invasion of the Soviet Union and the entry of the United States into the war. He noted the struggle for freedom and democracy still in process and the firm bonds between the people of Czechoslovakia and the United States. The ambassador’s party laid wreaths at the war memorials in Cheb, Vitejovice, Pole, and Lná^e, and at the site where the monument had been removed by the communist authorities several years ago in Kolové^. Commemorative plagues had also been removed by the authorities in Sušice and Ka^perskš Hory. In Sušice, when the ambassador said that the memory of heroic deeds would live even though the memorials are no longer there, a crowd of several hundred people burst into applause. But American soldiers were not the only ones forgotten by official spokesmen. According to Cesk^ slovo (Munich, May 1982), when he spoke at a ceremony in Terezin, the site of the former Nazi concentration camp in northern Bohemia, Zden4k Zuzka, deputy chairman of the Czech Government, mentioned Czechs, Slovaks, Russians, Serbs, French, Dutch, and Belgians who had lost their lives in Terezin, but he scandalously omitted to mention Jews of whom more than 100,000 died there or passed through on their way to extermination camps elsewhere. The ceremony, as Mr. Zuzka put it, was ”to contribute to international pesce and understanding.” [pageend3]4. THE TRIAL A re-enactment of the trial of imprisoned Czech playwright Vaclav Havel and friends was presented by a renowned group of actors, writers, and directors at the California Theater Council’s Fifth Annual Statewide Conference on May 22 at UCLA, Los Angeles. Ms Marianne Maroellin, representative of the American branch of the International Association for the Defense of Artists (AIDA), which was instrumental in arranging the event, read an introduction by Arthur Miller, reproduced below in full. The Czech actor Jan Taiska played the part of Vaclav Havel. Introduction Arthur Miller ’’Vaclav Havel is a full-fledged playwright | that is, he writes dialogues for actors to act and audienoes to hear. The only difference between him and other playwrights is that he had the misfortune of being born on a piece of real estate which is controlled by a party which does not allow people to address each other if their views fail to praise and support party policies. This is a big difference. For Václav Havel it is the difference between being able to write and produce his plays, live in a house with his wife and family, go to the oorner for his paper in the morning, or ride a bicycle up and down a hill. For he is in jail and has been for several years and will be for several more years. ”His crime was to speak, to do exactly what I am doing in writing these paragraphs which, if they were typed out in his country, would land me in a oell just like his. This is not more or less true; it is exactly true. ’’Because we are all either playwrights or audienoes, speakers or listeners, makers of ideas or consumers of ideas—because we are still alive—it is important to us to turn our attention to Vaclav Havel, to where he is at the present time and why he is there. He is part of our condition, our world, our hopes for ourselves.” CHARTER 77 ON TERROR The Charter 77 human rights movement sent a letter to the President of the Republio, Dr. Gustav Husák, on the increasing use of terror as a means to harass and intimidate its members and other human rights aotivists. The following is a summary version: Terrorism has become an important aspect of the second half of the 20th Century. It has spread all over the world as a deadly and dangerous infection. Innocent people are taken as hostages, including children and the aged. Extortinate practices are used not only by individuals against individuals or the politically weak against the politically powerful, but also by the powerful against those with no possibility of influencing the power structure of the state. Political terrorism is a phenomenon of the total deterioration of fundamental moral values and a testimony to the weakness of its protagonists. It is a pathological state of our society. This is one more reason for us to oppose th.e trend where terroristic methods are increasingly used by some segments of the executive branch of our government. [pageend4]5 [Specific types of pressure, false accusations, especially against relatives and friends of Charter 77 spokespersons, were mentioned as violations of the legal system.] We appeal to the competent organs because we can hardly believe that such illegal acts are perpetrated with the knowledge of responsible authorities. • Individuals are taken by the police without notice and subjected to interrogation about matters of no concern to the police (private oontacts; political, religious, and civic attitudes; etc.). This situation leads to a disintegration of the legal order and its substitution by uncontrolled license. Only the rule of law can prevent the recurrence of those conditions, Mr. President, which existed at the time when even you were illegally persecuted and imprisoned [the allusion was to Husák’s life sentence for ’’bourgeois nationalism” in 1951]* Prague, May 3, 1982 [signed] Dr. Radim Palous, Anna Marvanová, Ladislav Lis, Charter 77 spokes- Copies to the Federal Assembly persons and the Prosecutor General LETTER TO PRESIDENT REAGAN Dear Mr. President: We wish to express our admiration and gratitude for your address to the two Houses of Parliament in the Palace of Westminster in London on Tuesday, June 9, 1982. We appreciate especially your vigorous defense of democracy and the freedom and independence of every nation. We are encouraged by your renewed commitment of the United States of America to additional measures of assistance to all who struggle for these ideals. We approve the work of the leaders of the national Republican and Democratic parties in their searoh for the best means by which the United States can contribute to the global campaign for democracy as well as of the planned meetings of parliamentarians in Strasbourg and constitutional experts in Washington. We would be grateful if the representatives of the Council of Free Czechoslovakia oould take part, in a way acceptable to its organizers, at the international meeting on free elections which will be held in Washington in November of this year. Since the Council has for more than 30 years struggled from exile for Czechoslovakia’s freedom, independence, and democracy, we feel that we could make a telling contribution at such a meeting. You spoke in London of the support of Western Europeans to fraternal political and social institutions committed to bring about peaceful and democratic progress and of your own commitment to join in this effort. We would appreciate any assistance that your Administration oould give to our endeavor. Yours sincerely, Mojmír Povolný Chairman, Executive Committee Council of Free Czechoslovakia New York, June 9r 19&2 [pageend5]6 MEMORANDUM A memorandum from the free representatives of Central and East European nations was sent to President Reagan prior to his European trip in June. It read as follows: 43 Eaton Place London SW1X 8BX Mr. President: Your forthcoming visit to Europe in June will present an important opportunity for you to exchange views with political leaders of West European nations. We regret that your consultations on the future of Europe will not include the true representatives of Central and East European nations because our countries are under the domination of regimes which rule them on behalf of the Soviet Union. We wish, therefore, to convey to you in this way the following views of about 120 million people of Central and Eastern Europe who cannot speak freely for themselves. Our nations have never accepted the political division of Europe into two spheres: One free and democratic in the West; the other totalitarian and dominated by the Soviet Union. We dissociate ourselves, therefore, from all international agreements which have caused the present division of Europe, created a source of permanent internal and external conflicts,and brought about the flouting of human rights in Central and Eastern Europe. We should be grateful if you would explore, together with the West European leaders, all possible avenues for obliterating the present division of Europe. We have continuously insisted on the self-determination of our nations through free elections and on the negotiated withdrawal of Soviet armed forces from all Central and East European countries. We are convinced that this is the only way leading to the creation of a permanent climate of mutual confidence between the United States and Western Europe on the one hand and the Soviet Union on the other, and providing a solid basis for a conflict-free existence for the whole of Europe. We believe that intensification of economic relations between the West and the Soviet Union is in the interest of all parties oonc-erned but only on the condition of a parallel introduction of a new political order in Central and Eastern Europe, free from foreign domination and interference. We are convinced, however, that unless the Soviet Union and its satellite regimes prove willing to acoept the legitimate demands of Central and East European nations for freedom, separate, identity, and independence, the United States and the West European Governments should refrain from any favoring form of economic and financial support to the Soviet Union and its satellites, particularly as regards the international transfer of technology and all related scientific exchanges. As soon as our countries cease to be subject to Soviet domination, we oould look forward to a peaceful economic development of the whole of Central and Eastern Europe. In order to facilitate and speed up this process of recovery and development, we would advocate under these conditions a moratorium on the crippling foreign [pageend6]7 debts incurred by the present communist regimes and a large-scale economic aid and technical assistance program for those countries of Central and Eastern Europe where such a moratorium and aid program would be the necessary precondition of economic recovery. These program.s should be organized under the supervision of an international consortium constituted by all the donor and recipient countries. Toward the end of the Second World War the countries of liberated Europe expected that they would be able to govern themselves freely according to the democratically expressed will of their peoples. This expectation has been fulfilled with dramatic success in one half of Europe and tragically failed in Central and Eastern Europe. We appeal to you that after all the tribulations of the last 37 years the time has come for the reopening, in this context, of the Central and East European question in the negotiations between the West and the Soviet Union. We do so in the conviotion that only the resolution of this question in harmony with the wishes and the aspirations of the nations of Central and Eastern Europe will help achieve and insure the security, freedom, and peace to which you have dedicated your Administration.

NEWS FROM NORMALIZED CZECHOSLOVAKIA Czech Poet Honored The Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts in Munich elected the Czech poet Jaroslav Seifert as its honorary member. The octogenarian writer, who was elected chairman of the Writers’ Union during the Prague Spring in 1968, suffered a heart attack last November following a visit of State Security officers who pressed him to retract his signature from an appeal to PEN International asking help for imprisoned writers and journalists (Czechoslovak Newsletter, Vol. VII, No. 2/3, 1982). [pageend7]Motion Picture Industry in 1981 Films in Czechoslovakia are produced mainly at three locations: At Barrandov in Prague, at the ’’Studio” in Gottwaldov (southern Moravia), and at Koliba in Bratislava. In 1981 Barrandov produced 32 features and 23,000 meters of film for Czechoslovak television. About 100 foreign pictures were dubbed. At the opening of this year’s film festival in Ústí” nad Labem (northern Bohemia), Jiri Purs, director of Czechoslovak Film, noted that during the past 10 years 450 feature films were produced in Czechoslovakia and that some were co-produced with the Soviets. He also said that ”a rehabilitation of the Soviet film has taken place in the last few years,” an allusion to the widespread boycott of such films by the audience (Rudá" právo, March 27)* cinematography is plagued with shortcomings." a ’’convincing image of a contemporary hero, a been created, "as if our directors are afraid more than pictures about individuals who oare summer homes, cars, or other gadgets of a certain standard don’t believe in the existence of such individuals” [i.e., Bratislava Pravda of November 24, 1981, writing about Slovak films is no exchange of opinions . . . only megalomania, pontification, • • • • Slovak pictures have been unable to get rid of dilettantism But he mentioned that ’’Czechoslovak Tvorba of April 14 complained that man without fear or blame,” has not to offer the only about a audience something private residence, of living, as if they socialist heroesj. , noted: "There complacency Economic News Quality differences. Under this heading Hospodářské noviny of May 7 reported that "the Czechoslovak State Testing Agencies evaluated the quality of 9,000 products valued at over 110 billion crowns last year and representing about 27 percent of Czechoslovakia’s total industrial output. One quarter of the items was listed as falling in the first category, 70 percent in the second, and only about 3 percent in the third. Some 61 products did not even meet the standards of the lowest category. The largest proportion—almost half—of the classified products were from the food industry. Most of these products (85 percent) were placed in the second category. Products of the best quality involved fuels (63 percent in the first category), metals (55 percent), and textiles (45 percent). The largest number of items in the third category were products from the paper and cellulose industry, construction materials industry, and the electrical engineering, metalworking, and wood-working industries." x/ Wage differentials. Summarizing an article in the latest issue of Svet hospodářství", the CTK news agency noted .on May 6 that further development of Czechoslovakia’s eoonomy makes it necessary to endow wages with a greater role as an incentive. Wages must more effectively stimulate the workers* interest in their performance. It will involve wage differentiation, but without changing the present range of 1 to 10 between the lowest and highest earnings. One problem centers on the fac-t that as many as 60 percent of all employed workers are in the 2,200-3,300-crown pay bracket, close to the national monthly average of 2,700 crowns .... The wage policy in enterprises will be to make wages actually reflect the quality and volume of work performed. Scarcity of vegetables. "There is a scarcity of mainly root vegetables ... to such an extent that it was necessary to regulate sales per consumer" (Noviny vnitrního obchodu, March 17)* 8 [pageend8]
