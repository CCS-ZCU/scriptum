The rebel Dalai bandit went to Delhi to plan a coup d etat against the Chinese Government...". EJCECUTIONS: The reports also say that last year, more particularly on China s National Day, October 1, more than two-hundred Tibetans were publicly executed in Lhasa. Most of them were youths charged with various kinds of anti-Chinese activities. According to reports received from Nepalese traders who had recently returned from Tibet, in March last year many Tibetan youths in Lhasa were imprisoned for not de- monstrating the proper expression of mourning when the death of Mao Tse-tung was an- nounced. They are now in the Drapchi Prison in Lhasa and in the Ngachen Trang labour camp in Lhasa s suburbs. It was rumoured that the actual reason for their arrest was their membership of secret anti-Chinese organisations. When arrested, one of the lead- ers is said to have bitten off bis tongue. During the Saka Dawa - a festival which used to be held on June 1, commemor- ating the birth, enlightenment and parinirvana of the Lord Buddha - many Tibetans openly walked round the Lhasa Tsugla Khang (Central Cathedral) and were later joined by Tibet- an militiamen. Earlier in May a new campaign of the "Three Antis" was launched: Anti- Business-on-the-Side, Anti-Pilfering, and Anti-Bad-Elements-Who~Sabotage-Peace - in Lhasa, Shigatse, G-yangtse, Nagchu and Nyentri. Huge public meetings were called, and in Lhasa some 500 Tibetans were denounced and I30 imprisoned. It was said that news coming from the Chinese authorities indicated that the main object of this new campaign was for other major towns besides Lhasa to be made open to foreign visitors, but before this could be done, all the Tibetan officials and ordinary people who were suspected of being anti-Chinese, had to be purged־ There were also notices posted on Chinese offic- cs and factories in Tibet: "Entrance strictly prohibited to all foreigners without per- mission from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs". CONFIBIVLATION? The reports of executions in Tibet are corroborated by a BBC broadcast of 18th November, 1977' "Ia Tibet, there seems to be a new purge against the supporters of the former leader, the Dalai Lama, who lives now in exile in India...". However, since then (the Chinese invitation of April 30) he Las been publicly attacked here as the head of the rebel Tibetan bandits in India, and in a key speech to the reg- ionol congress in Lhasa, the local Party leader (General Jen Jung, holder of the supreme office of power in Tibet) denounced what he called the Dalai s "treacherous tricks for opposing Chino, its people and socialism". These recent strident denunciations of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, and the Chinese "... speaking of the need to root out the Dalai Lama s followers" (BBC) confirm reports of the Tibetan refugees and other sources which speak of the unhappiness of the Tibetan people and their opposition to the oppressive Chinese gun rule. The exact number of the Tibetans who hove been executed in recent months conn ot be accurately as- ccrtoined, but there is sufficient evidence to rouse the conscience of the world. Tib- etans nt home and in exile wish that - however belatedly - these oppressive and inhuman acts would move the United Nations to some kind of action. They are asking whether atrocities and acts of genocide can be overlooked simply because they are committed be- hind closed doors. Tibetans arc being arrested, imprisoned and executed because tour- ists bent on new thrills want to visit exotic places in Tibet, thus providing fodder for Peking propaganda. (10/10 of DL/FCI) •’OR ׳AY-TIBET Felix Greene film - A ’־!,LOP IN NOJWAY(TNA/Oslo) The showing in Norway of the Greene film " 'nibet Todav" screened on Norwegian television has ended the public silence on present Sino-Tibetan relations-. The film, obviously inspired by Chinese pro- paganda which has been recognised as grossly misrepresenting the historical truth,ange- red not only Tibetans living in Norway but the public as well. Numbers of articles and letters that have appeared in the local press have set the record straight. Among the protesters was also leading Norwegian Tibetologist Prof. P.Kvaerne.
