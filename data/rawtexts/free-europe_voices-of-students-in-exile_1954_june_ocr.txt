free europe! VOICE OF STUDENTS IN EXILE THREE JUNE, 1954 PENCE UNITE IN There are people in every society who believe that whole sections of that society ought to be suppressed if they stand in their way towards what they imagine to be “a higher end.” Such were the Fascists and the Nazis, such are to-day the Communists. Both explained, or explain away their drive to suppress human liberty by the all-embracing phrase: “inevitable forces of history.” The tragedy begins when this “explanation,” or, better, justification, is allowed to pass by those whose duty it is to defend freedom at any price—by those who enjoy the advantages and privileges of a free democratic society. Students must be the one section of the society who will never succumb to defeatism—preached so widely to-day. They should divorce themselves from armchair philosophy of submission to “the inevitable forces of history.” History is made by man—therefore let men make it. But let these men know what history they want to make; let them be for something, and not only meekly and ineffectively against that which, they are told, must be their lot. Let those who are against Communism be for Freedom. There already exist Free Europe Societies, and societies which carry a different name, but which fight towards the same end, in some universities of this country. There are not enough of them. You may well ask—But how to start a society, how to organise a group of right-thinking men and women, when the student population is so constantly changing. You might say—The “life” of a student FREEDOM is too short to start something and to keep it going. Well, it is when there is no outside help from a permanent body, and it is not when this help is forthcoming. It has now been possible to develop such a source. The British League for European Freedom—a body with ten years’ uncompromising fight for freedom everywhere—has set up a student committee just for that purpose. All you have to do is write, and ask for help and advice. The address is: 66 Elizabeth Street, London, S.W.l. N.U.S. AND YOU (By an English Observer) The great lesson of the Easter Council of N.U.S. at Sheffield was given by the Communists, In the first place they succeeded in infiltrating their very own Orgburo chief as a full-blown “student” delegate, notwithstanding his having quit his college studies for some years. It all turned on the delegate from the Camberwell School of Arts, a certain Mr. Anthony Goss. His credentials were questioned and rejected by the Credentials Committee, but their recommendations were in their turn questioned and rejected by a bewildered Council, suitably fed with sentiments of student solidarity by the Comrades, the fellow-travellers and a group of genuine non-Party people inspired by (the highest motives, no matter how misguided. Council is a rapidly- changing body, so that few of the uninitiated were aware that Mr. Goss had been present at quite a number of the previous meetings; REPORT of the Executive Committee of the C.P. presented to the 23rd National Congress. National Student Committee: “The function of the Committee is to provide detailed guidance and assistance to the work of the Communist and Y.C.L. members in student Branches and groups acting within the framework of the general policy and campaigns of the Communist Party . . . Activity has reached a high level in the colleges in the last few months around events in British Guiana and Kenya . . . There has been an improvement in the period under review in the number of meetings and discussions held on ideological questions. The student press has carried a considerable amount of material on all aspects of our immediate and long-term policy. of those few it is doubtful whether more than a handful knew that it was in his comradely capacity as full-time secretary of the National Student Committee of the Communist Party, in other words as a one-hundred per cent aparatchik, looking after the Party’s interests first and foremost. To register for a part-time course at Camberwell and then to get himself nominated to N.U.S. Council has earned Comrade Goss and his fellow-activists the congratulations of all from Harry Pollitt downwards. Having won this first round of the battle, the Comrades at Council went on against virtually no organised opposition, culminating in the election to next year’s Executive of as mixed a bag as N.U.S. has seen for some years. By its constitution N.U.S. is an a-political body and successive Councils cling to that assumed a-politicism with religious fervour. It is all a mockery and a sham in practice.

Thousands of students on both sides of the Iron Curtain, in Britain as well as in Poland, prepare themselves for a new life—a life of dispensing that which had been given to them to absorb during their school, college and university education. Surely, there is no section of the student body that will eventually contribute to the well-being of their fellow men more than the medical. That is the view which we, living in free countries, take for granted. The doctor, whether he be a general practitioner or a well- known specialist, is regarded as one of the comparatively few people whose professional duty it is to help and protect the people who come to him for help and protection, regardless of any political or other pressure that may be put on him to act differently. This is so obvious that it may seem a waste of time even to mention it. It would have been—had not the all-powerful Communist governments on the other side of the Iron Curtain taken a diametrically opposed point of view. To us it is unthinkable that a doctor who has broken his Hippocratic Oath should be allowed to practice, and in any case we have the right to change our doctor if we have reasons to doubt his professional integrity. Not so under Communist rule. There, doctors have wo choice but to compromise their professional integrity—if they want to live, and perhaps survive. Most, if not yet all, physicians trained since the Communists came to power in Poland—and in the other countries behind the Iron Curtain—are first and foremost Communist Party members, whose primary duty is to fulfil their party obligations. The only oath they know they must keep, or else....is their party oath. Political reliability is the determining factor of a candidate’s qualifications for admittance to medical faculties. Once admitted, the student is then subjected to intensive indoctrination in Communist theory. A typical edict on this subject is the pronouncement made by the Polish Communist Minister of Higher Education — Adam Rapacki: "In the curriculum of studies in all academic schools special attention will be paid to ideological subjects.” We all know what this means generally. In the case of the medical student it also means special training in “military medicine.” What is more, medical students are not free to choose specialised branches of the profession according to their preferences— they must choose as the current Six- Year Plan stipulates that they choose. There is no question of being allowed to follow one’s vocation. The fact is, and the Communists do not hide it behind the Iron Curtain—although they are more than careful to hide it in countries of which they do not have the whip hand—that the medical services in the Sovietised countries have been transformed into subservient instruments of political power. To give but one example, and one could give hundreds. As State employees, it is the doctors’ function to further the industrial and military plans of the State. This compels them to consider their workmen - patients as economic factors, precious only to the extent that then- health relates to the fulfilment of the industrial plan. In the case of factory doctors—and neither they nor their workerpatients have any choice but to give and receive treatment in the surgery chosen for them by the State—it means that they are reduced to the role of factory accountants who predetermine the number of persons entitled to be ill in any given period. A worker is not ill when he thinks he is ill, nor even when the doctor thinks that he is ill. The doctor must obey his directives. This is what a Polish worker who has recently escaped from Poland has said on this subject:— “No person with less than the regulation minimum temperature of 38.5—101 degrees F—can be certified ill in Polish factories. What is more, temperature must match the nature of the complaint. “ The doctor is afraid to grant sick leave to too many persons, for if the statistics reveal that too many persons have been sick over a given period it will be taken to mean that the doctor has not been taking sufficient care of the workers’ health, But how can people be well if they are underfed, if they are badly clothed, if they are constantly afraid and nervous, and always have to fulfil short-term and long-term norms?” There are no “private” doctors in Poland, or in . the other countries behind the Iron Curtain. All must work in State clinics and surgeries, all must do what they are told to do. Should you question the sagacity of this arrangement, and say that it defeats its own end—as you doubtless will—you will have put your finger on something of even wider implications. You will have summed up in a neat nutshell the enigma of Soviet Communist practice—which defeats the end it professes to serve.... the well-being of the human race. [pageend2]POLISH PAGE 3 INDOCTRINATION, BRAINWASHING The Association of Polish Youth— the Polish Communist version of the Soviet komsomol—has started to publish a new weekly for youth, intended for older schoolchildren. The weekly, entitled “Around the World,” shows unmistakenly the real feeling prevailing among that age group despite continuous intensive indoctrination. They are eager to learn about the world around them, around the Iron Curtain which separates them from it, So far— apart from listening surreptitiously to "broadcasts in Polish from the free countries—they had no opportunity to find out more than was written for their edification in the official geography textbooks, and than they could glean from their elders' guarded remarks about the past. They had no liking for the various youth papers which they had—and still have, for that matter—to buy at school. They bought, but did not read. The Communist Association of Polish Youth has been strongly criticised for this by the highest party officials: they were told to capture the school reading-public. and SCANDAL Revelations about scandalous treatment of students at the Medical Academy at Szczecin have been recently allowed to slip through editorial censorship. The official organ of the Communist Association of Polish Students—run by trusted Communist Party members transferred to that sector of party activity—has published an account of their privations, blaming, of course, one or two scape-goats found on the spot. It transpires from the report that nearly 10 per cent of the Academy’s 1,500 students have had their applications for grants turned down for no apparent reason. Perhaps “turned down” is not the right word here—apparently their applications have not reached the appropriate “Around the World” first appeared at the beginning of January this year. It was full of quite good illustrations and stories. One of the stories was a complete translation of Edmund Hillary’s account of his Everest Expedition, as it was originally published in one of the illustrated London weeklies. There was hardly any propaganda. The Communist Association of Polish Youth succeeded in their alm: they captured all the reading public that could get the new weekly. Newspaper stands were crowded on Saturday mornings when “Around the World” was due to appear. People, from 10 to 70 years of age eagerly waited for copies to arrive, and circulation was very limited. Moreover, the weekly could not be subscribed to, nor was it available anywhere except in the large towns. In less than two hours the whole supply would be bought out. Now, after a few months, “Around the World” is still published, and still sold out every time, but there is gradually less and less propaganda-free reading matter in it. It was a trick from the beginning. authority, but on investigation it was shown that, again apparently, no such authority exists as far as they are concerned. The net result is such that the 150 students—mostly sons and daughters of peasants, let it be made clear —survive on soup and bread, while nobody has taken the trouble to find out where they live. It is also strongly implied in the report—though carefully not mentioned in so many words—that the students in question are not members either of any of the Communist organisations ruling the Academy or of the Communist Party itself. A case of victimisation which, in the light of the article on the opposite page, requires no comment. POETRY? As a consequence of the recent reorganisation of the Communist State apparatus in Poland, Boleslaw Bierut has ceased to be Prime Minister and is now general secretary of the Polish United/Communist/ Workers’ Party. Before being Prime Minister he was Poland’s President —and through all the nominal changes has remained Kremlin’s most trusted henchman. For nearly 10 years now pseans have been sung to his glory. Consistent with Soviet practice his birthday has. been and is the chief occasion for such outbursts of “spontaneous rendering of homage” to his sagacity, genius, et cetera, et cetera. His birthday falls in April. In the April issue of “Płomyk,” a children’s monthly published by the constitutionally atheistic “Children’s Welfare Society,” the following “poem” appeared with the advice that it be learnt by heart. Dedicated to Bierut, it runs:— For your great concern, For our houses and schools, Please accept from us Flowers and gay songs. Accept also good marks On our terminal reports— Our first victories; Progressive reports. You are not alone in your work On us you can always count; In schools there is growing Eager for action second shift. The monthly is intended for children up to 12 years of age. Its reading is compulsory in all preparatory and primary schools. [pageend3]4 POLISH PAGE A FATEFUL DECADE This article has been written by an English student. He wishes to remain anonymous as he does not want the article to represent his personal views only, but also the opinion of all English students for whom freedom means more than slavery. * * Ten years ago Hitler’s doom was sealed. The invasion of France, both from South and North, made certain of it. It was a fateful year, and no more fateful for other countries than for Poland. This year the Soviet government of Poland is celebrating “the tenth anniversary of the birth of the People’s Republic”—the tenth anniversary of Poland’s subjugation. One has only to read the sixth and last volume of Sir Winston Churchill’s War Memoirs to realise how fateful the year 1944 was for Poland. This is quite unblushingly admitted even by the present rulers of the country which was the first to withstand Hitler’s barbarian invasion. None other than Bolesław Bierut—Poland’s Soviet dictator—has admitted it in his speech to the Second Congress of the United Polish/Communist/Workers’ Party. He said: “Poland’s revolution would have not been possible but for the fact that she was liberated by the Soviet army in 1944.” To-day it does not need explaining what the words “revolution” and “liberation” mean in a context like this. In 1944 the fate of Poland was sealed. In 1944 Polish soldiers captured the impregnable German stronghold of Monte Cassino in Italy; but in 1944, also, about 250,000 Polish men, women and children died in the ruins of Warsaw while the Red Army stood by. Watching. In command of that army—now called the army of liberation by Bolesław Bierut—was Marshal and Hero of the Soviet Union, Constantin Rokossovsky, present commander-in-chief of Poland’s slave army. It was he, by the way, who, at the same congress at which Mr. Bierut paid his homage to the Red Army, said without the slightest tremor in his voice that while “the congress is of the greatest importance to your country it is of no less importance to our army.” Was it just a slip of the tongue? Ten years ago Poland paid the price of her tradition: a tradition of fighting for her freedom. It is seldom realised in this country that in fighting for her freedom—whether against the hordes of Genghis Khan, or against the Porte, or against the blood-drunk Bolshevik avalanche in 1920—Poland was also fighting for Western Europe. Her geographical position made it unavoidable. Spanning as she did, and does, the plateau between the Baltic Sea and the Carpathian Mountains she is the gate between the East and West in Europe. Even when in 1683 the Turks had circumvented this gate, and reached Vienna by a Southern route, it was * * * Poland’s army that turned them back, delivering the capital of the Austrian Empire. Yet it would be wrong to suppose that all that Poland has done for Europe was to save her from umpteen barbarian invasions, bringing ruin and slavery in their wake. Poland’s contribution to the progress of humanity has been manifold, and equal to her military tradition. Let a few facts suffice to substantiate this claim. It is not'often realised that of all the modern countries it was Poland who first experimented with Constitutional Monarchy. Historians tell us that it was her ruin. This may have been so, but the fact remains that she did, and that perhaps other, slower- developing nations learnt something from her mistakes, and therefore succeeded the better. It was a Pole, Nicholas Copernicus, who revolutionised the earth’s understanding of itself even before Galileo suffered for a similar attempt. And Copernicus was free to develop his theories, which “stopped the Sun and moved the Earth”, in Poland. It was a Pole, Marie Curie, her maiden name was Skłodowska, who discovered radium—probably the greatest medical discovery of the present century. There were other men and women who contributed to the development of science, per force of less importance than the two just mentioned. In music there was Chopin—and Paderewski his greatest exponent. Of particular importance to this country there was Joseph Conrad in the field of letters. It is not widely known that his real name was Korzeniowski, and that he never mastered the intricacies of English phonetics. One of the Poles who have won the Nobel Prize for literature was Henry Sienkiewicz— but he is to be judged by his own, and not by M.G.M.’s “Quo Vadis”. And so on. The reason for writing the above has not been an unbridled desire to pat the Poles on the back, and say how jolly good fellows they have been. The reason is different. Shortly, it is this. Poland has done her best for Europe, and perhaps it was more than her share. Such things can never be known. What is known, however, is that Poland—that is the 25-or-so millions of Poles living to-day under the Soviet yoke—wants, as she has always wanted, to contribute her share to Europe’s future. So do the other nations kept under Soviet rule. Let us hope that soon, and the sooner the better for them and for the rest of the world, their wish and ambition will be granted. [pageend4]CZECHOSLOVAK PAGE 5 UNIVERSITIES IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA On our pages we try to give you a mosaic picture of conditions under which students live in the countries under the Communist domination. We feel, however, that there is a need for a brief account of the whole situation, indicating the major stages of development and the main features of the present system. A few weeks ago the information service of Free Czechoslovakia, FCI, in its bulletin Features and News from Behind the Iron Curtain, supplied an article exactly fulfilling the above-mentioned requirements. To-day we bring you the first part of the article, which was written by an educationalist who recently escaped from Czechoslovakia. ORGANISÁTORY CHANGES SINCE 1948: The opening stage was a thorough purge of lecturers and students. The victims were those who according to the judgment of scrutiny commissions were, by reason of their political beliefs and class origin, not suited to lecture or study at Socialist universities. This step having been carried out—and its application did not exclude personal jealousies—the universities were rid of the elements deemed hostile to a people’s democracy. But their actual structure and curriculum remained unchanged. The Ministry of Education therefore ordered a new reform, to make Communist doctrine a regular part of university studies. At first Marx-Leninism was lectured in a limited number of departments of sociology. Then in 1951, by the decision of the Communist Party Executive, chairs of Marx- Leninism were established at every university, for political economy, dialectical and historical materialism. Shortage of lecturers proved a difficulty. Then came the first frontal attack on academic freedom. The Party desired that its exponents among the lecturers should have regular daily contact with all students, in order to exercise full control over their development. Since 1949 attendance at all lectures has been obligatory. Study circles of about 20 students were set up for tutorial purposes, five hours weekly being reserved for them. Those who expressed doubts about this collective study were accused of individualism and their political immaturity became the object of special attention. Attendance at lectures was made compulsory, but up to 1952 there were many ways of circumventing this regulation. Now, however, any absence of more than one hour must be explained in writing. Repeated absences may result in expulsion from the university. Terminal examinations are compulsory, and students who do not sit for them are considered as having failed, unless they offer a satisfactory explanation. In the case of failure, the terminal can be taken a second time. However, application must be made to the Ministry of Education in the case of a second failure; the whole session must be repeated and the student also loses his scholarship. All previous examinations must also be repeated. This reduces the universities to the level of the grammar schools, where the same ruling applies. ENTRY TO UNIVERSITIES: A fundamental condition for university entry is the successful completion of grammar school education or of the workers’ preparatory course, and a satisfactory cadre report from the officials there. Every candidate must undergo a cadre interview at the university, after which he is accepted, rejected, or directed to another branch of study. But that is only in theory. In practice the fate of each candidate is decided before his “cadre interview”. In one case, out of forty candidates, all academically qualified, only four were admitted. The reasons for rejection are easily found. Besides his political reliability, the class origin of the student is considered, and he must give every guarantee that he will remain faithful to the working-class and that the Communist Party will profit from his being raised to the intelligentsia of the people’s democratic Republic. THE EDUCATIONAL SYLLABUS has not been changed to the same extent in every faculty. It is obvious that technical subjects allowed of no fundamental reforms. The attempt to shape all natural and technical sciences along the dialectical materialist line was so poor in effect that it was unofficially abandoned. More brutal is the prostitution of humanitarian studies: law, philosophy, history, etc. Here Marx-Leninism has become the axis. In addition, in all faculties, including technical, the “foundations of Marx-Leninism” is compulsory reading and is, at least nominally, the main subject. It is interesting .to note that “the least politically conscious” students in particular show the greatest knowledge of this sub j act. This completely jeopardised the attempt to make the results of examinations in Marx-Leninism a measure of political reliability from the Communist point of view. According to “Rude Pravo”, “The greatest danger is the parrotlike exhibition of knowledge) and dogma foreign to the spirit of Marx-Leninism, which deprives it of its fighting and revolutionary core, leads to narrow mindedness and vulgarity of theory and strangles lively interest in studies ... That applies especially when lectures are delivered without internal conviction and theories are forced on students which the lecturers have not adopted as their own.” (Continued on Page 6) [pageend5]6 CZECHOSLOVAK PAGE PEACE IS WAR-WAR IS PEACE Voices the world over are crying for Peace. It could be fairly said, we think, that Communists shout more loudly and more persistently than anyone else, but it seems that their definition of “peace” was not taken from the Oxford Dictionary. It is not very often that one gets a chance to describe from their own press the situation they .call “peace”; however, one of the rare examples occurred in an issue of MLADA FRONTA, organ of the Czech Youth Organisation. Our British readers mav take a special interest in this article which deals with their own country. Once a week a page is devoted in MLADA FRONTA to the Youth of the Free world as seen by a “progressive” youth newspaper of that country. On 26th March, 1954, the newspaper published “CHALLENGE, .the Voice of Youth.” A whole page was covered by descriptions of a miserable standard of living of a great majority of the British youth, and details of the struggle for peace and freedom from capitalist chains led by its “progressive elements.” The matters mainly dealt with consisted of information about strikes which took place in various industries and great satisfaction was expressed because Labour joined the Communists against the Conservatives during some elections somewhere in Tyneside, and that the Liverpool Union of Students, by 200 votes to 75, defeated a motion advocating declaring the CP illegal in Great Britain. For our purpose the most important part was the greeting sent by the Challenge to. the youth of PLACING OF UNIVERSITY GRADUATES IN JOBS: In 1952 the Ministry of Education ordered that in future students must pledge themselves to work as directed by the Ministry under whose supervision they came (e.g. Ministry of Health, in the case of a medical student). Every student signs an "allocation card”, pledging himself to work for three years in a job allocated to him, before sitting his final examination. Anyone refusing to sign would not receive his final diploma. The introduction of “allocation cards” has not had harmonious results, There are frequent cases of graduates being sent to places where Czechoslovakia. The relevant part read: . . . "The main contribution of the British youth towards peace is to get military service in Great Britain shortened ... If we can obtain that, the plans of warmongers will be seriously affected...” We take it, therefore, that one of the points of the Communist platform is the shortening of the national service and cutting down of the re-armament programme of their country. If this is to be taken seriously as a way towards peace, one could expect a similar policy in the countries they dominate. But turning a. page of the same copy of MLADA FRONTA, we can see. (and it must be admitted—not surprisingly) another tune. One of the letters to the Editor which was given a prominent place says: “Behind the building of the Natural Sciences Faculty of the Brno University one can hear rifle shots and orders: ‘Six to the left! Aim more to your right!’ etc. On a firing range other comrades are they are not needed at all, or being given jobs for which their studies do not fit them. Their wages are in the region of 1,000 crowns a month: less than those of a skilled worker. In conclusion, it can be said that the planned “allocation” of students is most unpopular, not only with non-Communists, but also with Communists and Worker Graduates. Dissatisfaction with the university system is admitted not only in university circles, where the blame is often laid on the Ministry of Education, but also in public. The press, for instance, has referred to “dismay which often manifested as a result of many difficulties and overwork.” waiting for their turn. Each one of them, wants to contribute a lion’s share to the victory of his unit. C.S.M. (Organisation of Czech Yowth, ed.) together with D.S.O. Slavia (sport-club on Trade Union basis, ed.) of the Faculty of Natural Sciences announced a competition for the greatest number of holders of the PPOV Badge (Military Efficiency Badge, ed.) Signed: B. MATY AS, Faculty of Natural Sciences, Brno. This article speaks for itself. While young Britons are recommended to throw away their rifles and refuse to da their national service, younig men and women of the Iron Curtain countries learn to shoot, not only in the army, but also in their spare time and mass competitions are announced for university students. While the youth of Great Britain is asked to leave its country defenceless, weak and ‘without an army worthy of the name, their counterparts in Eastern Europe are ordered to build up not only a strong and well-organised army, but also to make civilians familiar with weapons of destruction. This “peace logic” has peculiar rules indeed. Of course, you need only to ask a Communist for a ready-made explanation. The British army is preparing for war While the Czech army is preparing to safeguard peace. In other words, to behave like a pacifist in Great Britain is the same as to behave like a sworn enemy of pacifism in Czechoslovakia. Those people in Britain who are against national service and try to disrupt the armament programme deserve a friendly pat on the back—they are fighting for peace. Those who might make the same demands in Czechoslovakia deserve a not so friendly nudge from an4 executioner — they are reactionary servants of decadent capitalism. Have you read George Orwell’s book “1984”? If not, it is worth your while for some telling examples of Communist “double talk” and “double moral.” [pageend6]CZECHOSLOVAK PAGE 7 ROAD TO FREEDOM It all started in Prague on October 3, 1953. Five young men entered a train bound for the border town of Chomutov. Their final destination, however, lay much further north—in the Western Zone of Berlin. Who were these men trying to quit the Communist paradise? Did they belong to the reactionary bourgeoisie or were they past collaborators with the Nazis? Neither, apparently—Vaclac Svejda was a farmer, Josef Janata a production manager in a nationalised industry, and the other three students: Ctirad and Josef Masin, aged 20 and 22 respectively, were studying engineering, and Milan Baumer, aged 21, was a cadet in a military college. In the evening they reached Chomutov, walked to the nearby border and hid themselves in the woods. That night the Russian Zone of Germany was reached without difficulty. The next five days were comparatively uneventful: during the day they slept under bridges, in the woods and in other places out of reach of people, marching at night. In this way, 110 kilometres were covered in five days and the town of Ries was reached. But it seemed to be clearly impossible to stand up to the physical strain much longer because their food consisted of fruit and potatoes found in the fields. Sometimes they ventured near farmhouses to try and find some food among the garbage. It was essential to travel faster. Furthermore, ffie bridges over the Elbe which had to be crossed were heavily guarded by security police and the best way to get across seemed to be by train. Clothing, watches and fountain pens were pawned and with the proceeds tickets to Elsterwerd were bought. Everything went on smoothly, but all five of them were prepared to use their revolvers in case of emergency. On reaching Ukrow, on October 10, the fugitives found that armed People’s Police were guarding the exit from the station and demanding documents from all travellers. In the ensuing gun-fight, four policemen were killed and the rest retreated into a station building. Four Czechoslovaks escaped into the fields, but Janata remained lying seriously wounded on the pavement. A few more days passed with the same routine. In all villages, posters had been put up promising a reward for their capture and giving descriptions. Security police in that area had been alerted and searches were going on vigorously. For a few days the wanted men hid in barns waiting for the excitement to subside a little. Forced again to move because they overheard two peasants talking, one of whom said he knew where they were and was going to inform the police the fugitives were now travelling through a wooded country with many lakes. Now they marched swiftly even during the day always trying to keep near the edge of the wood. One evening a car appeared unexpectedly behind them. At first the driver slowed down and then accelerated suddenly. A hail of bullets came from the car, but by this time the four shadows had long since disappeared behind the trees. The policemen did not dare to come out and the car turned round and drove off. During the next 15 minutes detachments of security police began to cordon off the wood without trying to penetrate it. Suddenly heavy police machine-guns, guided by searchlights, .opened fire to comb out the whole area. It was impossible to slip through the line of armed men surrounding the hiding place. The fugitives had to cling to the ground and hope for the best. They were immobilised for several hours before it was possible to penetrate deeper into the wood. An occasional bullet still whistled past and one of them wounded Svejda. He could not go on. His friends carried him and tried to zig-zag their way through. That was their only chance and they knew it, too. He ordered them to break through and leave him alone. We cannot describe what thoughts passed through all their minds. At last, just before the dawn the three remaining students managed to slip out of the trap. Intent on reaching the north where hope lay the survivors marched steadily ahead. Less than half an hour had passed when green-uniformed men appeared in the morning twilight. Furious fire from automatic weapons drove the students back into the woods. They were not far from complete physical exhaustion but their will triumphed over their bodies. It was hardly a consolation to learn much later on that a major of the security police was fatally wounded by his own men during the one-sided gun battle. The three survivors out of the five who struggled to freedom were in that district for five more days. The police seemed to be everywhere. In the end the fugitives managed to reach a railway line and hide themselves in a goods train going north through the area in which more police units were concentrated. In the fourth week of this Anabasis the town Zossen 40 km. from Berlin was reached. The three Czechoslovaks kept close to the railway line as a useful guide to freedom. At one point they met a police detachment, shots were exchanged and Baumer was wounded. The Masin brothers managed however to put all of them safely on buffers of an electric train slowly passing hy on its way to Berlin. During the journey another guard opened fire on them and again wounded Baumer. In the suburbs of Berlin the students staggered out and forced the first German they met to guide them to the border of the American zone. There they climbed under the barbed wire defences and had only enough strength to ask a man to inform the authorities. People in the West often ask the refugees if they still believe that their countries will be free again. The answer is "yes”, for there are still men behind the Iron Curtain willing to bring the greatest sacrifice for their freedom. [pageend7]8 N.U.S. and You Our Readers Write (Continued from Front Page) The objective facts of this situation are that the new Executive, which takes office in November, includes one Communist card-carrier and five open or implied fellow- travellers, out of an Executive of eleven. These five include two or perhaps three who may waver, but as things are at the moment, the so- called “progressives” hold the balance. The new Welsh Vice- President has still to be elected and, according to an article in the “Sunday Times,” the Communists have already made their preparations for this fight in the Welsh colleges. Such a landslide has not occurred since 1949. Let one thing be clear: the faults lie completely with the non-Commu- nists for letting the Party machine get away with it. The trouble lies in apathy among the Tories, among the Liberals (and among the liberals with a small “1”), together with an internal split in the ranks of the Labour students, a split which is being successfully exploited by the Communist-front Student Labour Federation. S.L.F. is now under the able direction of its new organiser, John Prime, fresh from his two-year ■course in agitprop and orgburo theory and practice in Prague, given under the guise of his work as permanent secretary of the International Union of Students. Lastly, of course, there was the re-affiliation of N.U.S. to the I.U.S., as a “fraternal member.” This success of the Party bloc was again attained against virtually no vocal opposition, because the pundits accepted it as inevitable after the last Council. Yet the. margin of the majority was extremely small—two votes on a show of hands and 50 votes on the final call-vote. One major college could have swung the decision the other way, for there were few abstentions. Thus, if Manchester Men’s Union—which is . . . The FREE EUROPE movement is everyday expanding and gathering strength One of the episodes oj this great process is the formation of FREE EUROPE SOCIETY at that extremely socialistic institution, the London School of Economics. The struggle to form this society has lasted over a year and the unreasonably long lapse of time is felt in some measure to cloak political bias against the aims of the society. The Constitution as accepted by the Union Constitutional Committee and the Union Council says, the Society’s first object is to investigate and ascertain whether any forms of tyranny exist in Europe today. The second object as laid down is to inform the public and the L.S.E. Union in particular of the extent of this tyranny. This we hope will be done to increasing effect. The first appearance at L.S.E. of the paper “Free Europe!” caused some concern to certain students, for example, the Socialist Society notice-board exclaimed: “STUDENTS BEWARE! ” “Extreme right-wing propaganda emanating from the emigre Hungarian, Czech and Polish groups in London is being circulated amongst you under the guise of a democratic plea. The 'Governments that represented these ‘democrats’ before the war were never democratic in the British or American tradition, but oligarchical in the extreme!” Generally Communist propaganda solidly anti-I.U.S.—had not decided to disaffiliate and instead had come along and voted, then the decision would have been the other way. This is just one reason why the anti- I.U.S. unions should not—repeat not —quit the N.U.S. on this issue, but should stay in and fight it out, while they are still able to do so. If they leave, then the door is wide open to Comrade Goss and his colleagues, condemns British and American democracy as “the tool of bourgeois domination” or some similar sentiment, so what does “British or American tradition" mean here? Are we after all to understand that the western democracies are true “peoples’ democracies”? Senator McCarthy is no friend of the Socialist Society, delving, as he does, into past history to find the vaguest hint. of suspicious inclinations, but here the Socialist (alias Communist) Society has adopted his methods. Surely, if the members of the emigre groups believed in any form of “oligarchical government,” instead of being with us today, they would have taken their place within the Communist cliques oj their respective countries. LAWRENCE J HARLATT, Free Europe Society, L.S.E., London. Dear Sir, As a member of the Oxford University “Free Europe Society;’ I have long looked at the Communist inspired Student magazines which appear in my J.C.R. with considerable amusement and disgust, so I was very pleased when I saw a magazine which told the truth. I would like to subscribe to it—could you please give me details. I will try to publicise it among the members of our society. Yours sincerely, MISS J. A. WATSON, Tipton, Staffs. and N.U.S. will go back 10 years in history, to a period when it well- deser.ved the title given it—the title of the Red Union.
