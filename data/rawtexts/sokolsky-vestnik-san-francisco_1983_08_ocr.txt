Thank you Joe Jaki, Camp Director for a well organized camp! Thank you Helen Jaki, Camp Kitchen Director for well planned and prepared menus, and for a well fed campl Thanks to all the cooks, councilors, helpers and to all 60+ children who made this 1983 Sokol Camp the biggest .ever! With the unusual weather we've had this year, we found it necessary to delay the swimming sessions. The creek ran high and extremely cold. But by the end of the week, the children were able to go down the famous "Dinkey Creek Rock Slides". We hiked the areas surrounding the camp and studied various plants, rocks, etc. The youngest group known around camp'as the "Owls" made pictures of their impressions of their hike. They illustrated the snow flowers, the trees, the animals, and the lumber camp. Once again, clay sculpture was very popular. Running a close second were the friendship pins. As always, painting and coloring were popular, and some of the children made "pets" to surprise their parents: porcupines, owls, and pet rocks. Our groups consisting of the Owls, Beavers, and Eagles enjoyed games, horseback riding, hikes, swimming, etc. to fill the days. The campfire, singing, night games, and flashlight hikes completed the evening activities. There was always sometime set aside for barracks cleaning and showers, though councilors were not always sure this time was used efficiently for those purposes. Saturday we found ourselves either being entertained or doing the entertaining with our final night of skits, songs, and awarding of certificates. Concluding the evening with a party and dance for the Beavers and Eagles. Sunday morning, the morning of departure, once again was a day for shedding tears with our fond farewells of "See ya next year, I hope." "Maybe before next year." I CERTAINLY HOPE SO!!!!!

[pageend2]September, 1983__________ Sokol San Francisco Vestnik__________ Strana-Page 3 HISTORY - Continued from last month - The triumph of Czech might which reached the cu 1 md n^tl ng point October 28, 1918, would not have been possible if Tyrš nad not prepared the people, and if his idea had not penetrated the entire nation. For fiftytwo years his thoughts kneaded the Czech people, shaping their bodies and souls with a persistent untiring everyday work in the gymnasia. It taught the people perseverance and gave them the will to overcome weaknesses and multiply the strengths and abilities of their bodies. It taught further the need to strive earnestly to overcome all obstacles, to aim the highest goal, to merge the individual strengths into mighty strength of the whole, and finally to project all the strengths, all the abilities and all the efforts towards the success of the highest entity ... the nation. It influenced the love of freedom and the will to win this for the nation. Out of the rank-? of "Yrs• approtices, believers and apostles, grew the warriors who s tood up at the right moment and with their enthusiasm, devotion, discipline and veracity drew together the entire nation. The history of the Czech revolt during the first World War was basically history of the Sokol. After the liberation of Slovakia the Sokol brothers returned to their occupations, their families and to their Sokol gymnasia. Dr. Scheiner, who had been the general inspector of Czechoslovakia’s armed forces during the most difficult period, returned to his law office. In the same manner all the Sokols returned to their original occupations, irrespective of whether they were common rank and file soldiers or leaders, and they did this without the least claim for reward or military decoration. Only Jin- dra Vaniček remained in the Ministry of National Defense, with the assigned function of organizing the physical training in the army. This of course was not a reward but further service for which no man was more competent and better qualified. The Sokols as a whole joined hands with other gymnastic nrganizeti one as equals among equals without any special privileges or advantages. And that’s how good it was. Because service to the nation the way it was taught by Tyrs and the generation he had brought up, meant to want nothing and to give everything. Shortly after the war, voices began to be heard, claiming that the Sokols with their participation in the liberation had fulfilled their role and that their further role had become nn- necessary. But the Sokols insisted that their role was not and never would be ended. The Sokol training and the qualities it implants are needed by the nation in times of peace as well as in war. After attaining freedom there is the need for raeducating a rebellious nation into a loyal pro State nation. For it is not sufficient to win freedom by fighting for it but to preserve and use it wisely. The development of events that followed soon confirmed the correctness of this view. Conditions in the Republic were far from idyllic. It was not only the legionnaires who returned to their homes, but also the communists trained by the Russian Bolshevik revolution with their plans for Bolshevism in the young state. In this they were aided by the initial difficulties facing the government, which could not create order out of chaos in one day. Furthermore there were the Continued next page [pageend3]September, 1983__________ Sokol Saň" Francisco Věstník__________ Strana - Page 4 History - continued from previous /?age problems of providing food and essentials in a country exhausted and depleted by war. The communists eagerly fed the people's dissatisfaction with the slow pace of improvement as they kept harassing and inciting the workers, and organized frequent demonstrations and marches, during which they carried terrifying gallows. It was under such conditions that the Sokols were making preparations for their Seventh Slet, the first in their liberated country, The government favored the Slet because it saw in it a way out of post-war psychosis and disorganization, Who di ri not favor the Slet were the communists for the very same reasons. They threatened to make the Slet impossible. They cast among the people the motto, "The Slet will starve out Prague," and this did have its affect upon some levels of the populace. Under this pressure of unrest thus brought about, the government called for a meeting with the Slet leadership, in course of which individual ministers declared the Slet was wholly impossible. The mi nd star of transportation explained that because of lack of railroad cars, locomotives and transportation personnel, it would not be possible to bring to Prague the anticipated crowds or visitors. The minister of nourishment and food supplies brought forth the impossibility of supplying Prague with enough food necessary for such multitudes or visitors. And so on. After this the Sokol "ministers" gave thoir reports. The chairman of the transportation committee presented a detailed report as to where in what railroad yards could be found the exact number of locomotives and railroad cars that could be repaired in time by qualified Sokol railmen who would do so in their free time at no cost. He presented further detailed plan for the transportation needs during the festive days, to be carried out again by Sokol-railmen as a voluntary service during special shifts. The chairman of the committee on foods eind supplies brought forth listing of all the food gifts that had been pledged by the Sokol districts in various agricultural areas, as well as the Sokols of the USA, and that exceeded by far the anticipated need. He declared before the session that the Sokols themselves would feed and provide for the Slet participants, and in addition to that would donate considerable food portions to the city's kitchens serving the poor. All the Sokols asked of the government was the temporary use of the army's portable kitchens. When presented with this well thought out plan, the government readily capitulated. Thus the plans were actually carried out as projected. All transportation problems moved along smoothly and the Slet did not starve out Prague as feared, but actually fed the city during the entire Slet. But before the Slet could actually be realized, the Prague Sokols had to face the communist threat to do everything to prevent the holding of the Slet. There was genuine fear that the fanatic communists might undercut the columns supporting the grand stands or even set them afire. That is why Sokol members of the Prague Units guarded the construction site from the very beginning, stood guard all through the nights, and thus protected it from any wrong doing.

One day, a stranger appeared at one of their parties. He was dressed in a curious frock coat, was soft spoken and courteous. He danced with a few girls and then left early. After his departure, a brawl flared up in the saloon —a very unusual occurrence among the Podskalí folk who always lived happily together. One of the older raftsmen realized what had happened and told the others. The unknown guest was a river goblin and out of mischief had slipped some "brawl spice" into the men's drinks. He lived in the river under the Vyšehrad Rock and had done alot of harm to fishermen and raftsmen —sinking their rafts and tangling their nets. Many had drowned because of him. Trying to figure out how to revenge themselves on the goblin, they recalled that according to river lore, he derived his powers from the dripping tails of his frock coat. So, when he appeared at the next dancing party, one of the raftsmen took a pair of shears and cut off the miraculous part of the goblin’s coat. He fled, but deprived of his powers, he couldn't return to the water and had to make an honest living by his own tw o hands on dry land.
