[pageend6]5 THE SECOND ECHELON by Francoise Thom Francoise Thom is a French scholar and journalist who writes frequently about Soviet affairs. The upheaval of August 1991 was the result of a long process that first became evident in 1988. At that time, Moscow began to encourage the growth of national movements in the republics and adopted a new attitude towards its Eastern European satellites. Moscow's imperial policies have gradually become an extension of the politics of European unification. It is widely believed that the “common European home” cannot be built without a complete overhaul of the Soviet Union's imperial structure. Since the 1970s, the KGB and the officials of the military-industrial complex have been aware that the territorial organization of the USSR is obsolete and that structural reform of the Soviet empire is unavoidable. But the top political leadership, mired in the inertia of the Soviet political system, was oblivious to new ideas from the lower levels of the political hierarchy. Only when the top leaders finally understood the magnitude of the economic crisis did they begin to listen to the advice of others. They decided that pan-European integration would be their primary objective. The leadership realized, though, that integration could only take place if radical changes occurred in the political systems of both the East and the West that would narrow the differences between them. How could the Kremlin achieve this objective and at the same time extend its influence in Europe? Establishing popular fronts was the answer. In his speech to the plenum of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in February i990, Eduard Shevardnadze declared that the Soviet Union's greatest post-war foreign policy error was to disband the popular fronts in Eastern Europe. Those fronts, created by the communists shortly after World War 11, were alliances of communists, socialists, and center-left parties. Usually the [pageend7]6 UN CAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 communists controlled the key ministries: defense, internal affairs, and foreign affairs. The popular fronts were instruments for introducing communist rule. Shevardnadze is perfectly right to say that the Soviets made a mistake in getting rid of them and allowing the communists to act openly. This led to a Western backlash and the creation of NATO. Had the East European communists continued to act behind the scenes instead of flaunting their power, Moscow could have gained a strong position in Western Europe; popular fronts, we should not forget, existed in France, Italy, and Belgium until 1947. But Stalin's passion for total control led to the division of Europe, and Moscow's dream of achieving pan-European hegemony had to be set aside. Shevardnadze and his team, which includes, among others, Aleksander Yakovlev and Stanislav Shatalin, set out to change this state of affairs. Their task was enormous and risky. It required, first of all, the replacement of the entire Soviet political elite. The old communist party had to disappear and give way to the second echelon. Leninism had lost its authority, so the Soviet imperial structure needed a new source of legitimacy. Without “democratic” legitimacy for the Soviet empire, the common European home could not be built. Gorbachev, a member of the first echelon, did not understand what needed to be done. Shevardnadze and his team started by persuading Gorbachev that the leaders at the empire's periphery — inherited from the Brezhnev era — should be replaced by more dynamic and respectable officials. The men of the second echelon, in other words, portrayed the first step in their bid for power as a purge, and the first echelon accepted it as such. But in the empire's outer reaches, in Eastern Europe, attempts to modernize the old regime failed. The leaders of the second echelon — the likes of Krenz, Gysi, and Modrow — were rapidly swept away. Only in Romania did the Kremlin's maneuvers meet with success, possibly because of the valuable lessons learned from failed efforts elsewhere. In Romania, a “true” revolution was orchestrated, complete with bloodshed and dramatic events, and widely reported by the Western mass media. This pseudo-revolution secured the second echelon's hold on power. In the Soviet republics, the second echelon took over without much difficulty. Lithuania was the exception: the communist Algirdas Brazauskas, a late convert to national Bolshevism, lost the presidential election to Vytautas Landsbergis. Estonia, on the other hand, followed the Romanian scenario. Communist prime minister Edgar Savisaar's authority was strengthened following a “coup attempt” on May 15 by local Russian organizations and the military. The attempt was “foiled” when thousands of Tallinn residents, responding to Savisaar's appeal, came to defend the parliament. Nevertheless, the popular fronts' leaders constantly had to adapt to the increasingly radical demands of its rank and file membership for fear of revealing their true nature. Once the second echelon was securely in place in the republics, it was time to replace the first echelon at the center. The first attempt to do so was [pageend8]THE SECOND ECHELON 7 the Shatalin plan for economic reform. At this point, Gorbachev finally realized the implications of the policies he had been advised to pursue. This explains his about-face in September 1990, when he peremptorily rejected the Shatalin plan and embarked on a campaign to dislodge the second echelon from its newly gained positions in the republics. This campaign included attempts to destabilize the Baltic republics, the events in Vilnius in January 1991, and the dismissal of the leader of the second echelon in Lithuania, Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene. Paradoxically, Gorbachev's desperate efforts to put an end to the process he himself had set in motion convinced him that there could be no return to the status quo ante and that it was better to use cunning for the time being. Gorbachev's about-face had the effect of consolidating the second echelon at the center, whose leading representatives responded to Gorbachev by forming the Movement for Democratic Reforms. Gorbachev realized that the balance of forces was no longer in his favor, and thus he was forced to negotiate with the second echelon. Who belongs to the second echelon? There have always been two tendencies within the Soviet political elite. One favors control, the other prefers influence. These tendencies have been in constant conflict, a conflict that the West has misrepresented as a contest between “conservatives” and “reformers.” Under Stalin and Brezhnev, control was the preferred method. The advent of perestroika signaled the beginning of the end for advocates of control: influence became decisive. This change was first manifested in foreign policy. The Soviets gave up control of their Eastern European satellites in the expectation of wielding substantial influence in the soon-to-be constructed “common European home. ” On the domestic political front, however, the second echelon faced much stiffer resistance. It managed to supplant the first echelon only after staging last August's pseudo-coup. These two tendencies — control and influence — are intrinsically Leninist. Lenin tends to be associated above all with the iron discipline and the desire for total control of the Bolshevik party. But it was also during his rule that the policy of influencing the international community through disinformation and other meanss such as the infiltration of churches and émigré circles, was initiated. The neo-Bolsheviks of the second echelon are attempting to mobilize the masses by manipulating the Soviet public's two dominant passions: anticommunism and nationalism. These passions, which have the potential to destroy the state, must either be neutralized or channeled towards constructive ends. The second echelon advocates the “controlled dismantling of the USSR” and the creation of “horizontal intrastate structures.” It frightens the West by raising the specter of the Soviet nuclear arsenal falling under the control of “nationalists.” To overcome the economic crisis, the second echelon has called for “freezing the political dimension” of conflicts within and between the republics. That was a premise of the Shatalin plan. The members of the [pageend9]8 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 second echelon are still Marxists at heart and remain convinced that economic realities will determine the political superstructure. In the meantime, they are attempting to create a unified all-Union opposition movement that, once in power, will be in charge of preserving the federation in a modernized form. The revival of the “anti-fascist coalition” of the war years — that is, the original popular fronts -- has been one of the declared objectives of Soviet foreign policy since Shevardnadze's tenure as foreign minister. This coalition was a highly effective vehicle for Soviet influence throughout Europe. During the August pseudo-coup, Shevardnadze and Yakovlev called on the international community to defend Russian democracy against “dictatorship.” “Unity has been achieved,” Shevardnadze was happy to proclaim after the failure of the coup. “The movement for Russian democracy, together with other democratic movements, presented a united front...” Thanks to the coup, the re-creation of the “anti-dictatorship coalition” progressed markedly both within the USSR and internationally. In economic policy, the second echelon favors what is called “nomenklatura privatization,” that is, the transfer of party and state property to more or less fictitious associations and private companies in order to ensure the nomenklatura's power long after the party'disappears. The second echelon also calls for the creation of free-trade zones. These zones would give unlimited power to the nomenklatura of the regions where they are set up. Contrary to appearances, these free-trade zones would stand as obstacles to the restoration of the republics' independence. If the Baltic countries become the Soviet Hong Kong —- as representatives of the second echelon there have been proposing — they would be rendered politically insignificant. The rallying point of the second echelon is the Yavlinsky economic plan. The second echelon claims to prize competence above all else in recruiting officials. The nomenklatura has thus maintained its hold on positions of authority, as only its members can claim the necessary managerial experience. The second echelon portrays itself as a centrist force, opposed to extremism of all varieties and committed to social peace and consensus. It poses as the champion of human rights, which it says are threatened by radical anticommunists. The second echelon is also systematically attempting to reinforce executive power at the expense of legislative bodies at every political level. It advocates appointing prefects and governors to replace the party officials who hold sway over local and regional government; in practice, however, these officials are often recruited from the old nomenklatura. In military matters, the second echelon supports the privatization of the military-industrial complex. Privatization will provide the Soviet military sector with the credits and technology it so urgently needs. China, let us not forget, rebuilt its military industry in the early 1980s after a similar transformation. The “new thinking” in Soviet foreign policy, particularly towards Europe, fits in with the policy of encouraging and manipulating popular fronts. The [pageend10]THE SECOND ECHELON 9 Soviets are appealing to the international community for an end to ideological conflicts and for a new era of cooperation in confronting the great dangers threatening all of humanity. Their new thinking is more than mere propaganda: it is a concerted attempt to transform the institutions of democratic states into popular front-style organizations. The new thinking eradicates pluralism by imposing a consensus that cannot be opposed. In the jargon of perestroika, the word “confrontation” has extremely negative connotations. But confrontation actually means “differentiation,” and differentiation is the essence of political life. The new thinking is thus the ultimate stage of the revolutionary nihilism which made the USSR what it is today. It is a danger to the free world. A “common European home” built on the principles of the new thinking would be neither free nor democratic. Former Soviet republics governed by the second echelon, which is the case everywhere but Lithuania, will be only formally •independent. Their break with Moscow signals a return to the 1920s, that is, to the reestablishment of a Soviet federation open to all nations, especially the nations of Europe. The pseudo-independence of the former Soviet republics is the beginning of the creation of a pan-European federation, the long-held dream of the socialists. Once the first echelon is completely eliminated, only one obstacle will stand in the way of the implementation of this grand plan — namely, the resurgence of Russian nationalism. Yeltsin is not part of the second echelon. But without the backing of people like Shevardnadze and Yakovlev, he would never have risen to prominence so rapidly. Yeltsin is surrounded by members of the second echelon, and he has often carried out its policies. Nonetheless, he is not controlled by it. Eventually, though, the demands of Russian nationalism will come into conflict with the basically Leninist policies of the second echelon. Will Yeltsin manage to navigate between these opposing forces? Will he keep Russian nationalism in check after having exploited it, or will he sacrifice the “common European home” to satisfy long-repressed Russian national aspirations? The months to come will bring answers to these questions. [pageend11]Fortunately, you can get the tool for intelligent thought delivered straight to your door—and at a 33% savings.

Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk, and Boris Shushkevich — the elected leaders of Russia, Ukraine, and Byelorussia — declared that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics had ceased to exist as a legally constituted subject of international law. The denouement of the “Second Russian Revolution” lasted a long time for politicians, pundits, and journalists, but it was quite short in historical terms. In the three months after the August coup attempt, almost all political power had shifted to the offices of the Russian Republic or to the other republics (a process which had in fact begun well before the August putsch). It took only a declaration to state the obvious: that the USSR “was no more.” Even so, the inevitable was challenged. The non-Slavic republics waited a week or so before deciding to join the new “international space,” the Commonwealth of Independent States; two weeks went by before the Congress of People's Deputies disbanded itself; the symbol of the Soviet state, the hammer- and-sickle flag, wasn't lowered for the final time from above the Kremlin until December 25; and only on December 28 did the irrelevant (unelectéd) political figure of Mikhail Gorbachev hold his parting reception for foreign journalists. Lost among these dates was the tenth anniversary of the declaration by General Wojciech Jaruzelski of a state of war — stan wojenny — in Poland on December 13, 1981. (As usual with things communist, the widely-accepted English translation, martial law, doesn't fully convey the meaning.) This anniversary, though it went by largely unnoticed, marks a key date in the demise of communism as important as any of the recent milestones. No one could have believed that ten years later... “No one” — this was the established term in public discourse for those who did not think that communism could be opposed; who thought it was a permanent fixture of the international order; who did not foresee communism's collapse. [pageend13]12 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-9 2 In the analysis at the time, there was a certain resignation to the inevitability of stan wojenny. After all, the use of military force was thought to be necessary to “restore order” in the most populous and geopolitically important of the Soviet client states. Though most people in the West sympathized with the brave workers and intellectuals of Solidarity, everyone knew it couldn't last. An opposition movement counting most of the working population as supporters could not be tolerated by the Soviets, nor by the Polish communists. The Leninist state, by its very nature, did not allow for an organized opposition. Thus the resignation, and even relief, when “the Poles” (i.e. the police and armed forces of the Polish communist party-state) took care of business themselves. If Jamzelski didn't do it, then the Soviets would have, and that would have been a lot bloodier... Then-secretary of state Alexander Haig admitted that this line of reasoning was the basis of US foreign policy at the time. Leszek Kolakowski, the renowned philosopher, dubbed this the doctrine of “the hangman you know is better than the hangman you don't.” Of course, the West protested the repression of Solidarity, the internment of 10,000 people, the murder of striking coal miners, and the display of force and totalitarian power. Sanctions, some of them quite severe, were imposed. Yet, the most striking feature of Western policy toward the East Bloc was the treatment of Solidarity as an anti-communist antiquity. The great social movement had expired, never to be resuscitated. Solidarity became another Hungarian Revolution or Prague Spring. Public sermons commemorating it were tolerated; token amounts of aid to the peaceful underground were appropriated. Nonetheless, the “restoration of the legal status of Solidarity” was quietly dropped as a requirement for the lifting of sanctions. The lesson of Solidarity was that mass opposition to communist rule was useless, and thus foolhardy. This was what the realists said. But the realists' position seemed odd to all those who believed it was moral and realistic to organize opposition to communism and to support efforts to do so from the West. For those engaged in the effort it was clear that the goal of stan wojenny — to destroy Solidarity — had failed, and that Solidarity, though forced underground, was alive and still struggling. What this meant was that a new stage in the history of the communist bloc had been entered. Previously, each time force was used to put down mass opposition — in East Germany in 1953, Hungary in 1956, and Czechoslovakia in 1968 — the goal of the repression was achieved: the opposition was wiped out, the populace was bullied into submission, and no more than a handful of people were left to keep the flame of resistance flickering. Yet, in Poland, this goal was not attained. A mass opposition movement sustained a direct attack and managed to survive in an organized form. Three conclusions could be drawn from the survival of Solidarity. First, that the communist regime in Poland had weakened. Second, that the Soviet regime itself had weakened, because it had abjured from invading. Third, that [pageend14]TEN YEARS LATER 13 granting support to Solidarity would be an effective means of further weakening both the vulnerable Polish regime and its Soviet sponsor. The ultimate goal in the effort to organize opposition was clear: the overthrow of communism. In polite society, both here and behind the Iron Curtain, these things were not put in such crude terms. The tactics to be used toward this end were subject to debate. But there was little argument ip the underground Polish press over the ultimate aim of opposition. What would follow the overthrow of communism was unclear. Some advocated a ‘ ‘third way” between communism and capitalism, others a Hayekian version of the free market; some looked forward to Swedish-style social democracy, others Christian democracy. Most people in the opposition simply wanted democracy and a free, as opposed to a centrally-controlled, market. The vision of what should succeed communism was often reflected in the choice of tactics. Many of those who favored the “third way” advocated an alliance with reform communists; Christian democrats and supporters of national movements usually opposed talks with even the most reform-minded in the communist party-state. But just as everyone agreed that communism should ultimately be overthrown, they also agreed that it could not be successfully reformed. The system had to be /raniformed. Whether by evolution or revolution, it had to be scrapped in favor of a Western-style democratic order. A few years later, this unanimity in opposition thinking was achieved in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and East Germany; in Romania and Bulgaria; in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia; and in the other republics of the Soviet Union, including Russia. Of course, the first period of Solidarity's legal existence, from August 1980 to December 1981, also had its lessons for the ultimate demise of communism. The strategy of the union at that time — which was occasionally imposed upon it by its leader, Lech Walesa — was to “deal” with the regime: to make accommodations with it so as to allow Solidarity to survive. In those days, such a strategy was not unreasonable. Yet following this strategy led to avdead end. After waiting 15 months, the regime made clear how it had been planning to “deal” with Solidarity the whole time. In so doing, it ended the debate on the subject of the reformability of communism. In every country of the Soviet empire, the opposition — that is, all those willing to risk arrest, economic and social retribution, and physical harm — would learn a similar lesson. In Hungary, the opposition was grateful for a head start in economic reform. But in the end, not even the advocates of the “third way” considered Kadarism or even Poszgayism acceptable. In Czechoslovakia, there was an implosion so swift as to make the question of reform- ability a moot point. Nevertheless, anyone who talked with opposition figures before 1989 knew that this question was already settled. In Bulgaria, the opposition would accept neither Mladenov nor Lyukanov; in Romania, the opposition rejects both Roman and Iliescu. In the republics of the Soviet Union, the democratic opposition has sought the end of the system and independence. [pageend15]14 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 In the Soviet Union, just as in Central and Eastern Europe, once the threat of the use of force against the opposition was perceived to be hollow, the opposition undertook the necessary steps to put an end to the communist system. Indeed, after the August putsch, there really was no question as to whether there would be a “center” and a new “union.” The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, its party-state apparatus, its attendant central ministries, its state institutions, its symbols and flags — all of these were nothing but a concoction of the Bolsheviks. The mammoth centralized system that imprisoned so many different peoples was the result of treatises by Lenin and Stalin on the “nationalities question” which had little to do with reality. The opposition had long been aware of this. In the West, the debate over the collapse of communism has generally gone little further than chalking it all up to Gorbachev, who purportedly brought about democratic reforms, liberated Eastern Europe, and introduced the free market. “One of the Greatest Figures of the Twentieth Century,” a Washington Post headline trumpeted as the great twentieth-century figure himself was being unceremoniously kicked out of his office by Boris Yeltsin. In the former communist world, Gorbachev is given some credit for not using force against the organized opposition and for recognizing that something had to be done. But mostly, he is seen as irrelevant or reviled as the last communist, the man who still believed that “the people” wanted “socialism.” What brought about communism's collapse was neither the workings of impersonal historical forces nor the efforts of a single man; rather, it was the combined actions of Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Germans, Hungarians, Bulgarians (and soon Romanians), Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians, Ukrainians, Russians, Byelorussians, Armenians, Azeris, Georgians, Crimean Tatars, Kazakhs, Uzbeks, all the other Central Asian and Siberian peoples of the former Soviet Union, and Mongolians; of Jews, Christians (of all denominations), Muslims (both Sunni and Shiite), and atheists; of intellectuals and workers; of old and young — in short, of all the “no ones” who believed that communism had to be put to an end, just as fascism had to be put to an end. Certainly, historical trends — such as the advance of technology and communication in the West, the worldwide drive for democracy, the inability of the communist system to adapt (either economically or politically) to changing circumstances — were at work. And no doubt there were individuals from the communist hierarchy who had a hand in what happened — if only because their reforms in the face of collapse helped unleash democratic forces which they eventually could not control. More credit should be given to people like Yeltsin, who turned away from the system and then led the people to the final victory against it. But in the last analysis, the collapse of communism was brought about by the people themselves, who rose up after decades of fear and degradation to say “Enough.” These are the lessons of stan wojenny. Who would have believed them ten years ago? No one. [pageend16]IS POLICE AGENTS IN THE TRANSITION PERIOD by Józef Darski Józef Darski is a Polish journalist and a frequent contributor to Uncaptive Minds. Secret collaborators of the political police can be divided into two categories *: those who signed a formal declaration of collaboration; and those who “weren't formally secret collaborators, but with whom operational contact was maintained continually or periodically.” * There is another category of people who play a role that comes close to that of the informal collaborators: namely, those who believe that the communist system cannot be transformed without the cooperation of at least part of the communist power apparatus — i.e. the KGB and the army. For example, a Solidarity leader, Andrzej Celirtski, stated back in 1987 that though the party apparatus was against reform, “the police and the army may be more interested in it.” In other words, they were potential negotiating partners for the moderate opposition. Two years later, negotiations between the police and the moderate opposition did in fact take place in Poland, eventually resulting in the now famous round-table talks. Joachim Gauck, the man assigned the task of investigating the Stasi files by the German government, explained that political police forces of the East European countries “formed a single system, which operated under the name SOUD — Interlinked System for Recognizing Enemies. Its headquarters were in Moscow. Information concerning anything that qualified as a threat to the system was sent there and investigated. Particular cases were analyzed and appropriate tactics were devised for them. It was enough for someone to be considered — only potentially —■■ an opponent of the system, and the appro[pageend17]16 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 . priate actions were initiated: he was put under surveillance and information was collected on him. A foreigner who appeared in the former German Democratic Republic was put through the process by the Stasi, and his case would end up in headquarters in Moscow. With the exception of the Romanian service all the security services that belonged to SOUD had access to this information.” So-called advisors from the KGB supervised and directed the work of local security structures. A report of the Committee on Defense and Security in the Slovak parliament confirmed this: “Until November 1989, the links between the structures of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, and the KGB were virtually organic. The former administrators of the interior ministry and the thirteenth department of the central committee received orders, in matters of security, directly from the seat of the KGB in Prague.” In all probability, this procedure was the norm in the other satellite states, with the exception of Romania. It is thus reasonable to conclude that the security services of the former socialist countries were simply local branches of the KGB. In November 1990, the Polish parliament formed a special subcommittee to investigate the former WSW [military counterintelligence]. In February 1991, Janusz Okrzesik, chairman of the subcommittee, revealed that “the destruction of military and police documents of the special services began throughout the Eastern Bloc more or less at the same time. One may surmise that in general this operation was supervised by the KGB. According to information at our disposal, these documents were microfilmed before they were destroyed. There are many indications that they could be outside the country. The existence of a complete archive of the WSW to which we have no access cannot be ruled out. Among other things, this archive could contain the files of all informers of the WSW.” In an interview given to the Polish section of Radio Free Europe two weeks later, Okrzesik stated that the microfilms were in the Soviet Union, although he remarked that he couldn't prove this. Let's take a closer look at the situation in each of the former socialist countries. Poland The group of oppositionists who concluded the round-table agreements with the police apparatus [the communist government's negotiating team was led by Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak] in early 1989 and who, as a result of those agreements, took power later that year, has been decidedly opposed to the dismissal of former secret collaborators and even known KGB agents. Nonetheless, the politicians from Solidarity have not been entirely consistent. When they realized that Stanislaw Tymiňski was a dangerous rival to [pageend18]POLICE AGENTS 17 Tadeusz Mazowiecki and Lech Walesa in the presidential elections, Interior Minister Krzysztof Kozlowski threatened to publish what he said were very compromising materials on the upstart. Soon thereafter, he declared that Tyminski had traveled to Poland via Libya, which was the same as accusing him of collaborating with the KGB. After Tyminski lost the election, it turned out that “a computer error” had wrongly placed him in Libya, and that he in fact had no connection to that country. In the autumn of 1990, Józef Szaniawski, a reputable journalist, handed Walesa a list of 19 officers of the former security police and WSW who had collaborated with the KGB. The Solidarity politicians reacted immediately. The minister of national defense requested the prosecutor general to ‘‘protect the names of the many officers of whom it is not completely certain whether they worked or are working for Soviet intelligence.” The deputy prosecutor general admitted that “there is no doubt that KGB agents operated and are operating in our country, but first it's necessary to prove everything.” The editors of the newspaper Czas, which published Szaniawski's list, were punished by Interior Minister Kozlowski by being denied entrance to the archives of the interior ministry, which were open to other journalists. Kozlowski also told Szaniawski that ‘ ‘ the army has materials on you which will soon be disclosed. ’ ’ The threat was never carried out. In fact, Kozlowski was forced to dismiss an advisor who had been one of the strategists in the effort to suppress the opposition in the 1980s. In the spring of 1991, politicians from the Center Alliance, one of the major post-Solidarity parties, raised the issue of the collaborators in the early stages of the election campaign for parliament. Explaining the party's new position in this matter, Jan Olszewski [who became prime minister in December 1991] stated, “The lists of security police informers... can .be used against us by those who built the old system. Documents that were supposedly destroyed — and I am convinced that they were put in safe keeping and are now at the disposal of individuals as well as special organizations and networks created for this purpose, not to mention foreign powers — are a powerful weapon in the hands of a political opponent. This is why we cannot set this matter aside and hush it up. It is impermissible that we find out from a post-Solidarity minister that there are prominent public figures, some of our senators and deputies, who collaborated with the security police — and that we are not told who they are.” The situation in the interior ministry under Kozlowski's successor, Henryk Majewski, didn't improve — it worsened [see the interview with Majewski in the Summer 1991 issue of Uncaptive Minds]. According to Olszewski, ‘ ‘Former functionaries of the security police who want to reveal crimes — which were often committed under orders — are requesting their current superiors at the ministry to release them from their vows of professional secrecy. But even though they have left the service, they are not released from their vows.” [pageend19]18 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 On July 19, 1991 the Senate called upon the government to determine whether any candidates to parliament had collaborated with the security police or military counterintelligence (29 senators voted for the investigation, 22 against, 7 abstained, and 42 didn't show up for the vote). The government's response? On July 25, representatives of the interior ministry, the defense ministry, and the Bureau for the Protection of the State (UOP) told the Senate Committee on Legislative Initiatives and Affairs that investigating parliamentary candidates to determine whether they had been collaborators would violate four laws. They said that only the courts and the prosecutor could be given access to information on collaborators. Justice Minister Wieslaw Chrzanowski, who would have been obligated by the Senate motion to supervise the verification process, stated that he couldn't fulfill such a responsibility, because according to the law at the time, such an investigation would be illegal. Interior Minister Majewski stated that “Disclosing [the names of collaborators of the former security police or of the UOP] would politically destabilize the Polish state. The services connected with the interior ministry are being rebuilt. We must recruit new people for these services...Those who come to us must have guarantees that they are safe.” When Majewski was asked whether employees and collaborators of the former security police were currently being used by his ministry, he replied, “If they show a desire to do so and can give us worthwhile help in carrying out our tasks...We cannot, after all, cut ourselves off from all those who have collaborated previously with the secret services. We must give them a guarantee that after they come to us with information, their names will not appear on the first page of the newspaper the next day.. .We must demonstrate to each other — the ministry to the collaborators, and they to us — a minimum of trust. ’ ’ From these quotations we can conclude that Majewski — a man from Solidarity — considered usefulness for the'new security services and effectiveness in keeping tabs on the new political elite to be the most important criteria in deciding what to do with former collaborators. In fact, he has stated outright that disclosing agents' names would “impede the rise of political elites.” When asked on May 17, 1991 whether security police collaborators should be allowed to remain deputies to parliament, he refused to answer. Since the minister opposes disclosing the collaborators' names, it seems reasonable to assume that he prefers a parliament consisting of people the interior ministry can easily compromise. In Majewski's defense, it should be pointed out that he considers that the communist security police was a patriotic, even anti-Soviet organization: “I can, with full responsibility, assert that at least for the last decade or so the intelligence and counterintelligence services have worked on Poland's behalf. ’ ’ The communist political authorities were the guilty ones, he says, because “it was they and not the heads of intelligence and counterintelligence who decided with whom to share information and materials and, in the last analysis, ben[pageend20]POLICE AGENTS 19 efited from this.” Concerning the KGB, he claims that “cooperation in effect faded out in the mid-1980s.” The last head of the security police, Jerzy Karpacz, also sees dire consequences in revealing the names of collaborators. He believes that if ‘ ‘the names of certain agents of the special services were disclosed in certain countries of the former Eastern Bloc, there would be a realistic danger that many other well-placed agents would simply cease to collaborate.” It would be a threat to democracy if the names of agents were made public, according to Karpacz, because no one would be willing to work with the secret services without being “completely assured that their anonymity would be preserved.” The case of Poland shows that withholding the lists of collaborators and agents allows the government to accuse or threaten whorrtever it wants while shielding compromised people of use to it. Moreover, it appears that the first two non-communist administrations in Poland were interested in maintaining a special relationship with the KGB, or were at least forced to do so. Bulgaria In August 1990, the communist-dominated parliament set up a verification commission and appointed Georgi Tambuyev to be its head. But in December of that year, when the commission recommended publicizing the names of deputies who had been secret collaborators, parliament nixed the idea. In any case, the co'mmission probably didn't even have access to all the relevant files, since the communist minister of internal affairs put at their disposal only what he thought they should see: files of former secret collaborators of the sixth department of the ministry, but not of current collaborators of the new Bureau for the Protection of the Constitution. (In the latter case, the committee was only supplied with personal statistics and the date of recruitment.) Back in February 1990, the minister of internal affairs liquidated the sixth department together with local divisions of the political police. The most senior functionaries were asked to retire; the rest, however, were offered the opportunity to carry out “tasks arising from the new conception of the rebuilding of the Ministry of Internal Affairs” — that is, employment in the Bureau for the Protection of the Constitution. At that time, some of the collaborators ceased their work for the interior ministry, and their files were given to the parliamentary commission. But many of the collaborators —including all of those in parliament — were reassigned to the first, second, and third departments, thereby avoiding verification. According to the interior ministry official who passed the files to the commission, the list of secret collaborators of the other departments who were deputies at the time included 80 names — 20% of the deputies in parliament. As Tambuyev has written, the recommendation to reveal the collaborators would never have passed, considering how many of these secret collaborators were in parliament. [pageend21]20 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 The minister of internal affairs refused to guarantee the authenticity of the list of collaborators given to the commission, claiming that “he didn't review any personal files,” and that his subordinates had put together the list. The location of the sixth department archive was kept secret. The deputy minister of internal affairs, Krasimir Samandzhiycv, even claimed that, “The ministry has no information about it at its disposal”; and it proved impossible to find any of the former officials who would have known where it was. Alexander Stamboliski, secretary of the commission, said, “I was quite shocked when I read in Duma that an archive of the sixth department existed. When we looked for it, we couldn't find it. They told us that the documents had been taken and later returned.. .People whose names wc were given denied that they had worked in the sixth department. We were told that they had worked in the garden in front of the People's House of Culture.” Despite the pressure applied by the interior ministry on Tambuyev ‘‘to lock up or destroy the dossiers of the political police” in the interest ‘‘of social peace,” the commission proceeded with its work. Only the commission's leaders — Tambuyev, Deputy Chairman Rumen Danov, and Stamboliski — had access to the files that were given to the commission. Yet when Tambuyev prepared a draft of a report on the commission's work that included confidential information taken from the files, the information somehow wound up in the hands of the post-communist publication Fax, which published a list of 32 names in its April 22, 1991 issue. As it turned out, one of the commission's members, Tsanko Tsankov, was a collaborator who had been transferred from the sixth to the second department. The first list of collaborators in parliament supplied by the interior ministry included 25 names. Eleven seemed questionable, because torture and other forms of coercion had been used to force them to collaborate. The only proven collaborators on the list were: Mikhail Mikhailov, an opposition activist who was recruited in 1961 and who provided the interior ministry with information until the end of 1989 while participating in the Club in Support of Glasnost and Perestroika; Pankratiya, Metropolitan of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, an informer since 1971; Vasil Rostov, who worked for the sixth department from 1972 until its dissolution in 1990, by which time he had become the vice- president of the Independent Association for the Defense of Human Rights; Dimiter Batalov, who informed from 1947 to 1984, despite having spent time" in a prison camp; and Georgi Markov, vice-president of the Democratic Party, who was recruited in 1982. The first list also included six names of current secret collaborators with the Bureau for the Protection of the Constitution, among them Petar Beron, the former chairman of the Union of Democratic Forces and one-time candidate for premier. Only the president and interior minister have access to their files. Three entries consisted only of names; the rest of the dossiers were withheld by the interior ministry because “they still have operational significance. ’ ’ [pageend22]POLICE AGENTS 21 One had been an interior ministry employee from 1944 to 1949; one a retired employee; and another a director in the interior ministry. Before the commission had even completed its work, Tambuyev was told that Deputy Minister Samandzhiyev had taken the names of five active agents off the list, among which were three ministers. The ministers' names have never been revealed, because, according to a spokesman for the interior ministry, “they had been transferred to different departments, where they are performing useful work...” The other two names eventually were disclosed. One of them was Ivan Glushkov, chairman of the parliament. He had been recruited by counterintelligence in 1973, and had worked for the political police in 1988 and for the interior ministry's second department in 1989. Glushkov denied that he had been an agent and demanded to see the evidence against him. After a two-hour chat, the matter was “cleared up.” Interior Minister Danov explained that “[Glushkov] had been included on the list of agents, but we don't have his file”; Danov also complained of being fooled by a subordinate, who, he said, “had already been punished.” In the end, the communist-dominated parliament decided not to make the commission's report public and sealed the files of secret collaborators for 30 years. Some of the deputies even proposed burning the dossiers. Only part of the opposition was against these measures. For nearly everyone, it was clear that the interior ministry's purpose in “cooperating” with the parliamentary commission was to hide collaborators currently working with the ministry, to obtain parliament's assent for destroying the ministry's files, to compromise the opposition, and to confuse the criteria for collaboration to such an extent that the accusation of collaboration could arbitrarily be made against anyone. The communist deputies' allegations of collaboration leveled against the opposition were particularly offensive: the torturers were accusing the tortured. The interior ministry wants to maintain control of the files, and it has largely succeeded in keeping them out of the government's hands. But the ministry's own employees may have taken or copied a great many documents. Tambuyev asserts that “According to the information I have, the sixth department completely opened up the store for a period of time. Almost every operational employee could take whatever interested him. They took personal files to protect themselves, or to blackmail certain people in the future, or for both reasons.” On September 10, Democracy, the newspaper of the Union of Democratic Forces, published a new list of deputies who had been collaborators. These collaborators had worked in various departments of the interior ministry, not just the sixth. They included Viktor Vylkov, chairman of the Peasants' Union, a communist satellite party; Deputy Premier Alexander Tomov; Pctko Sim- eonov, once one of President Zhelyev's closest colleagues and a co-founder of the Union of Democratic Forces; and Chavdar Kyuranov, Stefan Prodev, [pageend23]22 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 and Angel Wagenstein, three former communist reformers who helped build the UDF. If all the secret police collaborators amongst the deputies elected in Bulgaria's first (mostly) free elections in June 1990 were counted, they would amount to a third of parliament. This gives us some idea of the degree to which the political elite in post-communist societies has been infiltrated. The Bulgarian case shows that as long as the communists have control over the archives of the interior ministries, they can freely manipulate the question of secret collaborators and undercut the opposition's ability to defend itself against charges of collaboration. Romania In Romania, the communists have retained complete control over the interior ministry, including the Romanian Information Service (SRI), the political police, and the Foreign Information Service, or foreign intelligence. The SRI has absorbed the core of the Securitate's personnel: its director-general, Virgil Máguranu, was a Securitate colonel, and his deputy, Mihai Stan, was a head of the Securitate disinformation service. In March 1991, the former deputy chairman of the ruling National Salvation Front (FSN), Claudiu Iordache, asserted that the old communists in the FSN leadership were blackmailing younger activists who wanted to introduce a greater degree of democracy into the country. According to Iordache, the Securitate files on secret collaborators at the disposal of FSN leaders have made it possible for them to rule the country in a dictatorial fashion, albeit with the trappings of democracy. Iordache also believes that the former USSR is involved in this matter. In May, Iordache submitted a motion to the Chamber of Deputies — eventually signed by 150 deputies and senators — which stated the following: “[This] group of deputies requests the Permanent Bureau of the Assembly of Deputies to make a decision on the appointment of a parliamentary commission with the power to verify the personal files of the political police for all members of both chambers of parliament, the executive, and the judiciary.” SRI chief Virgil Máguranu responded to the motion before the parliament. He said that he himself was in control of the Securitate files, and promised full cooperation in carrying out the tasks outlined in Iordache's motion. And then, incredibly, he recommended that ten signatories to the motion resign from parliament, though he didn't give any names. Opposition deputies asked him where the files were and who had access to them. Were they being used, and if so, for what purpose? None of the questions were answered. Even the motion itself is somewhat suspicious. Why was the Permanent Bureau supposed to appoint the verification commission, and not parliament itself? Why was parliamentary debate over this motion coupled with debate [pageend24]POLICE AGENTS 23 over a bill on the SRI that would have given the service virtually unlimited powers? Ion Ratiu, head of the Peasants' Party, said, “It is very important that we know exactly how the members of the Romanian parliament behaved during the period before the revolution.” He also voiced fears that only the collaborators who are active in the opposition would be revealed, but not those in the FSN — which would undermine the opposition's credibility. But so long as the FSN remains in control of the interior ministry, it will be impossible to prevent Ratiu's fears from materializing. After Claudiu Iordache put forward his motion in parliament, he became isolated within the FSN, and in June 1991 he left the organization. The list with the 150 signatures was stolen and the motion on verification was totally ignored by a plenary session of parliament. Iordache himself, who was carried to political prominence by the revolution, squandered his popularity defending the policies of the FSN. His initiative on verification could therefore have been an attempt to regain popularity — although it's still not certain whether he was acting by himself. Czechoslovakia Czechoslovakia is the only former communist country (not counting East Germany) where the new authorities have dismissed all employees of the secret police (StB). The opposition took control of the interior ministry, which includes the StB, only after the May 1990 parliamentary elections. As late as February 26 of that year, Richard Sacher, the federal minister of internal affairs, signed an agreement with KGB head Vladimir Kryuchkov on cooperation between the two organizations. It was a year before the treaty was officially renounced. A government spokesman has claimed that the treaty wasn't signed in the presence of President Havel during his visit with Sacher to Moscow, and was never put into effect. In Slovakia, the parliamentary committee on security and defense has found that the Soviet consulate gave Vladimir Mečiar, Slovak interior minister at the time, a list of three StB functionaries who were to remain in the interior ministry. Immediately after the May 1990 elections, the federal parliament set up a Committee to Investigate the Events of November 17, 1989, appointing Jiří Ruml, a well-known opposition journalist, as its chairman. A committee that had been set up earlier was disbanded. As Ruml put it: “Several members of the first committee were secret collaborators of the StB,” who were trying to throw the investigation off track. Ruml's committee was empowered to broaden the scope of the investigation to include the verification of deputies to the federal parliament. Between December 6th and 20th, 1990, the committee succeeded in obtaining the registries of agents and informers of every district branch of the StB, including those in Slovakia. The final list contained the names of about [pageend25]24 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 100,000 secret collaborators and about 10,000 full-time agents. Many of them held high political positions. The committee's press spokesman, Petr Toman, stated that on November 17, 1989, secret collaborators were ordered to infiltrate Civic Forum, the newly-arisen opposition formation. In December 1990, Ruml announced that “The former collaborators of the StB are still continuing their activity, and their network reaches into the new parliament. The collaborators are maintaining contacts with former StB functionaries.” The committee voted on each case of collaboration individually; if a majority decided that a given deputy had been a secret collaborator of the StB, he was summoned before the committee to face the charges and given the chance to resign his parliamentary seat quietly. The committee considered this fair treatment, since candidates for parliament had been required to sign an affidavit declaring that they had not collaborated with the political police. Only those who refused to resign faced public exposure. On March 22, the committee released the names of 16 deputies against whom there was strong evidence but who refused to step down when confronted. The disclosure of the names of the 16 collaborators in parliament did not put an end to the committee's tasks. Even before those names were announced, the committee's spokesman, in February 1991, declared that evidence indicated that there were secret police collaborators among “highly placed persons in the state administration, among deputies to the federal parliament, federal ministers and their deputies, employees of the bureau of the federal parliament and of the bureau of the council of ministers.” On May 24, during a session of the federal parliament devoted to the matter of verification, the committee's spokesman declared the investigation of members of the government and employees of the bureau of the government complete. He also announced, however, that there were many former collaborators and police employees working in the mass media. The committee proposed that these collaborators and the entire network of collaborators and agents assigned to the “struggle against the internal enemy” be exposed. On May 29, parliament rejected the committee's proposal to verify journalists and reveal the names of the StB's anti-opposition network. Conservative deputies in parliament, especially those from the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) and the Non-Partisan Club (KAN) supported the committee; but those on the left, especially the Civic Movement (OH), were opposed. A month later, the OH deputy and vice-premier Pavel Rychetský questioned the veracity of the registries of secret collaborators, which — in his opinion — did not constitute sufficient evidence of collaboration. Committee chairman Ruml's answer was clcar-cut: not a single case had yet been found that confirmed Rychetský's doubts, because it was impossible to falsify the files [see “Collaborators Revealed” in the Summer 1991 issue of Uncaptive Minds]. On June 10, a session of the federal parliament was devoted to the matter of verification of the government. Federal Premier Marian Čalfa had stated [pageend26]POLICE AGENTS 25 back on April 23 that government members had already been verified. Sometime after the session it was announced that no ministers had been found to be collaborators, but that there were possible cases of deputy ministers collaborating with the StB that would be under investigation to the end of June. At the same time, all private citizens who held documents from the StB archives were ordered to return them, and the exploitation of these dossiers was made a punishable offense. The committee had learned that files believed to have been destroyed had in fact been stolen or microfilmed. The verifications and the defense of those identified as collaborators in the federal government, the bureau of the council of ministers, and the bureau of the federal assembly was supposed to end on June 30. But a week after that date Jiří Ruml was still complaining that “the documents are not in order; people and concrete names are missing. Only when these gaps are filled in...will we be able to pass the complete dossiers...to the federal parliament.” In September 1991, the verification of employees at the foreign ministry was begun. According to Deputy Minister Václav Wagner, 50 secret collaborators of the StB (or the KGB) had been uncovered, including six ambassadors. Most of the collaborators and agents worked in the Czechoslovak embassy in Moscow. All of those “positively” verified were asked to leave the service. Several denied having collaborated; their files were submitted to “an exacting investigation.” Three of the accused explained that they had signed declarations of cooperation, but that no evidence exists that anyone was harmed by their actions. These three were allowed to remain in the foreign service. The majority of those who were verified did not try to defend themselves or justify their actions. Military and trade attachés have yet to undergo verification; so far, no one has been dismissed from these positions. On October 10, 1991 the federal parliament passed a comprehensive law on verification. The law bans, for a period of five years, the following categories of people from holding elected or appointed public or professional positions in state organizations, or in joint-stock companies in which the state holds a majority of the capital, for a period of five years: Those who, from February 1948 to November 1989, were: 1. functionaries or agents of the StB; 2. StB collaborators cognizant of their collaboration; 3. communist party functionaries from the township level up — except those who served from January 1, 1968 to May 1, 1969 — and members of National Front action committees and verification commissions set up after February 25, 1948, and verification and normalization commissions set up after August 21, 1968; [pageend27]26 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 4. members of the People's Militia; 5. students and junior assistants who were in KGB schools for a period longer than three months. Members of the latter four categories can appeal their cases to a special commission. All those concerned have the right to appeal to a court, which can affirm or reject the findings of the interior ministry or the verification commission. The law does not affect people who were rehabilitated after November 17, 1989 — that is, people who had been punished earlier for their opposition activity (so long as they weren't employees or collaborators of the StB). If they were active in the opposition but were never punished for it, they are subject to the verification law like everyone else. Those who worked in counterintelligence from department heads up, who studied in KGB schools, or held leading positions in certain communist party committees devoted to defense and security matters, were banned from promotions up to and including the rank of colonel in the interior and defense ministries. Ministers or the director of the intelligence service may make exceptions at their discretion. Upon reaching the age of 18, all citizens have the right to request a review of their own files. Publishers and radio and television producers can request the verification of their editorial staffs provided they obtain the consent of individual employees. The leaderships of political parties and movements have the same right. However, the findings of investigations undertaken by the interior ministry or the verification commission cannot be made public without the consent of the person in question. The Czech approach to the problem of collaboration is similar to that of the Germans in that institutions can request the verification of candidates they are thinking about hiring. In Germany, out of some 200,000 requests for verification, 60,000 have been disposed of. A new German law gives citizens the right to look at their own files, thus enabling them to find out who informed on them. The Czech law doesn't go this far. In Slovakia, the communist party and the nationalist parties have been opposed to verification. The former Slovak premier and leading Slovak nationalist, Vladimir Mečiar, was one of the staunchest opponents, and he blocked the removal of collaborators from political life. But Mečiar didn't simply protect the collaborators: he also exploited them. Armed with a list of collaborators in parliament, the mass media, the Church, and other sectors of public life, he blackmailed them to strengthen his political position. The way in which Mečiar got hold of this list, and his ties with StB in general, were the subjects of investigations conducted by the parliamentary committee on defense and security and the presidium of the parliament. [pageend28]POLICE AGENTS 27 When the Slovak foreign trade minister decided to submit his entire ministry to verification, he found that the names of 300 of his 1,300 employees appeared on lists of collaborators supplied by the federal interior ministry. As soon as he dismissed these employees, the minister himself was accused by an StB functionary of having links to the StB. The Slovak press has been gripped by a nationalist fervor not shared by the majority of Slovaks. Moreover, it is a brand of nationalism that isn't in the best interests of Slovakia: the policies the nationalists advocate would benefit the representatives of the old regime in the former USSR and Slovakia itself more than anyone else. This contradiction can largely be explained by the widespread infiltration of collaborators and agents of the StB into the Slovak media and Slovak political parties. And behind the StB is the KGB. The Slovak parliament passed comprehensive legislation on verification in the republic on June 20, 1991. A verification commission was set up and given until the end of 1991 to fulfill its tasks. The commission, however, has yet to accomplish any real work — which is hardly surprising, since it is controlled by former high officials of the StB. The opponents of verification — some of whom are not collaborators themselves — argue that in view of the destruction of a significant portion of the files, StB functionaries in effect could be in a position to decide who was and who wasn't a collaborator, because their eyewitness testimony would be the strongest evidence in the absence of dossiers. But the information in the files that were purportedly destroyed does in all likelihood exist — on microfilms and photocopies now stored in the safes of the KGB and unscrupulous politicians. Lithuania On November 12, the Lithuanian government declared that: “Former KGB employees and informers will not be permitted, for a period of five years, to hold ministerial positions in the government of the Republic of Lithuania, directorships of departments and other state services and inspectorates, and managerial positions in the basic units of the ministerial structure and in local and regional government. “Former KGB employees and informers who currently hold the positions mentioned above must resign by January 1, 1992. “.. .those who are collaborating with the structures of the KGB should be informed that such activity will henceforth be regarded as a state crime, and that they will be punished in accordance with the law.” The government did show mercy: it offered an amnesty for all former KGB collaborators who reported to the police. But those who failed to do so are to be deprived of their positions and have their names made public. [pageend29]28 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 The KGB archives in Vilnius have been plundered; the files in provincial KGB branches, however, have been put under safekeeping and remain largely intact. The parliamentary commission appointed to investigate the matter believes that it will be possible to reconstruct the lost lists of collaborators on the basis of the documentation of criminal cases against members of the political opposition, since these files contain information provided by informers. But so far, the names of only two KGB collaborators have been made public: Kazimiera Prunskiene, the former prime minister, and the secretary and co-founder of Sajudis, Virgilijus Čepaitis. The power struggle within the KGB probably led to the disclosure of Prunskiene's collaboration. In the second case, the KGB — which sent copies of reports filed by Čepaitis to the Lithuanian paper Respublika — was trying to undermine the Lithuanian population's trust in Landsbergis, since Čepaitis had been a friend and close political ally of the president. The cases of Prunskiene and Čepaitis demonstrate that the KGB — even though it has been formally disbanded in Lithuania — still has access to the dossiers in its former archives, and that it is willing to exploit them whenever it sees fit. These disclosures also illustrate the extent to which the KGB has infiltrated Eastern Europe's new political elite. [pageend30]29 i n t e r v i e w With ZDZISLAW RURARZ Zdzislaw Rurarz was the Polish ambassador to Japan until December 1981, when he resigned to protest the imposition of martial law. He was granted asylum in the United States, where he currently lives with his wife. In early 1982, he was sentenced in absentia to death, a sentence which has since been lifted. NOTHING HAS ENDED YET UM You do not trust the Polish authorities, I gather, for you have not returned to Poland. RURARZ Judging from the difficulties I have met in trying to obtain full exoneration and the restoration of my citizenship, it seems to me that the legacy of the Polish People's Republic has been preserved in the Republic of Poland. The issue is doubly complicated in my case, because I am sure that I was also sentenced by the Soviets. However, they never made public such sentences and thus I cannot be sure if I was pardoned by them. And not only are their troops still in Poland — so is the Soviet “fifth column.” UM You trust the Polish authorities as little as you do the Soviets? RURARZ It depends on what you mean by “authorities.” As to the military and police services, I surely do not trust them. The secret services, especially their military branch, of which I have personal knowledge, remain practically intact from the old times. [pageend31]30 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 UM No efforts have been made to dismantle these networks? RURARZ The surface of both the Polish and the Soviet networks, composed of all sorts of collaborators and spies, has still not been scratched. Not a single individual in Poland has been publicly named. And it seems that none of the collaborators will be revealed in the future, because this is now considered a “state secret”! I for one find it most strange that a state desiring to become democratic has become the guardian of secrets of its totalitarian predecessor. UM What are the prospects for “decommunization” in Poland? RURARZ Decommunization is necessary, but it is a different matter entirely from uncovering networks of informers and agents. The identities of communist party members are generally well known. The “cadre officers” in Poland's secret services are also largely known. What is unknown is the composition of the secret networks.' And what very few realize is that the network of collaborators run by the Polish secret services consisted mostly of noncommunists. These people sometimes posed as anticommunists, and undoubtedly managed to infiltrate the opposition at the highest levels. Decommunization would actually divert the nation's attention from the more vital issue of unmasking these networks of collaborators. UM Could you describe the security services you have in mind and what their fiinctions were? RURARZ In each country, there were actually four networks: a civilian intelligence service, civilian counterintelligence, military intelligence, and military counterintelligence. In Poland, the civilian intelligence and counterintelligence services were subordinate to the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MSW). These two secret services — or departments — were integral parts of the Security Service (SB), the equivalent of the KGB in the Soviet Union. After Solidarity came to power in the fall of 1989, the SB was transformed into the Bureau for the Protection of the State (UOP). It is widely believed that the SB's officers were all dismissed, but in reality, about half were rehired by the UOP. And the UOP has released no information on the secret network it inherited. [pageend32]NOTHING HAS ENDED 31 The military intelligence and counterintelligence services have been completely untouched. These services now form the Directorate of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, which was recently renamed Informacje [the name of the counterintelligence unit formed from part of the front forces organized as the Military Internal Service (WSW) after the war]. It was also subordinated to the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, and removed from any parliamentary or other civilian supervision or authority. In all the other countries of the bloc — including the former USSR — the civilian intelligence and counterintelligence services have been scaled down, but the military intelligence and counterintelligence services have been upgraded. And as far as I know, military intelligence and counterintelligence remain quite active, both domestically and internationally. UM Did the various intelligence services fill different fiinctions ? RURARZ Military intelligence was concerned primarily with military doctrine, strategy, war-fighting capabilities, and the possible course of enemy combat operations, everything connected with strategic and conventional weaponry, and the organization of the military. However, there are many fields that are considered to be related to the military: economics, demographics, meteorology, just to name a few. Any of these might increase or decrease military potential and effectiveness. Thus, many things that seemed to have little to do with the military fell under the purview of military intelligence. Of course, high technology was the number one priority, since almost all high technology was related in one way or another to military matters. The primary task of military counterintelligence was to protect all military-related targets, including all industrial enterprises. But military counterintelligence was also involved in other operations. After the imposition of martial law, it was exceptionally active in combating the Solidarity underground, for example. The civilian intelligence and counterintelligence services were involved in almost everything — the Church, the underground, and so on. Civilian and military counterintelligence overlapped, but by and large there was a division of labor. UM Was this whole operation separate from the Soviet network? [pageend33]32 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 RURARZ Through the Warsaw Pact (and even before), the Soviet and Polish networks collaborated closely with each other. Military counterintelligence and intelligence in Poland were actually run, in the early 1950s, by Soviet generals. In the civilian services, there were always Soviet advisors. Moreover, the Soviets also had their own informers and agents in Poland. In 1961, the East Bloc countries signed an agreement on the coordination of intelligence operations among the Warsaw Pact nations — which in fact meant they were further subordinating themselves to the Soviets. According to this agreement, the East Bloc countries were banned from interfering in Soviet intelligence operations on their territory. Soviet intelligence and counterintelligence were — and doubtless continue to be — active in the supervision and direction of the Polish and other services. Remember: the Soviets have had a free hand in Eastern Europe for almost 50 years. U M Do Soviet agents still have a free hand in Eastern Europe? RURARZ Not a single Soviet agent has been unmasked in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, eastern Germany, Romania, or Bulgaria. UM What are they doing now? RURARZ It is difficult to say. But I have not the slightest doubt that the transfer of power from the communists to the opposition could not have happened without the involvement of these networks. In fact, evidence has turned up suggesting that these networks were in close contact with the opposition, or a part of it. For example, Jaroslaw Kaczyriski gave an interview in which he said that during talks to form a Solidarity-led government in 1989, he was authorized by Walesa to meet informally, which means formally, with two Soviet intelligence operatives. He also admitted to meeting them prior to the June 1989 elections. Mieczyslaw Rakowski, the former communist prime minister, mentioned in his book that at the time, the government knew of extensive contacts between the Polish opposition and the Soviet embassy. UM Some in the opposition say a secret deal preceded the conclusion of the round-table negotiations. Would you agree ? [pageend34]n o t h in g h as e n d e d 33 RURARZ I was very much disturbed by the quite unusual transfer of power in Poland — especially since the events of 1989 in Poland were not isolated from what happened elsewhere in Eastern Europe that year. In Poland, the transfer of power was negotiated during the round-table talks. The regime's chief negotiator was General Czeslaw Kiszczak, then minister of internal affairs and a highly experienced veteran of the secret services. My own experience was that these services were highly efficient — remarkably so given how everything else worked. It is inconceivable that these talks could have succeeded without some behind-the-scenes agreement. In his book, General Kiszczak mentions someone in intelligence who penetrated Solidarity at the highest level. Because this agent was in intelligence, he couldn't have been known to counterintelligence, the agency that was normally charged with the task of infiltrating the opposition. This is a significant admission. But it also shows how little is known — both to us and the people involved in the security agencies. For example, we know that Vladimir Kryuchkov, then KGB chief, had a talk with Tadeusz Mazowiecki in 1989 four days after he was appointed prime minister. We do not know what they discussed, but Mazowiecki left the meeting in what associates termed “a state of shock.” Of course, there is a simple reason so little is known: most instructions and orders in the secret services were not written down, but delivered orally. UM The round-table agreements were signed almost three years ago. A great deal has happened since then. How are those agreements connected to the situation today? RURARZ The round-table agreements hardly exist anymore. But note that they were fulfilled. Lech Walesa has destroyed Solidarity as an organization. And no agents or collaborators have been unmasked. The interior ministry had 3 million files; military counterintelligence had 400,000. How many were part of the network? Judging from the number of military counterintelligence cadre officers, at least 70,000; the number of secret collaborators probably ran to the hundreds of thousands. Surely many more were working for the Soviet intelligence services. Where are all of these people? Not a single name in Poland was revealed. Many who were in the opposition, indeed some of the most vociferously anti-communist and anti-Soviet voices, have strangely changed their rhetoric and behavior upon entering the ruling circles. Are they acting in accord with a script written by someone else? We don't know. [pageend35]34 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 UM Is there any indication how high up this penetration went? RURARZ Recently it was discovered that in Lithuania, the vice-chairman of Sajudis and a prominent member of parliament, Virgilijus Čepaitis, was unmasked as a KGB collaborator. He himself confirmed the accusation. I doubt that this is an isolated case. UM It seems that the forces of the old regime retain some influence, but does it really matter? Aren'/ the changes that have taken place so far irreversible? RURARZ I am afraid nothing has ended yet. Because these changes have not done away with the legacy of the past, they are not irreversible. In Poland, economic reforms — the so-called shock therapy and marketization — were ill-conceived, and today are widely rejected by Polish society. Seventy percent of the people who voted in the last elections supported parties who campaigned against the government's economic program. And that doesn't include the majority who did not bother to vote. The proliferation of highly personalized and quarrelsome parties does not augur well for democracy. Indeed, I once wrote in jest that if I were asked to design changes for the express purpose of compromising democracy and a free-market economy, I would simply cite the Polish model over the last three years. UM Are you saying that the changes are little more than manipulations? Something akin to the “Urban scenario"? [see “Jerzy Urban's Letter to the First Secretary” in the November-December issue of Uncaptive Minds/ RURARZ I am saying there are mysteries that have not been explained — and with the passage of time, it will be ever more difficult to uncover the truth. The sooner the people involved in these networks are exposed and dismissed, the better it will be — and the more genuine and irreversible — for democratic and free market changes. [pageend36]ESTONIA, LATVIA, LITHUANIA 35 interviews With LENART MERI, VALERY KALABUGIN, TUNNE KELAM, ILMARS BISERS, ROMUALDAS RAZUKAS, AIGARS JIRGENS, and ZIGMAS VAISVILA The following interviews were conducted by Monika Agopsowicz, director of the Warsaw office of the Institute for Democracy in Eastern Europe and author of articles on East European affairs, and Krzysztof Kopczynski, a lecturer on literature at Warsaw University. STARTING ANEW AMIDST THE ROT OF THE OLD We were in Tallinn, Riga, and Vilnius from the 12th to the 19th of October, a week when further momentous changes were taking place both in the Baltic states and the entire former Soviet Union. On October 15, the presidents of the parliaments of Estonia and Latvia together with the president of Lithuania signed the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Helsinki. This welcoming ceremony to the free world was followed three days later by what at the time appeared to be the symbolic burial of the old Soviet Union: the signing of a watered-down union treaty by the leaders of the republics that didn't want independence. The old Soviet Union may be gone, but it certainly is not forgotten. During our travels, we constantly came across remnants of the empire, which still commands the loyalty of many people. Hundreds of thousands of Soviet troops remain stationed in the Baltic states. We frequently heard that the KGB and GRU (Soviet army intelligence) continue to play an important role, and that the activ[pageend37]36 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 ities of these organizations have in fact intensified since the outbreak of independence. Various mafias with international connections are thriving during the economic and legal transition period. These criminal and semi-criminal networks are especially active in Latvia, but, have also made their presence keenly felt in Lithuania. Perhaps the greatest challenge facing the leaders of the Baltic states is the formulation of a privatization program that will prevent the nomenklatura from taking over the plants and property it managed. Of course privatization must be accompanied by foreign investment. The Baltic countries are counting in particular on Scandinavian investment; at present, Estonia has the best prospects for attracting it. In the Baltic states, as elsewhere in the former empire, the economic situation will have a decisive impact on politics in the near future. Even nationality conflicts — which are particularly likely in Latvia, where ethnic Latvians constitute only 52% of the population — could fade against the backdrop of an improving economy. Many Russian residents of the Baltic states prefer to remain where they are even though they may not have the right to vote, because the economic prospects are better than in Russia. Assessing the influence of former communists among the political elites of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania seemed particularly important to us. In Estonia and Latvia, real authority is in the hands of the former communists — or “post-communists” as they are called in the region — and we believe that even if they were to lose power in the near future, they will mount a strong counteroffensive within a year or two (such a counteroffensive has already begun in Lithuania). The communist-dominated local governments retain control over the local media, for good reason. The interviews that follow concentrate on two problem areas: foreign policy and ethnic relations. The individuals with whom we spoke represent a broad spectrum of views. Our interviewees include government representatives and members of both the mainstream (the Congress of Estonia in the case of Estonia) and the radical opposition (the Citizens' Committee in the case of Latvia). They also have widely varying backgrounds. There are politicians on their way out of politics, such as Ilmars Bisers; politicians who have promising careers in front of them, such as Romualdas Ra- zukas; and politicians whom we hope will do well, such as Tunne Kelam. Some of these interviews are presented in a question and answer format, others consist only of the interviewee's response. M.A., K.K. [pageend38]STARTING ANEW 37 LENART MERI Lenart Meri, 63, was the Estonian foreign minister in the government of Edgar Savisaar (whose cabinet resigned on January 23, 1992 after this interview was conducted); he is a writer, translator, and documentary film-maker. He is also a member of the Estonian National Front and was considered the only non-leftist in the Estonian government. UM What conditions did Moscow set for recognizing the independence of Estonia ? MERI There were no conditions. UM None at all? MERI None. Tomorrow I am going to Helsinki to sign the Final Act of the 1975 Conference on Security and Cooperation. Even though it's a protocol visit, it has symbolic importance for us: it's a declaration that we are in Europe. UM What unites Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania? Are they presenting a common front to Russia and the former Soviet Union ? MERI I don't think there are any fundamental differences between us. We share a common historical experience: we are a community created by the Hitler-Stalin pact. And we will certainly be happy if it is our fate to have a common future, a democratic future. UM Does that mean the Baltic countries will pursue common policies on major issues, such as relations with Moscow and economic reform ? MERI There are a few differences in policy toward Yeltsin and Gorbachev, but those differences are so minor that we can speak of a partnership. The same holds for privatization. There are differences: [pageend39]38 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 Estonia is more advanced in some areas, Lithuania in others. Ten percent of the former Soviet Union's joint ventures are located in Estonia, in large part because of our ties to Finland. We and the Finns are linked by closely related languages and cultural traditions. And through our connection to Finland we have been strongly influenced by the West. UM To what extent is Finland a model for Estonia nowadays? MERI Finland has been important for us for the last 30 years. At the moment, Finland itself is going through some economic difficulties and is making a great effort to keep up with the other countries of Europe. I am certain that our ties with Germany, France, and Sweden will also play an important role. UM So Estonia plans to restore its traditionally friendly relationship with Germany? MERI We already have. Foreign Minister Genscher visited us, and Germany has already sent an ambassador. I think, though, that political ties will not be as important as economic and cultural ties. UM How would you assess James Baker's visit to the Baltic countries? MERI I have had the good fortune to pay Mr. Baker a visit in Washington, to participate in a conference with him in New York, and to speak with him in Moscow. I am proud that he was satisfied with the day he spent in Tallinn. For 50 years the Estonian flag has been hanging in the foyer of the State Department, which meant, as Mr. Baker said when he was here, that Estonia was always considered a part of Europe. UM We think that the countries departing the Soviet Union need to be able to refer back to a tradition of independence... [pageend40]STARTING ANEW 39 MERI Estonia never considered itself a part of the Soviet Union, just as Poland and France never considered themselves part of the Third Reich. Like them Estonia was an occup.ed country. UM As an historian, what do you find most compelling in Estonia's tradition of independence? MERI Perhaps this will sound funny to a European, but the memory of our previous parliamentary government enabled us, after 50 years of darkness, to restore democracy and a normal party system quickly. VALERY KALABUGIN Valery Kalabugin is an ethnic Russian resident of Estonia. He is a journalist, a deputy to the Congress of Estonia, a member of the Congress's council, and belongs to the Estonian National Independence Party. KALABUGIN The first group to take a stand against the regime was the Estonian Group for the Disclosure of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which was founded in 1987-1988 by dissidents who had spent many years in prison. After the text of the pact was published in the [official] media, the group transformed itself into the Estonian National Independence Party (ENIP). It has consistently followed its program since the beginning. On February 24, 1989, during celebrations marking Estonian independence day, ENIP, the Christian Union of Estonia, and the Society for the Protection of History announced a plan to register the citizens of Estonia. [People who fulfilled nationality or residency requirements were asked to register as citizens of the prewar Estonian republic.] The idea was for people to demonstrate support for the existence of an independent republic de jure, to let them acknowledge their citizenship in it, and to serve the cause of reestablishing independence. At the same time, the Estonian Popular Front, which was set up by people who had been connected to the communist party, began to split at the seams. True, it has played a progressive role. It was the first organization to speak [pageend41]40 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 up loudly, and it gave many people, including dissidents and nonconformists, the opportunity to say what they thought about the Soviet regime. It quickly became clear, however, that the popular front was organized from above. Its leaders turned out to be Gorbachev supporters. Strong disagreements developed between the front's central authorities and its regional branches. This became obvious when the front — which didn't want to join forces with ENIP and other “extremists” — made a secret agreement with the government to organize a separate rally on February 24. This was the first time since the Soviet occupation that the Estonian colors were flown above the parliament. In the course of a year, we registered 90% of all eligible residents. People stood in line during snowstorms in order to be registered. Afterwards, they elected the Congress of Estonia. Once the elections were over, the committee that organized the registration campaign dissolved itself so as to avoid the charge of undemocratic behavior. A few days before the elections, some of the people who had been denouncing the Congress decided to become candidates to the Congress's executive body, the Council. Among them were Edgar Savisaar, the current premier, who up until his candidacy had attacked us as extremists. These people were elected mainly because of a strong propaganda campaign. Our communist opponents were counting on the Congress being a one-shot thing. But the deputies decided to elect a permanent representative body and to meet whenever necessary. The Congress consisted of 550 elected deputies, including emigres, and 50 advisory representatives of Estonia's non-Estonian residents who want to become Estonian citizens. These people had also been given the right to register during the year before the elections. I consider this a very prudent measure — the idea was to take the immigrants, colonists, and occupiers “on board,” since otherwise they might turn against independence. We couldn't let the totalitarian mob simply remain a totalitarian mob. The Council of the Congress of Estonia, which currently has 55 deputies, immediately elected Tunne Kelam chairman. But at the second session of the Congress, a motion was passed giving the Congress, not just the Council, the power to elect the chairman. The motion also prohibited candidates from membership in political parties. As it turned out, the communists and the pink social democrats were in the minority on this issue, and Kelam was elected again — which of course strengthened his position, as he was elected by the entire Congress. [pageend42]STARTING ANEW 41 We dissolved the registration drive committee, and we will dissolve the Congress after democratic elections to parliament are held. True, the Congress was democratically elected, but that was during the occupation and without an independent press. In Latvia, committees still exist but they are subjected to very sharp criticism; their position is weaker. There is a much higher percentage of Russians in Latvia and the situation in the Latvian parliament is more difficult. The Congress of Estonia, on the other hand, proved to be the strongest alternative body in the entire Soviet empire. TUNNE KELAM Tunne Kelam, 56, is a historian. He is chairman of both the Congress of Estonia and of its Council. KELAM I travelled abroad the first time to Finland, when I was 3, shortly before the Nazi-Soviet pact was signed. The next time I went to the West was only two years ago. After completing my studies in 1959, I became a lecturer on international affairs and a political commentator. In the 1950s I began to ignore the Soviet mass media. I decided to learn English in order to listen to BBC radio programs, which were not jammed in Estonia; we were able to listen to Estonian and Russian-language broadcasts too. Ever since that time, the BBC has been my home radio. Later, I realized that Polish was also a good language to know — the Polish press was more independent than ours, and I could easily subscribe to it. My next step was to learn Italian just to read L'Unita — it was the best of all the communist papers available in Estonia at that time. When I read the Soviet press, I would read the Soviet edition, rather than the Estonian edition of Pravda. I joined the human rights movement in the beginning of the 1970s. In 1972, I wrote a memorandum to Kurt Waldheim, Secretary General of the United Nations, on behalf of two underground democratic groups. The memorandum called for support for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Estonia and for organizing free elections. We managed to smuggle the document over the border, but we never received any answer from the UN. The only response came from the KGB. Five members of our group were arrested and sentenced to either five or six years' imprisonment for “vicious deeds against the Soviet state.” I had not been known previously to the KGB, so I wasn't caught until a month or two after [pageend43]42 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 the others, after the first stage of the investigation was already completed. Because no evidence was found at my home and I denied all the charges, they let me go after six months of investigation. I was, however, fired from my job on the editorial board of the Estonian Encyclopedia. After 1975,1 was banned from all official positions. So I worked 10 years as a nightwatchman on a chicken farm. It proved to be the best possible thing — I fell so low that I couldn't go any lower. Moreover, I had plenty of spare time to continue my activities, above all sending appeals to the Helsinki Conference and other international organizations to help political prisoners. I was basically passing on information about what was happening here and trying to obtain information from the outside world. In those days, we had contacts in Finland. One of them was the Wurmbrand mission. Richard Wurmbrand was a Romanian clergyman who had been imprisoned for many years in Romania. Under international pressure, the government let him emigrate to the US, where he founded a mission to support believers in Soviet- bloc countries. By way of Finnish intermediaries, we received thousands of Bibles from him in Estonian, Latvian, and other languages. We also received political support from the mission, which was crucial to us in the second half of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s. At the end of the 1970s, dissidents from the three Baltic countries signed an “Appeal of 45,” addressed to the United Nations, on the anniversary of the Nazi-Soviet pact. Some years later, we actually received a reply: the first resolution of the European Parliament on the pact. At that time, we began to undertake a number of new activities. We organized “home universities,” which resembled the Polish “flying universities.” Groups of intellectuals gathered and freely discussed various subjects. All kinds of people came to these meetings, including writers, composers, and technicians. Then we entered a new period — the era of perestroika. We were skeptical about Gorbachev from the very beginning. I remember being interrogated by young Russian KGB officers, very assertive and very chauvinistic, shortly after Gorbachev came to power. They were very fond of Gorbachev — and that helped prevent me from having any illusions about him. Nor did we have any about perestroika, because we were convinced that the Soviet system could not be reformed. It was, as Solzhenitsyn put it, an evil empire founded on two pillars: lies and violence. So we continued to build independent movements. [pageend44]STARTING ANEW 43 I was one of the founders of the Estonian National Independence Party (ENIP), which was established in 1988. The next year, ENIP, the Heritage Society, and the Christian-Democratic Union began to form a broader movement: the Citizens' Committees Movement. By the end of 1989, we had succeeded in setting up a totally independent political infrastructure throughout Estonia. A group called the National Committee was established in order to prepare for elections to the Congress of Estonia, the first representative body in occupied Estonia. The National Committee's first step was to conduct a kind of census: people declared that they were, or wished to become, citizens of Estonia. They registered themselves and received cards identifying them as citizens. This census brought about a significant psychological change: thousands of people began to consider themselves legal citizens of the Estonian Republic rather than of the Soviet Union. In this manner, we built the electorate for the Congress of Estonia. In the end, 12,000 candidates ran for 500 congressional seats. This figure includes 35 representatives for Estonians living in exile (about 100,000 fled Estonia in 1944). About 35,000 Russians applied to obtain Estonian citizenship. These people now have the right to become Estonian citizens unconditionally. They were the first to take the risk, and they demonstrated with their courage that they deserve to be citizens. In the spring of 1990, we entered a very interesting period. Elections to the Estonian parliament, the Supreme Council, were held a month after the elections to the Congress of Estonia. The Supreme Council represents everyone who resides in Estonia, including 600,000 Russians and over 100,000 Soviet troops (four deputies still represent the armed forces). In effect, a dual power system came into being. On the one hand, the Congress of Estonia recognized only the continuity of the legal [pre-war] Estonian state and pressed for the restoration of legal state authority. On the other, the former communists and Soviet apparatchiks tried to legalize the Estonian Supreme Council, which meant legalizing the Soviet occupation and all the changes that took place under it. In spite of many setbacks, we should be satisfied. The plans to form a new Estonian Republic based on the Soviet heritage have failed. Over the course of the last year, the pro-Soviet Estonian elite has come to recognize the principle of the continuity of the legal Estonian state. We are in agreement on several crucial issues. Thirty delegates from the Supreme Council and thirty from the Congress are working together on a draft for a new constitution. We have agreed on the mechanisms that should govern during the tran[pageend45]44 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 sition from the Soviet political system to the legal Estonian state. The first of these will be elections to the legal parliament, the National Assembly, which will probably take place in the first half of 1992. Both the Supreme Council and the Congress will cease to exist when the Assembly's first session convenes. Despite everything we have managed to accomplish through negotiations, we continue to face a dilemma: whether to remain a Soviet satellite, like Poland and Czechoslovakia used to be, or to strive for genuine independence and democracy. The present government, particularly its head, Edgar Savisaar, has manifested dangerous authoritarian tendencies. But we may also develop a pluralistic, Western-style democracy based on a free-market economy. Under Savisaar, privatization has not been a success: state enterprises still account for 60% of the GNP. There are no guarantees for private firms or foreign investors. Thus we must devote all our efforts to winning a parliamentary majority that will support democracy and a free-market economy. We are putting a great deal of effort into ensuring that all parties and candidates to the new parliament have equal access to the media. We are also trying to obtain help from Western conservative parties to launch our own independent daily newspaper and radio station. The development of independent media is absolutely crucial, and there has been some progress on that front. It is encouraging to see publications such as the newly established independent Eesti Elu (Estonian Life) — a very vigorous paper printed outside of Tallinn, which has begun to issue various editions, an English-language monthly among them. What are the current inequities? First of all, the state-controlled press pays one-tenth as much for newsprint as everyone else. Second, state publications have favored access to printing presses and suffer from none of the delays that plague other publications. If we fail to establish independent mass media and ensure free access to the media, the hope of genuinely democratic elections will perish. ILMARS BISERS Ilmars Bisers, 61, is a professor of law and the first vice-premier of Latvia. He is a former USSR people's deputy and worked previously for the Latvian prosecutor's office. [pageend46]STARTING ANEW 45 UM What conditions did Moscow set for recognizing Latvia's independence? BISERS First of all, do you mean Yeltsin's Moscow or Gorbachev's? We have conducted negotiations with Gorbachev since February 1990. He avoided concrete matters, and only the putsch changed the situation. Yeltsin, by contrast, long ago declared his support for the independence of the Baltic countries if they wanted it, and he has remained faithful to this position ever since. We declared our independence during the putsch because we didn't know how it would end and we wanted to take advantage of perhaps our last chance to state our goals clearly. Earlier we had spoken about a transition period; discussions continued on this matter. But on August 21 we declared our independence, and on the 24th, Yeltsin issued a decree recognizing the Baltic countries as independent. I had the good fortune to witness the whole process. Soon thereafter everything seemed to happen at once — and what Gorbachev did ceased to matter. UM You say that Gorbachev didn 't matter any more, but to what extent did Gorbachev's decision to recognize Latvia change your international standing? BISERS Of course it made many things easier. Now we can discuss the army, the KGB, and border guards. Before acknowledging our independence, Gorbachev could put obstacles in our way, for example by blocking our entry into the UN. But the time has passed when he could show off his authority to the world the way Brezhnev used to, or even as he himself could a few years back. UM What unites and what divides Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in their dealings with Russia and the former Soviet Union? BISERS We are united by a common fate, not just in the recent past, but for many, many years. We are ethnically close to the Lithuanians, but our history more closely resembles Estonia's. Divisions between us stem from the desire evident throughout the Soviet Union: the desire to make decisions for ourselves. And with the move towards [pageend47]46 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 • a market economy, it's not surprising that we've been competing more with one another. But we have yet to understand that competition does not make poverty impossible. We have become poor enough to sign common political declarations. But an equitable market has not yet been established. Each of our states acts autonomously and frequently fails to inform the other two of its decisions. For example, price controls on food have been lifted in Estonia and will be abolished soon in Lithuania. We, on the other hand, promised our people that we would maintain price controls on food until January 1, although we have to rely on government subsidies to do so. Now if Lithuania does in fact decontrol prices, everything could disappear from our stores. As it is, the Estonians are already buying up things left and right. UM What position has the Baltic Council taken on this matter? BISERS Well, the Council exists, but whether its significance will increase or decrease depends on the heads of the Baltic states. UM Do you think that it is possible to speak of a common Baltic foreign and economic policy? BISERS A foreign policy, without a doubt. In economic affairs, the Baltic countries are much less coordinated; there are fundamental differences in our domestic economic policies. UM Anatolijs Gorbunovs, president of the Latvian parliament, said that the Finnish model is very important for Latvia. Do you think this model is more relevant for economic policy or for foreign relations ? BISERS It's relevant for both. Finland and Latvia are similar in that we are both small states that share a border with a much larger state. We were both once a part of that larger state, and there are still forces that wish to re-incorporate us into it. The fact that both our countries are members of the UN does not guarantee our safety: our membership in the League of Nations before the war did not protect us from annexation, after all. [pageend48]STARTING ANEW 47 UM On October 15, the Latvian parliament adopted a resolution on citizenship that primarily affects Russians living in this country. What do you think of this resolution? Have Russian or Soviet diplomats reacted to it yet? What sort of reaction does the Latvian government expect? BISERS It is not the government's task to judge resolutions passed by parliament. I haven't even received an official text of the resolution. My private opinion on this matter is the same as that expressed earlier by the government: it would be best to follow the Latvian constitution of 1919 and establish a five-year residency requirement, excluding criminals, etc. UM You said a five-year period, but the resolution specifies a 16-year period. Why so long? BISERS You should ask those who drew it up. It's important to keep in mind where many of our Russians came from. If you visited the Russian side of the border, you would think you were in the wilderness. Most'of the people who had been living there moved to our country. And many came as a result of official policy. The communists knew that the Latvian people were against the regime, so they built factories and transplanted Russians to work in them. They thought Russians were more reliable. The Latvians, however, didn't like it that the Russians felt themselves at home here. Unfortunately, the voices of fear began to speak up — the Latvian people may not survive, we will become a minority in our own country, etc. This encouraged the radicals who wanted to deny the Russians and all other Soviet immigrants citizenship. There are Russians who have been here a long time who have good relations with Latvians, and, of course, there are also many immigrants who have played a decidedly reactionary, pro-communist role lately. Sixty thousand military officers who couldn't find apartments in Russia after the war settled here, for example, so the veterans' organizations have large and influential memberships. UM Who do you have in mind when you speak of “radicals”? [pageend49]48 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 BISERS The Republican Party is extremely radical. So is the Citizens' Committee, a group of little-known people who have been trying to capture the sympathies of Latvian émigrés with a program that would defend their interests. After they registered citizens, they held elections to the Citizens' Congress. These elections were not entirely democratic... UM How many people were registered? BISERS I don't remember exactly, but it was quite a few — 800,000 or 900,000 [Latvia's population is 2.6 million]. I didn't register because I knew who was behind the movement. First they said they were more important than the Latvian Supreme Council. They declared their opposition to the path to independence that we were taking. For example, they called for a boycott of the elections to the Supreme Council and the referendum on independence. It's a small group without broad support, but it claims the backing of the 800,000 or 900,000 who participated in those elections. I should also mention the Movement for the Independence of Latvia, which was established in 1988 along with the Latvian Popular Front. The movement currently constitutes the right wing of the front, but it is more moderate than the Citizens' Committee. UM Do you think it would be dangerous for the Latvian nation if citizenship were granted to all the residents of the country? BISERS First I must say that I am against the resolution on citizenship, because I think that everyone should have the right to choose. I think that many of the Russians here, perhaps a third, don't believe in the future of this country and don't want to tie themselves to it. They want to live in Latvia for economic reasons, but they want to remain citizens of Russia, so they would have somewhere to turn to if something happened. But I repeat: I think that immigrants who want to be loyal citizens of Latvia should be granted all the rights of citizenship, including representation in parliament. After all, if they can't defend their interests in parliament, they'll take to the streets. I would not worry about a parliament with a large number of non-Latvian deputies. We've already had three elections: [pageend50]STARTING ANEW 49 to the USSR Supreme Soviet, the Latvian Supreme Council, and to the local councils. In each of these elections the popular front's candidates won 2/3 to 3/4 of the votes, although all the residents of Latvia took part in them, including the soldiers stationed here. It was the same with the referendum on independence: 74% of those participating in it — 64% of all the inhabitants of Latvia — favored independence. That means that a significant proportion of our Russian population supported independence. If we implement the right policies, these people will be our allies, not our enemies. ROMUALDAS RAZUKAS Romualdas Razukas, 37, an ethnic Lithuanian, is a neurosurgeon and the chairman of the Latvian Popular Front. RAZUKAS The Latvian Popular Front is approaching its Fourth Congress, which will take place from the 15th to the 17th of November. There will be ten working groups whose task will be to prepare the front's program. When elections are held to parliament — they probably won't be held for at least another year, but then again, we never thought we'd win our independence so quickly — this program will become our election platform. Our current organization, in contrast to the Estonian Popular Front and Sajudis, is very strong. We're like a party, with one big difference: members of other parties can join us as individuals. A year ago, we had between 170,000 and 180,000 members, but political activism has declined since then. A nation can't be politically active for a long time. Nonetheless, we still count about 100,000 members, and 85% of them don't belong to any other political organization. Political organizations are poorly developed in Latvia. For example, the Latvian Democratic Party of Labor — the former communists — has 7,100 members. Other parties have no more than a few thousand, and often only a few hundred. The communists are nonetheless very strong. That's why we want to maintain our structure for at least another year: we need to help the political parties. So long as the current parliament — which was elected before we declared our independence — remains in power, the majority of our members believe that we should continue to play the . same role. In this way, we can protect the still-imperfect mechan[pageend51]so UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 ism of democracy. We are the main buttress of stability in the state, which does not yet have an army, border guards, or a police force that is consistently loyal. Strong political parties will claim their place in national politics and a multiparty system will appear when society is ready to accept such a development. Unfortunately, not all of our politicians understand this — many of them are calling upon the front to become a real political party right away. But whenever you try to force something, and especially when you try to do it from above, you end up ruining what was already accomplished, and then it is almost impossible to go back to what you had. The communists like to say that the popular front replaced the communist party. Of course, they have their reasons. The front is fighting illegal privatization. For example, when the management of an enterprise buys up everything at rock-bottom prices, the front says: you can't do that. We don't let the communists steal, so they say that the front is a new monopoly party. I am deeply convinced that the popular front is now where Solidarity was when it was created. Except Poland had more sovereignty than Latvia does now. Our task is to bring a normal market economy into existence. This is extremely difficult. But all of society has an interest in seeing that as many people as possible have the opportunity to start their own businesses. I think that the populai * front will gain the nation's support in this matter. As for international contacts, we have 16 branches supporting the popular front among the Latvian émigré community, primarily in the US, Canada, Sweden, Germany, and Australia. We have good contacts with political parties in the Scandinavian countries — not to mention with the former republics of the USSR, including Sajudis in Lithuania, the Estonian Popular Front, the Byelorussian Popular Front, Rukh in Ukraine, and groups in Armenia and Georgia. I understand the problems of national minorities quite well, because I myself belong to a minority group and because I began my career in the Union of National Cultural Minorities of Latvia. A colleague and I wrote the law on cultural autonomy that was adopted by parliament. For me, the most important thing is cultural autonomy and the protection of human rights. The citizenship issue, however, is a political problem. Thank God it's moving toward a solution. At the moment, there are no ethnic tensions in Latvia. In the provinces, people understand that the question of citizenship shouldn't be settled in haste. People are [pageend52]STARTING ANEW 51 mainly interested in who will have the right to choose local government officials. We maintain that citizenship should be extended to everyone who has lived in the country for at least five years. This is the law everywhere else in the world. Many people here agree with this. That's why I think that this problem can be solved. In fact, it is being solved: parliament has already adopted a preliminary resolution. We think that when the citizenship law is ready, a referendum should be held. We can't prolong discussion on this matter forever. If we do, various political groups might exploit it. When I say this, I also have in mind the conservative approach of the Citizens' Committee. This approach has no perspective. The idea of defending the rights of individuals who were citizens in 1940 is right. But the idea that a parliament chosen only by the citizens from 1940 should have the exclusive right to solve our problems is not worth taking seriously. We live in 1991 and must respond to the problems of our day. After the citizenship law is passed, we will be able to choose a new parliament that will consist not of the greatest patriots, but of specialists who will be able to deal with the economy, privatization, etc. — the things that are most important for us now. AIGARS JIRGENS Aigars Jirgens, 32, is vice-chairman of the Latvian Citizens' Committee. JIRGENS The Citizens' Congress defends the rights of the citizens of the Latvian Republic — the one that was established on November 18, 1918. Elections to the Congress lasted from the 8th to the 23rd of April, 1990. The first session took place on April 30 and May 1. Sessions are held every three months. Our movement stems from the registration of people who were Latvian citizens before the war and their offspring. Over 700,000 participated in the elections to the Congress, which was more than half of those eligible to do so. Practically all the political parties that were active at the time of the elections are represented in the Congress, with the exception of the Communist Party of Latvia, which is now banned, and the Independent Communist Party, which has changed its name to the Democratic Party of Labor. Its members are all communists and members of the nomenklatura. Almost 2/3 of the delegates belong [pageend53]52 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 to the Movement for the National Independence of Latvia. But it's a movement, not a party. The parties were still weak, and therefore are poorly represented in the Congress. The Latvian Popular Front, though, is well represented. I think that the majority of the Congress's delegates are more congenial to conservative, right- wing traditions. There are many fewer who consider themselves social democrats. Relations with the leadership of the popular front are quite complex — and chilly. This is because the popular front's leaders don't carry out the decisions taken by its membership at its congresses, not to mention those of the Citizens' Congress. For example, the Latvian Supreme Council has adopted a resolution on citizenship which mentions the process of naturalization of citizens of the Soviet Union residing in Latvia. At the Third Congress of the Latvian Popular Front, however, it was decided that the number of people eligible for citizenship would not be increased before a fully legitimate government was established. This is quite a contradiction, but the popular front's leaders don't seem to be concerned about it. I would like to make a clear distinction between the front's leadership and its local branches. A few of the branches are dominated by representatives of the Democratic Party of Labor, who support the Latvian Supreme Council; but most of them support the Citizens' Congress. The Movement for the National Independence of Latvia is undergoing a complex change. The leadership of the movement also sits in the Latvian Supreme Council, where it does a very poor job of representing the interests of the Latvian nation and of carrying out the movement's program. Ideas have been floated to transform the movement into a party — although many of the movement's members are against such a plan and have already signed declarations against it. We have contacts with Latvian émigrés, a number of whom support us. The leaderships of the most important émigré organizations, however, have adopted Council positions and give us little, if any, support. The KGB has done much work among the émigrés; a number of representatives of the front, some of whom were KGB agents, have gone abroad, as have members of the Latvian Supreme Council, who have much more money and other resources than we do. There are no major differences between the Congress of Estonia and the Congress of Latvia. The Estonians held elections two months earlier than we did, and there are slight structural differ[pageend54]STARTING ANEW 53 ences. However, the two Congresses face different political situations. Political parties are much stronger in Estonia than in Latvia, and it is between these parties that the significant political battles are fought. The Latvian Supreme Council does not acknowledge the existence of the Latvian Congress — a majority of the delegates of the Supreme Council are communists and former communists defending the interests of the nomenklatura. The Estonian Supreme Council, on the other hand, recognized the Estonian Congress at its first sitting: it declared that the Congress expressed the will of the nation in its effort to rebuild a legitimate government. Half of the members of the new constitutional assembly come from the' Supreme Council and half from the Congress. Estonia needs a new constitution, because the last pre-war constitution, from 1938, was undemocratic. The last constitution of an independent Latvia, from 1922, does not require major revision. Our citizenship law from 1937 was one of the best in Europe — and foreigners agree with this assessment. But our Supreme Council doesn't acknowledge this; it prefers legislation in the Soviet style. We also find the Supreme Council's position on citizenship unacceptable. If things keep going like this, we will have two states in Latvia: one consisting of citizens to whom we have granted rights (those who were citizens before 1940 and their offspring); and one for Soviet colonists who become citizens following procedures set by the Latvian Supreme Council. Our task is to bring this difference of opinion to society's attention. The first thing that must be accomplished before the next parliamentary elections is the withdrawal of Soviet forces from our territory. Their presence precludes the possibility of free elections, not for military but for psychological reasons. They simply make people afraid. And the degree of support for our program depends on how afraid people are — and by extension, the extent of our popular support shapes our decisions. Basically there are three possible solutions: the Congress itself could organize the elections; it could invite parties to participate in elections called by the Supreme Council; or it could call for a boycott of the elections. Of course, the election law adopted by the Supreme Council will also be important: it will decide whether 5%, 25%, or 80% of the Russians will be eligible to vote. Nothing is certain in this matter at the moment. [pageend55]54 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 ZIGMAS VAISVILA Zigmas Vaisvila, 36, is a deputy prime minister of Lithuania and one of the founders and leaders of the Lithuanian Green Party. UM What conditions did Moscow set for recognizing Lithuania's independence? VAISVILA There were no conditions. During negotiations with Russia, we discussed the future of Russians living in Lithuania and signed protocols on subjects that concerned both sides. One of them addressed the problem of Russian specialists at our oil refinery who wished to leave Lithuania; another guaranteed the Russians access to the Kaliningrad region through Lithuanian territory. UM In what way did the establishment of relations with Gorbachev's Moscow change the international standing of Lithuania? VAISVILA Moscow was late in recognizing Lithuanian independence. Gorbachev has always been late with his decisions — to his own disadvantage as well as ours. Still, Moscow's recognition of our statehood was important, even though the Soviets failed to mention important historical facts, such as the occupation of Lithuania since 1940. It paved the way for other countries to recognize us. Of course, it gave rise to new international problems that we, Moscow, and the West must face. For instance, the problem of the Soviet army, which has no business being in our country. . It seems the West was unprepared for the rapid series of events that followed the August coup attempt. We, on the other hand, have been eagerly responding to the consequences of our newly won independence. We have been attending various international conferences, seminars, and meetings, and we are beginning to discuss our future in Europe. We have already begun to address the problem of national security, although we have not yet decided with whom we should be allied. UM What unites and what divides the three Baltic states in terms of their relations with the former Soviet Union? [pageend56]STARTING ANEW 55 VAISVILA We have shared the same fate since 1940. Over the last three years, our efforts to win independence have been similar. But there are differences. Lithuania was the first of the three states to declare independence — we did so long before the August coup. We are ahead of the others in the transition to a free-market system. A multi-tiered system of social care has already been established. All this can be attributed to the fact that 80% of our population is native Lithuanian (a much higher percentage of the population than native Estonians or Latvians in their countries) and that our government has had comparatively few problems passing legislation in parliament. Moscow made use of different tactics against the three Baltic states in order to divide us. These tactics failed, and now we are trying to help each other. We have signed a number of agreements, the most recent one on a customs system. We are trying to coordinate political decisions and have established the Baltic Council toward this end. This coordination is crucial right now, because the Moscow of Gorbachev continues to play the same old games. The Kremlin's motivation is clear: it wants to save the empire. The August coup attempt — an element in the game plan — was meant to keep Gorbachev at his post for another two or three months, where he would serve as a guarantor of the unity of the Soviet Union. All multinational empires have come apart in the past, and so it is with the Soviet empire. We are willing to resume talks about a “common house,” but only in the future. The collapse of the Soviet empire has been accompanied by a dangerous belief that economic recovery can be achieved without decentralization, free-market reform, or privatization. Most Russians want economic centralization, which means they are losing time in implementing the necessary radical changes. During the negotiations with the Russians, I came to realize two things. Though the Russian representatives seem frank and sincere, we have never been officially informed as to who is empowered to negotiate with us on behalf of the central Soviet authorities. And the Russian negotiators don't share the same views on economic matters. Owing to the murkiness of their authority and positions, very little has been formally settled between us. We have maintained an uncompromising policy towards the Soviets, and in this respect Lithuania is to some extent different from its Baltic neighbors. [pageend57]56 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 UM What sort of relations do you have with the Lithuanian émigré community ? VAISVILA Most of the Lithuanians living in the West left the country at the beginning of the 20th century or shortly after World War 13. Their role in our history is unique in that they preserved our language in its pure form, untainted by foreign — that is, Russian — influences. They observed our national traditions and customs though they were deprived of the right to return to their native country. We have excellent contacts with them, and they have given us considerable support. Our national identity could face a new threat: an influx of foreigners into our country. Though this immigration is motivated by economic reasons, it carries with it the dangers of further de- Lithuanization and increased organized crime. Most of the crime committed by the various mafias goes unpunished. Responsibility for this state of affairs lies with the old system of justice. We are working hard to replace the whole rotten system we inherited. The process is very painful. UM Do you think the communists could stage a comeback in Lithuania ? VAISVILA The communists' self-confidence vanished after the failure of the August coup. The communist-dominated local authorities have undergone a marked change in attitude toward us. Also, I think many communists have come to the realization that their economic system is bankrupt. However, they are still able to exert considerable influence on public opinion through the mass media, which they still control to a great extent. The lack of unbiased information has made itself felt especially keenly in the countryside. People there have no idea what a “free-market economy” means, and thus they are usually against change. This attitude is a serious brake on reform. On the whole, I feel we have succeeded in implementing a number of irreversible changes and in tearing down — in a very short time — the wall that divided qs from the West. Correction: The interview with Bohdan Voloshynsky entitled ‘ ‘The Story of Democracy in a Ukrainian Town” in the Fall 1991 issue of Uncaptive Minds was conducted by Monika Agopsowicz. [pageend58]LATVIA 57 THE CONTROVERSY OVER CITIZENSHIP by Alexei Grigorievs Alexei Grigorievs, who is of Latvian-Russian parentage, is a deputy to the Latvian parliament, the Supreme Council. He has served as editor-in- chief of the Russian edition of Atmoda, the weekly of the Latvian Popular Front. He wrote the following article for Uncaptive Minds in January 1992. In 1940, the Baltic states were erased from the political map of Europe. Many of the Western nations refused, however, to recognize the incorporation of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania into the USSR. De jure, the Baltic states never ceased to exist during the period of Soviet annexation, and they have now regained their de facto independence. The Baltic peoples stress that recent political changes constitute a renewal of independence. Legal continuity with the first republic provides many Latvians with a sense of history and of belonging to the Western tradition. But this continuity also provides radical nationalists with an argument for excluding the one million Russian-speaking inhabitants of Latvia from the nation's civic and political life. The nationalists contend that the legal continuity of the state entails continuity of citizenship: only those individuals who were Latvian citizens before the annexation of 1940 and their descendants can be regarded as citizens of Latvia today. All others must undergo the process of naturali zation to become Latvian citizens. [pageend59]58 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 The terras and procedures of naturalization have been the subject of much debate both in the parliament and in the press. One proposal was the so-called zero option. If adopted, it would have granted citizenship to whomever requested it. This proposal was rejected, however, early in the debate. On October 15, 1991, parliament adopted a preliminary resolution entitled “On the Renewal of the Rights of Citizens of the Republic of Latvia and on Naturalization.” This resolution is the unfortunate product of compromise. Taking “Equal Rights’ ’ as its rallying cry, the communist parliamentary faction all but abstained from the debate and vote on the naturalization law. The communists maintained that the very idea of naturalization was repugnant and that citizenship should automatically be extended to every resident of Latvia. As a result of the communists' withdrawal from the debate, the moderates were left alone to face the vocal, well-organized nationalists. The goal of the nationalists was simply to renew the rights of individuals who had been citizens in 1940 and their descendants. The immediate recognition of the rights of “pure citizens” in the adopted resolution was thus a victory for the nationalists. In establishing conditions for naturalization, on the other hand, the moderates scored a modest success. But if parliament is dissolved during the period set for the beginning of the naturalization process (October 15, 1991 through July 1, 1992), only the citizens of 1940 and their descendants will be eligible to vote, thus leaving half of the Latvian population without political representation. The nationalists were able to leave their mark on the requirements of naturalization established by the parliamentary resolution. Applicants for naturalization must have been permanent residents of Latvia for at least 16 years, they must be conversationally fluent in Latvian, they must give up their existing citizenship, they must demonstrate familiarity with the Latvian constitution, and they must pledge their loyalty to the republic. The law is very exclusive and renders a number of broad categories of Latvian residents ineligible for Latvian citizenship. Anyone who received treatment for drug addiction or alcoholism will be denied citizenship, as will anyone lacking a legal source of income in Latvia. Individuals who arrived in Latvia after June 17, 1940 as functionaries of the communist party or the communist youth league will be excluded from citizenship. Similarly, retirees from the Soviet armed forces, interior ministry forces, and the KGB cannot become citizens of Latvia unless they had originally been drafted from Latvia. Anyone guilty of a criminal offense, of fighting against independence and parliamentary democracy, of war crimes or crimes against humanity will be denied Latvian citizenship. So too will anyone found to have participated in mass repression or to have disseminated chauvinistic, fascist, communist, or other totalitarian ideas. Many of these exclusionary conditions seem extreme and even a little absurd. Yet the Latvian people have legitimate concerns about preserving their [pageend60]LATVIAN CITIZENSHIP 39 ethnic identity. Between 1940 and 1950, some 600,000 people out of Latvia's population of 2 million vanished. Some were killed by Germans, some by Soviets; some fled West, some went East. There were also massive deportations of Latvians deemed “class enemies” to Siberia — where most of them eventually died. The Latvians that remained were subjected to a Russification campaign. Russians and other Soviet nationalities were encouraged to settle en masse in Latvia. As a result, the Latvians are very nearly a minority in their own country. The controversy over citizenship has brought the legitimacy of the Latvian Supreme Council into question. Many of the “pure citizens” of Latvia, fearing the possible outcome of elections, organized a citizens' movement. They registered Latvian residents who were citizens in 1940 and their descendants and formed a Citizens' Congress headed by a Citizens' Committee. Initially, moderates in the Latvian Popular Front supported this movement as an alternative to achieving independence through the supreme council. But while the moderates participated in the electoral campaign for the supreme council, radicals like Aigars Jirgens gained control of the Citizens' Committee. As a result, the Citizens' Committee is now a radical nationalist opposition to the supreme council and the government. According to the Citizens' Committee, the supreme council, since it was elected under Soviet law, does not have the right to decide an issue of such fundamental importance as the law on citizenship. Their indignation is all the greater because those elections were open to all residents of Latvia, which included not only post-1940 arrivals but also all military personnel temporarily stationed in Latvia at that time. The nationalists' arguments have gained support outside their own circles. Some leaders of the popular front, notably Romualdas Razukas, have adopted a similar stand. In attacking the supreme council, however, the nationalists overlook one important point. If the supreme council had authority to declare independence and was up to that challenge, shouldn't it also be able to resolve the issue of citizenship? With the demise of the Soviet Union, many Latvian residents who did not qualify for immediate citizenship have been left without any citizenship at all. This is unjust — and all the more unfair given the support Russian inhabitants of Latvia demonstrated for Latvian independence. The pro-independence Latvian Popular Front would not have won its electoral victories without the votes of Latvia's Russian inhabitants. In the March 1991 referendum, 73% of the total population voted in favor of independence. This figure undermines the oft-heard argument that Russians, if granted Latvian citizenship, would support some sort of incorporation into Russia. Still, many of Latvia's Russian residents fear that denial of their political rights might be only the first step [pageend61]60 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 of radical nationalistic legislation against them. Under current law, for instance, non-citizens do not have the right to own land, and many fear that further restrictions are on the way. The Latvian government's stance on citizenship has drawn criticism from human rights groups from around the world. For example, according to the American organization Helsinki Watch, the new law on citizenship violates the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as well as the spirit of the various CSCE agreements. Unfortunately, Helsinki Watch and other Western human rights organizations have not fully taken into account the complex issues that have arisen in connection with the resumption of Latvian independence. In particular, there has been no discussion of the legal arguments against a restrictive citizenship law. Nonetheless, Western criticism has a role to play in the arduous task of reconciling the. interests of the Latvian nation-state and the human and civil rights of Latvia's Russian inhabitants. No doubt the issue of citizenship — the problem of determining just who is indeed a Latvian — will remain one of the most important issues in Latvian political life and will continue to threaten the country's stability. [pageend62]CZECHOSLOVAKIA 61 interview with JÁN ČARNOGURSKÝ Ján Čamogurský is the prime minister of the Slovak Republic and the head of the KDH (the Christian-Democratic Movement of Slovakia). The following interview was conducted by Vladimír Mlynář and appeared in the November 18-24 issue of the Czech weekly Respekt. POLITICS DOES NOT ALWAYS HAVE TO BE ETHICAL RESPEKT After the latest round of negotiations between the leaders of the Czech and Slovak parliaments on the future of Czechoslovakia, you stated that you will soon propose a “looser association” to the Czech side. Do you mean a confederation? CARNOGURSKY What I said was that if the leaders of the Czech and Slovak parliaments do not come to an agreement, I will propose a looser association — that is, a confederation or a union. We want both republics to be able to co-exist under one roof, in a common state, but the Czech delegation insists that a common state means a federation, not a confederation. I don't agree with that. In the course of previous negotiations we agreed on a common president, cabinet, and parliament as well as a common defense, foreign policy, finances, and other things. So in practical terms, we have accepted President Havel's proposals. But the Czech side does not think this is the case. It refuses to accept a state treaty [pageend63]Photo: Krzysztof Miller Ján Čarnogurský [pageend64]POLITICS DOES NOT ... 63 between the republics, and it is not satisfied with the proposed common sphere mentioned above. RESPEKT During the recent KDH congress you stated that if the idea of a "loose association ” is not accepted, your party will assent to a referendum. How would you present the question to voters? CARNOGURSKY I believe there is still hope for the republics to come to an agreement without having to call a referendum. But if it turns out that no agreement is possible and no form of looser state association is acceptable, then I will support a referendum. The problem, however, is that no party, including the KDH, has managed to formulate a question that would bring a clear answer in favor of either a firm state structure or a loose one. RESPEKT A while back you said you would like to replace liberalism with Christian democracy. How would you achieve this? CARNOGURSKY By disseminating our ideas. RESPEKT What ties does the KDH have with the Catholic clergy? Do you consult with the Church on political matters? CARNOGURSKY Our ties with the Church are based on the fact that we derive our ideas from Christianity. As a political force, we want to improve conditions for the Church's work. We don't seek advice from the Church, but sometimes we consult with it on matters pertaining to its own activities, for instance, legislation regulating church- state relations. RESPEKT Does the KDH want to ban abortions and introduce compulsory courses on religion into public schools? CARNOGURSKY We want to make a course on ethics compulsory. Students or their parents would choose between a religious class or a secular one. By the way, even in Church-run schools there is no compulsory religious education. [pageend65]64 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 With regard to abortion: the KDH wants to amend the law regulating abortion, which is more liberal than in any other European country. We would like to limit abortion. RESPEKT What do you mean when you say “limit abortion”? CARNOGURSKY I cannot answer this precisely. This is a technical question which we have not yet discussed. RESPEKT The Catholic Church has concrete views concerning abortion — it is explicitly against it. Won't the clergy accuse you of being soft if you only “limit” abortion? CARNOGURSKY No. The KDH is a political movement, and as such, it must work with other political forces in parliament to achieve its objectives. This applies not only to abortion, but to other matters as well. RESPEKT The KDH recently attacked a literary journal for publishing a short story entitled “The Last Supper. ” Jozef Miklosko [a deputy prime minister in the federal government] even called for prosecution of the journal and the story's author. Why hasn't the Slovak government reacted as strongly to anti-Semitic publications? CARNOGURSKY We consider this short story to be an egregious slander against Christians. As long as the KDH exists, it will oppose the right to freely publish such texts. It's not true that we haven't taken action against anti-Semitic publications. I myself sent a letter to the prosecutor general regarding the publication of the “Protocols of the Elders of Zion.” In these matters, however, we use the same criteria as Western European countries. I myself, however, don't know if publishing such things is considered a criminal offense there. RESPEKT But in Western democracies, the publication of much more scandalous stories than ‘ ‘The Last Supper ’ ’ is not subject to prosecution. [pageend66]POLITICS DOES NOT ... 65 CARNOGURSKY We have our own opinion about texts such as “The Last Supper.” RESPEKT How do you view the relationship between ethics and politics? Do you think that politicians should be guided by ethical principles? In your case let's talk about Christian principles. CARNOGURSKY It is certainly possible and positive to be guided by moral or, if you wish, Christian principles in politics. But 1 would never claim that politics is always ethical. RESPEKT Are you yourself guided by moral principles in politics ? CARNOGURSKY I cannot render a judgement in this matter, because I cannot look at myself from a distance. But I do look upon morality as a base and a goal of my political activity. RESPEKT In an interview, you described yourself as a politician who uses various masks according to need. This sounds more Machiavellian than Christian. CARNOGURSKY In different political situations one uses different approaches. Today, for instance, I saw a representative of a group of hunger strikers and the representatives of the initiative for the common state. Now I am talking to you, and later I will have dinner with representatives of various political parties. If I told everyone the same thing, emphasizing the same problems, we wouldn't be able to communicate with each other. Tactics, in my opinion, are a necessary part of politics. Only sometimes does a politician have to be firm. The advancement of the political interests of Christianity, democracy, and Slovakia, continues, of course, to be the foundation of my political activity. RESPEKT What specifically do you wish to achieve through your political activity? [pageend67]66 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 CARNOGURSKY My goal is a star for Slovakia in the European flag — that is, membership in the European Community with the same status as other member states. This goal should not be considered the same thing as demanding Slovak independence. In about ten years the European nations will not exist as completely independent states, but as separate members of the European Community or some new independent association. This is how I understand the separate star for Slovakia. RESPEKT Let's go back to the matter of morality and pragmatism in politics. Before the revolution, you were a leading Catholic dissident, one of very few dissidents in Slovakia. Were you also pragmatic back then ? CARNOGURSKY I participated only in those activities against the communist regime which I thought made sense and had a chance for success — that is, activities that would be acceptable to other people. I did not participate in actions that were too radical or unnecessarily risky, and thus unacceptable to the majority of citizens. I act the same way now. If you consider my behavior pragmatic now, then I was also pragmatic before November 17, 1989. RESPEKT You seem to be saying that you support only that which has a chance to win the support of the majority of citizens. According to public opinion polls, a separate Slovak state is not in this category. When you say that you support the common state, isn 't this just a tactical move? CARNOGURSKY No, but I admit that many Czechs may see it that way. I am not a separatist, because Slovak membership in the EC and an independent Slovakia are not identical for me. I am looking after the real interests of Slovakia, and I know that independence for Slovakia today would be harmful. It would cause such domestic and international problems that the Slovak state probably wouldn't survive. RESPEKT What do you think about Matica slovenská [Slovak Motherland Society]? Its chairman, JozefMarkus, is not the only former security police collaborator among its leaders. [pageend68]POLITICS DOES NOT ... 67 CARNOGURSKY Matica is one of the few Slovak institutions with a long tradition. For this reason alone it is valuable to Slovakia and deserves state support. I have my reservations concerning its present political profile. Unlike Czech democrats, however, I see proof that democracy exists in Slovakia, among other things, in that nationalist ideas can be freely expressed. Who the leaders of Matica are is an internal matter of that organization, and I have no intention to interfere in it. RESPEKT It is widely believed in Slovakia that former security police collaborators have entered into an alliance with separatist forces in the hope that an independent Slovak state would allow them to gain important public positions. CARNOGURSKY This whole national question is emotionally charged. Naturally, some people would like to forget their past, and an easy way to do so is to join a new emotional wave. But it would be a mistake to explain away the phenomenon of Slovak nationalism as a plot hatched by former communists and a few nationalists. The national idea is an historic strength of Slovakia. I see it as a positive force, though it does contain many risks and dangers. RESPEKT When environmental groups demonstrated some time ago against the Gabčíkovo dam, the police used force against them. When separatists threw eggs at President Havel, the police did not take action. Can you explain this discrepancy? CARNOGURSKY At Gabčíkovo, demonstrators trespassed onto the construction site, where demonstrations are not allowed. Besides, they wanted to damage a construction project worth 15 billion crowns. The police acted in accordance with the law, and nobody was seriously injured. When the president was pelted in Bratislava, the police were not prepared because they could not have known that eggs were going to be thrown. In any case, the police respected the wishes •of the organizers and limited themselves to practical steps to prevent scuffles between competing groups of demonstrators. [pageend69]68 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 RESPEKT Your brother Ivan has been accused by some people of collaborating with the security police. They say that even though he did not sign a collaboration agreement, he gave the police information about his foreign trips. If he asked you whether he should leave politics on account of these allegations, what would you advise him to do? CARNOGURSKY A few months ago, when my brother was accused of collaborating with the security police, he was said to have informed on me and our father. This is not true. The whole family knew that the security police was attempting to establish contact with him, and he discussed this with us. The documents that have been sold on the streets as copies of his file make clear that he did not provide the security police with any concrete information. Everyone should be able to choose his own way to avoid pressure applied by the security police. I have no reason to doubt my brother. Uncaptive Minds would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the editor- in-chief of Respekt, Ivan Lamper, for being named International Editor of the Year by World Press Review. [pageend70]CZECHOSLOVAKIA 69 interview With JAN KALVODA The following interview with Jan Kalvoda, deputy chairman of the Czech National Council (the parliament of the Czech Republic), was conducted by Jan Brabec and appeared in the November 18-24 issue of the Czech weekly Respekt. THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE A SHAM RESPEKT IThe delegation of the Czech parliament] recently met, for the thirteenth time, with the Slovak delegation. Were you able to come to an agreement on any substantial issue concerning the fiiture of the common Czech and Slovak state? KALVODA No, we weren't. The negotiations are very problematic. We arc not discussing what should be discussed; thus, the issues that really divide us are being obscured. RESPEKT There is talk now about transferring the negotiations to the federal parliament. Why wasn't the federal government invited to participate in the negotiations sooner? KALVODA The federal government now boldly proclaims its entrance onto the stage. But in my opinion, it should have been there all along. It has only itself to blame for the widespread perception that it is passive and indifferent. No political or constitutional body was pre[pageend71]70 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 venting the federal parliament from pursuing one of its duties: shaping the new constitution. The Czech National Council never negotiated anything with its Slovak counterpart other than an agreement to sponsor a draft law defining the structure of the federation. The Czech parliament always refused on principle to negotiate any form of treaty that would treat the Czech and Slovak Republics as separate states. RESPEKT The proposed legislation that would have permitted a referendum on this matter was not adopted. Given that the Slovaks refuse to accept any important aspect of the federation, is there any chance at all for an agreement? KALVODA Czech politicians avoid getting into disputes with Slovak politicians because they don't want to confront Slovak nationalism, which is on the rise. This appeasing approach has helped to create the present stalemate. It has allowed Slovak politicians to avoid taking a clear position on important issues such as the structure of Czechoslovakia. For example, the KDH (Christian Democratic Movement of Slovakia) proclaims that it supports a common state, yet it lays down conditions that would make such a state impossible. The Czech Republic has not reacted to this strongly enough, so it is also responsible. RESPEKT Why does the KDH behave in such a manner? KALVODA I am convinced that the KDH wants an independent Slovakia, but it is afraid to proclaim this aim clearly to the people of Slovakia, because it knows that they know the negative consequences — especially with regard to the economy — of separation. So the KDH has chosen to gradually step up its demands, betting that the Czech side, which strongly supports the common state and has a sense of responsibility for the geopolitical stability of the region, will not stand up to them. The KDH will, exploit the Czechs' compliance to weaken the Czechoslovak state and eventually, by small • steps, to reach its goal of an independent Slovakia. RESPEKT It is said that only extremists want an independent Slovak state. Supposedly, a silent majority of Slovaks is against it. [pageend72]THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE A SHAM 71 KALVODA A longing for independence exists in Slovakia, but no one has yet given it a clear political form. All the separatist parties and organizations are simply riding this wave of nationalism, this longing. In my opinion, the only way to save the state is to stabilize the political scene. That means that the actors on the political scene must abide by the rules of politics and answer for the consequences of their actions. We were willing to negotiate without clearly defined goals, and the result has been a gigantic political sham. We have been pretending to negotiate on a common state, while the Slovaks have been talking about something completely different. RESPEKT This sounds very pessimistic. If the Slovak representation to the talks persists in this approach, what do you think will happen? KALVODA It must be stated clearly: we [the representation of the Czech National Council] do not have a mandate to discuss anything except a common state. You, gentlemen, [from the Slovak parliament] go back to Slovakia and make up your minds there. Either call the referendum, which is the constitutional way and certainly the democratic one, or wait until the next elections and campaign on the platform of Slovak independence. Any other way of settling this problem is undemocratic and cowardly. RESPEKT Will the Slovak side accept such a challenge? KALVODA I don't know. But we ought to try this approach. RESPEKT What do you fUink of the Slovaks’ proposal to make a state treaty the legal basis of the common Czech and Slovak state? KALVODA A state treaty is incompatible with the principle of a common state, and those who propose it know that. Such a treaty is signed by two fully sovereign republics. We have wasted a year explaining to Slovak politicians the elementary fact that if they want a state treaty, then the federation must first be dissolved. For a long time we could not understand why they have been so insistent on this point and why they couldn't understand this basic fact. Now I think [pageend73]72 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 I understand. The KDH has big ambitions in Slovakia, but it fears the other large Slovak party — Vladimir Medar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). The KDH has conducted pseudonegotiations on a common state because, although it wants independence, it's afraid it couldn't compete with Medar's party in an independent Slovakia. RESPEKT Does KDH chairman Ján Čarnogurský have a substantially different view of Slovak independence than Mečiar? KALVODA I remember an old judge who caught one of my clients lying once. He told me, “You can lose your credibility only once, and when you do, you won't get it back again.” Medar has never bothered to be truthful in his political statements. It is not possible to deal with such a man. This is something the Czech side has not been willing to admit. When it caught Mečiar lying it should have said publicly: Mečiar is a liar and we will not recognize him as a partner in future negotiations. Čarnogurský has concealed his goal: to achieve independence for Slovakia sooner than the ten years he has stated in the past. You have to remember that Mečiar was a federalist when he was the prime minister of Slovakia. He only began to promote the idea of confederation as an opposition politician. RESPEKT What view does Public Against Violence (VPN) take on Slovak independence ? KALVODA VPN is in a very difficult position, and I take off my hat to those few politicians who have not yielded to the general atmosphere and who have stood by the democratic idea and defended the federation. In fact, some of its leaders are openly discussing leaving the Slovak governing coalition because they know the government is not seriously negotiating for a common state. There is a moral aspect of politics and in certain key moments one has to take a stand for principles without regard to tactical advantage. But not all VPN leaders are so inclined. When Mečiar was splitting up VPN, many of its leaders were afraid to take a clear stand because they feared VPN could disappear from the Slovak political scene. What I want to know is, What was VPN saving itself for? VPN has not taken full advantage of its potential as a political force. [pageend74]THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE A SHAM 73 RESPEKT How has the Czech National Council reacted to the negotiations conducted by its representatives? KALVODA Last September the Council passed a resolution which states that we are only authorized to negotiate on the basis of a common state. I am beginning to wonder whether a large number of deputies changed their views — especially those from the Civic Movement, the KSČM [the communists], and the Democratic Left [a splinter group from the communists]. I am also beginning to wonder whether these deputies intend to negotiate on a new basis and thus outside the framework of the constitution. This could soon crop up as a major parliamentary battle. At least Czech Prime Minister Petr Pithart, so far as I can tell, is on the right side. RESPEKT Pithart, in a recent televised speech, proclaimed his understanding for the feelings of the Slovak nationalists. The Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) leader, Daniel Kroupa, reacted by saying that he is ashamed of the prime minister, who does not seem to have any sympathy for the Slovak democrats. Do you think that the democratic forces in Slovakia are threatened? KALVODA Yes. I think that the ideology of the major Slovak parties such as the HZDS and the KDH is not particularly friendly to democracy. Mečiar's party obviously, because it is a quasi-communist movement. I am afraid that Čamogurský and the leaders of the KDH do not consider democracy to be their aim, to be a standard against which to measure their actions. They seem to feel that they are on a Christian mission, which is something quite removed from modernity. Jan Čamogurský, after all, has attacked liberalism in a dangerously intolerant manner. RESPEKT If Slovakia became an independent state, what would be the prospects for democracy? KALVODA It depends on whether the state were established in a constitutional manner. If it were, it would be a sign of the viability of democracy in Slovakia. However, the economy is likely to worsen, which would tempt the leadership to appeal to nationalist feelings and look for [pageend75]74 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 scapegoats. If this happens, then the prospects for democrapy would be nil — as would the prospects for national minorities. If Slovakia proclaimed its sovereignty, then any actions taken by the Slovak administration would violate the federal constitution, even if some insist that such a declaration would only be a symbolic act without practical consequences. The federal authorities would face a serious dilemma. If a prosecutor knows of activities contrary to the law, he cannot choose whether to act or ignore them. He has a legal duty to take action. Yet what should the federal prosecutor or other federal organs do? Any attempt to prosecute the Slovak government would be legal but fatal for the future of our common state. Such a conflict would certainly radicalize Czech society, and could even lead to a Yugoslav scenario. RESPEKT Stanislav Devátý said that if the law banning secret police collaborators from public office had been adopted a year ago, there would be no need to discuss the referendum on the future of Czechoslovak statehood now. KALVODA Mr. Devátý's opinion is based on information to which he has access as a member of the parliamentary committee investigating these matters. I don't have such information, but I assume that he is right. The Slovak National Council recently heard the report of its Defense and Security Committee on Mečiar's activities when he was the interior minister of the Slovak Republic, and this report confirms Mr. Devátý's conclusions. No doubt the problem of secret police collaboration is an important factor influencing the whole game. RESPEKT Soon the state budget for 1992-will be submitted to the federal parliament for approval... KALVODA I have been saying all along that we must conclude constitutional negotiations before we deal with the budget. After all, the federal budget, among other things, transfers funds from one republic to another. The budget must also be based on the assumption that both republics have at least a similar political outlook. Yet, they are not moving toward federation. Before voting on the budget, we have to ask ourselves whether it is in the best interest of our republic to approve the transfer of funds to the republic that's on its way out. That is the present dilemma. [pageend76]CZECHOSLOVAKIA 75 AFTER THE VELVET REVOLUTION by Tom Weidlinger The following article is based on a series of filmed interviews which will be used in a ten- year television chronicle of life in Czechoslovakia. Tom Weidlinger, who heads Moira Productions, is a producer of this American-Czech project. When recently asked what he recalled of Czechoslovakia's “Velvet Revolution,” Václav Klaus, the country's finance minister, became impatient. Perhaps too many Western journalists had already posed the question. Perhaps Klaus believes that the extraordinary events that brought down the old regime require less attention than the problems of the present. Events have moved so quickly that 1989 now seems like ancient history. Signs of change are everywhere to be seen. One change experienced by many Czechs and Slovaks is an unmistakable decline in living standards. Klaus, the architect of the sweeping and painful economic changes, bristles at the use of the word “reform” to describe what is happening. “What we are doing is not reform,” he says. “We are implementing fundamental, total, systemic change. It is definitely not a ‘reform.’” Dr. Jaroslava Moserová, a member of the Czech parliament, likens this process to a gigantic spring house-cleaning. Furniture is scattered about, books are piled everywhere, everything is topsyturvy. You can't find anything you're looking for while the cleaning is in progress, but, Dr. Moserová predicts, order will eventually be restored. Meanwhile, total systemic change is painful. The country's move towards a free-market economy began on January 1, 1991 with the abolition of price controls on 85% of all consumer goods. Scores of inefficient state enterprises have been shut down, and thousands of businesses are being privatized. Food [pageend77]76 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 prices have already risen 60%, while the price of fuel has doubled. The income of the average citizen, on the other hand, has been kept down by policies to prevent a wage-price inflationary spiral. As material circumstances become more difficult, some look back to the era of totalitarianism with nostalgia. One such individual is Antonin Berecz, a blacksmith. He directs a four- man crew at the gigantic CKD locomotive works. Their task, hauling bright red ingots of steel from blast furnaces, is dangerous. The men must work quickly to place the glowing metal into stamping machines before it cools. Amid the thunderous roar of the machinery and the hellish heat, the men slake their thirst with huge steins of Pilsen beer. Berecz is bewildered by democracy and the free market. When he discovered that the prices of some items varied from store to store, he was certain that someone somewhere was pulling a fast one. If President Havel is putting up with such inequities, Berecz reasons, he must be getting soft. With the dissolution of Comecon and the privatization of industry, Berecz's locomotive works must compete on its own in world markets. Last year, the factory produced 357 locomotives, down from 530 the year before. Approximately 1,200 employees, mainly administrative personnel, have been laid off. Berecz, who has worked in the factory for twenty years, is worried that he might be among the next wave of redundancies. He takes little comfort in the fact that unemployment in Czechoslovakia, currently about 3.5%, is remarkably low by Western standards. Fear of unemployment — a fear ever more people are experiencing — is wholly unprecedented in a society that previously guaranteed jobs to every individual. Dr. Debora Karetová, a 38-year-old cardiologist, has a steady job but is worried about making ends meet. As a result of the communists' glorification of the proletariat, janitors employed in Prague's subway system earn nearly one and a half times as much as physicians. Doctors are often paid the same as nurses and orderlies. A Czech automobile would cost Dr. Karetová three years' wages. Shoes for her eight-year-old daughter cost a week's pay. It is humiliating for her to explain these basic facts to Westerners. Growing numbers of health workers have taken to working 24-hour shifts several times each month in order to earn enough to feed their families. Another doctor has suggested, only half facetiously, that surgery patients ought to bring along a bite to eat for the doctors; performing surgery is difficult on an empty stomach. In the old days, according to a saying currently going around Prague, everyone harbored a secret wish to be a musician, but nowadays people dream of being entrepreneurs. Before the revolution, Saša and Svatoslav Florian were part of the network that published the underground newspaper Lidové noviny. Svatoslav was arrested several times and interrogated about his involvement in the dissident movement. His political activities eventually cost him his job as a restorer at the Prague technical museum. Saša worked as a lab technician at a pharmaceutical school. She has given up lab work and is now helping Svatoslav open an antique shop on one of the steep cobblestone streets below [pageend78]AFTER THE VELVET REVOLUTION 77 the Prague Castle. Both are brimming with enthusiasm. “I am happy,” Saša says almost incredulously. “It's great to have the opportunity to do something just the way you want to do it. Now you don't have to try to persuade a bunch of bureaucrats; you can put all your energy into something useful.” Outside Prague's first private bakery there is always a long line of customers. The owner is Daniela Mervartová, whose easy joviality belies a shrewd business sense. She comes from a family that had been well-to-do until the communists confiscated the fifteen apartment buildings her grandfather built and owned. Mervartová is now seeking to reclaim these buildings under the terms of new laws on the restitution of property. But even before the return of the family's property became a possibility, she established her bakery. Mervartová hopes to find a Western investor to finance the purchase of the imported equipment necessary to increase the bakery's output. In the meantime, she and her family work overtime to make up for the low efficiency of the bakery's mixers and ovens. Previously the manager of a state-owned grocery store, Mervartová had always thought of herself as a hard worker. Now she thinks she had only been working at perhaps 40% of her capacity. “I really didn't know just how much I could do; now I often work 18 hours a day.” Some of the new entrepreneurs have little more than their dreams to sustain them. Michal and Eva Juz are so poor that butter is a luxury. Michal is a potter. Trained as an art historian, Eva worked in a state-run publishing house that specialized in producing art books for export. Michal and Eva are currently trying to set themselves up as publishers in the fields of philosophy and art. The tiny shop they recently opened, lined from floor to ceiling with dark wooden shelves, is reminiscent of an ancient apothecary. Many of the shelves are empty. A dozen pieces of delicate porcelain are strategically placed near the front window. On the opposite wall are several neat stacks of paperbacks. Among the works is a book honoring the memory of Jan Patočka, the philosopher who was one of the founders of Charter 77. If they had existed, the books on Michal and Eva's shelves would have been instantly snapped up at almost any price before the revolution, when there was a tremendous demand for any kind of information and intellectual expression untainted by official propaganda. Since the revolution, this demand appears to have been sated. As a result, Michal and Eva have to rely on the earnings from the sale of his pots to pay for paper and ink. Eva comes close to tears when she describes the poor condition of the printing equipment at their disposal. Ironically, economic circumstances have replaced political obstacles as the greatest difficulty facing an independent publisher. The newfound entrepreneurial spirit and freedom of expression have converged with greater financial success in the burgeoning sex and pornography industries. The communists strictly enforced a ban on pornography; today, there are no less than twelve skin magazines published in Prague. Among the pioneers in this segment of the economy is Veronika Zaoralová, a former shop [pageend79]78 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 assistant and hairdresser. Her original “S Boutique” has grown into a chain of 25 sex shops. Zaoralová, a shy woman who dresses conservatively, sits in front of a leather-bedecked mannequin and recounts the growth of her business. Her shops, which cater to men and women separately, offer movies, magazines, lingerie, and what she calls ‘‘marital aids.” Recently, one shop turned a net profit of $10,000 in a single month — an absolute fortune by Czechoslovak standards. What are Zaoralovd's goals? Nothing grandiose: she wants simply to renovate the penthouse apartment she recently purchased and would like to be able to live in Paris for as long as she likes without having to worry about money. The profit potential of the sex industry has not gone unnoticed by the onetime arbiters of public taste. Ivan Chocholouš had previously served the Prague city government as the chief official responsible for ‘‘cultural planning,” the old euphemism for censorship. Today, ironically, Chocholouš is the director of the company that holds the franchise for the Czech version of Playboy, the glossiest and most expensive of the new magazines to hit the stands. Chocholouš is by no means the only communist official to abandon the fight against the evils of capitalism and take up as an entrepreneur. Jiří Pecka, who had been chief legal counsel for the Federal Ministry of Engineering under the communists, is now the director of Reporting AG, a company that acts as a broker for Western investors seeking contacts in Czechoslovakia and the former Soviet Union. Many of Pecka's high-level contacts have managed to retain their positions even after the privatization of state-owned firms and enterprises. As a result, an ‘‘old-boy” network is taking shape that will ensure that a large part of the benefits of privatization will fall into the hands of individuals who had once been dedicated opponents of the free market. Does Pecka have qualms about this about-face? Not in the least. “I don't care about politics; I care about economics. The Revolution has created room to maneuver.” As countless communists transform themselves into model capitalists, yesterday's dissidents are confronting the less easy task of assuming political responsibility. Michael Kocáb presided over the parliamentary committee overseeing the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Czechoslovakia. Before becoming a member of the federal parliament, he had been a rock musician and leader of Prague Choice, a popular band. ‘‘The move into political office has been difficult,” Kocáb explains. ‘‘It's been especially hard for me because I used to be a rock-and-roller. Musicians are very different from politicians. Drastically different, I would say. Musicians are autonomous artists who thrive on protest against society and its mistakes. They use rejection and negation as a means of working towards positive results. Politicians, on the other hand, have to try to be constructive and should be able to compromise and build consensus. Politicians should also try to set an example — and that's very difficult for me. By nature I'm a provocateur.” [pageend80]a r i f r r 11 f. v e i v f r revolution 79 Former dissidents are not alone in finding the transition from totalitarianism to democracy difficult. “We have not yet learned to be tolerant,” according to Kocáb. “Every time we hear a point of view different from our own, we assume we're hearing an enemy. This is the legacy of the totalitarian regime.” Kocáb's views are echoed by his American wife Marsha., who has lived in Czechoslovakia for the past six years. She explains, “Everyone lived behind closed doors. Out on the streets or in the stores people were not hateful, just very cold. There was no collective feeling. It is hard to change this feeling and to stop distrusting everyone else.” In the past, distrust and fear were necessary for survival, and these instincts are difficult to unlearn. For many people, even the most simple acts of self- assertion are unsettling and even traumatic. Ivana Doležalová recently attended a meeting for parents at her daughter's kindergarten. The school's director, who used to insist on being addressed as “Comrade Director,” ran the school with military discipline. She was a person to be feared. Complaints that the children had to sing too many songs about Lenin or that play time was too regimented would lead to disparaging comments in the child's file, which became part of the child's permanent record. At a parents' meeting, plans were announced for a reorganization that would force a number of children to leave the school. The first instinct of many parents was to accept the decision without question. There was no justification or official basis for the reorganization, but “Comrade Director” assumed that she could count on the habit of fear to maintain control of her pre-school empire. Doležalová and several other parents, however, met in a pub after the official meeting and drafted a letter of protest to the school board. Had they not stopped to question the director's authority, the reorganization would not have been halted. For all the parents involved, this simple act of self-empowerment was a moment of extraordinary importance. It marked a break with a lifetime of conditioning. Casting off the outward expressions of tyranny and oppression is only the first step towards exorcising the communists' legacy of fear and distrust. All speak now of freedom and democracy, but the meaning of these words varies tremendously as society faces the harsh realities of “total systemic change.” While the blacksmith Antonin Berecz insists that democracy ought to mean “that a man should not live in poverty,” the struggling doctor Debora Karetová is disturbed that people today are far more vocal about price increases than they had ever been about the lack of freedom under the old regime. Daniela Mervartová, the successful baker, confesses, “Freedom and democracy are beautiful expressions, but I don't know how to behave democratically. ” Despite uncertainties and hardships, the powerful expression of collective will that put Czechoslovakia on the road to democracy in 1989 remains a potent memory and a beacon to guide the nation into the future. Occasionally people look back to the events of 1989 and wonder, “Did it really happen?” The evidence that it did is all around them.

Vakhtangi Talakhadze is a member of the executive committee of the National Democratic Party of Georgia. The following interviews were conducted for Uncaptive Minds by Sebastian Rybarczyk in Tbilisi in late September 1991, before a coalition of political and military groups took over the government and forced Gamsakhurdia to flee Georgia on January 6, 1992. THE ROOTS OF THE CIVIL WAR: TWO VIEWS UM As we speak, Georgia is experiencing one of the most turbulent periods of its postwar histofy. There are, in effect, two rival governments. The president, chosen in a free election, is opposed by the prime minister, the minister of foreign affairs, the commander of the National Guard, and a large part of the democratic opposition. Let's begin the interview with a very basic question: which government are you serving? GABASHVILI The one and the same government that I have been part of all along. The government has not changed; it is the same government that [pageend83]82 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 was formed after the first democratic parliamentary elections in the history of the USSR. To understand the current situation, it's necessary to go back to when the government was first formed. At that time, our main task was to mobilize the entire Georgian intelligentsia in order to rebuild an independent state. We did not intend to carry out “witch hunts.” That would have been senseless. We considered everyone valuable. Whether someone had been a communist was not important. Here we made a fundamental mistake. We failed to realize that once a communist, always a communist — regardless of national allegiance, as the example of Prime Minister Sigua was to demonstrate. UM Who is the new prime minister? GABASH VILI The new prime minister is Besario Gugushvili. He is forty-two years old and is both an economist and orientalist. We used to work at the same institute. He has demonstrated great political acumen, and I believe that he is the right person for the position. He is capable of implementing the reforms our country requires. UM You were a minister in the Sigua government and were familiar with its efforts to gain recognition for Georgian independence. How successful has the foreign ministry been in establishing international contacts? GABASHVILI We have sent delegations to several Western governments with a statement requesting recognition of our independence. In this statement, we point out that we have the same right to sovereignty as the Baltic states. Like the Baltic states, Georgia was annexed by the Soviets, but 20 years earlier. Even Lenin recognized our independence. You have to remember that Georgia has a history that goes back several thousand years. We were one of the first states to accept Christianity. That was in 337, a good five or six centuries before the Russians did. We have our own distinct culture and art. Over many centuries, we developed our own traditions wholly independent of the Russians. [pageend84]THE ROOTS OF THE CIVIL WAR 83 UM That's a moral argument for recognizing Georgian independence, not a political argument. Morality is not always a factor in international relations. GABASHVILI True. You no doubt know that the West, particularly the US, is worried about political stability in this part of the world. In fact, the Western powers are doing all they can to help hold the Soviet Union together, though perhaps in some new shape and with at least the appearance of democratic practices. The West would like to have a policeman keeping order in this region, a policeman who will probably not allow new states to become independent. The Baltic states were recognized by the West because they were not all that important for the Soviets. Transcaucasia, on the other hand, is very important strategically; we're the gateway to the Middle East. After Georgia breaks away from the Soviet Union, I'm sure Armenia and Azerbaijan will follow. That would be a serious defeat for Moscow, which the West would like to avoid. UM Is the Georgian government holding talks now with Russia? GABASHVILI No. UM Was the West more willing to talk with the former prime minister than with Mr. Gugushvili? GABASHVILI No. The West is using the events here as a way to discredit our country. The communists and their allies in the so-called opposition are trying to stage a putsch. Western politicians say that democracy is in danger, and therefore their countries cannot possibly recognize Georgian independence. With this excuse, it doesn't matter who the prime minister might be. That's ridiculous. UM How is it that Gia Chanturia, who has long been known for his opposition to communism, has joined with the communists in opposition to President Gamsakhurdia? Doesn't that strike you as significant? [pageend85]84 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 GAB ASH VILI Chanturia was a dissident, as was Gamsakhurdia. They were in the struggle together for a long time. Chanturia, however, is very young and politically inexperienced. He, like the majority of Georgians, has no idea what democracy is, since it has never existed here. Chanturia grew up in a totalitarian society, and we are now seeing the consequences of his upbringing. He and the others are trying to create democracy by undemocratic methods; they are trying to depose a president who was elected in free elections. The Western press might call these people oppositionists, but the fact remains that their goal is to carry out a putsch. They are not playing the role of an opposition. They are incapable of acting within a normal political framework. All they espouse is armed struggle, since they have only forty deputies in parliament and the former prime minister backing them. The National Guard is being used to carry out a military coup. Chanturia boycotted the elections and does not recognize democratically elected authorities. He and the staff of his party have occupied a building for their headquarters by force. They refuse to register their party. The so-called opposition rejects the president's independence program. Gamsakhurdia wants basically to follow the methods that Landsbergis and the Lithuanians have used: free elections, negotiations with the Soviets, and so on. What does Chanturia propose? A massive campaign of civil disobedience. He thinks we should follow the example of the Indian resistance to Britain as a way of removing the Soviet army from Georgia. That's pure daydreaming. Poland and Germany have had to negotiate with the Russians, and it's irresponsible to think that we could get rid of the Soviet troops without doing the same. UM ■ Could it be that Chanturia did not register his party because he was not able to do so? GABASHVILI He didn't want to. Nor did he ever announce his intention to hold demonstrations. In both cases, he wanted to create a situation of illegality. Who is with him now? The Republican Party, the Liberal Party, and the Social Democrats — in other words, the parties that participated in the elections and did poorly. There arc also many communists on his side, who nobody wanted to vote for. So now Chanturia and his allies have become insurgents, fully aware that they are at the margins of political life in Georgia. [pageend86]THE ROOTS OF THE CIVIL WAR 85 I suspect, though, that this alliance will not last in the long ran. The only goal they have in common is disobedience towards the president. Chanturia's party is ignorant of the fact that it is being manipulated to work against Georgian independence. If this communist-inspired putsch succeeds, there will be no need for the communists to continue working with Chanturia or Careteli. UM The opposition maintains that President Gamsakhurdia is a dictator, and much of the Western press seems to agree. So do a number of new publications in the Baltic states. Is there any substance to these accusations? GAB ASH VILI The president has said that if he had wanted, he could have suppressed the so-called opposition immediately upon assuming office. Why didn't he? He wanted to be the president of all Georgians. He did not want to do anything that might hinder or delay Georgian independence. Those people out on the barricades are undermining Gamsakhurdia's authority without any right to do so. They did not participate in the democratic elections; those who were absent have no voice. And they are capable only of negation. Their only objective is to remove the president from office. Have you visited them at their barricades and demonstrations? UM Yes. GABASH VILI Then you saw just how many of them there actually are. A few hundred, only a couple hundred. And now look through this window. That is a demonstration in support of the president. There are easily several thousand people in the crowd. Please draw your own conclusions. With the strength of the support for the president, we could crush the rebels. But we aren't. That should answer your question whether Gamsakhurdia is a dictator. Besides, what kind of dictator could Gamsakhurdia be so long as Georgia is not independent? It is profoundly unjust to refer to him in this manner. Compare him to Gorbachev. Gorbachev is responsible for the murder of dozens of people in Baku, Tbilisi, Vilnius, and Riga. He bans independent publications in Russia and imposes censorship in other republics. The man exercises unlimited, unrestrained power, and the world calls him a democrat. And President Gamsakhurdia? He tries to [pageend87]86 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 restore peace to his country and to work for independence, and he is a dictator. Labeling him a dictator is simply a rationalization for not recognizing Georgian independence. UM How, then, would you explain the arrest and continuing imprisonment of Dzava Josaliani? [Josaliani led the Georgian Knights, a military organization that aided victims of the earthquake in Armenia; he also served as a negotiator in the conflict in Ossetia. Josaliani was openly critical of President Gamsakhurdia. Since this article was written, he was released and became one of the top leaders of the forces that overthrew the president.] GABASHVILI Would you allow bands of streetfighting thugs to roam about freely in your country? In retrospect, his arrest was fully justified. If Josaliani were at liberty, he would certainly be among the putschists trying to drive the president from office. The people who are attempting to overthrow the government should be brought to trial. UM The opposition accuses the president of inciting the conflict in Ossetia, of bringing Soviet troops into the region, and of inflaming relations between Georgians and Ossetians. GABASHVILI Actually the so-called opposition is not united on this theme. Some simply point to what they see as mistakes in our dealings with the Ossetians. Many people know that it wasn't Gamsakhurdia, but rather the Kremlin that incited the conflict. The accusations against President Gamsakhurdia do not have any basis in fact and are simply further propaganda to aid in removing him from office. As for the conflict in Ossetia, you have to keep in mind that the Ossetians have been completely russified. They do not want their own schools or newspapers in their own language. This group has been completely subordinated to the Kremlin and works entirely in the imperial interests of the Russians. We cannot permit this. We are not trying to suppress their national identity; we are trying to counter Russia's imperial influence in Transcaucasia. UM Let's leave the conflict between the president and his critics and turn to the work of your ministry. Part of Georgia's original ter[pageend88]THE ROOTS OF THE CIVIL WAR 87 ritory now lies in Azerbaijan and Turkey. Does Georgia have any territorial claims against its neighbors? GABASH VILI Adjusting borders would provoke ethnic conflicts, and we are not interested in doing that. We are interested, though, in seeing that the rights of Georgians living in those states are respected. For example, we want Georgians there to have their own schools and newspapers in their own language, in the same way that Azeris in Georgia do. UM One of the chief goals of Georgia's foreign policy is to build ties to Western Europe. But Western Europe is rather far away, and it seems unlikely that the West will be willing to incorporate Georgia, for instance, in its security arrangements. Given this simple fact, is it likely that Georgia might participate in some sort of a federation of Caucasian states as a means of defending itself against Russian imperialism ? GABASHVILI This issue is very interesting, but also very complicated. Georgia is a Christian country, like Russia and Armenia. Seven centuries ago, we helped fend off the Islamic onslaught. Until the annexation of 1921, we had been allied with the Russians. Our foreign policy seeks normal relations with Russia. I believe that a democratic Russia will break with its imperialist and chauvinistic past. If so, then there is a good chance that anti-Russian sentiments will not reemerge in Georgia. As for the possibility of a federation, I believe that we have already built the foundations for a system of this sort. Our relations with Azerbaijan and Armenia are very good. We are open to all suggestions and proposals. Right now, everything depends on whether other states recognize our independence. A sovereign Georgia is synonymous with a free Caucasus. ★ ★ ★ UM In accounts of recent events in Georgia there are numerous unclear points. President Gamsakhurdia and his supporters offer one version of events, and, not surprisingly, the opposition offers another. Could you explain what happened? [pageend89]88 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 TALAKHADZE Let me start from the beginning. On September 2, our party organized a demonstration calling for free access to the media. This was not our first demonstration. Over the past several months we have held several demonstrations, none of which influenced the government. A group obedient to the president controls the newspapers, radio, and television. No one else has access to the media. If a journalist comes out in support of us, he immediately loses his job. Gamsakhurdia wants to eradicate all opposition, to push anyone unwilling to obey him to the margins of political life. He has fought every step toward liberalization and democratization. A major incident occurred during the September 2 demonstration. Fights broke out, then troops from the Georgian militia attacked us. Our security people were also armed. A fire-fight ensued. Several people were killed, and many more were injured. The government militia troops withdrew and returned to their barracks. We urged the crowd to disperse because we were afraid that the troops might return, which could have led to an even worse massacre. On September 3 and the days following we held protest demonstrations outside the parliament. We demanded that the president resign. He was responsible for what had happened; he had ordered the militia to use deadly force. Then Gamsakhurdia announced his loyalty to the Soviet Union and ordered the arrest of the opposition. That's when the National Guard revolted. A representative of the Guard came to meet with us. He told us that the Guard would not participate in a political struggle; it would only defend the Georgian nation in keeping with the law. So it is not true that the National Guard was helping us. They have held to a position of neutrality, which I believe is right. Accusations that we are trying to mount a military coup are groundless. The Guard has not taken part in confrontations with the president's supporters. The armed people at our protests are members of the parties organizing the protests; they are here to protect us from Gamsakhurdia's troops. Our staff members have been attacked by the president's supporters, and several of our colleagues have been injured. We have not attacked anyone and have not tried to provoke violence. Our opponents have been much more eager for confrontation. UM You have been accused of being a tool of the Kremlin and of being opposed to Georgian independence. Why? [pageend90]THE ROOTS OF THE CIVIL WAR 89 TALAKHADZE Gia Chanturia [leader of the National Democratic Party] and I planned a trip to Moscow in September. On the 16th, after we had already boarded the airplane, we were arrested. My secretary and I were released, but Chanturia became the president's prisoner. We were indeed planning to meet with politicians from the Russian Federation in Moscow. Anyone even slightly acquainted with the situation in Georgia recognizes that the accusations against us are ridiculous. Gia Chanturia is known for his opposition to communism, and he was one of the first to take up the struggle for Georgian independence. The authorities simply needed some pretext to imprison our leader. UM The National Democratic Party has been accused of operating entirely outside the law. According to some critics, your party has not been officially registered, and its demonstrations have never been properly announced. TALAKHADZE That is not the case. We did not want to register our party according to Soviet law, which is still in effect in Georgia. The institution that Gamsakhurdia stubbornly calls a parliament is in fact a communist structure more commonly called a “supreme soviet.” It is based on the Soviet model and on Soviet law. For this reason, we did not want to register our party, nor did we want to participate in the elections. We boycotted the elections because they were elections to a Soviet, not a Georgian body. As for our demonstrations, we initially tried to obtain permission, but were never successful. After several refusals, we gave up trying. UM Your party has also been accused of illegally occupying a building for its headquarters. TALAKHADZE For two years we petitioned for a building with no success. So we decided to act by fait accompli and simply took the former Komsomol headquarters frorrt the communists. UM And you do not intend to pay rent for this building? [pageend91]90 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 TALAKHADZE That is not true. The rent the authorities have demanded from us is several times greater than what parties loyal to the president have to pay for comparable facilities. UM Some have argued that your party has no program beyond driving President Gamsakhurdiafrom office. What concrete proposals stand behind your call for liberalization and democratization ? TALAKHADZE Significant change has yet to occur in Georgia. Sure, the old supreme soviet is now called the parliament. The national flag has replaced the flag of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. We can sing our national anthem now. But these changes hardly alter the structure of the state. The legal and judicial systems remain unchanged. The security forces remain unchanged. The institutions of authority remain unchanged. And I won't even mention the issue of Soviet troops in Georgia. Legally and institutionally, Georgia remains a Soviet republic. Worst of all, the parliament does not have the will to implement change. It has done nothing so far. On top of all this, we have President Gamsakhurdia's dictatorial inclinations. The parliament is made up of his supporters from the Round Table-Free Georgia group and communists who support him because they are afraid of losing their influence. Because of his hold over the parliament, Gamsakhurdia has virtually unlimited power. All major appointments are in his hands; he chooses mayors, newspaper editors, and university presidents. When he became president, he evicted communists from all the important positions and appointed his own people. But his people turned out to be a disappointment, so he reinstated many of the communists. Removing the president is one of the most important points of our program. The groups participating in the protest have, of course, their own programs and specific proposals. These groups are bound together by a desire for genuine change. In order to achieve anything more than cosmetic change, however, we must first dispose of the president. We must force him to resign. UM You mentioned that "the elections took place according to Soviet law. But didn't all parties have the right to participate? [pageend92]THE ROOTS OF THE CIVIL WAR 91 TALAKHADZE That's true, but the opposition parties did not have the same opportunities as the communists or the parties linked to Gamsakhur- dia. The opposition parties did not have money or access to the newspapers or television. Gamsakhurdia promised to start the process of privatization and to dissolve the parliament, and the public believed him. But he has not done what he promised to do'. He has preserved socialist economic structures and institutions. Collective farms survive under new names. The banking system is the same as ever. Gamsakhurdia is doing nothing to make our economy independent of the Soviet economy. He has lied and continues to lie. His sole interest is in retaining power. UM Eighty-five percent of Georgian citizens voted for Gamsakhurdia. Doesn 't that suggest that he has considerable authority and legitimacy in the eyes of the public? TALAKHADZE The voters had no choice. The other candidate was a communist, which explains both why participation was so high and why Gamsakhurdia did so well. UM Why didn 't the National Democratic Party run its own candidate? TALAKHADZE That would not have made a difference. The entire mass media supported only one opposition candidate: Gamsakhurdia. We decided that an electoral campaign would cost too much in both energy and money. Our chances of success were minuscule. UM Your protest has been described as a communist putsch. The government has accused its opponents of conspiring with the old nomenklatura. Gamsakhurdia presents himself as the only advocate of Georgian independence and as the only true anti-communist. Is there any truth in these charges? TALAKHADZE Precisely the opposite is true. I already explained how Gamsakhurdia eventually replaced his own people with communists. The communists now hold many of the offices they used to hold, and some [pageend93]92 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 have been promoted to even higher positions. Foreign Minister Um- anidze is a former KGB officer, and Prime Minister Gugushvili was a high-ranking party functionary. The National Democratic Party has no former communist functionaries in its ranks. We have always been anti-communist and are known for our anti-communist stance. The president's accusations are pure demagoguery. UM In the past several days, we have seen rallies held by both the opposition and the president's supporters. The numbers do not look very encouraging for the opposition. TALAKHADZE Gamsakhurdia has a monopoly on information. Tbilisi has been cut off from the rest of the nation. It's practically in a state of siege. Under such circumstances, Gamsakhurdia can influence public perception. He is spreading disinformation throughout the rest of the country. Gamsakhurdia has appealed to his supporters across the country to come to Tbilisi. Local authorities have been providing buses to take people from the countryside to the capital. Each region is expected to provide at least 10,000 people. All of our demonstrators, in contrast, are residents of Tbilisi. The president's greatest support comes from women between the ages of 40 and 50. This can only be explained in Freudian terms. These women need a strong personality, a Fiihrer. The press portrays Gamsakhurdia as precisely this sort of figure. His pandering to this hysterical mob is very dangerous. Another factor behind the popular support for Gamsakhurdia is the sovietization of our society. We lack democratic traditions. But that is slowly changing. I am optimistic. [pageend94]TAJIKISTAN 93 AFTER THE STAND-OFF by Gregory Freidin Gregory Freidin is Associate Professor of Russian Literature at Stanford University. If the August coup in Moscow brought about the final agony of the Soviet dinosaur, it induced convulsions in some of the dinosaur's offspring. Central Asia is a case in point. With the exception of Kirghizstan, headed by one of the more enlightened politicians, Askar Akaev, these republics find themselves more firmly under the rule of local communists than before the dissolution of the USSR, when the latter had to answer to their superiors in Moscow. For a while, though, it seemed that Tajikistan might break out of the mold. The main reason was Davlat Khudonazarov, leader of the democratic opposition. The great stand-off between the opposition forces and the retrenched communist nomenklatura in Tajikistan began within weeks of the August coup. The new president pro tem, Rakhmon Nabiev, hastily installed by the communist- controlled Supreme Soviet of Tajikistan, declared martial law on September 22 only to rescind it three weeks later. Even a dyed-in-the-wool apparatchik like Nabiev could see that, with the center in Moscow lying in shambles, strong- arm tactics in the republics had no future. The local units of the Soviet army and the interior ministry forces, which months earlier might have come to the defense of the old guard, had lost all interest in Tajik politics. By late September, they declared their neutrality. Khudonazarov seized the historic chance. One of the most highly regarded Soviet filmmakers, Khudonazarov began his political career in 1988 when he was elected to represent Tajikistan in the Congress of the People's Deputies. He joined the Interregional Group, and soon became a figure in the democratic opposition mentioned along with the likes of Sakharov, Yeltsin, and Popov. His response to the August coup was exemplary. While most other officials either supported it or sat on the fence, Khudonazarov without any hesitation joined the forces of the opposition. On the 20th, he was already in Moscow, organizing the transfer of the Union of Filmmakers and other unions of artists to the jurisdiction of the president of the Russian Federation until the legitimate Union government was restored. [pageend95]94 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 The USSR ministers of ecology and the chemical industry followed him in transferring their ministries to Yeltsin's government. Working round the clock, he was able to force many high officials to declare themselves on record either in support of or in opposition to the coup. In September, Khudonazarov turned his attention to his native Tajikistan. The anti-communist opposition in the capital city of Dushanbe turned out to be massive and — thanks in large measure to the personality of its acknowledged leader, Davlat Khudonazarov — orderly and disciplined. For weeks the parliament building in Dushanbe was surrounded by a Hooverville-like tent city, with the demonstrators, some in traditional Tajik garb, challenging the legitimacy of the old communist legislature — all without a single serious incident. The old guard would not budge, the opposition would not yield, and the festive rally went on. The presidential election, originally set for October 27, was postponed for a month. The stand-off continued throughout the campaign, with the nomenklatura using every trick to sidetrack Khudonazarov. In an act that caused the most damage to his prospects, they blocked his access to local television. To circumvent them, Khudonazarov had to fly to Moscow to address his electorate in Russian from the central television studios. Unfortunately, he could use but a few three-minute segments on the evening news, with the studio giving equal time to the Nabiev forces for a rebuttal. The election was finally held on November 27. According to the pre-election polls, Khudonazarov's coalition, which included the Popular Front of Tajikistan (Rastokhez), the Tajik Democracy Party, the Party of Islamic Revival, and the republic's Islamic clergy, could count on 42% of the vote. A secular politician who is equally at home in either Tajik or Russian culture, Khudonazarov also enjoyed substantial support among the republic's dwindling Russian population of teachers, doctors, and technical specialists. Nabiev was expected to receive 45% of the vote, with the bulk of his support coming from the Russians, Tajiks, and Uzbeks in the Leninabad region, the most populous part of the republic and the long-time power base of the Tajik communist elite and the Russian bureaucratic establishment. Another 7 % of the electorate was divided among the other six candidates. With neither of the principal contenders commanding the required majority, a run-off election was the most likely outcome. According to the official tally, out of the 86% of eligible voters who participated in the elections, 57% chose Nabiev and 30% Khudonazarov. Khudonazarov challenged the results at once, citing such patriarchal practices as allowing one member of a family to vote for the entire clan. There was also plenty of evidence of ballot-box stuffing. The presses printing ballots must have worked overtime: in Dushanbe, at least, ballot forms became the wrapping paper of choice among the numerous pirozhki street vendors. Speaking on behalf of a group of independent observers from the USSR Congress of People's Deputies, Andrei Plotnikov suggested in the December 4 issue of Nezavisimaya gazeta that some 15% of the ballots should be considered invalid. But there was little chance that the Tajik Supreme Soviet, which had [pageend96]AFTER THE STAND-OFF 95 appointed Nabiev president in the first place, would wish to take a close look at these violations. Still, the evidence was so overwhelming that, after Khudo- nazarov submitted a petition supported by volumes of testimony, 3% of the ballots were declared void by the Central Election Commission. Interestingly enough, Andrei Plotnikov had the impression that while “the Tajik election officials may have committed irregularities out of ignorance, their Russian- speaking colleagues did so with premeditation.” This observation sheds an ironic light on the Russian habit of attributing a special propensity for corruption to the peoples of Central Asia. The announcement of the election results sparked outrage amongst the opposition. Many were ready to storm the parliament building. It took a great effort on the part of Khudonazarov to calm them down. His principles, temperament, and strategy are those of a conciliator, and he is prepared to risk much and concede a lot in order to minimize political polarization — especially if it could lead to violence. Seeing that his efforts to expose fraud at the polls were leading nowhere, he called on his supporters to accept the results and concentrate on organizing the opposition. This admirable and rational stance is also good politics. As reports in Nezavisimaya gazeta and Kommersant suggest, Rakhmon Nabiev, with his unreconstructed communist ways, may be his own worst enemy. In the wake of his victory, he declared his firm commitment to a “five-year plan” and its strict implementation. More recent reports indicate that he is not about to change his ways: at the first meeting of the Commonwealth of Independent States, Nabiev embarrassed his fellow- presidents with a panegyric to hydroelectric power projects, the Egyptian pyramids of the defunct Soviet state. It is widely expected that the next presidential elections will take place well before the end of Nabiev's first term. ★ ★ ★ A letter from Khudonazarov, dated December 10, reached me a few days ago. It is a fitting conclusion to the story about the first steps taken by the democratic movement in Tajikistan: The long, interminable day is behind me... All we have done is scratch the rocky soil of Tajik democracy. I have gone through hundreds of meetings, hundreds of hours of speaking in a hoarse voice through a microphone (and without one), answering the same questions, encountering people's attitudes — Mistrust in some, Hope in others; and all of this is happening while I am surrounded by barefoot little girls and boys. It was seeing these children that gave me strength to wage battle against the feudal nomenklatura elite, [who] fought back with deception, rumors, libel, lies, bribery... And yet, despite everything, I am a happy man. I have managed to awaken people, to see a multitude of faces, tens of thousands of them, to stand face to face with my country and my people. I am a happy man! [pageend97]Photo: Serkhiy Okhrymovych At the Ukrainian parliament building in Kiev on August 24, 1991, the day the dei ties meeting inside declared the independence of Ukraine. A sampling of the placards: “Put the CPSU on trial” "Kravchuk plus Gorbachev equals Red Terra “Communist junta get out of Ukraine”. [pageend98]UKRAINE 97 WHAT KIND OF INDEPENDENCE? by Jan Róždžyňski Jan Róždžyrtski is a Polish journalist. The following article is based on discussions the author held with a number of leading political figures in Ukraine shortly before December 1, when presidential elections and a referendum on independence were held in Ukraine. On December 1, 1991 the people of Ukraine chose independence. But the achievement of genuine independence remains a distant goal. Ukraine is still bound to the economic, military, and social structures of the former Soviet Union. Moreover, many opposition activists contend that both the presidential election and the referendum on independence were a maneuver on the part of the post-communist [former communist] majority in parliament to delay the creation of a democratic government. These activists describe Leonid Kravchuk, who served as the ideology chief of the communist party before becoming the head of parliament and now president, as the shrewdest politician among the post-communists. But Kravchuk's success is exceptional for a postcommunist in Ukraine: If parliamentary elections were held today, Rukh and the other groups opposed to the old Soviet order would win a majority. The minister of foreign affairs, Anatoliy Zlenko, who stresses that he had never been a part of the communist party apparatus, maintains that Ukraine does not intend to regard its borders the way totalitarian states do. “We do not want to dig trenches. We want to be an open state. After all, we're surrounded by friendly neighbors. We have no territorial claims against anyone [pageend99]98 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 else, nor do we acknowledge any claim to our territory, regardless of who might be making such claims.” Zlenko's comments are clearly a response to Boris Yeltsin's claims of a Russian right to revise existing borders. Ukraine immediately interpreted Yeltsin's remarks as a declaration of intent to lay claim to the eastern regions of Ukraine with large Russian-speaking populations. This incident has not, however, affected the generally good relations between Ukraine and Russia. Recently, Prime Minister Fokin of Ukraine signed an economic agreement with Russia, and, according to Zlenko, his ministry is preparing to send an ambassador to Yeltsin's government. Establishing diplomatic relations with Russia is just one step towards Ukraine taking its place in the international community. Representatives have already been sent to the capitals of the former Warsaw Pact nations. Ukraine does not need to send a representative to the United Nations, having long been a formal member of that body and its various organizations. The task now is to turn formal membership into genuine participation. Ukraine's expanding diplomatic activity presents a considerable challenge to Zlenko's ministry. A former representative to UNESCO in Paris, Zlenko is one of the very few professionals in the foreign ministry, which until recently served only functions of protocol. Its staff of approximately one hundred is lacking in specialists and should easily be three times as large as it is. Ukrainian authorities are understandably concerned about the work of the foreign ministry. As the internal transformation of the state begins, they are eager to foster the image of an independent state abroad. One indication of Ukraine's independence is the parliament's acceptance of the agreement on the foreign debt of the Soviet Union. Ukraine wants to pay a portion of that debt in cooperation with the other former republics of the Soviet Union. Parliament's resolution on the Soviet foreign debt has not won Ukraine admiration from the leaders of the other former republics. Ukraine's decision to create its own armed forces drew an even sharper reaction, particularly from Moscow. Upon being named Ukrainian minister of defense, General Konstantin Morozov, a Russian, reportedly announced, “I serve Ukraine” — before the Soviet Union had ceased to exist. Western estimates that 1.5 million Soviet troops are stationed in Ukraine are inaccurate, according to Morozov, but he was unwilling to provide the correct figure. Nor was he forthcoming on the planned size of the future Ukrainian armed forces; the figure of 450,000 troops has been mentioned in recent parliamentary discussions on the subject. As for Soviet troops and nuclear weapons still in Ukraine, Morozov explains, “Once our parliament and government make the necessary decisions, we will start negotiations with the general staff of the Soviet army. We will indicate which forces will enter into the strategic component and which will come under the control of the new ministry of defense.” The “strategic component” will be under the command of the central authorities and will remain in Ukraine until dissolved. Ukraine will insist that these units be disbanded as quickly as possible under the terms of [pageend100]WHAT KIND OF INDEPENDENCE? 99 agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union. Army officers and officials in the ministry of defense report that there are no plans to turn paramilitary and nationalist formations into regular troops. ‘ ‘We will have an army purely for defense,” Morozov has said. “It will not be used to threaten anyone within Ukraine or any of our neighbors. Its sole purpose is to guarantee our sovereignty.” Fundamental change in the military situation in Ukraine is unlikely in the coming months. The military authorities in Moscow are in no hurry to take any actions affecting the geostrategic position of this important part of the former Soviet Union. Indeed, Moscow had earlier planned to station troops returning from Germany in Ukraine. Despite these possible obstacles, General Morozov remains optimistic that his recently created ministry will achieve its goals. The parliament's decision to declare Ukraine a nuclear-free zone was greeted favorably throughout Europe, though not without a certain skepticism. General Morozov has no doubts about this objective. “Ukraine will be a state without nuclear weapons. Our parliament has unambiguously said that these weapons will be destroyed.” But in discussing the fate of the approximately 180 intercontinental missiles at facilities in Ukraine, General Morozov insists that Ukraine will not destroy these weapons if other states do not follow suite. “We intend to fulfill our commitments stemming from the treaty between the Soviet Union and the United States. As one of the legal successors to that agreement, we will follow the terms it stipulates. The majority of the nuclear weapons governed by this treaty should be destroyed in the course of the next seven years. We will do so in conjunction with Russia, Byelorussia, and Kazakhstan.” The reorganization of the armed forces is to be linked to the reorganization of the security apparatus. Until now, internal security was controlled from Moscow. According to Yaroslav Kondratiev, the deputy chairman of the parliamentary committee on internal affairs, centralized control no longer exists. The all-union KGB supposedly no longer functions. Nor are there any political prisoners still in captivity — just 100,000 or so “criminal” prisoners. The Ukrainian ministry of Internal Affairs has taken over the Kiev training school of its Soviet counterpart. Summarizing the changes in the security apparatus, Kondratiev explains, “We removed the communist party from the security services before the party ceased to exist. We intend to alter the organization of the security services and are looking at various alternatives from Europe and the US. We arc leaning towards the German model. Ukraine's security services will be concerned solely with the protection of the state. The militia has already been operating according to the new principles for nearly a year.” The reorganization of the security apparatus, including changes in personnel, has been sabotaged somewhat by Moscow. Kondratiev contends that Moscow is throwing up obstacles under the guise of “coordinating activities.” Volodymyr Filenko, the deputy leader of the parliamentary opposition, believes that the authorities in Moscow are not the only group with an interest in destabilizing Ukraine. “There is a constant threat from the ‘partocracy’ — the [pageend101]Photo: Stanistaw Ciok Photo: Stanistaw Ciok Bohdan Horyn Vyacheslav Chornovii. [pageend102]WHAT KIND OF INDEPENDENCE? 101 people who still hold positions of importance and have much to lose,” Filenko argues. “Great Russian chauvinism will always exist. The problem we face is to try to prevent chauvinism from determining the two states' internal and foreign policies. ’ Nationalism is an issue at the forefront of political debate in Ukraine. ‘ ‘Did you know that in Donetsk, Kharkiv and Zaporizhia there were no Ukrainian language schools for decades?” asks Lubomyr Senyk, one of the leaders of Rukh in Lviv. Like many others, Senyk holds history, responsible for the distinct difference between western and eastern Ukraine in political and national awareness. “For over three hundred years the Russians ruled eastern Ukraine, and they held to a policy of russification in all spheres of life until just a few years ago. The polonization of western Ukraine, however, was a different form of oppression: it was more European and did not deprive Ukrainians of their national identity. Since western Ukraine was under Polish rule until World War II, it was spared the twenty years of incorporation in the Soviet system that eastern Ukraine suffered. But then Stalin shifted the border from the Zbruch river to the Bug, which was of course a rather dramatic event for millions of my countrymen.” “In the 1940s, almost half a million Ukrainians were forcibly resettled from Poland,” says Sreda, a Lviv activist and chairman of the group Nadsa- nie. Nadsanie denies that its raison d'etre is to maintain ties to formerly Ukrainian-inhabited areas in Poland, but it in effect plays such a role. Along with two similar organizations, Nadsanie brings together people who cannot forget the lands of their forefathers or the culture that had developed in southwestern Poland. Sreda points out, though, that Nadsanie has no political or revanchist objectives. “We are not demanding the return of our territory. That would be senseless. Those sorts of demands are based on the past, and we are looking to the future.” Yuriy Shukhevych, regarded by many as a living symbol, has a different relationship to the past and the future. Shukhevych is the son of General Roman Shukhevych of the UPA [Ukrainian Insurrectionary Army, which arose during World War II], who was killed by the NKVD near Lviv in 1950 after many years of pursuit. Shukhevych was recently released from nearly forty years of incarceration. He has since become the leader of the interparty Ukrainian National Assembly, which grew out of the Anti-Bolshevik National Bloc. Among the groups belonging to the Ukrainian National Assembly are the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, the Ukrainian National Party, the Committee of Catholic Youth, the Ukrainian Radical Nationalists, and the Ukrainian People's Self-Defense. ‘ ‘Stalin established our current borders, we didn't’ ’ Shukhevych states passionately. “Adjusting the borders with Poland doesn't make any sense now. But in the east, there are Ukrainians living in regions that are not a part of Ukraine — Kuban, the Don basin. I believe that the Ukrainians living in these parts of the Russian Federation should have the right to self-determination. [pageend103]Yuriy Shukhevych Demonstration in Kiev, August 24, 1991 [pageend104]WHAT KIND OF INDEPENDENCE! 103 And I believe that the Ukrainians and all the peoples of Eastern Europe should realize that the existence of the Russian empire in any form, be it czarist, Bolshevik, or democratic — is a tremendous threat to us all. We must therefore do everything possible to neutralize the influence of Great Russia.” Asked if he is advocating some sort of march on Moscow, Shukhevych answered no. “But the former members of the Eastern Bloc should work together. We need above all strong economic ties to each other to create a counterweight to Russian power. And we have to be able to resist military aggression from that direction if necessary.” Shukhevych does not regard the Russian minority in eastern Ukraine as a problem. “They are simply russified Ukrainians. According to Soviet propaganda, there are supposed to be something like eleven million Russians living in Ukraine. Our researchers put the actual number around five million, which is a bit less than ten percent of the total population of Ukraine. And of course, not all of those Russians are longing for Russia. On the contrary, most support Ukrainian independence. For that reason, we speak of the equality of rights of citizens of Ukraine. Nationalism has to be understood positively. I observe the transformation taking place in Western Europe, and I see an attempt to negate distinct national qualities. Keeping in mind obvious differences, much the same thing was attempted in the Soviet Union. For decades, they tried to convince us that we belonged to the ‘Soviet nation.’ Because of our experiences, I am not enthusiastic about the idea of a united Europe.” The Ukrainian National Assembly chose Shukhevych as a presidential candidate, but he himself believes that new parliamentary elections should take place before the presidential election. “What sort of president will it be? A new parliament should first write a new constitution that would specify the prerogatives of the president, and then we could choose a new president. As for my candidacy, we have not counted on much support among the voters. Our aim has been to introduce our groups and our nationalist ideas to society. The presidential campaign has provided an opportunity to do that.” Shukhevych is correct when he notes the limited support for the Ukrainian National Assembly. In fact, very few of the newly arisen political groups in Ukraine exercise much influence. Bohdan Horyn, a former political prisoner and a co-founder of the Ukrainian Helsinki Union, is today a member of parliament and leader of the Lviv branch of the Ukrainian Republican Party (UPR). “At the moment,” Horyn explains, “three of the existing political forces count. The best organized remain the communists, who have suddenly become great patriots. The second is Rukh, which has rapidly become the largest mass organization. The UPR is the third force. We already have over ten thousand members in each province. Our presidential candidate, Levko Lukyanenko, was one of three who succeeded by October in gathering the necessary 100,000 signatures for his candidacy.” In Horyn's opinion, Ukraine has not made any major mistakes thus far in the transition from communism to democracy. “There have been no con[pageend105]104 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 flicts between the different national groups. We are doing everything possible to guarantee the national minorities a normal political, cultural, and religious life. The situation here has been an exception in the disintegrating Soviet Union. ’ ’ The most important of the Ukrainian Republican Party's goals, according to Horyn, are democratization, achieving economic independence for Ukraine, and attaining a place in the international community. “The UPR leaves history to the historians,” he says, despite the history of KGB repression personally experienced by the party's leadership and activists. Among the UPR membership are a number of former communists. “Most of them are intellectuals,” Horyn explains, “and they account for less than one percent of the total membership. They have demonstrated that they have changed their views.” One party that has clearly been gathering support, particularly in the countryside, is the Ukrainian Democratic Peasant Party (USDP). It, too, has a number of former communists in its ranks. USDP secretary Ivan Hushchak doesn't even try to calculate their number. Many remain the heads of collective farms. “But they are committed to our national and peasant cause. In the old days, if someone wanted to do something for the nation, he had to join the communist party. Many who joined did not do so out of conviction.” During the August putsch, the USDP organized the defense of the Lviv city hall and blocked the route of the anticipated tank attack with tractors and combines. It is now possible to lease land and even to acquire rights of permanent use of holdings up to 50 hectares. But few have decided to take either of these steps. “We fought for land for the farmers, and now we're fighting for means of production for them,” Hushchak says. He argues that the process of “far- merization” has only just begun. Currently, according to official statistics, approximately 1,700 independent private farms averaging 25 hectares exist. But only a handful are standing on their own two feet — mainly on account of shortages of nearly everything. “For that reason, our economic program comes down to one main goal: privatization. State ownership can and must be eliminated. Collective farms must be broken up, perhaps in different ways and at different rates of^speed according to their potential for profit. But the land must end up in private hands.” Ukraine faces many problems in addition to those raised in this article: in particular, the environment, the conflict between the Orthodox and Greek Catholic churches, separatism in the Crimea, and the Ukrainian diaspora in the other former Soviet republics. The attainment of complete independence is a precondition for solving these problems. Vyacheslav Chomovil, Rukh's presidential candidate, and Ivan Drach, leader of the Kiev chapter of Rukh, put forward the same argument: new parliamentary elections are needed soon because the current Ukrainian Supreme Council does not represent the distribution of social forces and is incapable of guiding an independent Ukraine. This writer-can only concur with that conclusion. [pageend106]BULGARIA TOS THE BLUES, THE REDS, AND THE GREENS by Avram Agov Avram Agov is a Bulgarian scholar. He wrote the following article for Uncaptive Minds in November 1991. Between the two parliamentary elections of June 1990 and October 1991, a great deal happened on the Bulgarian political scene: three governments were formed (the first two under the communist Andrei Lukanov and the third under the independent Dimitar Popov); a new constitution was drawn up, debated, amended, and ratified; the first phase of the economic transition, with its concomitant rise in unemployment and fall in living standards, was implemented after numerous delays; and the main opposition coalition, the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), split in three (UDF, UDF-Center, and UDF-Liberals). In spite of everything that has happened, the main political fault line continues to run between the communists — who, since May 1990, call themselves the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) — and the UDF. The voters demonstrated that Bulgarian politics was still polarized when, in the October election, they threw most of their support behind either the UDF, which received 34.36% of the vote, or the BSP, which took 33.14%. Only one other organization, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF), which is mainly composed A note about colors as labels for political orientations in Bulgaria: while it is fairly obvious that “Reds” refers to communists or postcommunists and “Blues” to the democratic opposition, “Greens” does not denote environmentalists, but rather members of the ethnic Turkish movement. [pageend107]106 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 of ethnic Turks, overcame the barrier of 4% of the popular vote required to gain admittance to parliament. Other groupings such as UDF-Center, UDF- Liberals, the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union (BANU-United), and BANU- Nikola Petkov have all been reduced to the ranks of the extra-parliamentary opposition. In other words, 25% of the national electorate is unrepresented in parliament. THE BLUES Ever since it came into existence in December 1989, the UDF has had to devote a great deal of attention to staying unified. After all, it was formed in order to give the opposition a realistic chance of defeating the communist monolith in the June 1990 elections. For the sake of this all important goal, many differences between the UDF's constituent organizations were smoothed over. When the opposition was defeated in those first free elections, it needed to formulate a coordinated policy so as not to be reduced to complete insignificance by the communist majority in parliament and continued communist control over the national government, economy, and local administrations. But the differences between the social democrats, agrarians, liberals, moderates, neo-conservatives, monarchists, republicans, environmentalists, and Christian democrats that constituted the UDF soon began to tell. Disputes broke out, escalating after the second Lukanov government fell in December 1990 and various political options opened up to the UDF. Differing opinions about tactics turned into harsh confrontations over control of the decision-making process. Under these circumstances, the breakup of the UDF was inevitable. The first irreconcilable dispute was between the UDF's parliamentary caucus and its National Coordinating Council over the ratification of the new constitution and the timing of the parliamentary elections. This disagreement prompted 39 blue deputies, a minority within the UDF caucus loyal to the Council, to walk out of parliament in May 1991. This gesture permanently changed the atmosphere within the opposition. When the 39 finally returned to parliament at the end of July, they formed a separate caucus. They also refused to sign the new constitution, which had been the work of their former UDF colleagues as well as the BSP. The protesting UDF deputies felt that the new constitution would make it much more difficult to prosecute corrupt officials from the old regime. Furthermore, they felt it would also make it impossible to deprive the BSP of the vast assets it accumulated at the expense of the Bulgarian people. Another major issue that was never settled, even after two national UDF congresses, was over how the UDF should be structured. There were basically two sides to the dispute, and both argued that their conception of the UDF, [pageend108]THE BLUES, THE REDS, AND THE GREENS 107 if implemented, would make it stronger vis-á-vis the communists and increase its popular base. The Democratic Party, Radical Democratic Party, United Democratic Center, and many other small parties advocated a stronger, more unified structure for the opposition. The Bulgarian Social Democratic Party (BSDP), BANU-Nikola Petkov, the Green Party, and Eco-Glasnost argued that only a diverse array of organizations with their “own faces,” linked by an even looser structure, could attract more popular support. These opposing conceptions reflected to some extent a difference of political interests. The smaller parties preferred the secure political cover of a common structure and its symbols. The larger ones, however, looked forward to the time when they would play the game of politics on their own. They became more interested in their own internal affairs and less interested in their relations with other parties within the UDF. Eventually, the UDF — to be more precise, the Coordinating Council of the UDF — split into three groups: UDF-Center (composed of the Bulgarian Social Democratic Party and the Political Club of Eco-Glasnost), UDF-Liberals (the Green Party and the Federation of the Clubs for Democracy), and the “plain” UDF, or UDF movement (including 20 of the original confederation's member groups). There were further splits: All the organizations whose leaders opposed tighter UDF structures and whose parliamentary representatives refused to join the 39 M.P.s who walked out of parliament in May split in two. These splits would occur in a very similar manner. Usually, an extraordinary party congress would be called at which loyalty to the UDF was declared and new party leaders were elected. The new party leaderships would then be recognized by the National Coordinating Council of the UDF as duly selected UDF representatives, while being simultaneously denounced as usurpers by the original leadership. As a result, a number of parties split into two separate organizations, each claiming the same name (without hyphenated qualification): the BSDP, Green Party, Eco-Glasnost, and the Federation of Clubs for Democracy. Despite the splits, the UDF retained its stature as the predominant opposition organization. This was so mainly because the delegates to the UDF congresses, being representatives of local UDF branches and not of the individual organizations that composed the UDF, favored a tighter, more unified structure. They backed the leaders who wanted a single organization and withdrew their support from those who went on to found the splinter confederations. In the elections, of course, the UDF thrashed its offspring-rivals. Perhaps the main reason these groups failed to appeal to the public was their inability to build images separate from that of the UDF. The UDF, on the other hand, grounded its campaign in its strong, clear anti-communist image. Its claim to continuity with the original UDF was also a great asset. It had all the original symbols — the blue flag, the blue ballot — at its disposal. [pageend109]108 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 The UDF-Center and UDF-Liberals had hoped to take a portion of the UDF's electorate and also a chunk of the BSP's. As it turned out, they took only a small number of votes from the UDF and didn't make a dent in the BSP's base: The UDF won 1.9 million votes and its sphnters only about 300,000, or a total of 2.2 million out of 5.5 million votes cast — roughly the same percentage of the vote that the united UDF won in the June 1990 elections. Another reason behind the drubbing that the UDF-Center and UDF-Liberals took at the hands of the UDF was the public's perception that these parties were acting inconsistently. For example, the head of the Social Democratic Party, Petar Dertliev, opposed the participation of his party'in a coalition with the BSP in January 1991. This, one could argue, was the only reasonable option at the time. Yet the portion of the UDF parliamentary caucus that cooperated with the BSP in drawing up the new constitution was led by Dertliev. The splinter groups were also perceived as breakaway factions with no sense of loyalty or anti-communist solidarity. The UDF may have won the elections, but it faces a number of severe difficulties. It will be subject to political pressure from a still powerful BSP and from the political parties outside of parliament, some of which could be seeking revenge. It will have to rely on the Movement for Rights and Freedoms for a majority in parliament. Furthermore, the UDF will have to confront the country's enormous economic difficulties. In order to take the radical steps necessary to restore the economy, it will have to reach a consensus both with its political rivals and with Podkrepa, the powerful independent trade union confederation. Podkrepa, in fact, played a significant role in the electoral success of the UDF. Though Podkrepa's leadership is largely sympathetic to the UDF's broadly stated goal of introducing a free-market economy, it may be forced to oppose any policy that would cause unemployment or lower the workers' standard of living if it wishes to retain its influence with the union rank-and-file. The UDF also faces possible internal problems. Although the most discontented organizations have left, this union still consists of 20 fairly diverse political parties. Satisfying them all will require all the skill and flexibility the National Coordinating Committee can muster. Finally, there is the problem of the BSP's control of a large number of local governments, which could foil any laws or executive orders the UDF government tries to implement. THE REDS Why did the BSP receive so many votes in the October 1991 elections? Although many people have assumed that the BSP's popularity has been constantly shrinking, that's not the case: Since January 1991, the socialists have maintained a stable electoral base. True, the BSP's popularity declined [pageend110]THE BLUES, THE REDS, AND THE GREENS 109 between the June 1990 elections and the fall of the all-socialist government at the end of 1990, largely on account of the economic collapse. But the economic team of the new government formed in January 1991 consisted of people from the opposition. By allowing these people into the government, the BSP managed to shift a good measure of responsibility for the unpopular reform program onto the UDF's shoulders. The BSP also helped shore up its electorate by proposing a more flexible program for reforming the economy. This program called for, among other things, the redistribution of state property — a very popular measure, as it would have distributed state property equally to all adult citizens, at least initially. The socialists' program however, is not characterized by dazzling innovations. It proposes a very slow tempo for reform — which is another reason why the BSP enjoyed a measure of success among the electorate. Surveys indicate that the people who voted for the BSP are generally older and come primarily from the countryside and from small towns; also, a high percentage of its supporters are former communists. These are the people who most fear the loss of their jobs or reductions in their social security benefits — which they originally received from the old party-state. Moreover, it is psychologically difficult for them to accept radical reform because it is the negation of everything they have worked to accomplish. They are being asked to re-examine their entire value system, and this frightens them. Finally, the BSP restricted access to radio and TV, thereby making it difficult for the opposition to get its message to the voters. Unlike several other former ruling communist parties in Eastern Europe, the BSP did not split. There was great tension between the old-fashioned communists and those that wanted to change with the times, but the two groups managed to resolve their differences without going their separate ways. It appears, in fact, that as a result of the BSP's harsh confrontation with the opposition, the old-style communists came out on top in the intra-party power struggle. One sign of this is the BSP's failure to unequivocally condemn the August putsch in the Soviet Union. United and under firm control, the BSP was thus better able to hold its own under generally unfavorable political circumstances. Before the elections, the socialists tried to alleviate their political isolation by setting up a coalition with several other parties. With the exception of the Fatherland Party of Labor, these parties are completely insignificant. Nevertheless, because this coalition includes Christian and nationalistic organizations, the BSP was able to modify its image and broaden its appeal. The appeal to nationalism, in particular, benefitted the socialists a great deal in areas with a high percentage of ethnic Turks: in the Kardzhali, Razgrad, and Targovishte districts, the vote was split between the BSP and the MRF; the UDF did not win a single seat. [pageend111]110 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 Like the UDF, the BSP had the foresight to retain its symbols and capitalize on them during the election campaign. And of course the BSP had an incomparably better-developed party infrastructure than any of its competitors. Finally, there is one important factor that has been overlooked in trying to account for the BSP's surprising success. The percentage of the adult population that didn't vote increased significantly between the June 1990 and the October 1991 elections. Since the socialist electorate remained fairly stable, the BSP's share of total votes cast increased. There were demographic circumstances that contributed to this phenomenon: a great many people (as many as 500,000 by some estimates), most of them young, left the country between the two elections. In addition, 25% of the opposition's votes were thrown away on parties that didn't attain the 4% threshold needed to make it into parliament. Why is the BSP considered to have scored a success at the elections even though it lost to the UDF? One reason is that the BSP will no longer be burdened with responsibility for the collapsing economy. Winning the elections might have been political suicide. Losing them by a small margin still gives the BSP an enormous amount of influence over Bulgarian politics. Their 33% of the vote translated into 44% of the seats in parliament — enough to block proposed constitutional amendments (which will be frequent in the near future) that are against their interests. Furthermore, as the opposition, the BSP will be in a position to benefit politically from all the problems the country will be going through. In the long run, however, the communists' prospects are not bright. Even if they remain united, which is far from certain, they will not be able to escape their totalitarian past. No amount of image-polishing or nationalist demagoguery can change this fact. THE GREENS The mainly Turkish MRF s share of the vote comes as no surprise. Its weight in parliament, however, is something of a shock, especially for the average Bulgarian. Though the MRF won only 7.55% of the vote, it captured 10% [24 seats out of 240] of the seats in parliament. Yet its influence is much greater than even the latter figure indicates, because the ruling UDF needs its support to form a majority in parliament. The question is, What does the MRF want in exchange for its support? Cooperation may not come easily: At first the MRF declared that it wanted a ministry, but the UDF was reluctant to give it one — not because the MRF doesn't deserve one, but because the UDF can't afford to appear too conciliatory towards the ethnic Turkish minority. [In the end, the MRF was not included in the government.] The BSP has shown itself to be all too willing to exploit rising nationalist sentiment. Working out a relationship between the [pageend112]President Zhelyu Zhelev [pageend113]112 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 UDF and the MRF will be an extraordinarily delicate problem. If the relationship goes bad, the possibility of national reconciliation could be lost for a long, long time to come. So far, however, Bulgaria is the only post-communist country in the Balkans which hasn't experienced serious ethnic violence during the transition to democracy. It should also be kept in mind that the MRF is not a monolithic organization that exclusively represents ethnic Turks. Bulgarians who profess Islam (Pomaks) and Gypsies, many of whom are also Muslims, voted in large numbers for the MRF, although the Pomaks do not feel particularly close to the ethnic Turks. Moreover, ethnic Turks did not necessarily vote for the MRF. A short while before the October elections, a number of nationalist legislators, who were quickly joined by the socialists, questioned the constitutionality of registering the MRF. Their objections, though demagogic, were not without merit. According to the newly adopted constitution, political “formations” based on ethnicity or religion are prohibited from participating in elections. A lower court, siding with the nationalists and the socialists, refused to register the MRF. Fortunately, the lower court's decision was overturned by the Central Electoral Commission, which registered the MRF on the grounds that it was a “movement” and not a “formation.” Unfortunately, the whole episode set back the cause of harmonious ethnic relations in Bulgaria — and wound up benefiting the socialists. The BSP used the issue to position itself as a patriotic party and guardian of the national interest. It whipped up concerns about the “real intentions” of the MRF's leadership, and even of the Turkish government. It exploited the fears of Bulgarians in the ethnically mixed regions. The ethnic Turks have good reason to organize politically to defend their rights. In 1985, the communist regime, in an effort to create a uni-national state, forced them to Bulgarize their Turkish-Arabic names. The government campaign led to unrest, and the subsequent pacification of a number of Turkish towns. A number of Turks were killed. Inter-ethnic relations were poisoned. In the summer of 1989, the Bulgarian government opened up the border with Turkey and encouraged its ethnic Turks to leave. Some 300,000, out of a total of about a million, decided that life in squalid refugee camps in Turkey was preferable to the oppressive conditions in Bulgaria. The changes that have taken place since November 1989 have cleared the way for solving the problems of Bulgaria's ethnic Turks. In January 1990, for example, the Turks were granted the right to use their Arabic-Turkish names. But in the poisoned atmosphere left behind by the communists, this gesture of reconciliation touched off a new wave of friction in the hot spots of the ethnically mixed regions. Moreover, the leadership of the MRF maintains that Turkish language classes are not guaranteed to Turkish children in Bulgarian schools, that the practice of Islam is not wholly unhindered, and that other collective rights of [pageend114]THE BLUES, THE REDS, AND THE GREENS 113 Turks are not ensured. Many Bulgarians, on the other hand, warn that the rights guaranteed the Turks exceed their obligations as Bulgarian citizens and may jeopardize the rights of ethnic Bulgarians in the mixed regions. They also fear that ethnic Turkish extremists — some of whom rose to prominence after the 1985 forced Bulgarization campaign — may be too influential within the Turkish movement. These issues are not being passed over in silence. In fact, since the October elections, the Turkish question in the context of the MRF's assumption of political influence has become virtually the number one topic of debate. The current trends, however, are not promising. The lack of a democratic culture and established institutions and structures is making itself felt. It can only be hoped that further democratization will heal this open gash in Bulgarian history. THE LOSERS Pre-election surveys showed that among the 39 parties registered to field candidates (besides the UDF, BSP, and MRF), at least the two UDF breakaway groups and the two Bulgarian Agrarian National Unions (BANU) were expected to surpass the 4% threshold. Why didn't they? It turned out that the split in the UDF was mainly an affair of the leadership within the National Coordinating Council. The electorate for the most part, especially in the countryside, did not regard the UDF-Center and UDF- Liberals as serious alternatives to the socialists. This quickly became apparent to the leaders of the two secessionist factions, who, on the second day of the elections, asked the Central Electoral Commission to count their votes together (which would have given them 6% of the vote). But it was too late, and their request was turned down. Nevertheless, they saw their only hope for the future in a merger, which took place on October 26. They are now called the Bulgarian Democratic Center. BANU-Unitcd was formed before the elections. It consisted of the original BANU (a former communist satellite party), a faction from BANU-Nikola Pet- kov (the opposition agrarian union), and several leading emigrants. BANU- Nikola Pctkov broke with the UDF at the last moment. Both these parties came close to overcoming the 4% barrier; together, they would have been a significant force in parliament. But they remained hostile to each other, and in the countryside where the BSP is very strong, they simply did not represent a credible alternative to the UDF. The presidential elections are scheduled for January 13, 1992. Since the president will be selected by direct balloting, the extra-parliamentary parties will have an opportunity to gain power provided they can field popular candidates. But Zhclyu Zhelev, the current president and former chairman of the [pageend115]114 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 UDF, will be difficult to unseat [Zhelev, in fact, won the elections with 53% of the vote]. The other candidates would probably need the backing of the BSP to have any chance. Such backing, however, would probably come with unacceptable strings attached. The presidential elections are probably the only opportunity the parliamentary outsiders will have to mount the stage of national politics. The three parliamentary groups don't have any reason to call new parliamentary elections before the expiration of the 4-year term. But nothing is certain: an unforeseen chain of events could strengthen one or more of the extra-parliamentary political organizations enough to force the parliamentary groups to come to some sort of an accommodation with them. Granting positions in the government to the newly powerful party or parties would be one possibility. Since November 10, 1989, the day Todor Zhivkov was deposed, Bulgarian society has felt itself on the brink of a dramatic breakthrough. The permanent state of upheaval of the last two years has fostered great expectations, including the belief that everything will be better tomorrow and that democracy will simply materialize on its own. Many counted the days to the October elections as the “days remaining to Liberty.” But of course it is not so simple. The opposition has defeated the communists, but it has not vanquished them. The virtues of tolerance and patience must be learned. The democratic system is not only a more-or-less rational method of governance — it is also a game in which some of the players agree to lose. The main political problem in Bulgaria is that nobody involved in the game is prepared to lose. [pageend116]POLAND 115 THE FIRST FREE PARLIAMENT A Survey of Opinions The following survey was conducted for Uncaptive Minds by Marek Laziňski in November 1991. On October 27, 1991, fully free parliamentary elections were finally held in Poland. In the partially free elections of June 1989, the communists and their allies had been guaranteed 65 % of the seats in the lower house of parliament, the Sejm. The removal of these lame-duck legislators was seen as an important step in Poland's return to democracy. The Polish electorate, however, was not too keen to exercise its right to vote, as only 43% of those eligible to do so went to the polling places. Why such a low turnout for such a crucial election? Commentators pointed to a wide range of causes, including the overabundance of candidates and parties (some 7,000 candidates competed for 460 seats in the Sejm; 600 candidates ran for the 100 Senate seats; 28 parties or coalitions fielded nationwide lists of candidates; and up to 37 party lists were on the ballot in individual electoral districts); the complexity of the electoral law; disgust with the demagoguery and personal attacks of the electoral campaign; and loss of faith in the democratic process in general. Issues played a relatively minor role. The acceptance or rejection of then- finance minister Leszek Balcerowicz's economic program was the main one. Most parties, left and right, attacked it relentlessly during the campaign; its only supporters were the Liberal-Democratic Congress, the Democratic Union, the Party of Christian Democrats, and the Polish Beer-Lovers' Party, who together won only about 24% of the vote. Another significant issue was the extent to which the communists should be held accountable for their past offenses [pageend117]116 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 and prevented from taking advantage of their positions and connections during the transition to a market economy. The Democratic Union and, naturally, the post-communist parties opposed any action in this matter, whereas the parties further to the right on the (still nebulous) Polish political spectrum generally spoke out for tough measures. Who won and who lost? Below we compiled a statistical answer to this question. Our survey respondents discuss this matter in greater detail.

The key player was President Lech Walesa, who is constitutionally empowered to designate the prime minister. Walesa appears to favor continuing the broad path of reform initiated by Balcerowicz, although he has criticized the Balcerowicz plan itself, most likely because the election results show that the Polish public, if it has not rejected free-market reform, at least has deep reservations about the manner in which it has been implemented so far. Finding a man who shared Walesa's views on this matter, and who would be able to put together a viable government coalition out of the fragmented Polish Sejm, was no easy task. The candidates included Walesa himself, Bronislaw Geremek of the Democratic Union (who was actually entrusted with the task of forming a government but who was unable to win sufficient parliamentary support), and the outgoing prime minister, Jan Krzysztof Bielecki. In the end, the president settled on Jan Olszewski of the Center Alliance, a figure many observers consider somewhat too independent for Walesa's taste. After conducting long and arduous negotiations himself, Mr. Olszewski put together a minority government consisting of the Christian-National Union (Catholic Action), the Solidarity Polish Peasants' Party (Peasants' Alliance), the Polish Peasants' Party (PSL), and his own Center Alliance. Finally, on December 21, the Sejm voted to confirm Olszewski's cabinet, completing a process that had begun with the elections nearly two months earlier. What follows is a survey of important public figures, each of whom was asked: What is your assessment of the elections? What has happened in Poland as a result of the elections? Were there any flaws in the electoral system? J.K. JERZY JASIŇSKI Jerzy Jasirtski is lawyer, sociologist, and a judge on the State Tribunal. In order to identify the winners and the losers, we need to determine how the elections should be evaluated. If we analyze the elections according to the more or less clearly expressed desires of the participating political groups, then everyone lost. We can also evaluate them by comparing the parliamentary strength of the post-communist groups versus the post-Solidarity and other former opposition forces before and after the elections. According to this criterion, the recolored communists and their supporters from the similarly recolored — or, as they themselves assert, “renewed” — satellite parties lost, because . their presence in parliament was drastically reduced. The former opposition, [pageend119]118 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 which collectively occupies a decisive majority of the seats in the Sejm, won. But for now, it is difficult to say to what extent this can be termed a “victory. ” The representatives of the many small groups that made it into the Sejm have yet to reveal their political orientation. Also, we don't yet know whether any of the post-Solidarity groups will form alliances with any of the post-communist groups. The situation in the Senate is different. Post-communist forces are practically absent there. The fate of a number of competing political forces sheds some light on changes in the political situation. One of the communists' old allies, the Democratic Party, was all but swept from the scene. This party has only one representative in the current Sejm. Solidarity, which participated in the elections as a separate group, suffered a clear defeat. This electoral failure can be attributed to the departure of most of the trade union's politically-minded and talented individuals, who now have their own political parties. Despite the very active support of the Catholic Church, center-right forces with a national- Christian orientation achieved weaker results than anticipated. The communists retained their electorate and acquired a surprisingly large number of seats in the Sejm. Only the Confederation for an Independent Poland (KPN) can boast of a significant success. This group greatly increased its electorate. Only 43% of those eligible voted. But public disillusionment with politics and especially elections is not the most important factor that influenced the election results. Rather, it was the electoral system itself, which managed to combine the faults of both the majority and proportional systems. This system benefited parties with a stable electorate, e.g., the communists and groups with popular leaders. Votes cast for such leaders enabled people from their parties to become representatives, even though some of them received less than 600 votes. So, all in all, I would say that society lost, for it acquired a parliamentary representation divided between many small parties. It will be exceedingly difficult to establish a stable parliamentary majority, which will be crucial to any government building a democratic political system and a market economy on the ruins of communism. WIKTOR KULERSKI Wiktor Kulerski is a political commentator and served as deputy minister of education in the Mazowiecki government. The electoral results constitute, above all, a defeat for the post-Solidarity groups and for the Church, which involved itself directly in the campaign. For the post-communist groups and the KPN, they are a success. The fact that only 43 % of the electorate participated in the first democratic parliamentary elections is a setback for the Church as well as for traditional democratic ideals. [pageend120]THE FIRST FREE PARLIAMENT 119 It's a sign of society's disappointment with the first two years of a democratic, free Poland. The current situation is reminiscent of Russia after the February Revolution, Weimar Germany, and Poland between 1918 and the 1926 coup. The electoral results are also an expression of society's political and ideological disorientation. The traditional hierarchy of values has been shaken. Material values played an enormous role, and the post-communists, who presented themselves as the defenders of materialism, won. The KPN's success can be attributed to people's willingness to support unknown forces — a phenomenon akin to Stanislaw Tyminski's surprise showing in the presidential elections. Society proved to be susceptible to lies, demagoguery, and even completely incomprehensible ranting. When evaluating the elections, we should realize that present-day Polish society, following two hundred years of selective extermination, is different from the one that we are accustomed to envisioning. Polish society today is very plebeian and recognizes a different hierarchy of values than the intellectual elites. Intensified economic and political instability together with heightened societal disintegration and disorientation followed the elections. The widely observed disillusionment with democracy, the free market, and freedom was confirmed. These factors together diminish public tolerance of the reform process and encourage authoritarian tendencies. The position of the president in Poland has also changed. Lech Walesa fostered political disintegration in order to put himself in the role of arbiter. But now he is beginning to lose control over the situation that he himself brought about. The flaws in the electoral system were not unforeseen. The Citizens' Parliamentary Caucus and the Center Alliance advocated a proportional system. Lech Walesa, who wanted to have a divided parliament, supported their position, at least at first. A secondary flaw of the electoral system was its complexity, which discouraged people from voting. KAROL MODZELEWSKI Karol Modzelewski was elected to the Senate in 1989 and went on to form the Solidarity of Labor party. He did not run in the recent elections, in which his party won only four seats. The results of the elections indicate that both the non-voting majority and a significant portion of those who did vote are disillusioned with the policies — particularly the economic policies — that have been carried out for the last two years under the banner of Solidarity. The successors to the Polish United Workers' Party, the Social Democrats [the core of the Democratic Left Alliance], did remarkably well considering society's strong anti-communist feelings, which prevented those who might have agreed with their program from voting for them. The extent of the shift in society's sympathies can be seen [pageend121]120 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 in the victory of the Polish Peasants' Party [PSL — the former communist satellite] over the peasant party affiliated with Solidarity, and in the success of the KPN, which attracted the votes of those who rejected Solidarity as well as the communists. These elections are a harbinger of bad news for politicians who dream of repeating the anti-communist plebiscite of 1989 and resurrecting the Solidarity camp. I wouldn't blame the electoral system for the outcome of the elections. The electoral system should not be treated as a means of correcting the electorate's will. The Sejm is divided more or less in accordance with the voting preferences of the part of society that voted — and this is the way it should be. After all, the Sejm does not exist in order to make it easy to form coalitions and to govern. It exists to resolve in a peaceful, reasoned fashion conflicts that would otherwise play themselves out in the streets. JAN OLSZEWSKI Jan Olszewski is a lawyer who represented defendants in political trials under the communist regime. He was appointed to head the new Polish government about a month after this survey was conducted. The two key factors that explain the results of the elections are the electoral system and the timing of the elections. When the deputies of the previous “contract” Sejm set the date for the elections, they did so with a purpose: it was clear that the economic and social difficulties resulting from the course of reform pursued up to now would reach a critical mass about this time. Deep frustration led almost two-thirds of society to abstain from voting. In the wake of these elections the Polish political elite should realize its predicament: It has received its final warning from society. The country's situation demands new conceptions, or even a whole new political scene. At the moment, this scene is dominated by the struggle between two groups of veterans: the post-communists, veterans of the totalitarian system; and Solidarity and its political offspring, veterans of the anti-communist movement. In the meantime, society is confronting the political elite with new questions which remain unanswered. The electoral system has many problems — which are the product of conscious manipulation. The so-called proportional principle influenced the results of the elections more than anything else. Actually, this name is inappropriate, because the method of vote-counting favored smaller parties. The minimum barrier that was supposed to protect the parliament from splintering was rendered ineffective^ The complicated voting system discouraged voters, who received a whole booklet for a ballot in which they were supposed to mark not only parties but also the names of individual candidates. Such a complex and [pageend122]THE FIRST FREE PARLIAMENT 121 contradictory system made it possible for an enormous number of groups, many consisting of no more than a handful of individuals, to enter the electoral race. Some of these parties' candidates got into the Sejm. One candidate from the Bielsko-Biala region was elected to parliament by a few dozen votes — he only needed to mobilize his family and friends to win. Such a broad range of groups, many of them unknown and quite strange, discouraged and even frightened away many potential voters. ZBIGNIEW ROMASZEWSKI Zbigniew Romaszewski was elected to the Senate in 1989 and reelected in 1991. It is worth noting that the elections were conducted according to two different systems: a proportional system for the Sejm and a majority system for the Senate. Comparing the results, we see that the majority system succeeded to a significantly greater degree in eliminating parties tied to the previous system. Only four representatives of the Democratic Left Alliance entered the Senate, and the PSL won fewer seats in the Senate than the two peasant groups affiliated with Solidarity. The proportional system, on the other hand, protected people from the previous system and also benefited some of the small political parties; hence, the successes of the Christian Democratic Union and, most notably, of the KPN. The election results constitute an unequivocal rejection of the government's economic doctrine. Poles generally accept privatization, the creation of a free market, and the introduction of competition, but they vetoed the approach that subordinated economic processes to doctrinaire principles — this time free- market ones — that did not take into account the psychological and social realities of Poland. Following the elections, the political elites were absorbed by one question: Who? Who will be prime minister? Who will occupy which position? The questions, What? and, How? have, in the current situation; ceased to provoke interest. Personally, I have serious doubts as to whether anyone has any idea how to stop the recession and to prevent the further decline of state-owned enterprises, which continue to account for 80% of the state's income. KRZYSZTOF STANOWSKI Krzysztof Stanowski is a leading educator who works for the Foundation for Education for Democracy. The elections have demonstrated, more than anything else, that civil society is in decline. For more than a decade, not professional politicians, but [pageend123]122 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 enlightened citizens set the tone of social and political life. Farmers, engineers, intellectuals, and electricians conducted a non-violent struggle for fundamental civic and national rights. It was precisely these people, not “professional politicians,” who made up the bulk of the democratic opposition in Poland during the 1970s and 1980s. These citizen-activists were still present among the Solidarity parliamentarians elected in 1989. Paradoxically, these elections ultimately led many of these people away from politics. They were opposed to Walesa's “war at the top,” to election campaigns obsessed with mud-slinging. For them, withdrawing from political life was preferable to the brutal elbowing that now accompanies the struggle for government positions. In effect, they have been displaced by calculating political players guided in their behavior more by the interests of specific groups than by the concerns of the Polish state. The elections also destroyed the myth of the democratic opposition in Poland. Observing the opposition of the 1970s and 1980s, many individuals had the mistaken impression that the essence of the struggle between the opposition and the ruling communist party was the difference between totalitarianism and democracy. But the election campaign demonstrated that many of the earlier opponents of communism viewed democratic phraseology as a propaganda device. In reality, these people sought to replace the totalitarian communist system with another undemocratic system. MACIEJ STRZEMBOSZ Maciej Strzembosz is a political commentator; he headed the government-run Channel 1 television network in 1991. In contrast to many commentators, I do not consider the election results bad, for four reasons. First, they revealed a state of crisis. If the results had reflected the wishes of the mass media or the political class, the symptoms of the illness would have been covered up. Second, the post-communists lost their decisive majority. The 60 seats they have in the Sejm are a lot, but they represent a considerably smaller percentage of parliament than the communists had before the elections. It is also good that this group took second place, not first. Those 60 seats are simply not enough to halt the process of the reconstruction of the state — but they are too many to pretend that the communist problem does not exist in Poland. The electorate's preferences and the surviving communist structures remind us that we need to put communism behind us. Third, the voters taught the Warsaw-Gdaňsk political class a lesson. All of the groups bom of Solidarity, including Solidarity itself, forgot about an important portion of the electorate — the industrial working class. The KPN succeeded in attracting this segment of the electorate. The KPN can rightly be accused of conducting a populist election campaign, but it is good that this group, and not Tyminski's Party X or the post-communists, won the workers' [pageend124]THE FIRST FREE PARLIAMENT 123 vote. I consider the surprisingly low percentage of votes won by the Democratic Union (UD) to be one of the best effects of the elections. If the Union had taken a dominant percentage of seats in the Sejm, as some polls indicated it would, then a conflict between the Sejm and the president would have been unavoidable. Now that the elections are behind us, a real political struggle has begun over the role of the presidency in Poland. The intra-parliamentary battle lines, however, have yet to take shape. In all probability, it will take at least six months for the real coalitions and divisions to form. The main flaw of the electoral system was its complexity. People did not understand it, so they did not vote. The State Electoral Commission did little to help — in fact, it made things worse. As in the presidential elections, it imposed rules on television campaigning which failed to differentiate between strong and weak parties. The electoral system also encouraged the diffusion of political power within parliament. The KPN was the only party that carefully read and exploited the electoral laws instead of criticizing them. The KPN's clever tactics maximized their parliamentary representation; they won more seats in the Sejm than the Center Alliance, which had a higher percentage of the popular vote. ROMAN ZIMAND Roman Zimand is a scholar and political commentator. The most important thing that the elections have taught us is that the majority of the electorate lacks confidence in the Polish political class. You can't expect 100% of eligible voters to participate, but it seems reasonable to expect at least an 80% participation rate in the first free parliamentary elections. From the beginning of the election campaign it was clear to everyone — the political elites, the episcopate and, above all, the electorate itself — that voter turnout would be low. Appeals to participate in the elections had no effect, regardless of who made them. Because of the low turnout, the parliament's mandate to govern is not nearly as strong as the president's [53 % of eligible voters turned out for the presidential campaign, of whom 75% voted for Lech Walesa]. Those who say that the elections were a political catastrophe, that the political situation radically worsened, are wrong. The only difference is that the situation has been made obvious. The politicians will have to learn to govern in this situation — i.e., amidst the apathy of the majority of the citizenry. They will have to learn to explain to society what they mean. The ideal, though unrealistic, solution to this situation would be the passage of a new majority electoral system and the calling of new elections. But this, of course, will not happen.

Romania's totalitarian hell has become a parody of itself since the December 1989 revolution. Co-opted by Ion lliescu and his colleagues in the nomenklatura, the revolution has not reversed, but accelerated the nation's moral and economic decline. Conditions have worsened particularly in rural Romania, where peasants have yet to receive title to the land they work. Many fields lie uncultivated as a result of shortages of farm equipment and uncertainty. The case of Sapinta, a village of 4,000 inhabitants in the northern county of Maramures, is a remarkable exception to the sad developments since the revolution. Sapinta's residents are once again the owners of the fields and forests that were theirs before Russian tanks brought communism to Romania. At a village meeting held on December 24, 1989, Toader §tetca was elected chairman of the local chapter of the National Salvation Front. A month later, he became Sapinta's mayor. The new mayor, a just and honest man, set to work implementing the policies advocated by all the democratic parties: demolition of the structures of communist rule, privatization of state property, and investigation of abuses perpetrated by the nomenklatura. He has promoted both economic reform and moral regeneration. The most pressing issue for Sapinta's citizens was resolved without delay — and without waiting for the central government to act. A 63-member commission was formed to distribute the holdings of the local collective farm. Each of the former members of the collective received five to eight hectares of arable land. Some 2,500 hectares of pasture and 3,000 hectares of forest were also turned over to private hands. All members of the local nomenklatura, many of whom were caught red-handed in illegal dealings, were removed from office, as were a number of corrupt employees of the local government. Even [pageend127]126 UNCAPTIVE MINDS WINTER 91-92 the village priest had to be replaced. Restoring the moral foundations of civic life after the communist plague of corruption has been one of the most important aspects of the “Sápinta phenomenon.” With enthusiasm — aiidthe leadership of Mayor §te(ca — the people of Sápinta have taken the initiative in creating a free and democratic society. §tetca was among the 50,000 men and women present in Bucharest's University Square on May 24, 1990, the final day of the 52-day marathon demonstration. The young people who occupied the Square were indeed extremists, as the official press dubbed them. They were extreme in their demand for moral purity in political and civic life, and they were appalled that Romanian society was being rebuilt on a base of lies. Toader §tetca addressed the crowd in University Square from the famous balcony that was the rostrum of the Students' League. He described the myriad problems he had encountered in dismantling communist structures in Sápinta and vehemently criticized President Iliescu. Shortly after the bloody suppression of the University Square movement, the forces of reaction began to take revenge against §tetca, who had already been threatened time and again by the “red mafia” of former communists and their cronies still in the government. He was brought to court five times to face a variety of contrived charges. This campaign of harassment culminated in §tetca's arrest on July 13 in the town of Sighet after a manhunt worthy of the Wild West. His fellow citizens stood up to the authorities with a remarkable display of what is certainly the most impressive dimension of the “Sápinta phenomenon,” namely solidarity bom of sacrifice. The villagers barricaded the main road passing through Sápinta and manned it despite constant threats from the police and army. Ighoring the government's efforts to intimidate them, they demanded that their mayor be released and that his trial be open to the public. $tetca's arrest was just the beginning of a nightmarish odyssey. Moved from one prison to another, he was constantly maltreated. His own words offer the best account of the suffering he endured. 1 believe my arrest was a setup devised by the former leadership of Sápinta and Maramures county. The charges against me were dictated from above. I was summoned to Sighet on July 13. Not suspecting anything, I arrived at the IGO (the town management organization) hoping to speak with the inspector who had discovered that 380,000 lei had been embezzled from our local government and that another 1.5 million lei allotted for a water project were missing. I spent a half-hour at the IGO speaking with various accountants and officials, but the inspector did not show up. So I left and went to the Prestarea cooperative. There, too, I spent a bit of time talking with a number of people who were interested in what we had been doing in Sápinta... Later, as I was about to get into my car, I noticed a large number of soldiers and policemen, perhaps as [pageend128]A PARODY OF THE INFERNO 127 many as 250, heading my way. My first instinct was to run, so I did. After about 700 meters, I was about to head down a side street when it occurred to me that the soldiers and police intended to kill me. I stopped and turned to them. Several soldiers grabbed me, others began to kick me. They dragged me off towards a police car, and I started to put up some resistance. They kept shouting that I was a dangerous criminal and had just murdered someone. I told them again and again that I was the mayor of Sápin^a and perfectly harmless. Some people in the crowd that had gathered tried to help me. ‘Leave him alone,’ they said, ‘we know who he is. ’ I was then shoved into a car and driven off to police headquarters. There, another five cars joined us, and I was taken to Baia Mare. During the ride, I was beaten and kicked while handcuffed. By the time we reached Baia Mare, I realized that everything had been planned in advance. There were several police officers on hand who immediately began filling out forms; I had no idea what these forms were. I was treated very badly and was not allowed to communicate with anyone. That continued for about a month, until a government official, General Medrea, and several border guards came and asked me about what had happened. I told them my side of the story, then they left for Sápínta. Shortly thereafter, a prosecution commission led by a Colonel Lupu came to Baia Mare and proposed a compromise, which I later realized was another setup. After a two-week investigation, I was told, they had come to the conclusion that I was innocent. But since the forces of law and order had made a mistake, I was urged to confess that I had shoved or punched a police lieutenant. They would bring the lieutenant to Baia Mare, he would confirm my story, then we would all come to an understanding. Not realizing the possible consequences of what I was doing, I agreed to this proposal... A commission then arrived requesting me to ask the people of Sápinja to remove their barricade from the main road. I complied with this request, and the barricade was removed. Two days later, I was taken to another prison. My head was shaved, then I was subjected to incredible abuse. I am not afraid to report that I was severely beaten and was treated far worse than seasoned criminals. Clearly, they were trying to eliminate me. ^tejca's testimony requires no comment. His courage and the courage of the people of Sápinja offer a model for the nation. “I think individual initiative is the best hope for Romania,” Adina Anghelescu has written, “and Toader §tetca is a remarkable individual. He has assumed responsibility for both himself and his community, and through his actions he is helping to bring about genuine change in the country.” Off in the forested hills, Sápinta is a beacon of hope for the whole of Romania.
