CZECHOSLOVAK SOCIETY OF ARTS AND SCIENCES HISTORY There are no statistics, only estimates o f the number o f Czech and Slovak intellectuals abroad. The first Czech refugees from religious persecution by the Hapsburg Counter-reformation during the Thirty Years War (1618-1648) arrived in New York (then New Amsterdam): the most prominent amoung them was Augustin Herman, later known as the “ Lord o f Bohemia Manor.” During the eighteenth century Moravian Brethern immigrated and established the Moravian Brethern Church o f America, with centers in Bethlehem, Pa., and Winston-Salem, N.C. But while a great many Czech and Slovak immigrants settled in the United States beginning in the 1860’s, before 1939 it was rare for a university professor, writer, or artist to leave Czechoslovakia for permanent settlement abroad. Then came World War IL The Nazi onslaught precipitated the emigration or escape o f some 20,000 persons: amoung these exiles, at least one- fourth were intellectuals. At the War’s conclusion, some returned to 20 [pageend20]Czechoslovakia. Many, however, remained in the United States, Canada, England, France or other Western countries. A still greater exodus began in 1948 after the February coup in Czechoslovakia. In the decade following that coup, over 60,000 people escaped to the West; it is estimated that about one-tenth o f these emigres or some 6,000 are intellectuals, scholars and professional people. Most o f them found their way to the United States, Canada and Australia, while a few hundred established themselves in Western Europe and various countries in Central and South America, Asia and Africa, In the nineteen-fifties it became increasingly difficult for Czechs and Slovaks to emigrate from Czechslovakia either legally or by illegal crossing o f the borders, and the influx o f Czech and Slovak refugees into the United States was reauced to a trickle. But after the liberalized Dubcek regime was crushed by the invasion o f the Warsaw powers in August 1968, another large exodus followed, again largely consisting o f intellectuals, some o f whom were admitted to the United States or Canada, while this time a majority stayed in Western Europe. During the nineteen-fifties, intellectuals who had managed to leave Czechoslovakia and gain permanent residence in the United States felt increasingly the need to maintain and develop Czechslovak culture, while in Czechoslovakia history was being rewritten as if Orwell’s 1984 had been advanced by thirty years and the writings o f past and present Czech and Slovak authors were on the proscribed lists. In 1958, a group o f scholars led by the late Professor Vaclav Hlavaty, a mathematician at Indiana University, and Dr. Jaroslav Nemec o f the National Library o f Medicine began to organize these intellectuals all over the world into a society o f arts and sciences. In 1960 the Society became incorporated under the laws o f the State o f New York, as a not-for-profit corporation, assuming the name o f Czechoslovak Society o f Arts and Sciences in America, Inc. Its activities, as outlined in its bylaws, consist in supporting and coordinating the educational, scholarly, literary and artistic endeavors o f the Czech and Slovak intelligentsia abroad, but the Society’s fundamental concept has been broadened into that o f an organization open to all scholars, regardless o f national background, who are genuinely interested in the advancement o f Czechoslovak scholarship. By a ruling o f the U.S. Treasury Department in 1962, contributions to the organization are tax deductible. The Society is known among Czechs and Slovaks as SVU, an abbreviation o f its name in the Czech or Slovak languages. From its inception the Society has maintained its non-political character and refused to become an instrument o f the cold war. The membership, o f course is opposed to any totalitarian ideology, be it o f the right or the left, knowing that culture and freedom are inseparable. PUBLICATIONS The Society has started an ambitious publishing program. Among its first publications was a monograph on the composer Antonin Dvorak, by the composer J Karel B. Jirak, late o f Roosevelt University. In 1963, Mouton & Co. o f The Hague, published for the Society Essays on Czech 21 [pageend21]literature by Rene Wellek o f Yale University. Papers delivered at the Society’s first two congresses (1962 and 1964) were published by Mouton & Co. under the titles The Czechoslovak Contribution to World Culture and Czechoslovakia, Past and Present respectively, both edited by Miioslav Rechcigl, past president o f the Society and Head o f research o f the Agency for International Development. In connection with the 300th anniversary o f the death o f Jan Amos Comenius (1592-1670) several English translations o f Comenius’ works and a volume o f essays on Comenius (papers delivered at the Society’s 1970 Congress) w e^ published, partly in cooperation with the Department o f Slavic Languages and Literature o f the University o f Michigan. The same cooperative effort also produced a unique bilingual (English and Czech) Anthology o f Czech Poetry, edited by Alfred French o f the University o f Adelaide. In 1971, the Society published, with the cooperation o f the University o f Michigan,- a collection o f brilliant essays in the Czech and Slovak languages, Studies in Verbal Art by Roman Jakobson o f Harvard University. Several other publications followed: a biographical directory o f members (the latest edition appeared in 1978), a number o f publications in the Czech language - a novel, poetry, essays and others. Recently the Society has published a monograph on Czechoslovak Military Justice during World War II in the English language and has instituted a new series of occasional papers. On the occasion o f the USA Bicentennial, the Society published a monumental bibliography on Czechs and Slovaks in North America, the result o f the meticulous work o f librarian Esther Jerabek, a second- generation author o f Czech descent. In the summer o f 1979, the second edition o f Alfred French’s Anthology o f Czech Poetry was published. In 1980, the Society came out with another bilingual edition o f poetry: Jaroslav Seifert’s The Plague Monument, with English translations from the Czech by Lyn Coffin and with collages by Jiri Kolar. In print now is also a bilingual edition o f Jiri Orten’s Elegies, again with translations by Lyn Coffin. Just o ff the press is Miioslav Rechcigl’s extensive new directory, entitled Educators with Czechoslovak Roots: A U.S. and Canadian Faculty Roster. Also scheduled for publication in 1980 are the following: Josef Cada’s scholarly study The Czechs in the United States and an anthology bearing the title A Masaryk Controversy, which will include essays by such well- known figures as Rene Wellek, Roman Jakobson, Jiri Voskovec, Vaclav Demy, and the late Jan Patocka. Since 1959, the Society has been publishing an informative newsletter Zpravy SVU (News o f SVU); since 1964, it has been publishing a quarterly for literature, philosophy and the arts, called Promeny (Metamorphoses). Since the Spring o f 1980, the Society began publishing its English language Bulletin for members and others who do not speak Czech or Slovak. The English Bulletin will appear three times a year as a supplement to Zpravy SVU. THE WORLD CONGRESSES The Society held its first World Congress in April 1962 in Washington [pageend22]DC. Since then, the Society's congresses have been held at Columbia University, New York University, Georgetown University, George Washington University and Cleveland State University. This year’s Tenth World Congress will be held again at Georgetown University, from October 17 to October 19. OFFICERS AND MEMBERSHIP Present membership is close to 1600. Dr. Jan F.

THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AR EA CHAPTER came into existence with a series o f Czech and Slovak Rims shown to an attentive audience in the Spring o f 1979 at Stanford University. Since then, members o f the Society and their friends have been meeting monthly. Cultural sessions o f poetry (and prose) reading attracted about 30 regular contributors and listeners. In the Fall o f 1979, three members o f the Chapter, Eva Kryska. Eliska Ryznar, and Jan Triska, introduced at Stanford University a new course for freshmen entitled “ Czechoslovakia in Eastern Europe and International Relations” . The course surveyed Czechoslovak history, examined Czechoslovak culture, and focused on Czechoslovak politics, especially before and after the Soviet invasion in 1968. Formal student evaluations o f the course w »a uniformly excellent. In May 1980, the energetic and enterprising Chairman o f the Chapter, Paul Kryska, organr ad and arranged a highly successful concert o f Waldemar Matuska at the San Francisco Victoria Theatre; the large house was almost full. As the interest in the monthly cultural sessions o f the Chapter is increasing, the Secretary Jaromir Maly plans to use Staijford1(classrooms for future meetings. THE VIENNA CHAPTER sprang into existence in the Spring o f 1980, almost entirely ,due to the persistence and enthusiasm o f Vera Behai. She arranged the first meeting on February 15, which attracted over 40 potential members o f the Chapter. Jan Triska, the President o f the Society, addressed the audience and spoke about the Society, its many cultural activities, and its aspirations in the future. At the second meeting o f the Chapter on March 5, Ivan Medek spoke about T.G. Masaryk, Lubor Karlik about social implications o f industrial development, and opera singer Jarmila Novotna reminisced about her distinguished career. Since thenlthe new Chapter members elected Vera Behai chairperson and Ivan Medek secretary. The Chapter is now engaged in varied cultural activities on an established monthly basis.
