free europe ! VOICE OF STUDENTS IN EXILE No v e mb e r 1953 INTRODUCING OURSELVES The paper which is now in your hands brings to you the voice of many exiled students from Central and Eastern Europe. You may remember coming across two similar bulletins in the last academic year: “Red and White” published by the Association of Polish Students Abroad and „Student News from behind the Iron Curtain” published by the Association of Czechoslovak Democratic Students in Gt. Britain. These two papers are presented to you now in one issue and under one title. Moreover, the following numbers are expected to include contributions from a few more exiled Student and Youth organisations. At the moment free men are opposed by an enemy who is prepared to realize his inhuman theory of society by any means and at any price. We must either face up to this danger or submit to it. There is no escape from this situation and all responsible people should accept it as a fact. Our task is to give you a better understanding of the common danger by pointing out some facts less accessible to our Western fellow- students who are the vanguard of free peoples in the world. Editor NUS President writes: I was very interested to learn that the Exiled Students' organisations are to publish their own journal. It can do useful work in informing British students of the problems and opinions of exiled students and I wish it every success. We in the N. U.S. enjoy friendly relations with a number of exiled student organisations and receive their co-operation in furthering the work of our national union. For our part, we do everything possible to assist the exiled students, and indeed all students from overseas, to play their full part in the student life of the universities and colleges of this country. We feel that exiled students have much to contribute to the activities of our student unions and whilst they will naturally be somewhat preoccupied with their own special problems, we trust that they will at all times feel welcome to join with British students in cooperation on common problems and furtherance of common aims. Fred Jarvis It is not difficult to guess why we have decided to work together. Although we come from differnent countries and different homes, yet there is something we all have in common: an experience of slavery under Communist dictatorship. We should like to stress the fact that our views are not products of academic thinking but results of practical experience. We all consider it our duty to warn you of dangers which we know to be real, as real as our experience has been. A biased view of which you might accuse us is one we gladly admit—yes, we love freedom and we could not live without it. We are convinced that the right to live in freedom belongs to all and that it cannot be for long denied to our own nations, too. We shall always work for the day when this just demand is satisfied. Our faith is not afraid of facts, it is based on them. PERFECT TRANSLATION Western students seem to have great difficulties in learning how to read Communist press. A very valuable lesson was administered to them by a delegate at the last meeting of the British NUS at Reading. A Russian propaganda leaflet had been sent to him by “World Student News” from Prague, presumably by mistake. The English edition of the same leaflet reads as follows: “Dear Reader: We would like you to send your criticism of our magazine and the suggestions you have for its improvement. Would you please fill in the form below and add any further comments on the back of this form. Your co-operation will help in the better production of “World Student News”. Gratefully Yours...” The literal translation of the Russian text, however, started with the words: “Dear Comrades!” and the last sentence was rather developed in the following manner: “Your co-operation will help in the better production of „World Student News” and in the struggle against capitalist and imperialist enemies”. When NUS President Jarvis brought up this matter before the IUS congress at Warsaw, Communists declared the Russian text to be a forgery and the whole incident an attempt by capitalists to destroy students’ unity. We can hardly understand why they were so excited about it. There was nothing wrong with the Russian text. Naturally they are able to address a studentreader behind the Iron Curtain as “Dear Comrade”, only Communist students being allowed to enter Universities. And logically enough, an improvement in the production of “World Students News” means an improvement in the struggle against capitalist and imperialist enemies. [pageend1]2 POLISH PAGE what we know: THE NEW YEAR September saw the return to school of children throughout the world. We take this opportunity to examine the lot of the several milion Polish children who have either resumed or commenced their studies in the Communist schools of their, and our, country. Let us begin with an analysis of the teaching situation in Poland today —since it is the teachers who are the Communist regime’s chief weapon and instrument in this sector of the Communist attack on the mind. To quote the official line: “To fulfil his duties the teacher should be completely free from the narrow, pseudo-moral, class superstition of the past; fiom the prejudices of a bourgeois society. Otherwise he is not fit to prepare our youth for the realisation of our bold plans for the building of a Socialist Poland”. This is not all. The Education Ministry’s teaching directives for all secondary school teachers begin with an introduction—the same for all subjects—in which the teacher is explicitly told that it is his first duty to: “foster love of revolutionary traditions; love and respect for the Soviet Union— the land of victorious Socialism', a living example to the whole world”. It would be a truism to state that the Communists have by far outstripped the Jesuits of the 16th century in their realisation of the fact that the only fruitful way of inculcating a completely new outlook (Weltanschauung) into the minds of their victims is by intensive indoctrination not of the adult, but of the rising generation. Hence the great importance of the teaching profession. The teachers’ colleges in Poland are under the strictest supervision (see, in this issue, “Youth behind the Iron Curtain’’) of the Ministry of Education. Admission to these colleges is only open to those who can procure countless testimonials of their political and ideological suitability. It must be remembered, and stressed, that in its educational scheme the Communist regime in Poland has been greatly aided by the unprecedented thirst for knowledge of the millions of young people who were deprived of schools' during the war by the Nazi occupant. Of this the fullest advantage has been taken by the regime. The present 6-year Plan thus sums up the aims of the educationalists: “To make our young generation into conscious fighters and builders of Socialism in their own countries, and into conscious participants in the struggle against injustice, exploitation and oppression of the working masses of the world”. It is important to notice here that humanistic subjects are universally neglected, and that the main effort is directed at technical education reinforced by political courses. This is how the “Student’s Almanack” for 1951 summed up the achievements to that year: “Not only has the organisation of the school changed, but also its educational content. New textbooks—based on Marxist ideals, have appeared. The didactic and pedagogical work of the new school aims at forming a scientific outlook and a Socialist morality, and at producing popular patriotism and internationalism”. The Cracow “Polish Daily” for 2.it.1951 boasted: “In a large measure we have secceedcd in purging our ranks (schools') of elements hostile to the regime”. Religion—of course—is absent from all school curricula. Its place has been taken by Communist Ideology classes. This disease even affects technical and art schools where, says the official line: “All teaching must be strictly bound up with the building of Socialism in our country”. However, ideological education of youth has not been entrusted solely to the schools. A large part of the burden is carried by Soviet-styled youth organisations, of which the leading and most important one is the “Association of Polish Youth”. The kind of work this organisation is there to carry out is perhaps best illustrated by the following quotation from the “Sztandar Młodych” (The official daily organ of the Association, with a circulation of about two million): “Thanks to the political work of the A.P.T., youth brigades have helped the Bierut Colliery in fulfilling its production plan in 114%. These youth brigades form a large part of the manpower of the colliery, and often work in the most difficult sectors. On the average they perform from 150% to their norms”. Need we add that these brigades are recruited on the Sergeant-Major principle—“The following shall volunteer”? The duties of all members of the A.P.Y. are summed up in a letter sent to Bierut—when he was still President—by members of the National Committee of School-Activists of the A.P.Y.: “We shall deepen in our youth the feeling of warm solidarity with all the peoples fighting for peace, and especially with the glorious Soviet Touth which is our model. We shall inspire our youth with hate for warmongers and traitors, and their agents in our own country; and we shall teach them, and ourselves, how better to track down and conquer the enemy of our fatherland—in whose defence we are for ever ready”. Children from 9 to 14 are taken care of by the so-called Scout Movement, which “having rejected the scouting spirit of the past, has taken its place among the progressive youth organisation of a country building Socialism, and has become the main supporter of the school in the socialistic upbringing of children”. The new Scout’s Code of Behaviour has been altered accordingly, and reads: “The Scout strengthens our friendship with the USSR... he is the brother of the (Soviet) Pioneer... he prepares himself to work in the ranks of the A.P.Y...” etc., etc... Need we quote more? Need we explain what — and who, are the warmongers whom the Polish child is taught to hate and malign ? Need we to stress that the high standard of human relations and understanding reached after centuries of the Christian Tradition is being demolished in one generation—by methods of unprecedented and systematic ruthlessness, of which the Spanish Inquisition was but a foundering and infantile prototype? We think we can rely upon our readers to draw the conclusions. [pageend2]POLISH PAGE what we know: UNCENSORED LETTER Reprinted from “EAST EUROPE AND SOVIET RUSSIA” We have received an uncensored letter from behind the Iron Curtain which should be read by everyone interested in the future of Europe. The writer is a professor at a teachers’ college. Owing to his progressive views on education, he not only retained his job after the war, but was promoted. ‘'ll is impossible to bring up children to be principled individuals when, to protect their parents and ensure jobs and or higher education for themselves, they njust tell one lot of lies at school and another lot in public places. Except for the children of leading Party members, any grown up gets into serious trouble if his child repeats critical remarks about the Communist leadership. Should this system continue for another few years, our young will grow up not into responsible young persons, but into a horde of unreliable, boorish, faceless creatures, who will creep through life frightened and deceitful. The West will be aghast at the kind of people it will find here if we are eventually liberated. “As it is, half of our thinking people are already more antagonistic to the West than to Russia because they say that the West has let us down. They are furious about broadcasts which encourage them to resist although no western Power intends to help them. what we do: “FOR BETTER LIVING AND STUDY CONDITIONS IN THE CAPITALIST WORLD” Between 27th August and 3rd September there took place in Warsaw the mammoth Hird World Congress of Students. Organised by the Communist International Union of Students, it was the Communists’ final and desperate bid to win back into the IUS the Student Unions of the capitalist and imperialist western countries. Without them even the IUS feels somewhat shy to boast that it represents the aspirations and needs of the student masses of the world. We all know what took place at the Congress. We all have read the brave words of Mr. Fred Jarvis, president of the BNUS. We all know, and know much better from the Communist “humanitarians”, “Westerners cannot conceive of the effects of the uncertainty endured in a Communist state. They do not realize what it does to men’s minds and hearts when no one can be sure of a job, or a flat, a room, a pension, in fact of anything. This applies to industrial workers, agricultural labourers, miners, officials, technicians— everyone. Cowardice, deceit, spite, jealousy, all these horrible traits are magnified until they overshadow everything noble and kind in human beings. “Follow this to its logical conclusion. Children brought up on double standards become perfect liars—or, to put it more cynically, only perfect liars can survive under the Communist system. These youngsters have to make their way in the terrible world of Communist uncertainty, faced by a government which exploits the situation of its own creation to extract a maximum amount of labour from its browbeaten subjects. The Communists pride themselves on having discovered the secret of “bigger and better slavery’’: excruciating uncertainty. In the old days, the slaves who had good masters were reasonably secure. Here no one is secure. • “If this goes on for any lenght of time, our young people will become inveterate liars, their morals further undermined by opportunities for sexual and other excesses what student living and study conditions really are in the decadent West. It would be superfluous to debunk what the Communists have said about them. They are debunked by reality. created for them from the time they join the Pioneers. (Л Communist organisation somewhat on Boy Scout lines, but for both sexes). I hate war because of its horrors and cruelty, but I would gladly fight myself if I could hope to liberate my country from the Communist evil. Not the least of our cankers is the number of informers who batten on us. Here in the College two of my colleagues report to the Security Police. Life has become hell now that we cannot talk freely even in the senior common room. “The West should consider the East European problem from this angle-. Can it afford to allow one hundred million people to have their best instincts killed and their worst enormously developedl When some westerners talk about accepting “realities’’—meaning that East Europe should remain part of the Soviet orbit— I would like to do just one thing-, have bring up their children under our conditions and watch them being scientifically degenerated”. Need we add from ourselves that all that is stated in this letter is not new to us—that we have heard much the same reports from countless students who have escaped from Poland since the war, and whose number grows everyday ? But, unfortunately, the reverse side of the medal is much less known in the free world. The realities of the Communist-dominated part of the world are a grim secret; the most closely guarded secret of the Kremlin and its puppet governments in the capitals of Eastern Europe. It was because of that that the Association of Polish Students Abroad circulated an open letter, on the eve of the Communist Congress in Warsaw, to all those who were going to Warsaw from England, and to the British Press. In this letter—based on first hand evidence obtained from students who have escaped from the Communist heaven: [pageend3]4 POLISH PAGE what we do: (continued) „Dear Fellow-students, In a few days’ time you shall be in Warsaw the capital of our country, in your capacity as delegates or observers to the Hird World Students Congress. Know, therefore, that only a few miles from the conference room in which the sessions of the Congress will take place, and in which speakers will clamour for the improvement of the lot of students in the western world, there is—in Anielewicz Street— the “Monopol” camp, where young people are doing slave labour. If only you were able to visit the overflowing camps and prisons scattered all over Poland today, you would find in them many second-year chemistry students from Lodz University who, in March, 1953, signed a petition for the abolition of compulsory courses and examinations in Marxism-Leninism. These two examples we have selected from a whole flood of facts which daily reach us from behind the Iron Curtain. Vet, the young people you will meet in Warsaw, will not be able to tell you about them. Had they been able to—-you would hear this cry. “We demand freedom', of study, freedom of speech; freedom of criticism and discussion —of association, religion and politics', freedom from fear and misery! We demand to be freed from propaganda and political examinations', to be freed from the intrusion of the Communist Party into our intellectual and social life. We do not want constantly to be fed with hatred towards the West, and with humiliating glorification of everything Russian. We demand the right of free travel abroad', free contacts with students and young people of the West. We demand the opening of the gates of learning and study to everybody without exception—without political and social discrimination. We protest against the favouritism which is shown to opportunists and snoopers. We want a just distribution of scholarships and state grants. We protest against the compulsion which is exerted on us to belong to the Communist “Polish Youth Association”. STUDENT IN EXILE The Association of Polish Students in Exile, although of comparatively recent origins—it was founded in the early years of the Second World War- draws on a tradition of over a century. Ever since the fourth decade of the last century there has existed, somewhere in the world—and most frequently in Paris—an association of Polish students in exile. It was part of the history of Poland of this long period that an association of this nature should have existed. Partitioned and occupied in the last decade of the XVIIIth century, Poland sent her students abroad to study at universities which were free from anti-Polish restrictions and prejudices—to universities where truth was sought for its own sake. Many of those students later returned to Poland to lay down their acquired knowledge and experience on the altar of Poland’s struggle for national independence and progress. Many stayed abroad to work for their country there. All remained Poles, dedicated to the service of the cause which had demanded that they study in freedom. Even to-day, in our Association’s Paris Branch there are to be found letters and documents of a hundred years ago—living testimonials of this westward trek towards learning, and freedom. That our present Association should have been founded in England, and should have attracted to itself all other, local, Polish Student Associations in Exile, was the result of historical necessity. When our Association was founded, only England, of the democratic countries of Europe, was free. Only in England could exiles work for the freedom of their countries. However, all thought, then, that once the war had been won, their task should have ended, too. All thought that they should return to a free Poland with the fruits of their labours in exile. All thought thus—and all were disappointed. The war eneded, and Poland did not regain her freedom. Exiles remained exiles. The Association of Polish Students in Exile continued in existence—its ranks swollen by thousands of ex-soldiers, who had fought for their country, and for freedom, in Africa, in Italy, and in Normandy and Germany. They now continued this fight as students. No less than ten thousand of them have passed through our Association. To-day the Association of Polish Students in Exile still has well over one thousand members, scattered all over the free world. Their bulk—over eight hundred—live and study in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Not all of them are exiles of long standing. Quite a few are recent escapees, who have still to learn the new language, and get acclimatised. For them the Association has started a Scholarship Fund which, although wholly dependent on private donations, is still rising. There are those who study, or wish to study, in the evenings, in various colleges and institutes. For them the Association is publishing an informatory pamphlet. One could go on enumerat ing these various groups ad infinitum. There is scarcely a day when a letter does not arrive at our headquarters in London raising a new problem. Individual cases make up most of our files. Hardly ever do we have to reply that the Association can do nothing. It is the Association’s selfappointed duty to cater for all its members, and to do so free of charge. All in all, the Association of Polish Students in Exile is an organisation with limitless obligations and everexpanding spheres of activity. Social, cultural, practical, informatory, financial—are but its main, most easily defined, fields of work. All, however, are equally important; all, taken singly and together, fall within the over-all aim of working for a free and independent Poland. We, students, members of the Association of Polish Students in Exile, regard ourselves as, and believe ourselves to be, the trustees of this New Poland of the (near, we hope) future. Whatever we do, and wherever we are, we shall always be ready to lay our knowledge, experience and faith at the altar of Freedom—yours and ours. [pageend4]CZECHOSLOVAK PAGE 5 T. G. M. The three letters above have a magic meaning for all Czechs and Slovaks in the world. They stand for the name of Thomas Garrigue Masaryk and represent the political programme of the first Czechoslovak republic which was founded 35 years ago on the 28th of October 1918. This democracy lasted for 20 years and fell victim to the first attack of German Nazism. An attempt to revive her spirit was made in 1945 but after three years of struggle ■under the most unfavourable conditions the already weakened democratic forces were overcome by an aggression of Russian Communism. But those among the Czechs and Slovaks who believe in the victory of truth will never give up. The ideas of T.G.M. represent the best principles they stand for. Following are a few quotations from Masaryk’s works: „The strongest argument for democracy is faith in man, in his spirit and immortal soul: that is true, metaphysical equality. Ethically democracy is based on the political realization of love of one’s neighbour...” „Democracy on its social side means abolition of degrading misery: in a republic, in a democracy, it must not be possible for individuals or ranks to exploit their co-citizens—in a democracy man to man must not be merely a means. The natural variety must be organised through the division and graduation of functions and work: no organisation of men is possible without superiors and subordinates, but it must just be an organisation, and not privilege, not aristoctatic coercion but mutual service. Democracy needs leaders, not masters.” „A man does not live on bread alone, nations do not live on bread alone. I do not believe in the omnipotence of political violence...” I remember what Napoleon came to on St. Helena: That in Europe there would no longer be any other arrangement possible except league of nations... Well, I wonder: How many Napoleons and little Napoleons will have still to come to reason?” „Reciprocity, internationalism, cosmopolitanism—we have a more comprehensive word for it: humanity. The development of the world is working towards universal humanity...” (“Masaryk on Though and Life” published by Allen and Unwin). For the benefit of Czech and Slovak students Masaryk once wrote a book called “How to work” (published by Allen and Unwin in one volume together with “Ideals of Humanity”). The last chapter “Concerning Compromise” we quote in full: „The subject of compromise would require many words. I should like to call attention to Morley’s work on the subject. Every compromise is bad. The question is whether it affects principle or only indifferent matters. If principle is endangered, compromise is morally impossible. We know from experience that very few occasions arrise in which indifferent matters only are at stake. Compromise, therefore, most frequently means that in principle the party to it gave in: thus originates the ethical and political dilettantism so common in our country. The voters will pass a radical resolution as readilly as, within the hour, they will pass a conservative one: I do not hold the electoral masses responsible. The man from the country does not understand politics, he is not very much interested in these matters, having heard only a few formal political speeches in all his life. But it is just the intellectuals who should be blamed: the onus falls upon the comparatively small class of educated people. IN MEMORIAM 17.XI.1939 Josef ADAMEC Jan CERNY Mark FRAUENWIRTH Jaroslav KLIMA Bedřich KOULA Josef MATOUŠEK Vaclav SAFRANEK Frantisek SKORKOVSKY Jan WEINERT The above nine names are those of the student martyrs, members of the Executive of the former National Union of Czechoslovak Students who were shot dead by the Nazi soldiery after student demonstrations in Prague. The day of their execution later became International Students Day. No one can ever doubt what this date have always symbolized: The determined will of students to fight at any time and under any circumstances for their human rights and above all for their national independence which is the basic requirement of independence in any other sense. Freedom belongs to student life like water belongs to sea, without freedom no student can live. Those nine colleagues died that we could live in freedom. How do we carry on their legacy? What have we done for the common cause of student freedom in all parts of the world? Have we always stood firmly against the dictators who oppress their fellowcitizens either in the name of a totalitarian principle or in the name of the people itself? Or did we sometimes think that it is better to sacrifice other peoples’ freedom for the sake of our own prosperity ? Thus, if a new and better order of things is to replace the old we must all bring it about by studying politics properly and by showing a stronger determination to stand for our truth, by cultivating a fearlessnes in speaking our minds...” [pageend5]6 CZECHOSLOVAK PAGE LOOKING TEMPORA MUT AN TUR... Mr. Zdenek Nejedly lately Minister in the Czechoslovak Government and a Communist old-timer wrote about Masaryk in 1937: “I gazed at Masaryk, who was then already 60 years old, with admiration. How far ahead of his time he was... Professor, philosopher, ideologist, yet he spoke by deeds. When news later arrived of his political work in exile, I vividly recalled his promise'. The main steps are yet to be taken. I also saw him in 1918 when he returned to the country in triumph... How great he was, a unique phenomenon and example...” And time passes by. The crowning work of Masaryk’s lifetime, free and independent, democratic Czechoslovak republic lies in ruins. People did not learn how to live up to his ideals. Mr. Nejedly no longer speaks of Masaryk with admiration. Now he writes books about his treachery of the Czech nation, about the crimes against the people. As an ugly little old pigmy he tries to climb up the pedestal of a great man. This is what one of the peace-loving characters of his evil gang wrote recently in the Prague paper “Literarni noviny”: “Ever since 1890’5 Masaryk dragged our cultural and spiritual life into the service of decadent bourgeois Westernism, and displayed his cosmopolitanism... Sharply different from Masaryk, Nejedly’s roots are deep in the national soil, and neither Comte nor Mill have been among his teachers... It was inevitable that cosmopolitan Masaryk became in his development the servant of American imperialism, while Nejedly by changing to a Communist position has once more brilliantly confirmed the fact that only the working class and Communists are the legitimate heirs of the people’s democratic traditions”. But time passes by very quickly now. Nejedly’s struggle seems to be over. When the Czechoslovak cabinet was reshuffled a few weeks ago, he lost his post of the Minister for Culture. He is still in the Government but they would not even let him come before the microphone which he used for such a long time to spill his folly on the nation. BEHIND THE May be somewhere in the country another Communist rascal sharpens slowly his pen to have the article ready when the Kremlin clock strikes. Inevitably he would begin by saying: “It was inevitable, that the old trockyist- slanskyist Nejedly turned traitor to the working class of this country because of his bourgeois origine. Which once more bri- liantly confirmes the fact that only the working class and the Communists are the legitimate, etc. * * * This is all very funny and enjoyable. Somewhere, very far from here, people behave like wolves. What can you do with wolves ? You cannot really co-exist and make peace with them. Therefore it is better to close our eyes and think that they are lambs. May be they won’t jump on our throat. It would be a great tragedy if they did. A great tragedy indeed, because our hopes for a lasting peace would be spoiled. Not for long, of course, because soon, there would be only wolves left in the world. Perhaps we don’t mind. Or do we? * * * SCHOOLTEACHERS ON HOLIDAY A further proof that a special vocabulary for Communists is badly needed is given by the Rude Pravo of 23 July. It describes the “holidays” of schoolteachers”: “After the school term is over the teachers start their holiday and begin to carry out their vacation duties. Mistresses from all kinds of schools from kindergartens upwards, are to take care of children in public nurseries and youth organizations. The teachers will take up their places in recreation centres, youth camps or will lead hop-picking brigades. Rural schoolteachers will help on the collective or State farms during harvest, especially in cultural and propaganda work...’ And they still call that holidays. CURTAIN DECADENT CULTURE.. “WHERE NO VULTURES FLY’» at the Communist Film Festival Did you read the IUS resolution on understanding among nations? Here is a small illustration of how this principle is applied behind the Iron Curtain. Film critics at the recent International Film Festival in Karlsbad were discussing the British film “Where No Vultures Fly”. Readers of the Communist Youth daily “Mlada Fronta” were reminded that capitalist films must be measured by different standards because of their cultural decadence. On 2nd August 1953 the progressive eye recorded : “Where No Vultures Fly” is a film made in Africa, in the British colony of Kenya and concerns a young man’s struggle for the establishment of a National Park to save wild animals from extermination by biggame hunters. Tes, it deals with wihi animals, not with the plight of the African- native. The latter, although often seen in this fast-moving and often exciting picture- showing their knowledge of nature and saving human life, are a secondary subjects The film, therefore, is marked by an imperialistic and colonial view of African nativesand lacks even a shadow of the social criticism which is portrayed so vividly, truthfully and naturally by a recent documentary film of our travellers Zikmund and Han- zelka”. (These are two Czechoslovak, film producers who some time ago. travelled by car through Africa and India. Their work, which was to be a documentary film on nature and life- in Africa, turned out as generally happens in the peace-loving countries of the East, to be an instrument of antiBritish propaganda—Ed.). Just a short question, please. Somehow we wonder, whether the present Communist Government of Czechoslovakia would allow British filmproducers to turn out a film in Czechoslovakia which would show “vividly,, truthfully and naturally” social criticism of life (if that is the word) on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain. [pageend6]CZECHOSLOVAK PAGE 7 WORKERS PREPARE FOR UNIVERSITY A worker, who recently escaped from Czechoslovakia, was describing the Communist method of preparing workers for the University. Individual employees are chosen by factory committees, only those workers of faultless proletarian origin and absolute political reliability being considered. Those picked are sent on special short courses to acquire in one year knowledge which an intelligent student normally takes eight years to absorb. The particular course described by the refugee worker took place in W. Slovakia (Trnava) from 28th October 1952 to 16th August 1953 and was attended by 185 candidates below the age of 25 years. A special boarding house was at their disposal and the daily programme was made up as follows: Six о‘clock reveille followed by one hour‘s physical training. After breakfest one hour was given to compulsory reading of the Soviet and home press and discussion of various articles. On Saturday afternoons candidates took part in a field military exercise. In case of bad weather a talk on military theory was substituted or the military exercise was postponed until Sunday. A strict military discipline ruled during the course. Free time was always spent collectively in one debating circle or another devoted to party propaganda. Walks in the countryside were taken in groups, too, and if anyone wished for solitude and did not mix with the rest, he became suspect. From time to time candidates rooms were searched. The head of the course was the chairman of the Local County Council. A native of Bohemia, who however, used Slovak pseudonym of Karol. The method of instruction is well illustrated by his attempt to uproot the religious ideas of some of his pupils. The whole group was divided into two parts: Christians and Party freethinkers, after which a debate took place at which each side was to try to persuade its opponents as to the rightness of its belief. Naturally the result can be all too easily imagined: the believers did all the listening and hardly any talking, fearing that their defence of Christianity would be regarded as a proof of their political unreliability. As a result of this method of instruction nearly a hundred workers left the course before its end. * * * THE GREAT MAN OF BRITAIN (As seen from behind the Iron Curtain). An average reader of Czech Communist newspapers, if he tries to form a picture of Great Britain must necessarily come to the conclusion that one of the gratest leaders of the British people and one of the greatest men it has ever produced is the Red Dean. In the organ of the Czechoslovak Youth Organization “Mlada Fronta” the following was published on 7th August this year: “Л narrow clerical collar, golden chain round his neck, a plain black cassoc, the Fucik-badge on his lapel (given to the Czechoslovak Com. youth for outstanding political work — Ed.) — that was our impression of the Dean of Canterbury when he stopped in Prague on his way to Bucharest (where the Communist Youth Festival took place — Ed.)... In his country, England, he contributed greatly to increasing knowledge of the USSR among the masses. His impressions of the land of the Soviets were published in several books. Perhaps the most important one is the “Socialist Sixth of the World” which ran into more than twenty editions in capitalist England. In his country during a serious international crisis last year the progressive Dean of Canterbury publicly denounced the bloody Korean war and revealed to the British people the barbaric acts commited by Americans in Korea. He was to have been prosecuted for his statement but the Public Prosecutor let the case drop, for fear that great discontent would be caused among the working classes, shocking them into even greater political activity”. IUS AND COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL (any resemblance is purely coincidental) During a recent Congress of the IUS in Warsaw the Chinese delegation handed over as a gift a red flag on which were the following words: “Students of the World Unite!” It is remarkable how this organisation, which boasts of uniting within itself students of all shades of political opinion resembles in some of its official pronouncements the Communist International. It is not difficult to guess what these two have in common. Of course, unlike the latter, the IUS counts amongst its members “Conservatives, Liberals and Socialists” (at least that is shamelessly stated it its appeal to the students of the world). We wonder if the Secretariat of the IUS could kindly tell us how many Conservatives, Liberals and real Socialists in includes. We beg the IUS President Berlinguer to count them on his fingers; one hand should be more than enough for this purpose. We sympathise with his difficulties; there are not many Concer- vatives, Liberals and Social democrats who can be nowadays seduced by the appeal to student unity under Communist banners and slogans. Political toleration is interpreted quite simply by the comrades in the IUS Secretariat: “Co-operation and toleration is possible as long as you agree with us and play our game”. As soon as the non-Communists try to strike an independent note and reveal the true aims of the comrades, as was done by the NUS President Jarvis in Warsaw, they are met with the cry: “Fascist reactionaries, servants of imperialism, warmongers” and similar specialities of the Iron Curtain vocabulary. After the years of painful experience, it is surprising to find that some British students are still trying to co-operate on concrete issues with the boys who play the Kremlin game. In everyday life we do not usually sit at one table with well known swindlers and card-sharpers What good can it bring about when you do the same at the international level? [pageend7]IUS Congress in Perspective of Truth From our special correspondent The circus was in town again. Well prepared for the minimum of mental exercise which is required from the young Communists, they came from all parts of the world. Also a few strangers came to see what was going on behind the Iron Curtain. The congress started with a very long speech by the secretary general Mr. Berlinguer. Though his speech was lenghthy, he made his task easier by adopting a very stereotyped pattern: Whatever is found in the student life in the West is bad, whatever is found in the student life in the East is splendid! Of course, he made a few points which we would like to take up. Summing up the present day situation he said: “The day-to-day struggle to meet study expenses and to purchase books and equipment, anxiety over the cost of living and many other worries, prevent the development of a proper education and tend to choke the personality of the student”. Well said, Mr. Berlinguer, only it is a pity you did not mention the main evil which not only tends to choke the personality but which actually choked up the personalities of a whole generation of students and that is Communism and Marx-Lenin-Stalinism which you cram down their throat day and night. Comrade Berlinguer complained very bitterly about the grim facts of student vacation work in the West. On the same subject the Soviet delegate boasted later on: “During the summer and winter vacations our students do not work, they rest in resthomes, sanatoria and tourist centers, or travel round the country”. There is only one thing wrong with this student paradise behind the Iron Curtain—it just does not exist. Obviously Mr. Berlinguer had not listened to the Prague radio on the 9th July 1953 when they were talking about student vacation work in Czechoslovakia. If he had he would have known that in that particular student paradise “until this year summer vacation work merely fulfilled the role of voluntary brigade work to help production. Now it forms part of the educational programme authorised by the Ministry of Universities. Heads of University departments outline a month's practical work for the students in their charge. On completion of this work the students submit written reports on it to the manager of the establishment in which they have been working, and the manager in turn reports to the University on the work of individual students. The scheme covers not only factories, but also other fields of activity, such as offices, law courts, hospitals, clinics, scientific research institutes, etc....”. So this is the truth about vacation work behind the Iron Curtain. dAn you have no choice either because you jolly well go where you are told to go and moreover, there will be a supervisor to watch you and report on you to the authorities. Of course, there is still the possibility, that the Soviet delegate said “rest-homes” and meant “factories” instead. You never know what they mean in their double-talk. The question of scholarships was also widely discussed. And again: plenty of grants for everybody behind the Iron Curtain while the poor devils in the West have to do part-time work. And not only Mr. Berlinguer complained. Also comrade I. Husein from Trinidad a student of the London School of Economics agreed with him. He said in an interview with the editor of “Kongress’: “I myself in order to be able to study at the University, have to work 5 hours a day in an Institute for the research of public opinion. And there are many like me in London”. For the benefit of Mr. Husein and many like him in London and everywhere we would like to make it clear that scholarships behind the Iron Curtain are means of corruption, an advance payment for the future services to the Communist Party. Before you are eligible you must prove that your parents are all right and your political ideas adapted to the new regime. Secondly it should be stressed that peoples’ democratic students do quite a lot of work, namely in the voluntary brigades, preferably on Sundays and holidays. There are two snags in it: These voluntary brigades are in fact obligatory and you don’t get paid for your work. Students in the West on the other hand, if they are compelled to work, get their pay which, as you can observe in the case of Mr. Husein is enough to carry them as far as Warsaw during their holidays. In order to grasp the general pattern of the conference, you want to imagine about four or five Communist speakers from the West, one after another repeating that all is rotten in their respective countries and that students must fight for a better future. These series would be interrupted by a speaker from a peoples’ democracy who would say how splendid the conditions are in his country and that he and his friends are ready to help their less fortunate colleagues in their fight. Also there would be a detailed description of the suffering of students in USA by a genuine American Communist (name withheld), dignified contempt for the capitalist and imperialistic attempts of Mr. Jarvis to break the students’ unity and finally a little community singing. There was, however, one magnanimous gesture on the part of IUS which we appreciate very much. In the resolutions of the Congress we read in the chapter on Living and Studying conditions the following recommendation: “The institution of campaigns for solidarity with all students suffering from lack or loss of academic or democratic rights”. Since we, the exiled students of Europe, are the first who suffer from loss of both academic and democratic rights in our countries we thank thelUS most heartily for their kind thought. But with their permission we would like to suggest that instead of organised “campaigns for solidarity” we would very much prefer to get the proof of their sympathy in kind (i.e. roubles). This would enable us to print more copies of our paper and consequently to co-operate more fully with the IUS according to the chapter on Cultural and Educational Exchange, which states that “arrangements should be made for the reciprocal exchange of... publications”.
