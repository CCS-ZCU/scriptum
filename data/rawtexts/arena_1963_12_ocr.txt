[pageend2]ARENA NOTES ON THE SHORTER STORY The regional significance of modes of expression is startling when interpreted in a geographical or racial context. The essential experience of the European mind seems to have been time—-whatever the form of art that the artist practised. In this sense, and in this sense alone, the paths of scientist and artist have been running along parallel courses, at least in what, for want of a better word, we can call the modern age, introduced by the Galilean experiments. Obviously, it is no fortuitous accident that this concept, of time occupies so dominant a place in our thought; the roots can be traced in biblical legend with its emphasis on an ancient of days, judgment day, pinpointed creation —but the accident, insofar as it is that, remains gloriously symbolic of the essential character of European art. Eastern art—or for that matter Inca or Aztec art— is the expression of an experience of timelessness. Contemplation is not the key-word: by using it we have misled ourselves : Confucius defined wisdom as aloofness “. . . while respecting the gods and demons, to keep aloof from them: that may be called wisdom,” Lun You, vi, xx). (Inca and Aztec art are, of course, not ‘wise1). Only the prehistoric nations of America, the Chinese (and the Japanese have succeeded in building, or throwing what are truly! beautiful pots: the art of pottery is ‘abstract’: the beauty of a shape, coupled to that of glaze, may only reflect the experience of timeless- 1 [pageend3]ness—or at any rate, stepping outside the boundaries of time. Once it carries allusions, it is defiled. That is the reason for both the anonymity and the greatness of say the Raku potters; and that is the reason why, by imitatively contributing their personality, the European potters, and especially the modern English ones, fail. The traditions of anonymity (or call it modesty) are married to the experience of timelessness; whereas individuality (its ideal as tradition) is allied to an experience of time: sometimes after the fashion of St. George whose image cannot be divorced from that of the Dragon (of time)—and sometimes as Orpheus whose music enchants (temporarily) the beasts of time. The self-effacement of the Eastern sculptor or potter and the ego-assertive pose of the Western counterpart are both religious attitudes. No value-judgment in general can be based on this distinction—but a moment’s reflexion will justify the type of general value-judgment that I would, nevertheless, wish to base on this observation. I To my mind music is the p a r - e x c e I l e n c e, the most characteristic expression, as well as the most perfect one, of European artistic genius. Eastern music, related to the experience of permanences, seems, to me, dull. Music, in Europe at any rate, has always been the division of time into particles of rhythm defined by sonorities of tune, or even mere noise; in this process it came to stand for—only exploited the process of time much as the pure thoughts of pure scientists—• (Galileo, Descartes and Pascal were contemporaries of Palestrina and Monteverdi; Newton a contemporary of Lach; Mozart of Laplace; Beethoven of Lobachevski and Bólyai; Einstein of Schoenberg). I can make my meaning even clearer by opposing the qualities of the great Chinese novel to its European [pageend4]counterparts: character is the tool of the European writer and in his hand it shapes events; in the Chinese and Japanese works I had the opportunity to read, character is of secondary importance—it is the event which shapes character. Quixote, the greatest of all European symbols, can even create events that do not exist—M o n key is made and converted by the facts of his fate. Character is time as the expression of man: as a man raised (among other ideas) on the aesthetic theories held (or perhaps merely propounded) by George Lukács, I would define it as, in part, a representational summing up of chances granted by a period in history; facts, in the Chinese sense, are timeless because they are not of man's making. The eastern persona may have characteristics that make him distinguishable (e.g. he!she may be old or young, good or bad, short or tall—but things happen to him or her nevertheless, and he or she, however big for the sake of argument, will not be surprised by passing through a metaphorical key-hole) : the western character attempts to create events (widen perhaps key-holes) and even in creating them, questions them—and his criteria are those of time and time- l es snes s. It is, I think, for this reiason that as a form of art the eastern short-story (novella) is such a conspicuous failure in spite of the fact that, occasionally, it amuses. The Ming period short stories tell merely a tale and lack the sp)ace that would naturally place their meaning in that extra-temporal territory of myth which contributes to the staggering and (surprisingly) realistic magnificence of the sprawling, almost endless Chinese novel: they take place within their specified and very narrow field of reference—demlanded by the shortness of the tale: having a timeless vision, they seem to be unrelated to those co-ordinates of eternity which might give mean3 [pageend5]ing to the vastness of space which opresses them from within. In them the essential solitude of man cannot find expression—-as, indeed, it does in the Chinese novel and the shape of the Raku pots. I would not say that the solitude of man must be expressed by the artist—its expression is incidental. A letter is not defined by the address we write on the envelope: but, unless we do so, it is unlikely to reach the addressee. The expression of solitude is the agreed convention of communicating. Attitudes to the universe influence us in the modes adopted—and, obviously, these attitudes influence the degree of success we may expect "when we write letters”. I do not think that any European will ever build a perfect pot which speaks its silence, nor do I think that an Indian or a Japanese composer will ever hear those intervals of time which silenced the speech of Mozart and Schubert. The short-story (of the novella type) is more perfectly suited to the expression of the individual experiences of the European writer, it appears to me, than, say the novel or the epic: the clause is, once again, the same one: the very shape of the novella is built on ‘movements’ closely similar to those of the sonata form : it is more attuned to the commitments of time. Its shape is dynamic. In it the timeless objects of aloofness and wisdom become absolutely and ridiculously irrelevant. The writer of the great short story is entirely on his own. Possibly, this explains the 'attraction of the genre to the greatest of our literary figures: Chekhov, Tolstoy, Dostoevski, Joyce, Krúdy, Thomas Mann, Lawrence— in spite of the fact that, from purely a commercial point of view, the novel has always been a better paying proposition in most countries. It could not be resisted by them—for it provided them with a chance of full commitment to the European idea—whereas, in the 4 [pageend6]Anglo-Saxon countries especially, the concentrated, essential utterances of the genre provided readers in general at any rate, ■with a -will to resist it, and for exactly the same reasons: for they were still just sufficiently quick to realize that in the gre'at short story they were confronted by the time-committed visions of European man. J. C. ARKAY 5 [pageend7]LASZLO Cs. SZABO LES CERCUEILS L’histoire se passe à Naples, en 1961. Cela commença avec la mort de notre petite fille Gabriela. Déjà je le raconte mal, j’ai déjà mal commencé. Mais même aujourd’hui, je ne peux pas rassembler mes esprits quand je pense à cette époque-là. Cela commença avec la mort de sa petite fille. Quand je le dis comme ça, ce que je raconte se comprend mieux. A partir de l’instant où la grosse vieille religieuse de l’hôpital avait serré ma femme contre elle de crainte qu’elle ne s’effondre, l’enfant morte devint sienne exclusivement, elle l’appela sienne comme si elle l’avait conçue sans péché. Pourtant, tant que Gabriela vivait, elle se comportait juste à l’inverse, en la tournant vers moi elle la montrait sur son bras aux parents, aux amis, à tous les passants, regardez, c’est le portrait d’Aldo, c’en est risible tant ils se ressemblent, regardez son oreille, et la manière dont ses dents poussent, même son cou, —• tourne-toi donc, Aldo ! même son cou a la même courbure derrière que son père. L’oreille de ma petite étoile était encore bien minuscule et ses dents se voyaient à peine, et ce qu’on en voyait était pareil que ce qu’avaient les autres petites filles. Bien sûr, cela me faisait plaisir qu’elle me rappelle tellement dans notre fille, que sur mon corps elle superpose l’image de son petit corps. Et un jour, à la procession de la Saint Antoine, alors que Gabriela était l’ange et portait une 6 [pageend8]robe bleue semée d’étoiles, et qu’autour de nous tous les gens disaient oh ! qu’elle est belle, elle est belle, répondit-elle en se coulant a mon côté, car elle est à Aldo. Cela me fit d’autant plus mal qu’à partir de sa mort, tout d’un coup, elle fit comme si pour toujours elle était devenue sienne. De qui donc avait-elle reçu ses yeux ? Avec sur le bord des points d’or tout autour, à cause desquels à l’armée et plus tard à l’usine les copains m’appelaient celui qui a des yeux d’or. Et j’étais encore plus amer car je soupçonnais qu’elle le faisait par représailles, sottement et obstinément elle voulait me punir en me retirant la morte, notre morte, parfaitement ma morte, Gabriela. Comme si elle s’était mis en tête, comme quelque vieille femme obstinée que c’est moi la cause de cette mort en traînée de poudre. Car la mort vint, se répandit et détruisit comme une traînée de poudre. A l’aube, Carmela me secoue, cours chercher un médecin, l’enfant suffoque, regarde, elle est toute violette, moi à demi? réveillé j’étais déjà dans la rue, je fonçais chercher le vieux médecin dans le voisinage, je fonçais en chemise, pieds nus, tel que je m’étais écroulé sur le lit à minuit, j’avais seulement enfilé un pantalon. Nous travaillions alors intensément à l’usine, avec beaucoup d’heures supplémentaires. Il fallait mettre à flot le bateau-citerne pour le jour de la Fête-Dieu, et ainsi fut fait, la femme du Président de la République vint chez nous à Stabies pour le baptiser. Depuis on en a commandé trois pareils, un pour les juifs, un pour la Syrie et un pour la Tunisie si je me souviens bien. Le médecin est venu tout de suite, il a sauté de son lit comme une jeune recrue, et pourtant il a passé soixante dix ans, nous avons célébré son soixante dixième anniversaire l’année dernière, tout le quartier l’a fêté, avec illuminations et sérénade, parce que du plus loin que je me souvienne, le jour comme la nuit, il surgit là où cela va mal et quelle est la nuit qui n’a son lot de terreur [pageend9]aveugle et de souci profond, de détresse et de chagrin dans ces rues débordantes d’enfants. Son père était usurier, il pressurait ses misérables petits débiteurs; son fils, lui, n’accepte pas d’argent des pauvres gens. Il veut réparer les fautes de son sale père. Il a même payé la voiture qui a conduit ma petite fille à l’hôpital. Vers midi on a téléphoné sur le chantier de constructions navales, que je laisse tout, que je vienne si je veux la voir encore vivante. On m’a laissé aussitôt partir, j’ai pris une voiture à la porte, elle a foncé comme une enragée, il était déjà trop tard. C’est d’abord au cimetière que je fus frappé par le comportement de Carmela. Les autres femmes, sa mère et ses trois sœurs s’arrachaient les cheveux, se tordaient les mains. Elles pleuraient, se lamentaient et chancelaient dans le convoi au long du chemin, et elles praient la Madonne pour qu’elle aime et veille sur Gabriela à leur place. Seuls les yeux de ma femme étaient secs. Secs sa bouche, son front, son visage, ses mains aussi, tellement secs que je pensaient les voir se fendiller devant moi, comme la terre argileuse suppliciée durant la grande sécheresse. Ma belle et ronde épouse s’était desséchée, comment pourrais-je désormais l’aimer? pensais-je derrière le corbillard blanc. Elle essaya de s’écarter de mon bras comme si mon corps lui répugnait, ou qu’elle sentît quelles pensées me tourmentaient. Je vais tout raconter franchement, car on n’a pas toujours les sentiments que l’on nous a enseigné d’avoir. Après l’enterrement, nous sommes allés chez sa mère veuve. Nous étions bien douze. Les autres mangeaient, moi aussi j’ai goûté ceci, cela, en pignochant, Carmela ne toucha pas la nourriture. Sa mère voulait que nous restions chez, elle pour la nuit, que nous dormions là, moi j’acceptai aussitôt, mais elle se contenta de secouer la tête obstinément. On ne put en tirer un son. Tout à 8 [pageend10]coup elle se leva, embrassa les autres et partit pour aller chez nous. Elle ne me fit même pas signe que nous partions et je dus me précipiter pour rassembler nos affaires. Comment allons-nous faire, Seigneur Dieu, pensais- je en chemin, comment allons-nous supporter côte à côte les jours, les semaines, les mois, jusqu’à ce qu’il y en ait un second à la place du premier? Je marchais près d’elle lentement, sans un mot, je la pris une fois par le cou, comme on fait avec les filles, par gentillesse, à la promenade, mais lui aussi était froid et raide, et je le lâchai bien vite. De nouveau je fus pris d’épouvante, comme derrière le corbillard, de ce que son corps s’était desséché et que sous la robe il est comme le raisin ratatiné que nous avions eu l’occasion de cueillir une fois chez des parents. La route pour rentrer chez nous dura une éternité. Nous sommes joliment logés, dans une chambre mais avec une cuisine séparée. Garibaldi est accroché au- dessus de notre lit. C’est le beau tableau coloré, quand il partit à l’aube pour la Sicile avec ses mille soldats. La fumée noire et épaisse retombe de la cheminée du navire sur le ciel rosé. Le bateau de temps-là avait une cheminée haute et étroite et des roues à aubes, de nos jours on n’en voit plus de pareil, sinon au cinéma. L’année dernière j’ai acheté un minuscule terrain près de la grand’ route, j’ai planté des lis, des œillets et des mauves autour du potager et je fais grimper des volubilis sur la cabane à outils. J’allumai la lumière, et aussitôt ma faute me sauté aux yeux. Le petit lit était resté là, et pourtant j’y avais pensé deux fois, que je devais le descendre à la cave. Maintenant il était trop tard. Le silence entre nous pesait terriblement, et je commençai à l’implorer de manger quelque chose, voilà un peu de salade à l’huile qui reste, des tomates, qu’elle mange au moins cela avec du pain et du fromage. Elle allait, venait, ne me prêtait 9 [pageend11]pas attention. Elle rangea la nourriture et nettoya à l’eau et à la brosse une tache sur mon veston noir, que j’avais mis sur une chaise. Puis elle commença à se déshabiller. Elle se tenait sous l’ampoule électrique, elle déboutonnait son corsage noir. Elle en était peut-être au quatrième bouton lorsqu’apparut Gabriela. Le visage tourné vers moi, le dos à sa mère mais juste devant elle, elle aurait même pu l’enlacer. Elle lui arrivait au ventre. C’était une plus grande fille que celle que nous venions d’enterrer, c’est à ses yeux seulement que je me rendis compte que cette adolescente était notre fille, grandie. Je fus saisi d’épouvante comme un jour, dans mon enfance, après un autre enterrement, lorsque j’avais découvert ma grand'mère morte ramassée en boule sous le lit. Elle me faisait signe que pst ! je ne dise rien aux autres, car il lui faut pétrir de la pâte pour le lendemain, cachée sous mon lit. Maintenant aussi j’étais seul à voir notre petite fille grandie, habillée de blanc, avec un voile de dentelle blanche lui descendant à la taille, en gants blancs pour sa première communion. Elle scintillait comme un tableau d’argent. Et derrière elle, à hauteur de sa tête, à ses cheveux noirs et lisses, séparés par une raie, je vis un beau sein rond, la poitrine de sa mère qui avait jailli du corsage. C’est à moitié l’épouvante de voir un fantôme, et à moitié l’heureuse surprise de voir que le corps de Carmela ne s’était point du tout desséché dans la robe de deuil qui firent que je me mis à la désirer comme jamais encore. Plus sauvagement, plus avidement, comme si à ce moment seulement mon sang avait appris ce qu’est l’amour. Elle m’aurait même enfoncé un couteau si elle en avait eu un sous la main. Elle me repoussa si violemment que je chancelai jusqu’au mur. Comme un rôdeur affamé, comme un sale chemineau qui veut la déshonorer devant sa fille. Qu’est-ce qui te prend, tu es possédé 10 [pageend12]par le diable? Elle ne le dit pas à haute voix, et ne le dit même pas avec colère. C’était du dégoût qu’il y avait dans sa voix. Elle reboutonna son corsage et sortit dans la cuisine. Sur le coup, je ne sus que faire. Que je la frappe, que je la batte ? Auprès du lit de notre fille qui n’était pour ainsi dire pas encore refroidi? Ou que je me mette à l’apaiser doucement, avec des cajoleries, pour . . . Mais qu’avais-je fait de mal? Ma bouche gardait encore le goût de son sein, ma main la chaleur de son autre sein. Puis elle revint de la cuisine, pâle mais calme, et elle me dit d’éteindre. Nous nous déshabillâmes dans le noir. Mais je suivais ses mouvements à l’oreille, je sus quand il n’y eut plus sur son corps que sa chemise et subitement l’espoir m’envahit qu’entre temps elle était revenue à elle, qu’elle avait honte et que de ses deux bras forts elle m’accueillerait entre ses seins. J’attendis en vain. Au bout d’un moment, tendrement je tendis le bras vers elle, était couchée au bord du lit, toute contractée, habillée. Qu’avais-je pu entendre dans le noir, quel déshabillage ? Partout où je portais la main, je ne me heurtais qu’à du tissu hérissé, un corps de pierre. Elle ne se défendait plus, ne me repoussait pas, elle savait que mon courage m’avait abandonné. Le lendemain je fus réveillé par une odeur de café frais. Elle travaillait pour moi, comme toujours, tous les jours depuis notre nuit de noces. J’allai à l’usine. Tout en travaillant je repris un peu goût et confiance, et même je fabriquai un petit boniment pour l’amadouer. Car ce n’était plus que mon propre comportement qui me choquait, ce n’était vraiment pas honnête que par peur, à cause d’un fantôme, je tombe sur son sein le jour même de l’enterrement. Le soir, il ne resta plus un mot du discours. J’avais à peine mis le pied dans la chambre, quelque chose me frappa au cœur. L’air, ou quoi. Eh bien, mon ami, tout avait changé, ici. Autour d’elle et autour de moi, et 11 [pageend13]pourtant les meubles étaient restés en place. Pourquoi descendre à la cave le petit lit ? . . cela n’avancerait plus à rien. Aïe, Aldo, dis-je en moi-même, en la guettant du coin de l’œil auprès du feu, Dieu sait avec quel stupide sentiment de culpabilité, aïe, Aldo, ça va mal, plus mal que tu ne croyais. Je ne voulais plus battre cette malheureuse femme, je ne l’aurais pas touchée seulement du doigt, à aucun prix, au contraire je ne l’aimais et ne la plaignais que plus. Je croyais que pour elle aussi il en était de même, mais qu’elle ne pouvait l’exprimer par des mots, de même que moi non plus je ne trouvais pas de mots. Je croyais, je croyais, mais pas longtemps. Tout de même, j’avais mes deux yeux. Au bout de quelques jours je commençai à réaliser que Carmela ressentait les choses autrement que moi, peut-être même qu’elle ne m’aimait plus. Qu’elle ne plaignait ni ne me désirait, j’aurais pu m’en douter vraiment. Puis d’ici, puis de là la nouvelle parvint à mes oreilles. Qu’elle parlait de sa fille, de sa petite fille conçue sans péché, aux parents, aux voisins, dans les boutiques et au marché. Et en cachette, d’une amnière ambiguë, comme si elle vivait encore quelque part, en quelque retraite ignorée, en sûreté, bien cachée à mes yeux pour que je ne la dévore pas, comme ce hideux dieu païen dont le curé m’avait parlé à l'école. Car j’étais un garçon intelligent, le curé m’invitait parfois pour bavarder, mais mon père est mort subitement et ma mère m’a retiré de l’école. Je le dis, Carmela commença à parler de la petite fille comme si elle vivait encore quelque part. Et il y eut des gens qui s’imaginèrent que l’enfant était chez des parents, que sa grand’mère lui faisait faire un tour à Aversa, à Itri. Des gens qui ne savaient pas qu’elle était morte. Il me fallut soulager mon âme. Je pensai à Ercole, le beau-frère. Nous avons grandi dans le même rue, nous avons fait notre service militaire ensemble, nous sommes 12 [pageend14]tombés amoureux de deux sœurs le même jour. Nous nous étions mêlés aux filles par taquinerie après une procession de fête patronale. C’est alors que nous avons fait la connaissance de Carmela et de sa jeune sœur Rosaria. Nous avions même fixé la date du mariage au même jour, mais le sien fut retardé car il eut un accident près de Cava dei Tirreni, sur la route. Ercole est chauffeur de poids lourd dans une usine d’eau minérale, il va jusqu’à Salerne et au retour il s’arrange pour arriver à Stables à la porte de l’usine à peu près à l’heure d’arrêt du travail, là il me prend et s’il n’y a pas d’heures supplémentaires nous allons dans le bistro d’en face discuter les nouvelles sportives. Il fait partie d’un club de boxe et l’année dernière son jeune frère a gagné l’étape des Abruzzes du Giro. Nous savons quel exploit ce fut, tout le monde l’a vu à la télévision. Je n’eus pas longtemps à attendre. Mais quand nous nous assîmes devant notre demi, aucun de nous ne pensait au sport. Il me dit que depuis l’enterrement ils parlaient sans cesse de nous, lui et sa femme -— eux attendent seulement maintenant leur premier — et ils se préparaient à venir nous voir à Stabies. De sorte que ma langue se délia d’autant plus facilement. Je ne celai rien, je n’aurais pu être plus confiant avec mon frère. Lui aurait compris, rien qu’à un ou deux gestes sans paroles, tant il me connaissait, que le mal était grand, car depuis notre mariage je n’ai jamais désiré d’autre femme ou fille en dehors de Carmela. Non pas à cause du serment fait à l’autel, je ne suis point homme à curés, je ne l’ai conduite à l’autel que pour satisfaire les femmes. Parce que c’est dans ma nature. Le bon Dieu m’a puni, Ercole, quel remède y a-t-il ? Pourtant il faut que tu m’aides, si tu me veux du bien, car sinon la mort sera la fin de tout cela, il y en aura deux, je tuerai ma femme malgré mon amour et me tuerai ensuite. 13 [pageend15]Le remède est chez nous, répondit Ercole, presque sans réfléchir, tu sais bien comme elles s’aiment toutes les deux. Il s’agit des deux sœurs. Aujourd’hui nous sommes jeudi, venez chez nous samedi après-midi et restez jusque dimanche soir. On mettra pour moi un lit emprunté dans la cuisine, tu auras le divan, et elles s’endormiront dans le grand lit. Dimanche après-midi nous irons tous les deux au match et nous laisserons les femmes toutes seules. Tu verras, tout s’arrangera. Il parlait avec tant de confiance et il était si sûr, que je quittait la table tout transformé. Ercole préparera Rosaria, elle entreprendra Carmela et la fera revenir avant que je ne me résolve à quelque folie. Mais comment la persuader d’aller samedi à Naples? Et si de nouveau elle se bute, comme après l’enterrement quand elle ne voulait à aucun prix passer la nuit chez sa mère alors que tout le monde voulait la faire rester. Quand une chose lui passait par la tête, le Bon Dieu même n’aurait pu lui faire changer d’idée depuis la mort de notre petite fille. Je fus soulagé lorsqu’elle partit sans faire d’opposition, même elle avait l’air d’en être un peu contente. Qui sait, peut-être qu’elle attendait depuis des jours, ma pauvre petite, que je trouve un moyen de la délivrer. Délivrer de nous-même, de la chambre, du lit, de Stabies, du regard des autres. Samedi après-midi, nous partîmes à Naples. Je connais Naples, cette ville sublime n’a pas sa pareille. J’y ai été soldat pendant cinq mois, puis plus tard j’y ai travaillé pendant un temps. Surtout les environs de la rue San Biagio. C’est là que le beau-frère a une chambre spacieuse et sèche au cinquième étage. Lui et sa femme en sont d’ailleurs très contents. Cela s’est passé quand j’étais garçon, je ne connaissais pas encore Carmela, je faisais un peu Ja cour à une fille qui travaillait aux environs, elle aidait dans une cuisine de clinique. Un soir que je la raccompagnais vers minuit, 14 [pageend16]un rat monstrueux traverse la route vers une maison en ruines. Une pierre me tombe sous la main, de la maison bombardée je crois, et je la lance. J’ai touché juste et avec tant de force qu’il s’est convulsé une ou deux fois et le voilà crevé. Le fille me saute au cou, m’embrasse dans tous les sens, tu as tué sa sale âme, on ne fabriquera plus d’anges ! qu’elle crie. Quelle sale âme, et quelle fabrication d’anges? En me remerciant elle continue à m’embrasser sur les oreilles, les yeux, les cheveux, le visage, et elle raconte que le professeur avait l’habitude de rentrer chez lui sous 1a forme d’un rat énorme, tout le monde le sait à la clinique. C’est leur accoucheur. 11 y a toujours dix ou quinze médecins assistants qui lui courent après, il a toute une cour de religieuses, on ne peut compter les titres qu’il a et ses grades et il fait comme s’il adorait les nourrissons à la folie, ce docteur au cœur d’or. Mais quand il a terminé, 1e soir il se transforme en rat et il retourne à sa villa, pour faire des anges à1 prix d’or et ce n’est que son double qui salue de sa voiture, à côté du chauffeur, ce n’est pas le vrai docteur, le vrai avec son âme mauvaise, était le rat que j’ai tué, il ne pourra plus faire le mal. La fille superstitieuse racontait des sornettes, et le lendemain à l’atelier les garçons ne la crurent guère, sauf celui qu’on appelait oreille-torse. Mon malheur voulut que nous tournions, Carmela et moi, dans une longue ruelle. On l’appelle. . . Mais pourquoi dire son nom. A peine avions-nous tourné, tout de suite à son début un escalier de cave s’ouvrait sur la rue. Un vieil homme était assis sur une chaise basse à l’entrée et il salua, quand nous arrivâmes à sa hauteur, à peine, il bascula seulement un peu en avant son chapeau comme s’il nous connaissait, cependant qu’il regardait fixement le sol devant lui. C’est peut-être pour cela que nous nous arrêtâmes à la porte et regardâmes dans 1a profondeur éclairée. L’escalier était raide, et profonde 15 [pageend17]la cave, mais il régnait au fond une clarté inhabituelle, comme si l’on ne plaignait pas l’électricité aux apprentis et aux aides, ce qui est bien rare à Naples. Ils étaient peut-être dix à travailler à la lumière du néon en sifflant gaiement. Ils rabotaient, clouaient, examinaient les planches en les levant près de l’œil pour voir si elles étaient droites, l’odeur de la scieure montait jusqu’à la rue. Une douzaine de cercueils de bois blanc s’alignait au fond de la cave, près du mur, sur le plus proche il y avait plusieurs tasses à café sales en désordre, telles qu’elles avaient été posées là après qu’on les eut bues tout en travaillant. Rien que des cercueils d’enfant, grands comme celui dans lequel on avait couché Gabriela. La cave était une fabrique de cercueils d’enfant. Et le vieux à la porte? Que sais-je, peut-être n’avait-il rien à y voir, c’était peut-être par habitude qu’il avait donné un coup à son chapeau, peut-être avait-il vu quelqu’un par terre et le saluait-il. Je tenais le bras de Carmela, pour qu’elle ne prenne pas la fuite, qu’elle ne se précipite à Stabies et ne crie aux gens, ne me maudisse devant le monde entier de ce que je l’aie amenée à Naples par traîtrise devant une fabrique de cercueils d’enfant pour me délecter de son supplice. Car son comportement me contraignait à des pensées aussi effroyables en dépit de mon bon sens. 'Mais elle ne fit aucun mouvement suspect et ne dit rien. Moi non plus, moi non plus. Un moment se passa avant que la force ne revienne dans mes genoux et que je puisse me mettre en marche. Bien sûr il n’aurait pas fallu nous arrêter, mais qui aurait deviné ce qu’il y avait dans la cave? Nous arrivâmes sur une grande place. Il suffit de la traverser pour nous trouver dans la rue San Biagio. Je ne sais lequel de nous aurait voulu y arriver le plus vite. Rien que pour échapper au silence impuissant. Et alors il arriva une telle horreur que ç’en aurait été trop même pour un autre. Un taxi traversait la place, 16 [pageend18]dans sa longueur pour que nous le voyions plus longtemps. Un petit cercueil blanc était attaché sur son toit, niais l’un des bouts de la corde s’était dénoué et la partie la plus étroite du cercueil, celle de derrière, glissait de tous cêtés, comme s’il le petit mort se jetait çà et là à l’intérieur, comme s’il voulait s’échapper, se jeter en bas avant qu’il ne soit trop tard. Il était vide bien sûr, on le portait peut-être chez le doreur car il n’avait pas d’inscription. Mais de cela je ne me souvins qu’une heure après. A ce moment-là, au coin de la ruelle, je ne vis qu’un cerceuil d’enfant qui essaie de s’enfuir avec son mort de sur l’auto en pleine course, il secoue ses cordes, il s’est déjà à moitié libéré et peut-être va-t-il arracher les autres liens quand il arrivera devant nous, il volera à bas et roulera en morceaux jusqu’à nos pieds, et même nous verrons le mort avec son visage cireux à travers les fentes. D’autres aperçurent aussi le taxi, le multitude d’enfants s’ébattant sur la place le montrait en se poussant, ils criaient de rire et firent la course derrière durant un moment. C’était pour eux une bonne blague. Les autres, les gens n’y faisaient même pas attention, pourquoi se seraient-ils souciés d’une caisse de la croix à l’autre extrémité de la place, mais en même temps elle regardait ailleurs. Ce n’est que pour nous que cette caisse n’était pas vide. Carmela s’arracha de mon bras et se mit à courir, elle courait, courait, courait, elle se précipita sur une porte à l’autre bout de la place, la poussa et disparut. Moi je ne bougeais pas sur mes jambes sans force, plein d’amertume, car ce qui est trop est trop, tant de coups, c’est tout de même trop pour un homme, je ne l’avais pas mérité, quels que fussent mes péchés. Ou s’était précipitée Carmela ? Je partis à sa suite et, alors que désespéré je m’approchais de la porte qui l’avait engloutie, brusquement je la reconnus. Elle menait chez les moines noirs. Derrière la porte il y avait 17 [pageend19]un escalier en colimaçon, il menait au niveau supérieur de l’église. Son vrai portail s’ouvrait ailleurs, la grand’ porte qui était sur le côté, dans une autre rue que nous avions déjà dépassée. Carmela connaissait mal Naples, mais même sans se reconnaître elle s’était réfugiée dans une église. J’ouvris la petite porte, et je vis que mon souvenir était juste, l’escalier sentant l’encens tournait là en effet. J’arrivai dans l’église du côté de l’autel en passant par une seconde porte. On décorait le maître-autel, deux femmes récuraient le parquet sous le tapis replié, on apportait de la sacristie des fleurs à longues tiges, fraîchement coupées, par brassées entières. Dans une des chapelles, deux borreaux frappaient le Christ dans un tableau sombre. Lui aussi faisait comme le petit cercueil sur le toit du taxi, penché en avant il essayait de se libérer de la corde qui enserrait ses poignets. Carmela était agenouillée de l’autre côté du maître-autel, devant la grille d’une autre chapelle, sur les marches, et elle pressait son front contre la balustrade. Je m’arrêtai sans bruit derrière elle. Son visage n’était pas visible, peut- être pleurait-elle, mais alors en silence, tout bas, car son corps ne bougeait pas. Un jeune saint reposait dans un cercueil de verre, sur un coussin de pourpre brodé, des palmes d’or dans la main, sur la tête une bouche d’or et une auréole, une blessure ouverte au cou, on avait dû le tuer ainsi, il avait un vêtement blanc et des sandales aux pieds. J’ai oublié son nom. Une tablette indiquait qu’il fallait l’invoquer en cas de mal de poitrine. Il y avait beaucoup d’ex-votos suspendus alentour, des cœurs d’argent embrasés et des bébés d’argent qui serraient leurs mains sur leur poitrine. Comme je me tenais derrière Carmela, un moine me toucha l’épaule. Quelque chose ne va pas, mon fils? — et il incline la tête du côté de ma femme. Je compris à 18 [pageend20]peine, tellement il chuchotait bas. Sa petite fille est morte il y a peu de temps, soufllai-je. Ce n’est que lorsque je l’eus prononcé que je me rendis compte comment je l’avais dit. Que sa petite fille était morte. Et cela ne me faisait déjà plus de peine. Le moine fit signe de la tête, serra mon bras et s’éloigna. Puis Carmela se leva. Ses yeux étaient rougis de larmes, mais, elle me regarda bien plus gentiment que jamais depuis l’enterrement. Comme si son ancien visage était revenu en place pendant qu’elle l’avait enfoui dans ses mains sur la balustrade, c’était ce visage que je lui connaissais lorsqu’elle avait encore l’enfant dans les bras. Allons, Aldo, fit-elle, afin qu’ils ne nous attendent pas en vain. Mais je lui répondis que puisque nous étions là, faisons en le tour car l’église est belle et célèbre et les frères l’entretiennent. Ercole et Rosaria peuvent attendre encore un peu. Nous en fîmes donc le tour, nous nous arrêtamês devant les vieux tableaux et les statues, cependant que je la conduisais en la tenant par le cou, maintenant par ici, ma fleur, par là, maintenant continuons, car son cou aussi était redevenu l’ancien, il était tendre et souple, se blottissait dans ma main. Nous arrivâmes à la sacristie. Devant sa porte se tenait le moine qui m’avait adressé la parole. Il salua Carmela en souriant et fit un signe de tête derrière lui, pour que nous regardions là aussi. Il y avait de splendides armoires sculptées le long du mur de deux côtés, dans l’une on comptait des nappes frangées repassées à en être craquantes, un enfant nettoyait des calices, des femmes taillaient les tiges des lis, ici on se préparait à la fête. Je levai les yeux au plafond, car je pensais qu’il y avait dessus quelque belle peinture. D’abord je ne compris pas ce que je voyais au-dessus des armoires et sous le plafond à l’étage. Mais Carmela 19 [pageend21]ne le comprit pas non plus, car elle n’aurait pas demandé, Aldo, qu’y a-t-il là-haut derrière la barrière ? Ils ressemblaient à des coffres de voyage ferrés et sanglés, comme on en voit encore rarement sur les bateaux ď émigrants. Des épées rouilléss, des blasons, des bâtons de commandement étaient cloués sur leurs flancs ou leur couvercle. Et leurs housses ! Sur certaines, le velours et la soie étaient plus ou moins intacts, mais sur les autres s’effrangeaient de partout et même leur couleur bordeau avait passé. Combien de souris peuvent se cacher derrière, des nichées entières — pensai-je et j’eus envie de secouer les loques. Le moine vint à notre aide. Il nous appela pour que nous montions et les regardions de plus près, car nous n’avions certainement jamais vu pareille merveille. U nous précéda dans un petit escalier et avec une clé, ouvrit une porte qui donait sur la tribune. Ce n’est que là-haut que les ravages du temps se révélèrent vraiment. Ce qui d’en bas semblait des housses d’apparat usées, ternes, n’était ici que loques et déchirures. Sur un tableau la mort tambourinait avec des ossements, sur un autre tableau je vis un seigneur à la barbe rousse dans quelque antique vêture. Il y a quarante-cinq cercueils l’un au-dessus de l’autre, expliqué le moine, dans dix ce sont des souverains, des Aragon, les seigneurs passés de notre pays, dans celui sur lequel il y a l’épée se trouve le comte d’Avalos, tombé pour le roi dans la bataille, c’est lui l’homme à la barbe rousse sur le tableau. Dans les autres, ce sont des reines, des princes, des princesses et autres grands seigneurs, si nous savions lire l’ancienne écriture, nous saurions aussi tout de suite qui il y a dans lequel, mais la couronne au-dessus des cercueils nous désigne les souverains. Je voyais que Carmela commence à s’empourprer et ronge et mordille le coin de son mouchoir. C’est ainsi qu’elle faisait, jeune fille, lorsque le rire la chatouil20 [pageend22]lait et qu’elle essayait de le réprimer. Par bonheur nous en étions aux derniers cercueils sinon nous serions restés dans notre honte. Elle aurait éclaté devant le prêtre. Nous le remerciâmes bien pour ses renseignements, nous descendîmes en hâte à la sacristie, Carmela traversait déjà l’église en courant. Elle ne se tenait plus de rire. Dehors, dans la rue, elle appuya son front au mur, son corps en était secoué. Aldo. . . Aldo. . . es-tu entendu? Quarante-cinq rois et reines et princes et grands seigneurs. Elle ne put continuer. Moi je m’étais arrêté devant elle et je disais en singeant, très sérieusement : dix rois, des seigneurs d’Aragon, le comte d’Avalos qui est mort dans la bataille pour le roi. Elle riait, riait, le rire la lavait de sa peine, des atroces jours passés, les tourments de nous deux. En quelques minutes il la lava de tout. Aldo, qu’est-il donc resté d’eux dans le cercueil? Eh bien, juste ce que le temps a laissé, répondis-je, quelques dents, quelques côtes, un peu de leur jambe et beaucoup de bagues, de bijoux, car sûrement qu’on a enterré de si grands seigneurs avec leurs bijoux. Carmela devint sérieuse. Je lus dans ses yeux un changement qui me fit m’enflammer. Elle me laissa enlacer sa taille, le bas de son corps, ses deux coudes elle me maintenait éloigné pour qu’elle me regarde. D’amour nous ne pouvions plus parler. Peut-être se souvint-elle du baiser dont j’offensai son sein le jour de l’enterrement? Car le baiser qu’elle me donna là dans la rue, appuyée au mur, était aussi sauvage que le mien, ce mauvais baiser. Et je savais déjà qu’elle m’aimerait cette nuit comme lors de notre première nuit. Nous nous retournâmes et, nous tenant par la main, nous reprîmes le chemin que nous avions pris pour venir. Nous marchions à grands pas, et nos pas s’accéléraient de plus en plus, pour que nous attrapions vite un train pour Stabies. A la fin nous courions, tellement le bonheur nous poussait. Ce n’est que dans le train en 21 [pageend23]marche qu’il me vint à l’esprit que nous n’avions même pas fait attention à la fabrique de cercueils en passant devant la porte de la cave. Nous aurions pourtant pu la remarquer car je me souviens qu’un apprenti marchait devant nous pendant un moment avec des tasses sales; il les rapportait de la cave au bar. PAUL TABORI QUEST FOR UNHAPPINESS I kissed her and it should have been heaven. Her soft arms went around my neck and I felt the clean, young perfume of her body. Her eyes were closed but mine remained open. Her hair, dark with tints of deep red, was a soft halo around her small head. ‘Margo,’ I whispered, ‘Margo,’ without taking my lips from her mouth. She did not hear me. And again, as it had happened before, her fingers, the fingers of her right hand moved. On my nape she drew the sign. A circle and above it, a cross. I felt the circular movement of her forefinger and then the two soft lines crossing each other. I shivered, the short hairs on my neck quivered. I had hoped it would be different this time. I had bought the ring, the licence was in my pocket. We had found that apartment in the Village for which we had been hunting for six months. ‘Margo, Margo,’ I whispered again and freed myself, impatiently. Her eyes, pools of velvety brown, opened wide. I sat down on the couch and lit a cigarette. 22 [pageend24]‘It’s no use,’ I said. Her face puckered as if she were going to cry. If I only could get behind that smooth white forehead, find my way among the complex corridors of her mind, I thought. Sometimes I felt a chisel or a hammer would do it. Yes, sometimes I hated her because of the circle and the cross, her forefinger drew on the skin of my neck when I kissed her. For I had not taught her to make that sign. I did not know what it meant. It belonged to her past and her past belonged to some other man. At first I fought the queer feeling. A ghost walked over the grave of our love. I told myself not to court unhappiness. There was someone else in everybody’s life. But I felt guilty because she had not come to me as other women came into my life. We moved in different circles: she, a rising young actress; I, a newspaperman, not brilliant but competent. When I saw her first, playing stock in a small summer theatre in Vermont, I became desperately impatient. I was there for my two weeks’ vacation; poker and drinking were beginning to bore me and the Bakers dragged me off to a Wednesday night performance. She had a small part but she was on the stage most of the time, just a foil to Vera Ver- loyne, the star. I can’t remember the play, it doesn’t matter, I stared at her and the ache of wanting her was like hunger and thirst, the throbbing ache of some hurt I could not trace. Because I was impatient, I walked the grim grey dawn outside her boarding house; because I could not bear the ache I forced my way into her tiny dressing room, began with a cheap wisecrack and made her come out to dinner with me. I had only a week left and yet I felt that if I lost an hour,, everything would be too late. She was quiet then, withdrawn as if she had been hurt and could never trust the world again. In a way I 23 [pageend25]browbeat her into loving me. And when I succeeded, when my fine words and blackmail of whining self-pity had taken effect, I could not believe my great good luck. Disbelief led to suspicion. I was not merely jealous; I nourished a devouring curiosity about every detail of her past and present. I wanted to know whether she had a crush on her first grade teacher and when she ate her first banana split. In her small flat I' inspected every book and every dress, every piece of china and even’ picture. She was demure and humble. She never refused me anything. When I asked her to marry me, she said yes at once and nodded as if my proposal had confirmed some long-standing suspicion in her. She told me everything, at least so I thought; everything except the secret of that crazy sign and what it meant. It became so that I did not kiss her for weeks on end; and when I did, I was watching anxiously whether this time she would forget. And sometimes she did but then her body was rigid and her lips were not kindled into flame by mine. ‘You must tell me, Margo,’ I said. ‘Please. It sounds crazy, I know—but I want our marriage to start right.’ She folded her hands, sat primly; the victim waiting for the axe. ‘But there is nothing to tell.. .’ ‘You think it’s nothing. But it’s driving me mad. Who was he?’ And this time she really began to cry. Tears of quiet hopelessness. ‘But what difference does it make. . .’ she began. ‘Once I know, it will be all right. I promise. Even if. . .’ T haven’t seen him for five years.’ 24 [pageend26]I pounced upon this confession. ‘So there ivas someone. I knew it. And he. . . he thought you would stay with him. Otherwise. . .’ She looked up at me; her misty eyes full of wonder. ‘He taught you. . . that sign,’ I continued. ‘The one you make, quite unconsciously now, when I kiss you. Whenever I kiss you,’ I added, whipping myself into a savage rage. ‘Five days or five years, what difference does it make? You still belong to him. How can we get married if this ghost stays between us, if he is deep down in you, so deep that you cannot deny him. . .’ ‘But it wasn’t like that,’ she whispered, her lips hardly moving ‘It wasn’t like that at all. I am twenty- six, Dick. Did you think that I had gone through life wearing an armour, wrapped in asbestos? He. . . I met him when I was new to Broadway. He was much older than I, kind and no strings attached to his kindness. But he never took me seriously. There was someone else —all the time I felt there was someone else. He seemed to be looking for someone in every crowd, listening for a voice. That little sign—he never told me what it meant. Only it was a funny secret, linking us together. Until one night he came to my dressing room—I was playing a bit part as usual—and told me, gently enough, that it was over.’ ‘He had found that other woman ?’ I asked, still angry but cooling a little. ‘The one he was looking for all the time ?’ Margo shook her head. T don’t know. He said something quite different. He said he lost her.’ ‘But that doesn’t make sense! Not that it matters—the man must have been crazy. And I still don’t quite believe you. I have to clear it up. Please, darling, do understand, I have to clear it up. If you told me his name and I. . .’ 25 [pageend27]We wrangled and fought a long time. It was undignified but I was past caring for dignity. And in the end she gave in. She told me his name and the name of the lawyers’ firm where he had been working at the time she met him. More she wouldn’t or couldn’t say. But it was enough. His name was on the outside office door, the second from top. Paul Lancaster, with a string of capitals after it. I didn’t know what they meant but they were impressive. He kept me waiting, too. There were a couple of typists in the ante-room where I was sitting and sometimes they looked at me and giggled. I felt like walking out but it had taken me a week to run him to earth. Mr. Lancaster who hadn’t seen Margo for five years. I wondered whether this was true. I wondered. . . Then a cool, tall girl came out and said that Mr. Lancaster would see me now though he usually never received gentlemen of the press. And then I remembered that this was a firm specialising in big criminal cases, that they sometimes figured in headlines and that he must be a pretty important guy. Not that it mattered. Only he would be wary, a cool customer. But I hadn’t interviewed five hundred assorted celebrities and notorieties for nothing. I could take it. But when I stepped through the door into a large room with panelling and books and a gleaming big desk, I was taken unawares. I had expected a wolf, a sugar- daddy or some similar form of low animal life. Paul Lancaster was about fifty, not handsome but pleasantly rugged. Nobody’s fool, either; but hardly a man to take unfair advantage of anybody. I prided myself on judging people at first sight. My batting average was pretty good in this game. 26 [pageend28]‘Mr. Dixon?’ he said, thoughtfully turning my card in his hand. It had the name of my paper on, of course. ‘If it’s about the Grandini case, I am afraid. . . ’ ‘It’s about Margo,’ I said and sat down without waiting for an invitation. That shook him a bit. But he was soon master of himself. ‘How is she?’ he asked. T know, of course, she’s back on Broadway and doing fine—but what I meant. . .’ ‘She is all right,’ I said. ‘We plan to get married almost at once.’ That shook him even more. For a single, fleeting moment he closed his eyes. Play-acting? No, I decided. He really remembered Margo, remembered her too damn well for my liking. ‘Congratulations,’ he said. ‘She’ll make a wonderful wife. But I still don’t know why you came to see me. Perhaps some legal difficulty? a settlement? or. . .’ There was a clean blotter in front of him. In a small lacquered tray there were half a dozen beautifully sharpened pencils. I took one; deliberately, silently, I drew a circle and, just on top of it, a cross. That got under his skin. He flushed and put a finger under his collar. Then he got up and faced me, hands in his trouser pockets. He wanted to have the advantage of standing, of towering over me. Not that he was that much taller than I. Just an inch, perhaps. ‘Listen,’ he said, T can’t talk now. I have a very full schedule. Come over to my apartment on Riverside. Here’s the address,’ and he scribbled it on a slip of paper. ‘I’d love to have you for dinner, but I have to finish a contract before I leave here. Nine-thirty suits you?’ ‘Yeah,’ I said, ‘any time.’ 27 [pageend29]‘Margo was a sweet kid,’ he said. He was getting mellow; this was his fifth drink. I held on to my glass; it was he who had to do the talking. ‘It would have been better if I had never met her, though—or if we had met ten years earlier. No,’ he laughed, ‘I don’t feel decrepit yet even if five years have passed since I have seen her last.’ Check, I told myself. Or was it a put-up job? Had Margo talked to him before I found Mr. Lancaster ? But she hadn’t known that he had changed offices, that he had risen to senior partnership. No, I told myself that I mustn’t be too suspicious. That way lay madness and unhappiness. Just let the guy talk. Natural. ‘When we ran into each other on some silly party,’ he went on, ‘we laughed at the stuffed shirts together. I wanted nothing but a listener. I was full of my own bitterness. And she helped. If she was hurt, it wasn’t my fault.’ He turned to me with sudden fierceness and gripped my arm. ‘You must believe me, Dixon—it wasn’t my fault.’ ‘Sure, I believe you,’ I sneered. ‘The irresistible male and the impressionable maiden. Go on.’ For a moment he looked as if he wanted to sock me but then he shrugged. ‘Two-three months passed and I thought it would work out—you know how these things are. I wasn’t trifling with her affections as the silly phrase goes. I was serious but she. . . she was just a kid. There were moments when I forgot everything, when Ilona was just a pale ghost at the fringe of my mind.’ That was a new one to me. ‘Ilona ?’ I prompted him. ‘Yes. Didn’t you know? My wife.’ ‘Your what?’ I roared. T met her in Chicago,’ he continued, taking no notice of my rage and surprise. T was just out of law-school; 28 [pageend30]she was doing some model work. She was a redhead with very white skin and seagreen eyes; she was also more woman than any I had ever met before or since her. . . We were married a week after I spoke to her for the first time. . .’ ‘So you were married when you and Margo. . .’ I began but he cut me short. ‘Being married to Ilona was rather like living with a temporary quiescent volcano. You never know when an eruption would come. We fought like wildcats—and then, suddenly, everything was perfect. She was the most superstitious creature in the world. Her parents came from Transylvania—you know, the country where all those witches and warlocks, vampires and werewolves were supposed to roam the countryside. Half of my salary she spent on crystal gazers, fortune-tellers and assorted mystics. She had charms against everything from stomach ache to conjugal infidelity. She was always making signs in the air, on the table-cloth, throwing salt or scooping it up, muttering little prayers to ward off the Evil Eye. It was weird and wonderful; she was not of our century, Dixon. I would have stood it, in spite of all. But one day she disappeared.’ ‘With someone else?’ I asked though I knew it was a mean question. ‘As far as I could find out—no,’ he replied unruffled. T searched for her—for months. I neglected my work, I spent all my money but I found no trace of her. Perhaps she had gone abroad. It was hell for she had been more than a wife or a mistress; she represented the content of my whole life. . . I. . .’ I didn’t urge him to go on this time. The sketchy picture he had painted of his wife made me think. Because of its very sketchiness it fascinated me. I pictured her in my mind and while it was probably quite a 29 [pageend31]wrong picture, it fixed her in my thoughts and made me suddenly long to meet her. ‘Then I met Margo,’ Paul Lancaster went on. T hadn’t thought of divorcing Ilona, I still hoped somehow that one day she would come back to me. But Margo. . . she gave me other ideas. I put the papers through and hoped that when I was free I could ask Margo. . . I mean, it was sort of understood between the two of us. . .’ ‘But you didn’t ask her?’ lie poured himself another drink. He wasn’t drunk but another couple of drinks and he would be starry- eyed. I wanted to get the story out of him before he passed out. I took his glass and put it down on the small table. He didn’t seem to notice it. ‘No,’ he said slowly, T didn’t. A day or two before I. . . meant to speak to her, I got a letter from Ilona. A queer, wild letter. It was postmarked some small place in Montana. It was a call for help and at the same time a sort of farewell. Incoherent, if you know what I mean. It made me excited and sad.’ ‘You went to see her?’ I prompted him. He got up and looked down at me. His eyes were blank, confused. ‘No,’ he said, T didn’t. I never went.’ ‘But. . .’ ‘You see,’ he explained patiently as if I were a child, T was in love with Margo. I was afraid if I went back to Ilona, I would stay with her—and the whole wonderful and terrible business of our marriage would start all over again. Until one day she left me again. Until. . .’ ‘O.K., so you didn’t go back to her,’ I said rudely. ‘But what about Margo?’ ‘Nothing,’ he said. ‘Nothing at all. It never works that way. You think you can make a cut-and-dry decision, that it’s final like a writ issued, a Supreme Court judgment upheld. That silly sign—the circle and the 30 [pageend32]cross—Ilona used it, always. She said the circle meant the two of us, that within it we belonged to each other and we were safe. And the cross was the blessing of God. Her God was terribly personal: she was always quarrelling with Him or praying to Him. Somehow it soaked into me, as if I had been branded with it. When I kissed Margo, I drew it unconsciously, inevitably on her cheek, her nape, her shoulder. . . Until I realized that it was Ilona who made the sign, through me. I could not go back to her, Dixon, but I could not stay with Margo either. . .’ I got up. ‘Thanks for the drinks,’ I said. ‘And thanks for a very entertaining story. What did you say the postmark of that letter was?’ I cursed myself for a stubborn fool, the sort of man who never knew when he was well off. This was a crazy quest, a quest for unhappiness, for a red-haired woman who was superstitious and who had a first-class talent for ruining the life of others—and her own. But I bought the ticket and I travelled in a dusty day-coach through mountain and plain until I came to a whistle-stop kind of place. I was the only one to get off and I stood on the platform with the flaking paint, feeling a dozen different kinds of an idiot. The man in the station agent’s office was old and hard of hearing. When I asked him whether he knew a Mrs. Ilona Lancaster, he shook his head and said that he was new to the place, only been here a couple of years. I’d better walk down to the village; perhaps at Joe’s Place I’ll get some information. Joe was fat and sullen; he hadn’t shaved for a few days and the place stank of beer and onions. At first he wouldn’t talk to me at all. Strangers evidently were not 31 [pageend33]welcome—though his regulars could have hardly kept his place alive. ‘Lancaster?’ he repeated, chewing a dead cigar. ‘No, I ain’t heard of anybody by that name. What did you say the rest of it was?’ ‘Ilona,’ I said patiently. ‘Mrs. Ilona Lancaster. She has red hair, she must be about thirty or a little bit older. Is there a post office in this hole?’ ‘Sure,’ he said, ‘but they don’t know nothing there. I knew a lady called Ilona. A foreigner, she was, though she did spoke good American. Perhaps that’s the one. Come to think of it, she had red hair. . .’ I lost my patience.’ Well, where do I find her?’ Joe looked at me reflectively. I could see his two bits of brain working in the middle of all that fat. ‘Straight down the main street,’ he said. ‘When you come to the bridge, turn to the left. It’s about half-a-milc beyond.’ ‘Thanks,’ I said and paid for my beer I hadn’t touched. I walked down the street. Soon the houses were left behind. It was a dirt road and I was soon ankle-deep in dust. Then it started to rain. It was a dismal prospect. The ditch on the roadside was gurgling with water. I was a city man, not the out-door type. I almost turned back. There was a curve in the road and then it straightened and ran, endless, across the plain. There was no house I could see—not for miles. Joe had sent me on a wild goose chase, I thought, and cursed him. But there was a clump of trees a few hundred yards farther on. Perhaps the house was behind them. I began to run. The trees were sad specimens. But the grass was lush under them. There was no house. Only crosses and small stone monuments. A cemetery. I pushed open the creaking gate. And there it was, 32 [pageend34]in the first row. The weather had stained the stone a little but the inscription was clear enough, il o n a La n c a s t e r , it said. No dates. Perhaps she was vain about her age, even in death. And. . . The circle and cross, carved in the greyish granite. The circle and the cross and five words: w h o l o v e d WELL, LIVED WELL. A wonderful epitaph, I thought. But had she ‘lived well’ ? and why did she die ? Was that letter she wrote an S.O.S., a last call for help—but had she been too proud to do more than hint at her plight? I bated Paul Lancaster at that moment though I had never seen his dead wife. I hated him and cursed him for a smug prig. But at the same time I felt oddly relieved. As if I had settled something I had been putting off for a long time. As if peace had come after a long period of strife. I could have gone back to the village, found someone to tell me the story of Ilona’s death. Perhaps it would be disappointing, perhaps it would measure up to my imagination. But I found I didn’t want to do that. All I wanted was to stand there in the dripping rain, listen to the soft susurration of the leaves and then walk back to the station and get the next train up the line. As I opened the door of the dressing room, Margo saw me in her mirror. She sat rigid, in one hand the powder- puff, half lifted to her cheek. She dropped it and swung round. Then she was in my arms and her softness and her perfume were so real after the nightmarish time I’ve had that I almost laughed out aloud. ‘It’s all right, baby,’ I said. ‘Everything’s all right.’ I kissed her and felt her lips opening under mine. And on her tender nape where the tiny hairs curled, I made the sign of the circle and the cross. 33 [pageend35]FEYYAZ KAYACAN ASPECTS OF A CRY I A man cried in the light The cry turned to stone Flung in search of a window In the sky. It bounced off A scribbled sun And purposeless fell back again, Lay there like a fossil Not remembering and not remembered By the breath which once starred the bone. Then the stone cast a shadow And the shadow was a leaf Not remembering and not remembered By the tree which once stood on the branch. And I looked at it long Trying to place it trying to remember Where I had heard it last, And a dryness stirred in my throat. II A man cried in the dark In all the tongues of the world And I woke up missing In all the eyes. 34 [pageend36]Ill A man cried in the dark. I felt the thud of his voice Tapering to a scream. Man is the sum of his terrors Said a passer-by from a safe distance. Must I then from the same distance. Endorse this fear, like one Racing to see a fire, Or must I gather my fingers in And track it to the lips and the tongue Which haunt my loopholes an cl my web Of tightropes? IV And then morning stood On the tip of my breath, And my children rose in me And I saw them come to me With a smile in the hair And an apple in the eye. (Translated from the Turkish by the author) 35 [pageend37]VERA LARINA A LETTER TO MY MOTHER Dear Mother, It’s a long time since yon last heard from me and I expect yon have been wondering, what has happened to your “good son’’, as you always used to call me. Well, there is good and bad in all of us, more good in some— more bad in others, and you don’t always know till the end, which it’s going to be. I remember, how upset you were, wlien Jack all of a sudden took after Dad, and disappeared as you said, “. . . round the wrong corner’’. This may be the last letter you have from me, and so I thought I would tell you about a young man—a young man, who was ever so quiet and didn’t drink or smoke and wouldn’t hurt a fly. Well, one day this young man lay in bed with a chill ... he often had coughs and colds but was not one for going to the doctor’s and just got better ... or not, by himself. And as he lay there, he got to thinking, that if he should die, he would just vanish out of the world, like a ripple on the water. No one had ever heard of him and there was just nothing he could do with his life, to bring himself to anyone’s memory. He was not clever enough to write books or paint pictures, or strong enough to play football and cricket, no aeroplane had ever crashed near him, so he could rescue the pilot out of a burning cockpit, nor had he ever seen a runaway horse. And it was, as he was lying propped up on his pillows, reading the papers and sipping the tea, that his landlady, who was kindness itself, had brought him, that he got the idea of commit36 [pageend38]ting the “perfect crime’’. At first the thought amused him, then he pushed it aside in horror and then he started thinking about it, more and more—after all, who wants to be, just a vanished ripple? Anyway, by the time he was more or less fit enough to be back at the office, he had everything planned and it really is an easy enough thing, if you give your mind to it. Because of having been so poorly, a short while ago, he made a great show of going early to bed every night and made sure, that whoever happened to be about, should meet him in his dressing-gown or hear him in the bathroom, after which he would go to his room with a lot of noise and clatter, and change into a suit of clothes, that he didn’t wear at the office and turning out the light, creep downstairs, holding his shoes in his hand and so out of the front door. He would prowl round the darkest streets and alleys in the district, looking for a likely victim, but maybe it’s more difficult to find things, when looking for them—like happiness, they always elude you—only he never came across anyone, who walked alone and didn’t turn into some gateway, before he could get near enough to them. Now, once—before he was ill and before he got the crime idea into his head, he was waiting at a bus stop, in a queue with other people, and next to him, was a young girl. She was just an ordinary girl and she was wearing a black coat and a bright green spotted scarf and she had short brown hair, but really, he paid little attention to her, first—because he was anxious to catch his bus and secondly, because he wasn’t interested in girls. They were all the same, as he well knew, sly and cunning and only interested in what they could get out of you. There was nothing else to them. Just as an example, there was the girl in his office—she wasn’t anything to look at either, but she was ready to make sheep’s eyes at anyone, who came along, twisting her 37 [pageend39]body in her over-tight red jumper and throwing her head back and pretending you were the cat’s whiskers as far as she was concerned, and all agreeable to your giving her chocolates and almost inviting herself to the pictures with you, but you just ask for a bit; of proof of all this seeming affection and she was on her high-horse in no time. You were all wrong about her apparently, and she wasn’t anything like what you thought she might be, and she certainty wasn’t leading you on, whatever you might have imagined and anyway, she was going steady with someone, who worked out of towrn ... so that was that and realty, who cares ? He wasn’t interested in girls and he certainly would not have given the bus stop girl another look, if they hadn’t both wanted the same bus, but being a request stop, the bus they wanted, sneaked behind two others and just whizzed past, without stopping, while they nearly got run over, trying to wave to it. And so as they walked back to their places, they exchanged a few comments about the way, some buses dodged the request stops and thinking there should be some way of improving matters. It was then he noticed, that her eyes were small and brown and turned into slits, when she smiled. And just then, another bus came along and this time they both got on and he waved to her as he climbed upstairs and that was the last thought he gave her. Now, it happened, that his landlady and her husband always used to go to a whist drive on the first Wednesday in every month. They had to go right across London for it, to where the landlady’s sister lived, it was a Church "do”—and they took the car and always got back late. Well, on this particular Wednesday, that I am telling you about, the young man went to the bathroom, in his pyjamas and dressing gown, just at the time when 38 [pageend40]the landlady’s husband was going down to get the car, so they just about bumped into each other and the young man said, he hoped they would win all the prizes and the husband said, how sensible he was to be going early to bed, what with his cough and everything and it was not a bit nice out, just starting to rain . . . not that it mattered much to them, as they had the car. The young man had left the door of his room open, so that anyone passing would naturally glance inside and might notice how his clothes were placed and he’d put a green pullover on top, so as to draw people’s attention. As soon as the landlady and her husband had gone and the house quietened down, the young man put on his second suit and another mackintosh and a cloth cap and taking an old pair of shoes, that he only wore on his night prowls, he crept downstairs and out of the front door, not putting his shoes on, until he was on the doorstep. Sure enough, it was a nasty night. There was a cold wind and driving rain and the few pedestrians, that he met, hurried past with their collars up or underneath umbrellas, so you couldn’t see, who they were. He wandered round the darker streets for quite a bit and then, just as he thought, he might as well go home, he found himself near an Underground station. He thought it might be possible to follow someone from there and stood in the shadows, just waiting to see, if Fate should send him anybody. He heard a train rattling in and in a few minutes, a man emerged from the exit, put his collar up and walked past quickly . . . then, a couple of giggling girls, an elderly couple, a young boy and finally—and here, he could hardly believe his eyes—the girl of the bus stop. She wore the same black coat but this time a yellow scarf was loosely knotted round her neck and her hair was covered by a yellow beret. She looked round to see if it was raining and was just going to open her umbrella, when the young man 39 [pageend41]stepped out from the shadows—“Hullo,” he said . . . “No catching buses to-night?” She started at first and then recognized him “Oh it’s you,” she smiled. She told him, that she’d been to a party and it had lasted longer than expected, so as she wasn’t sure, what time the buses ran and as another friend was going by underground, they travelled together, the friend getting out two stops earlier. “I don’t really like coming back by train, so late,” she explained, “. . . as I’ve quite a walk home and some of the streets are so dark. . He told her, that he’d been waiting at the station, in case his old aunt turned up, as she said she would, if she didn’t get a lift home. However, it was now long past the appointed hour, SO' there wasn’t any sense in waiting any more and he offered to walk at least a part of the way, with the girl. She accepted gladly and he took the umbrella from her and held it over them both, as they walked. Once or twice they stopped, for the young man to cough or blow his nose and the girl held the umbrella, while he got his handkerchief out. As they were walking through a dark mews passage, he asked her to hold the umbrella again and as she took it from him, he suddenly grasped the ends of her yellow scarf and pulled them tight, her hands let go of the umbrella, which dropped to rest on their heads, while with a strength he didn’t know he possessed, he pulled the scarftighter still. He then laid the girl down on the wet cobbles of the mews and stuffed a handkerchief, which he had found in the street a week or so ago, into her mouth. He did not know, who the handkerchief belonged to, but he thought it would be useful for putting the police on a false scent. He made quite sure, the girl was no longer breathing and then putting the open umbrella over her—he was wearing gloves, so there was no danger of any finger-prints on the handle— walked quickly away. It was getting late and he had a 40 [pageend42]long walk home. He did however, manage to get home before the owners returned. It had stopped raining by now, so he took his coat off before entering, folding its lining outwards, so that no wet should brush against the wall oť drip on the stairs, he wrapped his cap inside it and took off his shoes. On getting to his room, he put all his wet things and his suit into a tin trunk, which he had standing behind the sofa, dried the back of his head, uncovered by the cap, in front of the gas fire and got into bed again. It was not long after all this—and really, it all seemed like a dream—that he heard the car drive up and the landlady and her husband came up the stairs. Dream or no dream, he was concentrating on his alibi plan and this included a fit of coughing, just as the couple walked past his door. The man stopped and asked softly, if he was asleep. “No, no. . . come in. . . . I did drop off for a bit, but the cough keeps waking me.” “Well, the Missus is going to make some tea, so I’ll bring you a cup. . .” “All right then, thanks a lot. I’ll just get up and put the light on.” The landlord told him not to bother and getting his matches out of his pocket, went and lit the gas, tripping over the young man’s shoes, in the process. As he put them back in their proper place, the young man hoped he noticed, that they were dry (the wet ones being in the trunk) and then, as he was opening the door, the young man’s hat fell off and he picked that up and replaced it. In a few minutes, he returned with a cup of tea and chatted for a bit, while the young man drank it. There was nothing in the morning papers but the evening ones were splashed with headlines about the “Yellow Scarf Murder”. The young man’s hands shook as he read the reports, fearful lest the police should 41 [pageend43]uncover some slip he might have made without realising it. So far however, there was nothing at all. It was just a straightforward report, that the girl’s body was found by two women, one of whom screamed and ran for the police and that the girl was strangled with her own yellow scarf. So far, they could not find a motive for the murder, the girl’s handbag was intact and she had not been molested. The handkerchief stuffed into her mouth seemed the only clue. Next day’s papers printed the description of how she had spent her last evening, which tallied exactly with what she had told the young man and all the people in the mews had been interviewed and questioned, without any concrete results. No one had seen or heard anything. The laundry mark of the handkerchief had its photograph in the papers and a day or two later, its owner came forward. It appeared, that he was a Huddersfield business man, who had been on a two-day visit to London a week or so before. He had never seen the girl in his life and was playing in a snooker match in Huddersfield on the night of the murder. He presumed, that he must have lost the handkerchief, while in London, as he had a bad cold at the time and had several of them in every coat and jacket pocket. So that—was that. What surprised the Police most of all, was the fact, that there was no sign of any struggle. It could not have been anyone, who leapt at her and attacked her suddenly and yet, she was certainly not expecting to meet anyone. Her plan of going home by bus was changed at the last minute and a girl friend travelled in the train with her most of the way. She was a quiet girl but not secretive, so all the girls at her place of work—she was an apprentice at a hairdressing establishment—were sure they would have heard about a boy friend, if she had one. Which- every theory the police explored, they came to a dead end. After a few days, the “Yellow Scarf Murder” oc42 [pageend44]cupied only about four lines of newspaper space and then, the headless bodies of three women were found in the wardrobe of a Brighton boarding house and the “Yellow Scarf” was forgotten altogether. The young man scanned every page of every available newspaper but it seemed, that his anonymous fame, had been very short-lived indeed. It certainly seemed, as if Fate were determined, that he should never be anything more, than the vanishing ripple, he so feared. At last, he could bear it no longer. His fever had returned again and so, before retiring once more to bed and while his legs could still haltingly carry him, he made his way to the nearest police station and confussed. Well, it appeared, that he was the fourth person to confess to the “Yellow Scarf Murder” and so, although the police listened attentively, they did not show the enthusiasm he had expected. They asked him various questions but by that time, his fever was running high, his brain was feeling muzzy and sometimes he forgot, what he wanted to say, sometimes he contradicted himself. The police went to his house and questioned the landlady and her husband and in spite of the seriousness of the occasion, it was all they could do, not to laugh. They told the police, that the young man was the quietest, gentlest and nicest person, that he wouldn’t hurt a fly and the only explanation they could give for his extraordinary statement, was the fact, that he was ill and probably delirious. As the night of the murder happened to be the first Wednesday in the month, the landlord remembered all the events of the evening quite clearly and having been in the police force himself, at one time, he had a good eye for detail. He remembered, how he met the young man going to the bathroom in his pyjamas and dressing gown and that when he went past the open door of his room, he could see his clothes thrown over a chair and the clothes included a green pullover, which 43 [pageend45]caught his eye, because it seemed twisted to a pattern that reminded him of the wallpaper in his own mother’s kitchen many years ago, and that when they returned from the Whist Drive and he went in, to take the young man a cup of tea, the clothes and the pullover were in exactly the same position. Also, he remembered stumbling over the young man’s shoes and picking up his hat and both the hat and the shoes were dry, yet it had been raining cats and dogs all evening. And then, the wife, who kept an eye on the young man’s clothes, doing occasional mending etc., knew, that he only had one hat and no one could have been out without a hat that evening, without getting his hair soaking wet and the husband had remembered, that the young man’s hair was bone dry and kept falling down over his forehead. The story the young man told, about having worn a cap, which he later burnt in the office stove, while everyone was out at lunch, could not be proved, and his chief in the office, described the young man in a way, which tallied exactly with what the landlord and his wife had said, adding, that he was extremely hard-working and conscientious but of poor health, which they were willing to overlook however, because of his good character. The other lodgers in the house where he lived, were also questioned and no one had heard him going out or coming in and the landlady remembered, how when they were walking up the stairs that evening, she noticed with relief, that in spite of the weather, no one had muddied the stairs. They were covered with linoleum and the gas was left burning all night, so she could have easily seen any wet footmarks or splashes. The police doctor examined the young man and it was decided, that his story was the result of hallucinations, due to the advanced stage of his disease and the young man then knew, that there was no hope of his ever convincing anybody and his fever got to be so bad, that he never 44 [pageend46]even had a chance to see, if the papers had reported his confession and in fact, what with the fever and the pain and the haze in his head, there were moments when he began to doubt the story himself. And yet, thinking about it, he could sometimes still, almost feel the ends of the scarf, as he pulled them so tight. No, surely it had not been a dream. . . . Now that I have told you the story, Mother, I have decided after all, not to send you this letter . . . what right has anyone to burden other people with his troubles and there is no doubt, you have plenty of your own, and so, when the hospital or sanatorium write to you, let the sorrow you feel, as you stand by my grave, only be—that you have lost your “good” son ... a son who has vanished from the world, like a ripple on the water. . . . MILADA SOUCKOVA THE SHIP IS FOR TWELVE On February the 8th Admiral Heihachiro Togo’s Torpedo Flotilla launched a salvo of torpedoes at the Russian Fleet in the outer Harbour at Port Arthur. February the 8th., 19 . . ; I always think twice as 1 begin to write the date of a new year. In school we write 1904 in our exercise books, and then all of a sudden it’s 1905. But February the 8th is different. Today my sister is going to have a tea-party. A teapart}7 like grown-up ladies have. There will be flowers 45 [pageend47]on the table, fancy sandwiches, French pastries from Berger’s and of course ice cream. My sister is anxious to go to Berger’s with mother to choose the design of the ice-cream. February the 8th, 5 p.m., the Hady cashier at Berger’s writes in the order-book. February the 8th, five o’clock in the afternoon. We are standing at the cashier’s desk; the cashier sits inside a booth. It is a white carved throne, enclosed on all sides. It must be a funny feeling to sit in la box like that. It is something like a confessional, onlj’ much gayer. Here she hears confessions about dinner parties, christening parties, engagements and weddings. And about tea-parties, like the one my sister is having, a teJa-party for a grown-up lady, with many guests. My sister goes up to the confessional the colour of whipped cream and listens to the conversation between mother and the cashier. She pays careful attention, for she knows that neither the dashier nor mother is as interested as she is in the shape of the ice cream. What do they care if it looks like fruit, or even like a “bomb”. The cashier asks: “A bomb ?” The background of gay music blends with the conversation of beautifully dressed ladies sitting at the tables, and the tinkling of their silver spoons whispers secrets. * • • They had Hansel and Gretel last year at Henner’s party. The cashier does not know this. Mother hesitates over the choice. She likes new and unexpected things, even for such occasions as sister’s tea-party. The mirror above the cashier’s confessional shows the image of mother. She looks like the beautiful shepherdesses painted on the silk candy-boxes displayed on the glass shelves. Mother’s beautiful face is mirrored from all 46 [pageend48]sides, surrounded by the smell of sweets wrhpped in paper doilies. The shepherdesses are dreaming with letters and bouquets in their laps, dreaming before an imaginary stream which reflects their own beauty. But mother is dressed differently; she stands before the cashier land cannot make up her mind what shape the ice cream for my sister’s party should be. ‘‘Perhaps the Russo-Japanese War?” Mother looks at the cashier as if to say : ‘‘Why wasn’t I offered this straight (away?” But all she says is: “I think I will take it.” My sister seems a little worried by the fact that the ice cream has been ordered without her being consulted. The Russo-Japanese War ! What can it be ? It might be either something from a flairy tale, like Hansel and Gretel, or something from the theatre, like the Rosenkavalier mother had for her big dinner-party. What could it be? My sister ought to have had more confidence in mother’s taste. But the Russo-Jlapanese War? Who ever heard of it? Perhaps it is something for boys. My sister does not understand why boys like railways and soldiers. “For how many people?” “Ten.” “The Russo-Japanese War is for twelve.” “I’ll take it, please.” The Russo-Japanese War is ordered. My sister hlas only to listen to mother saying: Prague II, So-and-so street, No. 331. “What time?” “Four o’clock in the afternoon.” Won’t that be too late? Sister tugs at mother’s sleeve: won’t it be too late? But mother is asking wHat it will look like. The cashier answers indifferently: a boat. A boat. Sister is somewhat disappointed. It must be something for boys. What could be so special about it? The tiny silver rose, the real silk rose the ice erdam 47 [pageend49]Rosenkavalier carried in his hand at mother’s dinnerparty was breathtaking, but a boat ? But it’s too late to do anything about it now. The cashier is writing in her order-book with her copying-pencil: February the 8th, 4 p.m. What do the grown-ups care for sister’s worries! The cashier is of course a stranger, but now mother is in conversation wtih the owner of the establishment. Mother is a good customer. This is where she ordered the ice crdam for my sister’s christening, in the shape of little doughnuts. Aunt Milde picked one up from the plate, dropped it and screamed. Everyone laughed and Aunt Milde blushed; she had thought it bad taste to serve doughnuts on such an occasion, but did not want to give offence. This story has been apocryphal in our family for so long that although we do not remember it ourselves, it is as if we did. Perhaps the Russo-Japanese War won’t be such a sensation las the little doughnuts were at sister’s christening dinner. And sister would like it to come as a surprise to everyone; she would like to be surprised herself. She wants some thing just as beautiful as the ice cream Jat her last year’s party: a nest made entirely of spun sugar with eggs of different flavoured ice cream inside! You could eat the whole nest, it was so crisp and tasty. February the 8th ! What if they bring the ice cream late, or forget it altogether! We should have told them to come at three. Don’t be tiresome, says mother; don’t be tiresome, or I’ll call the whole thing off. But sister knows that mother would never do it. February the 8th, 19 . . ; my sister hlas no memory for dates, though she is one of the best in her class. She can’t remember the date of the battle of Bila Hora, nor the reign of Charles the Fourth. But February the 8th is engraved on her mind. Anything might happen between now and then. On the 6th one thought the 8th would never come; but it bias come. It is three o’lock 48 [pageend50]and sister’s ears are clean. Usually she resists having them washed. Her hair is in long ringlets with a light blue ribbon in it, matching the sky-blue shimmering through the smoke-brown chiffon of her dress. In the dining room she inspects the table, which is being laid as for ta dinner for twelve grown-ups. Lidushka is ironing the creases out of the tablecloth, right on the table; then she will put on a lace “milieu”. That’s what she and mother call it: a milieu. It is made of the most beautiful Dace crocheted by Lidushka and put together in Zadruha. In the middle of the table there will be a flower centrepiece with violets, and everyone will get a posy of violets next to his plate. My sister would have preferred pink carnations; one pink carnation with its stem wrfapped up in silver paper for each guest, like the ones mother had at her dinner-party. But mother explained to sister that those carnations were for the gentlemen to put in the buttonholes of their dinner jackets. Sister was disappointed, but it had to be admitted that girls do not hlave coats with buttonholes. She tried to argue that carnations too could be pinned on. But the violets were ordered all the same. The real trouble was that nobody had brought them yet, nor the French pastries from Berger’s! Who cares if sister’s plarty is quite spoilt. Sister reproaches mother for not having ordered them for three o’clock, but mother does not even answer. She casts a critical eye over Lidushka’s work, and here and there moves a silver spoon or fork half an inch or so. My sister tries to make mother promise to send Lidushka to Berger’s land Dittrich’s if nothing has come by three. Mother refuses to promise anything: “Wait until four o’clock, and then we shall see.” We shall see! That implies that it could happen. Sister and I follow Lidushka into the kitchen and try to persuade her to run over to Berger’s and Dittrich’s if nothing arrives. Sister even offers her some of her 49 [pageend51]own pocket money so that she can take the trolley-bus instead of running. Lidushka promises to go, but the promise is given so lightly that sister does not believe her. She doesn’t trust Berger, Dittrich, or mother, either. None of them care. This is not strictly true, but of course they do not care as much as she does. However, by four o’clock sharp the dining table looks as beautiful and splendid as if it were really intended for one of mother’s big tea-parties. As soon as the cuckoo clock in the kitchen strikes four, with my sister imploring Lidushka to get dressed and go to Berger’s, the door-bell rings. And a big, strong man carries in the bucket we know so well, and the huge trays with the French pastries. He puts the trays on the kitchen table and asks when he should come back to take them away. We haven’t even started yet! Just a minute ago sister was afraid the ice cream would be late, and already they are asking when they should come and fetch it back. Lidushkia >ays, “Come in the evening or tomorrow morning.’’ Evening, tomorrow—we haven’t begun yet. There is a ring at the door bell, and the flowers arrive. Sister tears open tto white paper to have a look— violets! They must be taken to the cool pantry, though my sister would like to see them on the table at once. “Do you wfent them to wilt then?’’ No, she does not want them to wilt, but she would have preferred the carnations which the gentlemen put in their buttonholes when they sit down at the table. What a pity children cannot have these things. At last everything is ready, and the guests mfay arrive. Everything is here : ice cream, flowers, and the same fancy sandwiches that the gentlemen eat with a glass of wine. We help Lidushka to take the piaper off the trays, and lick off the grains of caviar and the streaks of cream. Now is the time for the guests to come. But suppose they don’t come? But what a question; why 50 [pageend52]on earth shouldn’t they come, all of them were in school, lafter all. Ice cream, pastries, sandwiches and flowers are here; the table is laid; what is there to worry about? They will come all right, they must come. Of course some parents are always feeling their children’s foreheads, and if they think them at all hot, they at once forbid them to go skating or to school. We know some of these parents very well, but luckily ours are not like that. Anyone touching my sister’s cheeks or forehead now would send her to bed-at once. Luckily our parents are not so easily fooled, they know that we are ill only when we have no appetite or when our chests are covered in spots. Then Dr. Bursik appears, put his head, which smells so nice, against one’s chest, and nobody minds. What if someone were to fall ill today, or get scarlatina, or anything which might keep them away from school, skating or a tea-party! Henner’s parents are that sort. The number of times she wlas away from school, yet when we went to' see her, we found her up and dressed. Her parents simply thought she was getting a cold. But Henner promised my sister faithfully to come. Even if she feels sick, she promised to hide it from her parents. This is some consolation. Even if the sickness were already in Henner’s or sister’s “system”, as mother slays, it would not have had time to ‘‘show”, as Dr. Bursik says. Of course it might have been in their system for a week, and show when they came back from school. Impossible! Not one of them complained this morning. But of course it might show only after they got home. Anyway, not in all of them. They are never lall sick at once; one, two, or even three perhaps, but not all; that would be ridiculous. But it would be a pity all the same if one or two did not come, even the ones sister does not particularly like and who were invited simply because she went to their parties. It is sad to look ',at an empty chair. Sister keeps watch51 [pageend53]ing the big clock. Four thirty, and nobody here yet! And Henner promised to be the first to arrive. The bell rings, and sister runs to open the door—it is the postman, bringing some letters for father. I can see there is no letter from Oslavan or Roudnická, because we know their writing. Those are the letters father rdads aloud to us after supper. They begin: Dear brother, sister-in-law and children. And the uncle from Oslavan writes : Dear Tony. Fancy anybody calling father "brother” or "Tony”, and mother ‘’Sister- in-law”, las our uncle in Roudnická does. But the letter wasn’t from Roudnická anyway. We return to the dining room, where the centre-piece is now on the table, and the posy of violets beside each plate. The front door bell rings again; this time it is the porter’s wife, asking for the keys to the cellar. My sister stands next to Lidushka in her best dress and with her hair specially done; she is afraid that her party is spoilt, and that nobody will be able to come. She remembers how she had to stay away from the Claudius’ fancy dress party. Mother had chosen a pair of angel wings for her at Bohm’s on Ferdinand Avenue, white organdie wings covered in golden stars. Sister would rather have had wings of real feathers, and so she did not mind so much when she got scarlet fever and could not go; she never found out how the other boys and girls were dressed up. The same might happen today; no-one might even know what kind of flowers were on the table, it might have been red carnations. And no-one will even know that the ice cream represented the Russo-Japanese War; Port Arthur, der Hafen des Todes, as uncle Zizka äaid. My parents laugh at uncle Zizka (Ziza, father calls him), because he is pessimistic about everything, especially money. This is bedause he is a high-up official in the Ministry of Finance. And when he is on holiday he 52 [pageend54]always expects bad weather. The very day he arrives he says summer will be over soon. He is for ever explaining to father how the war in Korda will influence the political situation in Austria. Father gesticulates in disagreement, and then the argument starts in earnest. Uncle Zizka says that the Japanese at Lao-Yang were in the same position as the Prussians were in 1866. Kuropatkin was in the position of Benedek. Father loses patience and calls uncle a strategist and a Prussian, while uncle Zizka for his part calls father a Slav and a nationalist. We know what that means. Father cannot forgive uncle’s admiration for the German military art; and uncle Zizka cannot forgive father his lack of respect when speaking of the Austrian Emperor. Once more the bell rings 1 My sister runs to open the door, and it really is Henner. Henner has not suffered all the false alarms we have, and she is so boisterous that Miss Horejshi has to scold her. Miss Horejshi asks mother, who has come into the hall, when she should come to fetch Ann. When? Nine o’clock at the earliest, and even later if possible. It’s simply not done to say, •as mother does, “Please come around nine.” You mustn’t do that! The bell rings again. This time it’s Susan. She has come all by herself, in her sailor dress. She is not dressed up as much as sister and Henner, who has a dress like sister’s, only bright red. It is the dress she wore when she sat for Boettinger this yefar. Susan came by herself, with nobody to ask when she should be taken home; she can stay as long as she likes, even till ten o’clock. It only takes her a moment to take off her navy blue coiat, but she tears the loop off it, and Lidushka has to take it to the kitchen to sew it on again. Now another ring at the bell brings two girls at once, Cerna and Claudius. Claudius stands on the door-mat, twisting her hands and bubbling over with laughter. From now on the bell hardly stops ringing; 53 [pageend55]Novotna and Rykova come in, trying to be ladylike. Sister would like the girls to stay as long as possible. Till eight then? Oh no, we have hardly begun yet! It is after five now; by the time everyone has come in and sat down at the table it will be six, and then there’s the tea and ice cream ! And it’s not till after that that the fun and games start. Eight o’clock won’t do, it will have to be nine. We listen carefully to what mother says, for the grown-ups could easily come to an agreement behind our hacks. No, no, not eight, eight-thirty at the earliest, but better nine and even later. We sit down in the drawing-room in the armchairs like grownups—but not for long. Henner leaps onto the sofa and bounces on the springs. Wlm is still missing? The doorbell rings bringing Beaufort and 'Mark. Only Rose Kinzl still has not come. Shall we wait for her ? We must. My sister does not like her very much, for Rose is the first in her class and very well behaved. She is never noisy or rowdy—-she isn’t any fun. Is that her? Yes, the two Kinzl sisters have arrived. One is a grown-up lad}- who will not stay; she apologises for Rose’s lateness, but she herself had ;a singing lesson, and nobody could be spared to bring Rose along. Sister does not complain about it too much. Rose can go away again if she is such a model child. The table sparkles with white linen, flowers, gljass and china. The chandelier illuminates the glowing colours of the children’s faces and the white, pink and cream icing. The blue and red bows in sister’s and Heimer’s hair are conspicuous. Lidushka is pouring the tea, and mother sees to the handing of sugar and cream. Sister’s cheeks flame like Henner’s hair-ribbon; they could not be redder if Mr. Scarlatina were standing behind the door with the message that Dr. Bursik will come tomorrow morning at nine o’clock. My sister is happy. It doesn’t matter what happens tomorrow or 54 [pageend56]during the night. Tomorrow they can all be sick. We might be sick too, but tonight everyone will enjoy the food. We shall be sick anyway, we shall feel sick even this evening after stuffing ourselves to bursting point. But who cares? The main thing is that we are all here, that nothing has gone wrong, and that—what did the big man call it? Der Hafen des Todes—Port Arthur! No, that was what uncle Zizka called it. We must just go to the pantry and take a look at the ice cream. Is it still all right?—Why, what could hlave happened to it?—What could have happened? Doesn’t Lidushka know ? Didn’t some salt get into the ice cream at one of the dinner-parties? Didn’t mother once have to compllain at Berger’s because the ice cream was half melted ? You never know !—But all one can see is the water dripping from the ice through the tiny tap. Sister has to go back to her guests in the dining room As it is, mother scolds her for running away and not looking after them. For they are her own guests, it is her party. She is proud of her guests, and is impatient for the moment when they see the Russo-Japanese War. This has remained a secret which we have shared with nobody, not even Henner. We have not let slip a single hint of what it might be. The surprise will be here in no time. We follow mother into the kitchen, anxious not to miss the moment when the ice cream is being lifted from the bucket. Sister keeps giving mother and Lidushka unnecessary instructions and getting in the way. To get rid of her they scare her with the thought that if she gets in the way the ice cream will certainly be damaged. Soon the lumps of ice, all pink from salt, pour out of the bucket. And there emerges—the Russo- Japanese War. A boat! All made of ice cream ! And more beautiful than anyone could imagine. It is a big- battleship, with tiny sailors made of sugar. On the masts there flutter tiny pennants made of real silk. The 55 [pageend57]ship is set down in the middle of the table, and we implore mother not to cut it yet—let it stay as it is for a little while. Or if she does cut it, she should do it so that it doesn’t show. We cannot tell whether it is a Russian or a Japanese battleship. Japanese people wear kimonos, and these sailors are wearing striped suits. Uncle Zizka would know. Is it the Knyaz Suvorov, or the Osly ably a, or the Svetlana of the Second Pacific Squadron? Or the Petropavlovsk of the Port Arthur Fleet; or the Japanese Mikazal Are they signalling Admiral Rozhdestvensky’s command : “The Second and Third division take stations astern of the First, keeping in formation”? Or is it perhaps the signal raised on Togo’s flagship on 27 May, 1905 : “The rise or fall of the Empire depends on this battle. Let every man do his utmost!” The ship is more magnificent than the Rosenkavtalier mother had, more magnificent than the silver rose he had in his hand. Sister had begged mother not to give it to any of the guests, for grown-ups do not really care about such things; she asked her to be careful no to get any ice cream on it, and send it to the kitchen where we were waiting for it. That time the ice cream was served late at night, after nine—but this is more gorgeous than (anything could be. Who is going to get those pennants, the beautiful little flags made of real silk? They are all on one string, and they can’t be divided. Sister knows, of course, that as hostess she can lay no claim to the pennants, and should not even give them a thought. Henner, her best friend, will get them, for at Henner’s my sister will get the best thing on the ice cream. The flags shall be Henner’s, and every girl will get a sailor. Now the pennants must be taken off. Already the ship is heeling over on its side. It must be horrible to see a befautiful ship sinking ! 56 [pageend58]Slowly we leave the table. And now what? Tag’ Hide and seek ? Tag ! My sister is a little frightened of what conies next. She knows very well what you are allowed to do and wh'at you are not; she knows it is forbidden to scratch the floor with one’s heels or chairs. But one cannot tell guests that. Henner is the first. She rushes from the door of the dining-room to slide on the carpet in the hall. But our rug isn’t as long as Henner’s and doesn’t slide so well. She crashes into father’s room, sl&mming the door so hard that the whole- house shakes. Everyone follows her. Every now and then one hears a crash, as of a body colliding with the furniture, the wall, or the floor. For a moment everyone stops—but it’s all right, let’s go on. The door of the back toilet creaks ‘as Mark, Claudius and Susan shove on it with all their might. Baseli is locked in. Baseli with the scab on her nose, whose mother is proud of the fact that her daughter has no secrets from her. We laugh at Mrs. Baseli, !and Henner often imitates the way she walks. Helene takes after her. We think Mrs. Baseli is very funny, although she is very beautiful and has been painted by Nechleba many times. Baseli likes to boast of the number of times she herself has sat for him. With the scab on her nose! And the things she does! Disgusting ! She has been locked in long enough now, and my sister begs Susan and Claudius to let her come out. Henner has found her way into the bathroom, and sprays Mark and Cerna with water by keeping her thumb over the tap. She doesn’t care if she spills water over the dress in which she was painted by Boettinger—she isn’t afraid of anything. Baseli has stopped screaming and hammering on the door. She probably feels offended. We were once shut in the bathroom at Henner’s, but it had large windows and plenty of light. Claudius and Susan won’t listen. Not until Henner suggests putting up the trapeze do they leave 57 [pageend59]the door. For a while Baseli does not suspect that she is free, but on hearing everyone leaving the hall she tries the handle and emerges in high dudgeon. But nobody takes any notice of her. Henner, on the trapeze, bets that she could touch the chandelier with her toe. But this is nothing compared with Susan’s performance. In her sailor dress she hangs upside down on the trapeze, revealing her black gym pants. She wears them all the time so as to be able to swing on the trapeze at a moment’s notice. She h'angs on it rather like a strange bat, with her pleated skirt and golden hair hanging down. Her hair is not false like sister’s or Henner’s; she wears it every day to school. Sister knows her pants well from gym. At Susjan’s we sometimes play “secret” games with Claudius and Henner, but today no-one gives the secrets a thought. There is no time for them. The door bell rings. The hands of the clock stand at seven-thirty. Impossible ! It can’t be half past seven yet. And who could it be ringing the bell ? They all promised to come at eight. Miss Kinzl is standing in the hall. Mother comes out of the bedroom, where she was in case we should need her. She welcomes Miss Kinzl and invites her to come in and pleads with her to let Rose stay. But Mr. Kinzl (they have no mother any more) has already made 311 exception for today; they usually have supper at seven-thirty, and this time Rose will be half an hour late. Rose does not argue or revolt, it is no accident that she is the best behaved in the class. Well, let her go, she’s no fun. But how could it be half past seven ? We have spent a quarter of an hour in the hall with Rose, and it will be eight in no time. Still, Henner will stay till nine and maybe later. Sushn boasts that she can stay till ten. Nobody ever asks when she will be home. Perhaps this is because she has grown-up brothers and a sister. Bonda will 58 [pageend60]come to see her home, for after nine even Susan cannot be out in the street by herself. We are very envious of Bouda, for she is grown-up, and the things she tells Susan ! Claudius rubs her hands and chuckles, for no particular reason.—The bell rings again. The Claudius’ maid. Mother has to persuade her to join Lidushka and take aj piece of pastry. And now they are coming to fetch Baseli and Mark, and will not hear of letting them stay longer. The hall is crowded with people, commotion and people bumping into one another. It’s impossible to persuade them to let the girls stay, even for a little while. The girls are pushed into their coats and politely say goodbye; the governesses and maids address themselves to mother with the parents’ compliments, which she reciprocates. The li/all is empty; and in the drawing room only Henner, Susan and Claudius, sister’s best friends, are left. Now they will really have fun. And they have to promise once more to stay on, come what may, for the .agreement was till nine. —■ How did Miss Horejshi get in? Oh no! Henner was faithfully promised she could stay till nine, and even later. Miss Horejshi promised it herself, and Heimer’s parents knew about it. After all, a promise is :a promise. Henner is a real friend of the family ! She helps us push Miss Horejshi into the kitchen, where she has to sit and wait. Back in the drawing room Henner gives an imitation of the way Miss Horejshi talks: Actually! Actually she promised Ann that she would go home at nine, and so she’s actually got to wait. Henner then parodies the way Miss Horejshi walks, waggling her hips, horsh hips, (for Miss Horejshi says horsh instead of horse), actually horsh. Henner is very good at it and has sister rolling with laughter, but the fun is somewhat spoilt when one knows that Miss Horejshi an^the Claudius’ maid are 59 [pageend61]waiting in the kitchen. And the door bell rings again. This time it is Bonda. And Susan said she could stay till ten ! Here is her opportunity to show that Bonda is her friend. Bonda agrees to wait, but not too long. Meanwhile Bonda is joined by Miss Horejshi, looking for Heimer’s coat. And it’s not even nine o’clock ! Susan does her best to push Bonda into the kitchen, and we are all pushing Miss Horejshi. It’s great fun, but it can’t last. Miss Horejshi actually won’t put up with disobedience. Let’s close the kitchen door and all of us lean on it! At this point mother intervenes. She likes children to be happy, and she is glad when they have a good time, but we nearlj’ shut Miss Horejshi’s finger in the door. Now it’s after nine and even Henner has no more excuses; the little respite is over. The Claudius’ maid tries to get Lydia into her coat. Claudius is playing about and giggling. All Susan’s boasting nbout Bonda was only talk. Miss Horejshi has closed her ears to all entreaties. Claudius, now dressed, and shaking with laughter, says a formal goodbye to mother. Heimer, holding the battleship’s flying pennants, lines up with Miss Horejshi. We examine Miss Horejshi’s hips, and wonder if they could actually belong to a “horsh”. They are outside, on the stairs, Claudius laughing as she bounds down, Susan in everyone’s way, Miss Horejshi warning Henner not to gallop like a horsh. They are gone. We listen to their voices echoing in the entrance hall downstairs before dissolving in the sounds of the street. It is all over. Sister shuts the door and goes back to the dining room, where mother has started to clear away the dishes. The chandelier still illuminates the table and the remains of the party. It is all over. Sister says, “I hope they had a good time.” That is what mother always says when the ladies have left after one of her parties. Mother takes 60 [pageend62]íi couple of fancy sandwiches and pastries and puts them on a plate; this will be her supper tonight. Father won’t be coining yet. Sister takes one sandwich and a cup of tea. Lidushka brings in what is left of the ice cream. It has to be eaten now, or it will be wasted. We sit at the table and regard the shipwreck of the ice cream. It must be horrible when a ship like that sinks. We heard that they cut the ribbons off the Japanese killed in battle, and use them to make pompadours for the ladies. It must be horrible to wear one of them ! luckily children don’t have to. Sister is probably thinking quite different, although she was there when uncle Zizka said that Europe was surprised by the Japanese defeat of Russia. Russia lost through her rotten bureaucracy, said uncle Zizka. He knows about these things: he knows what an upright bureaucracy means, a bureaucracy with clean hands. A state with a corrupt bureaucracy cannot win a war. (Father was cross when he listened to uncle Zizka, and we know why; it was because he could not forgive uncle for the way he was received in the Ministry of Finance, for uncle was very nervous that someone might think his brother-in-law had come to ask him a favour. It was very embarrassing. Father said even uncle’s secretary was embarrassed.) Marquis Ito was killed at a meeting with the Russian Minister of Finance. Where will it all end? In complete anarchy. All these things are the doing of the anarchists. We know that uncle Zizka will be furious. He will stop teasing us. He will talk about imminent destruction by subversive elements. Uncle Zizka fears them as much as a visit to his office by father. Sometimes he mentions names like the ones in our book of Japanese and Chinese fairy tales. The emperor Yi Hvong. A name from Andersen’s fairy tales: the Emperor and the Nightingale. The Emperor Yi Hvong had 61 [pageend63]to abdicate in favour of his son. He lived in a wonderful palace at the foot of a mountain at Seoul; his palace had a hall with a hundred pillars, a lake with a thousand lilies, and a chorus of singing girls. At this point uncle chuckles and glances at mother, and w’e know it is one of those gentlemen’s jokes we are not allowed to hear. We are surprised that uncle, who is interested only in Emperors and military atrategy, and reads about them all evening, makes the same kind of jokes as every other man. Korea is made of sea and bamboo, such as are painted on mother’s kimono, all green on white. It was bought in the Maison. The Stanek. Whenever we go into this shop with mother, we look for the blue plate with one of our fairy tales. Again and again we look at the plate and look for the familiar figures: the father with his whip, chasing the two lovers over the bridge; the big- overhanging tree with catkins, which is mentioned in the story. When the willow blossom drops from the bough, then The nest your winged artist builds, Some robber-bird shall tear away. When the catkins fall off the willow-tree 1 On the picture they will never fall, perhaps only when the plate breaks, and perhaps not even then. These catkins, as big as the whip of the father chasing the lovers, will never fall off. Not in the picture, at any rate. But in the fairy tale and in the reality it tells of, the catkins did fall, and the peach-tree was all covered with blossoms. And the young lady was all dressed in peach-coloured silk. The beauty of it is in the words: peach colour. When you think of it it is beautiful—pinkish, with just a dash of orange, like melted apricot ice cream. The lady’s name was Kong-See. The picture shows all the objects in> the story ; the willow-tree, the father, the whip, the two lovers and the two turtle-doves. And 62 [pageend64]there are many things to be found between the lines of the story, like the time when the willow-tree did not have any catkins. Far beyond the borders of the blue plate are countries and stories the plate, or cup, or saucer do not mention. Far beyond are places like Liao- Yang and Liao-Ho. Landscapes with tea-gardens which grow the tea that Maison Thé Stanek calls Russian tea. So far away from the story of the blue plate as to be quite invisible are the armies of generals Kuropatkin and Kuroki, who fought the battle of Liao-Yang. Infinitely far beyond the blue plate on which the father chases the two lovers over the bridge are the bridges of Liao-Yang, where on the night of September the 1st, 1904, the first and third divisions of the Siberian Army fought. If uncle Zizka were here he would say that the fate of Port Arthur and that of the Russian Army was decided at Liao-Yang. Sister finished her ice cream, melting like the folds of the peach-coloured silk dress Kong-See wore on her wedding day. It is the end. The ice cream battleship is completely wrecked. Uncle Zizka could tell us its name. Was it the swift cruiser Svetlana, the swallow of the second Pacific Fleet, which on 14 October 1904 left Libau harbour, sailed over three oceans, and sustained a direct hit under the waterline at the very beginning of the battle of Tsushima ? Her dynamo broke and her bow pitched forward, so that she could steam at only 15 knots. Remembering Admiral Rozhdestvensky’s orders she set a course N. 23 deg. E. for Vladivostok, and on 28 May 1905, far from the Korean coast, with all her ammunition gone, her machinery damaged, and her powder magazine flooded, opened her sea-valves, a sinking derelict riddled with Japanese shells. Could it be the Petropavlovsk, which on 13 April 1904 struck a mine which holed her bottom? Tire boilers and 18 torpedoes blew up, and the magazine exploded. The 63 [pageend65]ship was blown in two, and sank by the bows. Admiral Makaroff, the war artist Vereshchagin, Rear-Admiral Holas, chief of Naval Headquarters, GOO men and 31 officers perished. Once when we visited uncle Zizka, we saw in one of his magazines a picture of a sinking ship, on whose deck stood an admiral with his legs planted firmly apart. The caption of the picture was: Untergang des Admiral Makaroff auf dem Panzerkreuzer Petropavlovsk, 1904. Uncle Zizka said : “The annexation of Korea’’. We often hear people talk about the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but we cannot understand it when people talk this way about a fairy land like Korea. We are familiar with the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina because the grown-ups used to talk about it. Father talks about it quite often, and besides he has a picture in his room : A man is being carried on a stretcher along a mountain path; in the foreground a blind guslar sits, led by his daughter; her dark hair is woven with a string of sequins, and she is gazing into au abyss. Sometimes I think my sister will grow up to look like the blind guslar’s daughter, because he looks very like father. That is what the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina means. How could anything like this happen in Korea? To believe it really you have to look hard into the blue plate, follow its two doves, and look far beyond it. A blue plate bought in Chinatown, or at the Maison Thé Stanek, which says: The nest your winged artist builds, Some robber-bird shall tear away. 64 [pageend66]KATE BARLAY THE VISITATION OF AUNT CLARA Somewhere in the world I have, or had, rich relatives — according to some members of my family. But if so, I never had their address. My paternal grandfather lived in the Bachka, in Hungary, the black-soiled, fertile land where the earth grew gold. Wheat, golden wheat, heavy with the hard grain, each head hanging humble when ripe. And there was golden corn ou the cob, standing like sentinels in the heat of the dying summer. Everything was there to create wealth—except that the family fortune went in the 1848 Revolution. My father’s and my mother’s, too. The ancient house, with its cool corridors, thick walls, vaulted ceilings, and the veranda, with its pillars and redstone floor, curtained with lush green creepers on the garden side. This house went up in the flames of the Revolution. I only saw pictures of it and heard tales of it; but to me it was so real, I could have touched it. One day, the church bells rang as the house and the town burned under a pall of smoke, sparks scattering everywhere, blown by the south-eastern wind, and Russian soldiers galloped across the great plains, crushing to death Hungary’s bid for freedom which the Austrians were powerless to defeat alone. After all this was over, my father’s family was never well-off. They had to start a new life. A smaller house was built on the site of the old one. When I was very small, I once visited this house, but by then it no longer stood on Hungarian soil, for the country was carved up after the first world war. The house of my ancestors and 65 [pageend67]the earth they worked had become alien land. Of course, it was some time before things had settled down sufficiently for my parents to go there, and by then grandfather was very old and had had a stroke. He sat there in his wheelchair and with his white hair and beard, looked like a patriarch. On his little finger he wore a ring with the family crest. The ring fascinated me and I asked him to give it to me. Grandfather looked at me gaily, his blue eyes watering at the corners, and said, “My little chicken, I will give it to you after I die.” My small heart gladdened at the prospect. I stroked his face and said, “When will you die, Grandad?” He burst out laughing-—so hard he started to cough. “Ho-ho, not so fast, little chicken! Die I shall, but I won’t let myself be hurried ! The pity is, I shan’t be able to leave you as much as I’d have liked.” He seemed to talk to himself now. “Once, so help me, I had the chance to win back everything. I had fabulous luck. But for that blackguard" Bela, that scoundrel, that good-for- nothing. . .” Grandad’s face grew purple. Grandmother came in and stopped him. “Again! Really, Sandor, won’t you ever get over it! You haven’t set eyes on my brother for forty-eight years! Goodness knows where he is now.” “I hope he’s in a good hot place,” Grandad muttered. Grandmother didn’t say anything after that, but silently pushed his wheelchair out into the garden. There he dozed, near the flowerbed where the huge poppies grew, their fleshy petals soaking in the warm morning sun, innocent, proud, while inside the peduncle the black seeds harboured opium. And though Grandad’s sleep had nothing to do with this, it became deeper, as if he had been drugged by the sweet poison contained within the flowers. Something was deadly down in the Bachka. The iner66 [pageend68]tia. Bees buzzed among the flowers. I played with a kitten. Soon the noon-day bell would peal out and the huge noon-day meals begin. Things went on as before, and as long before that. But the dice was loaded—against the bouse and the garden, against Hungary, and against my inheritance, though Grandad put all the blame on Uncle Bela for everything. Uncle Bela was Grandmother’s younger brother. The way I pieced it together afterwards, it all started one noon, just as Jutka, the big, hefty maid whose braided hair was plaited around her head like a crown, put the huge soup tureen on the table. As the church bells pealed out the last strokes, Grandad opened the front door, hung up his hat, put his walking stick in the stand, and walked into the dining room. Grandmother stood at the far end of the table, stirred the soup with the ladle and started to serve. The children sat down and chanted in unison, “Kiss your hand, Tapa !” There were six of them—Grandma was sixteen when she married. This was all the children said during meals, unless their father addressed them. Grandad ruled with a rod of iron. His walking stick was not just something to lean on. Its handle was of silver and carried his initials—a symbol of his authority, a fine malacca cane, to be used, if need be, on the backs of his sons. Its thickness didn’t bother him ! His children feared him as fire, and his wife- served him like a slave. Grandad said grace, then tasted the first mouthful of soup. Grandma waited, spoon in hand. The children waited, too, spoons poised near their hungry mouths. They all looked at him. “Good ! Just enough rice and not too thick !” It was chicken giblct soup, with rice. Cream and chopped parsley floated on top of it. Grandma smiled happily, and everyone had started to eat when the door burst open and Uncle Bela came in. 67 [pageend69]“ ‘Day, brother-in-law. ‘Day, Melinda.” He patted some heads as he passed the children, who all grinned— they adored Uncle Bela. He threw his hat with deadly accuracy to land on a wine cooler on the sideboard, pulled up a chair and sat down. “M’um, my favourite soup!” The maid came in without prompting and handed a soup plate to Grandma who filled it without a word. Grandad shook his head. “What is it this time, brother —as if I didn’t know! Lost at cards?” Bela guzzled his soup noisily. “Your finger-tips should be gilded, Melinda, the way you flavour everything. Just right! Brother-in-law, you are lucky Melie married you.” Grandad gave him a dirty look. “Also, you are dead wrong! I don’t want any money from you. On the contrary, I want to put some in your pocket.” Grandfather’s expression spoke volumes, but he only waved his hand as to chase away a fly. “Bah!” “I’m selling National Lottery tickets,” Uncle Bela continued, unabashed. “With a little luck, you’ll be rich. I’ve bought some myself,” he added temptingly. Crops were bad that year. Hailstorms, late frost, drought, the lot. Grandad had worry in plenty. But that didn’t mean he changed his habits. As usual when in a tight corner, he was already negotiating the sale of a piece of land with one of the big landowners in the neighbourhood. “You, Melie?” Bela turned to his sister. “Won’t you buy a ticket?” Grandma shook her head without answering. Instead, she changed the subject. “Bela, won’t you get a proper job, dear ? You ought to settle down. Kate cries her eyes out over you. She’s heard about the new girl cashier at the Café Ocean. You ought to put things right with 68 [pageend70]her at once. She has plenty of money and her father will give you at least three hundred acres for a dowry. Besides, she is beautiful, a good churchgoer and in love with you . . .” Grandad rapped the table/'Melinda, nicht für die Kinder!” Bela grinned. “Thanks, brother! It would spoil my favourite lunch if I had to listen to sermons!” He looked at the beans and roast goose approvingly as Grandma heaped his plate with the second course. “Nothing makes a man feel better than Hungarian cooking. My favourite dishes would be the death of the Austrians, curse them !” he added. The ’48 Revolution wasn’t forgotten and the skin still smarted under the old scar tissue. Jutka brought in the sweet, a boiled concoction that resembled ravioli but had a filling of plum jam and ground walnuts, with sugar scattered over it. It was called Monk’s Ear, and by the time it was finished everybody felt a bit distended round the waist. A marvellously nourishing sweet, but a deadly enemy of work, requiring several hours of diligent and devoted digestion. The maximum effort afterwards would be, say, a game of dominoes or cards at the coffee house called the Ocean. At least, that was where Uncle Bela went. Grandad withdrew to the bedroom for a nap on the sofa at the foot of the large double-bed. It never became clear which was responsible for Grandad’s dream, the second helping of Monk’s Ear, Uncle Bela’s talk about winning the National Lottery —or even, perhaps, some supernatural power. What one believes depends on one’s inclinations. But it is a fact that when Grandma went into the bedroom, she found, to her amazement, the entire front of the cupboard door covered with huge numbers in chalk! Grandad was deep asleep, snoring peacefully. In the 69 [pageend71]firm belief that one of the boys had done this dreadful thing out of sheer devilment, Grandma hastily wiped off the numbers with her own lavender-scented handkerchief before Grandad awoke and beat the erring child to death. Sure that the last traces of chalk had gone, Grandma quietly withdrew to the sewing room to do some mending. It was there that Grandad found her when he burst in excitedly half-an-hour later. “Who wiped off the numbers from the wardrobe?” he demanded in a wrathful voice. “Who dared touch my numbers?” Grandma was amazed. “You wrote on the mahagony wardrobe, Sandor? Why?” “Don’t cross-examine me ! Answer !” roared Grandad, his blue eyes blazing. “Yes, I wiped them off. How could have dreamed . . .” Grandad sank into a chair, his anger ebbing away under the blow. “It’s all over, Melie. It is gone. I’m sure it was the right number.” Grandma looked at him as if he had gone mad. “Listen. You remember Clara, my dead sister?” Grandma nodded. "Go on. What about her?” “She came to me from Bulgaria to visit me in my dream. She was dressed in white, from head to foot. She took a lottery ticket from her purse and handed it to me. She said she wanted to help me. ‘This number will win !’ she said. ‘Stick to it, brother, and it will help you, even if it doesn’t make you very rich.’ Then she waved to me and disappeared into the wardrobe. I woke up with a start, but I could still hear her voice as she said, ‘Don’t forget—don’t forget!’ So I whipped out a piece of billiard cue chalk I happened to have in my waistcoat pocket and made a note of the number— at the very spot she had disappeared ! Then I sat down on the sofa to recover myself and I must have fallen asleep again.” Grandad shook his head, as if even he 70 [pageend72]couldn’t understand what had happened. “I don’t believe in ghosts and I’m not superstitious. But Clara was so alive, Melie. So alive!” Grandma was very sorry about the lost number and did her best to apologise and to comfort Grandad. When he had recovered himself he went out to the Café Ocean, not forgetting to go by way of the banks of the Danube to make sure none of the boys had gone swimming instead of to school. The river was low and the wooden bridge spanning it at that point, deserted. The broad stream was empty, too, and though it was only the beginning of June, the heat of the Hungarian summer enveloped the landscape. A horse whinnied in a nearby field. Grandad nodded, turned away from the river and went on to the coffee house, reassured that all was well and that the natural order of things prevailed. Spending the afternoons at the café, drinking a capuciner and playing cards benefited his station in life. Was he not a member of the landed gentry? There was the old bailiff to keep an eye on things—and the peasants to work. It was equally normal to sell a piece of land when things got tough. Still, what a queer dream he’d had ! Inside the Ocean it was much cooler. Apart from the entrance, the place was almost hermetically sealed. It was darker, too, and above the marble-topped tables the mirrors glittered dimly on the walls. The air was stale and stuffy with tobacco smoke which had eaten into the very walls and furniture, and even the old dress suit of the waiter. Figures like dummies sat draped on the chairs, reading the newspapers in their bamboo frames. At one corner table sat a few of the regulars, playing cards. The only bright spot in this vapour-laden atmosphere was Mancika, the cashier. There she sat, enclosed in a semi-circular wooden structure on a kind of pedestal, 71 [pageend73]at her elbow, a glass bowl filled with lump sugar, on the shelves behind her, bottles of liqueurs. Apricot brandy, glistening like gold; green walnut brandy; cherry brandy; even champagne. Whenever the ancient, flat-footed waiter had an order for a capuciner—which was black coffee with just a dash of milk, served in a tall glass—he would shuffle first to Mancika. “Sugar and capuciner to number four.” And Mancika would place two* big lumps of sugar on the small round metal saucer waiting on the shining metal tray, and then at once make a note of the order in the ledger she kept open before her. Book-keeping was simple at the Ocean. Bela stood at her left, leaning against the wooden structure that enclosed Mancika. He was a tall young man. But he had to' look up to- her, which he did in adoration. “What lovely white shoulders you have, Mancika!” Mancika giggled. She wore an embroidered white grenadine blouse, pushed down invitingly. The puffed short sleeves left her white round arms free. Her hair was very dark brown, almost black, shiny and alive, and done into a large bun at the nape of her neck. “What a nice slim waist!” Bela went on softly, caressingly. Mancika turned her head away from him, showing her neck as she did so, where her hair grew short and escaped in soft ringlets from her bun. “Too bad you let that clown of a Count put his arms around it. People saw you! Aren’t you ashamed, Mancika!” Mancika turned crimson and looked Bela full in the face, her dark eyes flashing. “Why should I be ashamed? Goodness gracious me, things like that shouldn’t be taken seriously ! A man is a man, even if he is a Count. I couldn’t hurt his feelings. Anyway, I’m not married to you. Really, you expect too much. But even if I were—and I don’t presume to that—I wouldn’t give my husband sweets 72 [pageend74]every clay. I wouldn’t spoil him, or he’d soon loathe the sight of me. Besides, it’s nice to have admirers.” Here Mancika broke down to the point of tears. “He ordered twelve bottles of champagne,” she whispered. “Do you want me to lose my job 1” Meanwhile, Grandad had taken his seat among the card-players and, striking a glass on the table with his signet ring, ordered a capuciner and an apricot brandy. Mancika had to get busy and Bela went over to join Grandad for a game. But he was pale and his hands were moist as he shuffled the cards, and he hated Grandad for interrupting his discussion with Mancika. That same evening, Grandad found it necessary to say something about Bela to his wife. “That young ass, your brother is getting himself talked about. The way he carries on with Mancika, the cashier at the Ocean. He’d better not get into any scrapes with the Count 1 It would be a fine thing if my brother-in-law got into trouble for such a girl!” Grandmother, of course, agreed with every word he said, and the matter wasn’t raised again for a week or so. Then one night, after a dinner of Transylvanian stuffed sour cabbage and poppy seed strudel, Grandad had another visitation from his dead sister, Clara. He slept heavily, throwing himself about, and didn’t hear when Grandmother got out of bed in the middle of the night and went to the window. Somebody was throwing pebbles at the glass. She drew aside the curtains and in the pale moonlight saw Bela with Mancika. Bela whispered, “Let us in, Melie, please!” Grandma loked anxiously over her shoulder towards Grandad, but he only muttered something in his sleep. Grandma quickly put on her housecoat and, silently as a shadow, went out. “For mercy’s sake, what’s happened?” she asked. 73 [pageend75]Mancika burst into tears. “He beat up the Count because of me—though God’s my witness, I love only him!” She clung to Bela. “The old scoundrel! He’s lucky to be alive,’’ Bela said threateningly. Grandma clutched her head. “Jesus Maria, what have .you done ! He was negotiating for a piece of our land. The deal won’t go through now, to be sure! . . . Still, poor child, poor child, you’re shivering !” she murmured. “I’m sure the Count asked for it 1” Mancika clutched at Grandma’s hand and kissed it. “Melie, please put her up for the night,’’ Bela pleased. “She’ll go at dawn before anyone gets up.’’ Grandma nodded. She was still young herself at the time, only six years older than Bela. But she was motherly, even then. She put her arm round Mancika’s shoulders and led her from the sleeping garden into the house. Bela stood watching them until they disappeared, then he turned and vanished under the shadows of the trees. Grandad was dreaming . . . His dead sister Clara from Bulgaria was remonstrating with him. “You didn’t buy the lottery ticket I told you about, did you? I’ll give you the number again. It won’t make you as rich as Croesus, but it’ll give you a little peace, a little time, a little ease . . . Vou won’t have to sell the land, the land, the land . . .” Grandfather’s heart ached. He loved his land and didn’t feel like selling it. He squinted in his effort to see the number in his sister’s hand. At first he thought he saw it, then he didn’t. Then he did. Yes, quite clearly. He woke with a start, threw himself out of bed, rushed to his coat, took his notebook from it and wrote down the figures while they were still fresh in his mind. He put the notebook back in the jacket pocket, returned to bed and fell asleep . . . 74 [pageend76]He woke, whistling and happy. He was having breakfast on the veranda as usual when Bela arrived. “Good morning, brother-in-law,’’ he greeted Grandad. “Morning,” said Grandad. “What’s up? You’re around early today.” Bela sat down and poured himself a cup of coffee with a generous portion of cream. He seemed thoughtful as he stirred the sugar. Then he said deliberately, weighing every word, “I’m going to get a job—start afresh.” “You didn’t sell any lottery tickets?” Grandad twitted him. “As it happens, I have a customer for you.” Bela didn’t rise to the bait. “I don’t bother with such things any more. It’s a mug’s game.” “Oh, I wouldn’t say that!” Grandad protested, and fished the little notebook from his pocket. “Look I have a tip. This number is going to win. I’ll give you five forints and you stake this number for me in Szabadka.” For a moment, Bela looked at Grandad in amazement, but then lost interest almost at once. “Nonsense,” he said. “How could you have a tip? The draw isn’t crooked and isn’t till tomorrow.” He shook his head. “You can’t have a tip on this. It isn’t like horses. Don’t waste your money.” “Don’t you worry whether I have a tip or not. Just do me the favour of getting a ticket for me in Szabadka.” “I don’t know if I’ll have the time today, brother- in-law. I’m very busy. And Szabadka, as you know, is five hours’ drive ...” Grandad hit the table with his open palm. He always had a quick femper. “You make the time,” he shouted. “It’s the least you can do!” Bela took the money and wrote down the number which Grandad read out from his little book. “Oh, all 75 [pageend77]right,” he said. ‘‘Money down the drain. Please yourself. It’s your money!” A moment later Grandma came out and Grandad who had finished breakfast by this time, lit his pipe and got up. ‘‘I’m going down to the stables,” he said. “Wonders never cease, Melie. You’ve got a reformed brother.” He winked and went away, whistling. As soon as he was out of earshot, Grandma whispered, “Bela, she was gone by morning. Where is she now?” “In my dogcart, under the trees, just outside the garden. I’m taking her with me. We’re going to get married.” Grandmother clasped her hands together. “If you marry her, Sandor will never forgive you. A cashier girl!” “That can’t be helped. I love her and I’m going to marry her. Melie, I shan’t see you for a long time. Thank you for everything. You have been a good sister to me. Don’t cry.” He leant forward and kissed her cheek. Then, as’ he was about to go, he remembered something. “Melie, here are five forints,” he said, smiling. “Buy something for yourself—it’s money that would have been wasted anyway. Don’t breathe a word of my plans to a soul. I need time.” He waved to her and, his footsteps echoing on the red stones of the veranda, he was gone. Grandmother was very busy that day. She was making cherry jam. One of her sons was bitten by a dog, and Grandad unexpectedly brought home several friends to celebrate. He didn’t tell Grandmother what the celebration was for, but she knew he could always find a reason for celebrating if he felt like it. Grandmother wasn’t in the habit of asking too many questions. While she rushed around all day, her thoughts were with Bela and Mancika. Where were they? Where 76 [pageend78]would they go? She looked sad and absent-minded, but nobody asked what was troubling her. All her life her hands were never idle; her light footsteps sounded all day around the house. But she was silent. As always, it was her way to help, not to burden others with her own problems. The Count had sent a letter, cancelling his offer to buy the land. But Grandad didn’t seem to' care, and celebrated instead. For this Grandmother was grateful, since the Count hadn’t mentioned the incident with Bela. She went to sleep while the men were still singing on the veranda by candle-light. Grandfather didn’t like lamps. He stuck candles into the necks of empty bottles. Every empty bottle meant a new candle, and as the night grew deeper the veranda became lighter with every passing hour. “He who drinks good wine can’t be a bad man 1 Hey-ho, we’ll never die! Drink, friends.. !” The moths, attracted by the light, swirled round and died in the flames. Grandad awoke with a big, aching head around noon. The veranda was freshly scrubbed, the stones glistened, and Grandmother placed a tall glass of sour cabbage juice in front of him as he sat down in the very seat he had used the previous night. “Did Bela call?” he asked. “Not yet,” said Grandmother, looking away. In her apron pocket was a note she had received that morning. “Dear Melie, we are going abroad. The world is full of opportunities. I hope—no, I am certain I shall make a fortune somewhere. Don’t show this letter to anyone. It would mean trouble if we were discovered before we left the country. The Count has influential friends. I hit him hard. Your loving brother, Bela.” 77 [pageend79]And beneath his name, in a childish hand, was written “Mancika”. The note burned Grandmother’s pocket, but she did not breathe a word about Bela’s departure. Grandad was too restless to notice the guilty look on Grandmother’s face. He decided not to wait till his afternoon visit to the Café Ocean to see the papers. The results of the lottery would be out by now and he had great faith in Aunt Clara. He was elated, almost excited, and, fortified by the sour cabbage juice, already felt much better. “I think I’m going to the coffee house to see the papers. Tell Bela when he shows up to join me there— and tell him to bring my ticket with him.” “What ticket?” Grandma asked naively. “Melie, what does it matter what ticket? If I say, tell Bela to bring the ticket, it’s evident he must know about it. So tell him to bring it.” Obediently, Grandmother nodded. Grandad put on his hat, took his malacca cane from the stand, picked up his gloves and set out. The Café Ocean was in a turmoil. Nobody sat in the cash desk to take the orders, to hand out the lumps of sugar. The headwaiter was trying to cope with about a dozen people—an unusually large crowd—who had all come to read the newspapers and see the results of the lottery. Grandfather sat down and after waiting for a few seconds, tapped with his heavy signet-ring on the marble-topped table. He had to knock quite hard before the sad, flat-footed waiter came hurrying up, bringing Grandfather his favourite paper and ready to take his order. “What will it be, sir?” "Capuciner and a double apricot brandy.” "Capuciner and a double apricot,” the hoarse, tired 78 [pageend80]waiter’s voice repeated the order to the headwaiter who sat in the elevated enclosure Mancika had abandoned. Grandfather opened the paper, then folded it, took out his pince-nez and was about to start reading when the waiter place his order in front of him. He nodded, took a sip of the brandy, put on his pince-nez and started to examine the columns of numbers. The next moment, with a great sweep of his arm, he knocked over the coffee in the tall, steaming glass. “I have won !” he shouted in his joy. “The big treble chance! I have won! Here it is! Right on top. My number! Champagne for everyone. It’s all on me!” The headwaiter, the waiter and several people crowded round him at once. While the waiter mopped up the spilled coffee, Grandad shook hands with his well- wishers. Then be looked up towards the cash-desk which Mancika used to grace and asked, “Where’s the girl? She likes champagne, too, the little one. . .” The headwaiter cleared his throat and after a small silence supplied the information: “Mancika has left. She’s gone for good. . .” He cleared his throat again. “She’s going to get married. She’s gone abroad. America maybe.” Grandad laughed. “She’s a sly one! Who was the fool who took her?” There was an awkward pause, then the headwaiter replied with a reluctant little cough, “Your brother-in- law, sir.” Grandad shot from his seat. He grabbed the head- waiter by the lapel of his shabby tailcoat. His eyes blazed. “It’s a lie!” “No, sir. . .” “When did this happen?” “Early yesterday morning, sir. They took the train to Budapest to get married—and went on from there. 79 [pageend81]Mancika left a note to tell us. She has no family, so she felt we ought to. . .” Grandad had changed colour. He released his grip on the headwaiter’s tailcoat and sat down heavily. 'When he spoke his voice was quiet. “It’s all over. He never bought that lottery ticket . . . and I won ! That’s the bitterness of it all. I won ! . . . Hell and damnation. . . and the fool never bought my ticket 1” He looked, round at the people gaping at him. He reached into his pocket and threw a banknote on to the table. “Champagne for everybody, just as I said. . .” And he walked out. Uncle Bela’s name was never mentioned in the house again. Grandad forbade it. For a while, Grandma received letters from him. From Vienna, then from Berlin, later from Loudon. The. last note said they expected a baby and might go to America. Perhaps at last he did make a fortune, and successful people become forgetful. The old house in the Bachka has gone. Taxes and bad management took it after my grandparents died in the alien land. The Second World War finished what was left of the silver, family portraits and furniture. But I still have the number of that lottery ticket. And it is nice to think that, somewhere in the world, maybe I have rich relatives. 80 [pageend82]GERTRUDE GOEPFERTOVA GROSSVATER ERZÄHLT VOM FABIAN Heute kann man die Leute wie Schafe führen, früher waren sie nicht so furchtsam, liessen sich nichts gefallen. Nicht einmal die Diebe haben sich so einfach ergeben. In Dolejsi Mesto gingen wieder einmal die Gendarmen umher. Sie waren auf Zigeunerfang und schauten auch bei einem gewissen Kalas hinein, der mit diesen verbündet sein sollte, um ihn zu packen. “Herr Wachtmeister,” bettelte er, ‘‘lasst mich sein, ich will Euch den Fabian verraten, er ist heute abend zu Haus.” Fabian war ein in Mesto ausgerufenener Dieb, den noch kein Gendarm erwischt hatte. “Schon gut”, sagte der Wachtmeister zu Kalas, “aber Ihr bleibt daheim und lauft mir nicht davon !” Und er ging zu Fabians Hütte von vorne, nahm den Nachbarn Picha mit, stellte ihn als Wache hinter den Zaun auf der Stallseite und klopfte an. Stille. Er schlug an die Tür, nichts. Da trommelte er ans Fenster und hörte die Stiege auf dem Dachboden krachen. Er schrie die Alte an : “Ihr habt jemand da drinnen !” “Nein, Herr Wachtmeister!” Die Alte leugnete, das ist klar, aber er griff ins Bett hinein, und fühlte es noch warm, machte die Taschenlampe an und mit einem Satz sprang er auf den Dachboden. Die Alte stand noch unten mit einer flackernden Lampe. Der Gendarm schaut sich im Dunklen um, er steht auf der letzten Stufe und sieht nichts. Auf einmal hört er einen schrecklichen Krach, Fabian war ein starker 81 [pageend83]Bursche, er sprengte die Schindeln auf, sprang auf das Stalldach, wo Picha Wache stand, den warf er um und sprang über den Weg auf unseren Zaun. Nebenan wohnte Bartak, und der war gerade im Holzschuppen und lauerte auf Hasen, er hat ein wenig gewildert. Bartak hörte den Wachtmeister schreien : Packt ihn, packt ihn ! Wie ein Unschuldiger brüllte er: Darf ich schiessen? Natürlich schiessen Sie, schrie der Wachtmeister. Und der zielte also, und mit dem Hasenschrot bestreute er Fabians Knöchel. Natürlich konnte dann Fabian nicht mehr so laufen. Er sprang zu uns auf den Hof und in den Schweinestall. Dort riegelte er sich ein. Aber Bartak sah ihn, den Wachtmeister rief er herbei, damn lief noch unser Vater hinaus und der Pächter Vantera und alle standen um den Schweinestall und nötigten den Fabian, heraus- zukommen. Aber um keinen Preis der Welt wollte der. Da packten sie das Dach und rissen es weg und stachen den lieben Fabian mit Mistgabeln, damit er herauskäme. Auf einmal sagt er: Lasst das, ich komme heraus. Und er kam. Er kroch heraus, stiess die ungeduldigen Kerle von sich weg, sie sprangen wieder auf ihn los, als der Gendarm schrie : Packt ihn! aber er warf sie wieder zurück. Da sagten sie: Packt ihn selbst, Herr Wachtmeister, es ist doch Euer Geschäft! Fabian duckte sich plötzlich, stiess sie auseinander und rannte die Strasse hinunter. Aber die Leute eilten aus den Häusern, aus dem Gasthaus, das ganze Dorf war selbstverständlich auf den Beinen. Sie kreisten ihn ein, rückten zusammen, und der Gendarm kam schon dahergerannt. Jetzt mussten zwei voraus und zwei auf jeder Seite gehen, und der Gendarm stiess ihm das Gewehr in den Rücken. Fabian drehte sich immer wieder um und schlug nach dem Gewehr jedes Mal, wenn ihn der 82 [pageend84]Wachtmeister damit stach. Auf einmal drehte er sich wieder um, schlug den Gendarm nieder, und die anderen stiess er auseinander und stürzte in eine Seitengasse. Zum Unglück ging da aber ein gewisser Chlad und sagte: Vinz, Fabian Vinz, wo läufst du denn so hin ? Er breitete die Arme aus, aber Fabian schlug ihn nieder. Chlad packte aber den Fabian im Fallen am Bein, und der liebe Fabian fiel über ihn. Das hat ihn schon auf gehalten. Die anderen holten ihn ein. Sie umringten ihn alle, banden ihn mit Zügeln auf einen Wagen, und er war gefangen. Als die Alte zu ihm ins Gefängnis kam, um ihm den Abschiedskuss zu geben, biss er ihr die Nase weg, dass sie niemanden mehr gefalle und ihm treu bleibe. Aus dem Gefängnis ist er einmal durch den Schornstein und Über den Blitzableiter hinunter geklettert, und das zweite 'Mal ist er durch die Latrine und die Senkgrube davongeschwommen. Dann musste ihm das “Annerl ohne Nase”, so nannte man sie seit dem Biss, das Essen in seine Höhle bringen. Sie hatte auch Angst, dass er sie umbringen würde, und so hat sie ihn eines Tages dem Bürgermeister verraten. Es war ein ziemlich grosses Kopfgeld für ihn ausgeschrieben, der Bürgermeister wollte es selber einstecken, so nahm er einen Eisenstock und ging los. Das Annerl hatte ihm die Wege durch Reisig bezeichnet. Er fand den Fabian schlafend. Er warf den Eisenstock nach ihm, aber irgendwie traf er ihn nicht, er schlug daneben. Fabian wachte durch den Schlag auf, sprang auf wie ein Hase, in Blitzesschnelle hatte er den Bürgermeister zusammen gepackt und rollte ihn den Abhang hinunter. Er selber lief auf und davon. Danach hat er in Mesto ausrichten lassen, dass er den Bürgermeister erwürgt hätte, hätte er nur gewusst, dass dieser damals allein war. Seitdem hatte man von ihm in Mesto Ruhe, nicht ein83 [pageend85]mal in seiner Hütte hat sieh seitdem etwas gerührt. Einmal hat unser Hund dort aus dem Reisig eine Leberwurst nach der anderen herausgezogen, so eine verhexte Hütte war es. Statt dessen hat ihn die Umgegend zu spüren bekommen. Er streifte nicht mehr allein, das Annerl hatte er zu sich genommen, und sie kochte für seine Bande. Dort drüben, in Závidkovice, haben die Bauern im Damm beim Teich kleine Keller, und dort heben sie den Rahm auf. Es ist ein schönes Stück hinter den Häusern, man kann dort gut stehlen, und Fabian mit seiner Bande konnte gut aussuchen. Aber einige Nachbarn wurden doch das Hundegebell geweckt, sie liessen die Hunde, los und liefen, was sie konnten, mit Knüppeln hinterher. Fabians Bande machte auf einmal kehrt, legte an und schoss alle Hunde tot. Und sie lachten noch die Nachbarn aus: Wollt ihr auch, kommt euch Rahm holen ! Die Männer sind wie Hasen davongelaufen, aber das ist noch nicht alles. Die Fabian-Bande ging jetzt nur ganz langsam weiter, die Weiber hatten sie mit der Milch vorausgeschickt. Zwei von ihnen duckten sich und gingen auf allen vieren weiter, die anderen warfen ihnen die Mäntel über, und bei stockfinsterer Nacht klopften sie bei den Gendarmen an, sie hätten hier zwei Schweine aus Mesto nach Svetlá getrieben, und in Závidkovice hätten die Männer ihnen aufgelauert und geschossen. So einer ist der Fabian gewesen. Auch bei mir ist er einmal vorbeigekommen, damals war ich hier schon verheiratet. Es hat an die Fensterscheibe geklopft, ich mache auf und sehe einen Kerl mit einer schwarzen Maske vor den Augen. Er drängte sich herein und sagte, er wolle bei uns übernachten. Warum denn nicht, sagte ich, um ihn ein wenig aufzuhalten. Auf seine Übernachtung legte ich keinen Wert. Sollte er mir den roten Hahn in der Nacht aufs Dach setzen. Warum nicht ? Haben Sie Papiere ? 84 [pageend86]Der Kerl ist wütend geworden : Ich frage euch auch nicht nach euren Papieren und komme zu euch. Ich frage nur, wo ihr mich schlafen lasst. Ich liess ihn auf die Küchenbank, und in dieser Nacht habe ich nicht viel geruht. Bald danach habe ich gehört, dass Fabian mit einer schwarzen Maske herumgeht, ich dachte mir gleich, dass er es gewesen war. Aber zu niemanden sagte ich ein Sterbenswörtchen. Seitdem habe ich nichts mehr von ihm gehört, nicht einmal, was für ein Ende er genommen hat, aber dass sie ihn nicht erwischt haben, das weiss ich ganz sicher. SADEQ CHUBAK THE TOY HORSE The little boy had not yet had the toy horse for more than a few hours—it had been brought home and given to him as Christmas present just before bedtime, and he had done nothing but handle it and play about with it, poking his fingers into its nostrils and feeling the bulges of its wide, blankly-staring eyes, until at least he had fallen asleep and dropped like a stone on to the sofa beside his mother. The horse stood on the floor on four thick wooden wheels, painted to look like black rubber tyres; the reins were made of leather, and the saddle was a piece of red felt. The horse’s body was the colour of 85 [pageend87]dried henna and had coarse bits of dust sticking up through the paint, so that its surface felt rough, like sand-paper. It stood with its muzzle thrust into the boy’s face, peeping up at him, and the boy still had his arms round its neck. The horse was bigger than the child, big enough for him to climb onto its back and ride it. Their breath mingled. The boy’s cheeks puffed up as his mouth filled the air, then his lips parted and released a warm stream of breath on to the horse’s face. The woman was sitting on the sofa, in front of a charred brick stove which stood bleakly silent and quite empty but for a scattered handful of feathery ashes, remains of burnt paper and cardboard and boxes that had contained sweet biscuits. She starred into the ashes, sick and miserable. The room was entirely bare; there was nothing in it except the one old brown leather sofa and a couple of canvas-covered suitcases standing side by side in expectation of departure. An unshaded bulb, coated with dust, cast its harsh and shameless light into the room, which looked as if the owners had just now moved out. There was still a thick layer of dust on the floor, not smooth but lined by random arabesques and bearing innumerable footprints. Where things had been dragged across the room the dust was disturbed and the red mosaic of the floor showed through in streaks. The woman herself had a dusty and shop-soiled look, and her hair was mousey. She was like a doll which had lost something of its freshness as a result of too much fingering. Her hair resembled a gorse bush, and her clothes hung in slovenly disarray. Streams of tears had washed the dust and dirt and powder that had covered her cheeks and left dried-up streaks in their place. From under the thin lines of her blond eyebrows a pair of deep velvety blue eyes gazed with weary hopelessness into the ashes. She had stopped crying. “If only that night in Mont86 [pageend88]martre had never happened!”, she thought. "If only I had never promised to marry that animal! Why did I ever leave my own country’ and let myself be dragged away’ to this godforsaken place to live under these alien skies? I’ve lost everything—my’ religion, my’ love, my hopes—all is destroyed. I never thought it would be like this. It was all for the sake of the child. What a mistake! How was I to know ? These creatures simply aren’t human.” Through the panes of the uncurtained window she watched the big white snowflakes that whirled and crisscrossed against the black sky. The room was cold, and she had thrown a faded spring coat over her shoulders. She tried to detach the child’s arms from the neck of the horse, but he had clasped it too firmly. He winced in his sleep and she left him alone. This was her third Christmas in Iran; three years ago her plane had touched down at Mehrabad, and she, a fresh and beautiful y’oung woman, had set foot on Persian soil with a light heart. Now her thoughts returned to the Paris she knew before the war. In those days Jalal was a medical student and she worked in a bookshop on the Boulevard Saint-Michel. He was a swarthy, modest-looking young man with broad shoulders who often used to come and browse among the books. His eyes had a rather bewildered, little-boy-lost expression and flitted inconsequentially’ from one object to another and he never stopped blinking. Whenever she noticed him, he would look the other way. Later they’ had fallen in love. She was lively’ and graceful and very' pretty’ and in the evenings the two of them would make for the wine shop at the bottom of the narrow, arched street. They’ would buy a bottle of tepid Burgundy’ and take it down to the river. They would go down the steps on the banks of the Seine and lean against the trunks of the proud green elms, and take turns to sip the last tear87 [pageend89]drops of wine from the bottle. Then they would fall into each other’s arms and devour each other’s lips, while far and near the clochards sprawled on the ground, gulping down their Beaujolais, and muttering. Their favourite haunt was the spot where the lights of the Pont Alexandre Troisieme were reflected in the waters, and it was there they always went. It was there that they kissed and writhed in their embraces till they trembled from head to foot and their mouths became dry and her body caught fire and Jalal’s swarthy cheeks took on a deeper colour. And before long they would get up and go to his little attic in the Rue Gay Lussac. They would both undress and first she would slip between the sheets and then he would come and lie down with her. They would kiss and lick each other all over and the smell of their bodies would change and they would sweat and get out of breath and finally drop into oblivion in each other’s arms. And now, after six years, he had gone off and married his fat, dark-haired cousin, who had eyebrows that reminded her of the legs of a goat, they were so rough and black and ugly. Now there was nothing else for her and her child to do but to return, covered in shame and humiliation, to Paris and her family. Her life had gone up in flames and when she tried to breathe, memories arose like clouds of smoke and stifled her. The warmth of the child’s body pressed against her calmed her down. All she had in the world were her child and the two suitcases which she had put on the floor side by side. Three years ago, when she arrived at Mehrabad, she was two months pregnant. Jalal had accompanied her on the journey and as they alighted he had taken her arm. Her heart was beating fast. It was June and the fierce heat of the sun pressed heavily down on her head like quicksilver. The first thing she saw at the airport were two glowering, dark-faced 88 [pageend90]military policemen, helmeted and standing with their fixed bayonets raised above their heads. There was something peculiarly sinister and repulsive about them. A friend of Jalal’s by the name of Ahmad had come to meet them in his car and she got into the front seat between the two of them. In the back seat was her brother-in-law, Jamal. He had a dirty, unshaven face. His cheeks were covered with bristley stubble and his lips and gums were violet. When she shook hands with him his features contorted themselves into a vacuous leer and he said, “Comment allez-vous?”, in moth- eaten French. Having greeting her thus, he lapsed into complete silence and for the rest of the journey just sat licking his dry, violet-coloured lips. When they got home everything suddenly changed and nothing was as she had expected. The moment she crossed the threshold a putrid smell rose to her nostrils and she wanted to be sick. The house was cramped and dark and had high white-washed walls. The courtyard formed a kind of pergola, covered over by an oppressed- looking trellis to which clung, like a wrestler, the tangled skeleton of a wine, with clusters of tiny mildewed grapes hanging from it. Suddenly she remembered that this must be the house where Jalal was born and she looked around her with new interest. But the unbearable stench from the lavatory in the passage burnt a hole in the fabric of her thoughts. Jalal’s mother and father and three unattractive sisters of assorted shapes and sizes were waiting for him in the courtyard with strangulated and tremulous smiles suggestive of hysteria. She had seen snapshots of them in Paris, both singly and taken as a group, but none of tliem were in the least like their photographs. Their bellies were distended and their skin dark and grubby and they looked as if their family tree could not have included a single healthy specimen. She shook hands 89 [pageend91]with each and nodded and their cold, dry touch made her flesh creep. She looked at them and smiled and repeated. "Salaam, salaam, salaam”, as Jalal had told her to. He had taught her something else to say after "Salaam”, but she was embarrassed to find that she had forgotten what it was. She tried hard to remember. Her head reeled with a tumult of dumb, half-formed syllables and the acrid stench from the passage burnt into her nostrils and prevented her from gathering her thoughts. The phrase that Jalal had taught her in the plane was “Man Kaniz-e shoma hastam”—I am your slave. She guessed that it must be a form of greeting, but did not know’ what it meant and now she had forgotten it completely. Then Jalal took her into the ‘orosi’ and went back for the suitcases. This was a kind of sitting-room, evidently the best room in the house. In one corner stood a round table of ungainly height and a sofa and several armchairs of the type introduced from Europe by Amin as-Sultan, with frayed ornamental knots and faded tassels round them. Small black grapes and cucumbers and cherries had been set out on the table, and there were flies crawling over them. At the far end of the room was a brand new double bed of plain wood, still smelling strongly of French polish, and on it a puffed-up mattress and a bolster. Another corner was taken up by an old velvet-covered and brassbound chest. She liked the room, especially its tiny panes of multi-coloured glass, but here as everywhere the air was polluted by the smell from the passage. It was a smell she had not come across before; indeed, she never knew7 that such a smell existed. She was alone in the room. She put her handbag dowm on the sofa and stood waiting for Jalal to come back. While she waited, she looked around, not without astonishment, at the room and its contents. There was a photograph on the w’all of a frowning revolutionary 90 [pageend92]with a bushy handlebar moustache that seemed to grow out behind his ears and a Mauser rifle under his arm. She found him rather terrifying, and for a moment the image of the two military policemen of Mehrabad flashed through her mind. From the courtyard came the strange and unintelligible voices of Jalal’s mother and father and family—quarrelling voices, as it seemed to her. It was not a reassuring sound. She could distinguish Jalal’s voice from amidst the jibber-jabber. It seemed a long time that she had been left alone in the room and she fell to re-examining the little panes of coloured glass. She thought of the stained glass of Notre-Dame, but these window's were quite different. For that matter, everything here was as different from what she was used to as chalk from cheese. When Jalal returned, he was bathed in sweat and had his jacket slung over his arm. He came and sat down quietly and apprehensively on the sofa, with a cheerless, regretful expression on his face, and said slowly, “Whatever I do I can’t convince them. We should never have come here in the first place.’’ “Convince them of what? Don’t they like me?’’ “It’s not that. They like you, all right, but they insist on a Moslem wedding.” “Haven’t we already been married in Church?” “They don’t recognize that. We’ll have to have a Moslem wedding as well.” “Don’t be silly ! We are already married, and we’ve already got a child—and what’s it got to do with them anyway ?” “They say the child of a Christian marriage is illegitimate.” Both fell silent. Jalal hung his head and gazed down at the flower pattern on the carpet, while she stood watching him. She saw how harassed he looked. She loved him and felt sorry for him—obviously he was be91 [pageend93]ing bullied by his family and hadn’t been able to get a word in edgeways. She went over to the sofa and sat down beside him and took his hand in hers and said : “You know how much I love you. I don’t want you to be unhappy.” “I know. The fact that you were willing to come and live in Persia was a considerable act of selfsacrifice to begin with, and I’m ashamed to ask this of you as well. But the important thing is that we adore each other—none of these external things matter.” “Of course not. I’ll do whatever you say. I only want to live for your sake.” Later a Moslem priest came and married them, and she became Fatima, a name she did not much care for, since she associated it with Algerian prostitutes on the Pigalle. When, after the ceremony, Jalal’s mother addressed her as Fatima, she shuddered and muttered under her breath: “Merde !” But it was not until she saw the lavatory’ that she realised fully’ what sort of place she had come to. Four steps had been let down into the paving of the courtyard, and at the bottom was a dark pit with a damp, heavy curtain of coloured canvas hanging across the entrance. There was no door. When she went down she encountered a wet, stiffing gas, the acrid heat of which almost overwhelmed her. She had brought a piece of tissue paper with her, and involuntarily she held it over her nose. The light of the oil lamp in her hand contracted to a few specks of flame that cowered and clung to the wick, surrounding it like tiny globules of mercury. It was this feeble glow that had disturbed the beetles and spiders and mosquitos; she heard the noise of their scurrying at the bottom of the hole and wanted to run away. But she couldn’t. Her Dior perfume mingled with the smell from below and she wanted to be sick. Then she felt a pain in the pit of her stomach and flung down the lamp and ran 92 [pageend94]outside. That night she lay in a high fever till dawn. She caught typhoid from Jalal’s eight year old sister. The sister died and for a time she herself was in grave danger. The whole family called her a woman of evil omen and accused her of having brought death into their house. They refused to have anything to do with her and she was nursed through the illness by a French nun. Her head had to be shaved completely and she emerged from her ordeal with a jaundiced liver, a yellow complexion and sunken eyes. It seemed that morning would never come. Christmas night was always long but she had never noticed it before because she had always been excited and busy with shopping and dressing and the Christmas tree and Christmas dinner and dancing. But this long ominous night was pounding its heaviness and coldness into her very soul. She lifted her head from the watch on her wrist and, between eyelids that tingled and unwillingly peeled apart, continued gazing into the ashes. The stove was cold and desolate and lifeless. She remembered that it had been midnight when she had looked at her watch before—and now it was still midnight. The hands, as if chained, seemed not to move. Other Christmasses had not been like this. Christmas in Paris had been wonderful. What a night that had been in Montmartre, at the Lapin Agile, with all the coloured lanterns hanging from the barrel-vaults, and everybody gathered together, and the trays loaded with wine and martinis and champagne being passed around by the waiters, and the diseases who took the stage in turn and sang popular songs while all the boys and girls joined hands and swayed to the rhythm and hummed! What a boy Jalal had been in Paris 1 What a dancer! He had held enlightened views, and seemed such an intellectual. But when he came here he seemed to undergo a transformation. His looks changed, his colour changed, his 93 [pageend95]eyes had a different expression, he smelt different. How soon he had forgotten the compassion, the kindness and the acts of tenderness and the beautiful things that had existed between them ! A stinging coldness pierced her spine. Gently she pulled the child’s arm away from the neck of the horse and pushed the horse aside. Then she lay the child’s hands on his chest, and, taking the coat from her shoulders, put it round him and tucked him up warmly inside it. She had a feeling that the people in the town were all her deadly enemies—that they were plotting some mischief against her child and that they were all lying in wait for him out there in the snow. She looked up at the electric light bulb. Needles of light pierced her eyes and penetrated her brain. But in four hours’ time she would be leaving this country for good; she would go without casting a single glance behind her. She looked around the room.—it was empty and unfamiliar, and yet she had been living in it for the last two years. Jalal had come and uprooted the furniture and carted it away and what was left looked like a plundered bomb site. She could not sit still, so she got up and walked over to the window and lit a cigarette and puffed a billowing cloud of smoke on to the glass. Through the window pane she gazed out at the pattern of black and white created by the snowflakes criss-crossing in the air. She could see the street and the cars with dazzling eyes threading along, one behind the other like a scurrying column of ladybirds. She looked out over the famous view of the town, with the dome and minaret of the mosque of Sepah Salar. As she looked a feeling of disgust welled up inside her. Suddenly her stomach turned over and she hurried out to the wash basin. The dank smell of the basin, the* sight of her own unwashed face, the tired eyes behind eyelids that stuck together, the dusty, dishevelled hair—all this 94 [pageend96]nauseated her even more than the view from the window and all at once she was sick into the basin. She threw her half-smoked cigarette into the white foam, a thread of which still hung from her upper lip. She retched a second time. Damp, stifling smoke was still rising from her cigarette butt, which lay smouldering in the basin. Then she began to feel very cold again. Her head still bent over the basin, she looked at her wristwatch—it was half an hour after midnight. The hands might drag themselves round the dial at a snail’s pace if they wanted it that way. It made no difference to her—no matter how slowly they moved, she would still be out of here in two or three hours at the most. All she wished was that those three hours were three seconds. Never had she so ardently wanted time to go up in flames. But at least she would take her child out of this snakepit and when he grew up he would remember neither his father, nor his father’s family, nor his father’s country. She did not even want him to know who his father was—much better to let him think his father was no more than a casual pick-up in the street, never seen or heard of since. Only his swarthy face and black curly hair would be with him all his life as a perpetual mark of shame. She returned to the sitting-room. The child was still fast asleep, with the horse’s smooth, impassive face staring straight up at him. She was shivering a little, and thought the child must be cold too. She sat down beside him, but his body was just as hot as before. She laid her hand on his forehead, and it felt so hot that she knew her fingers must be very cold. When she touched him, he shivered and frowned and winced in his sleep. She thought: “Why was I such a fool as not to realize that I could have had my child by anyone? He would have looked different, that’s all. But I should have 95 [pageend97]loved him just as much as this one. Perhaps he is cold. I am freezing. Everything about this country is dry and metallic—the sun, the cold, the people^—everything and everybody. Life is finished for me. All that remains is to give the child a proper start. But I must implant in him a hatred of this country and of this heavy, blazing sun, so that he never remembers Persia and never remembers his father. To live one needs both love and hate, both friendship and enmity, the two together. The time of Jesus is past and nobody can live on love and forgiveness alone.” She had been to church a great deal and been told often enough that life is love, and she had heard how Jesus washed the feet of Mary Magdalen, and how, when they stoned her, she did not retaliate, but turned her back and walked away; and she had liked these stories. “But now,” she told herself, “I cannot forgive anyone. All that’s over and done with. I’m living in this world, and it is in this world that I must make my decisions. I can’t do much, it’s true—but I have a right to follow my own reasoning as far as it reaches, and go where it takes me. To do that is worthwhile, and gives me a certain satisfaction.” She seized the horse’s bridle ami pushed it back from the sofa. Its wheels scraped on the floor and the child suddenly stirred. She was frightened, and let go of the horse. Her lips stuck together with the dried saliva, she got up and took the horse under her arm and quietly placed it among the burnt papers on the otherwise empty stove. She took a box of matches from the pocket of her jacket and set fire to the horse’s mane and tail. Then she stood back, to let the flames warm the child’s face. She wiped her mouth on her sleeve and stepped back to the sofa and sat down beside the child, watching the flames with remorseful, startled eyes. She was uneasy. She wished that she was not there, that she had 90 [pageend98]left long ago. She decided that when he woke up she would say, “Your Daddy came and grabbed it by force and took it away.” At least it would warm the room up —she was freezing. The flames licked round the horse and enveloped it, filling the inside of the brick stove. The horse loomed large and then grew small. It frowned. It grew lame. It was scorched. It heeled over. Through the flames the woman saw her freshness, her vitality and gracefulness, her love, her life and her annihilation. Translated by Maurice Left. VICTOR HAT AR LA LÉGENDE DU TROISIÈME LAPIN (Une chapitre du roman PEPITO ET PEPITA) Et voilà enfin le troisième — le vrai lapin. Dieu — qui sait tout — seul sait d’où avait bien pu sortir cette boîte à gâteaux rouge et or dont le Harpiste avait tapissé le fond d’un coussin d’herbes fines et de mousses dont on se demande bien aussi comment il se les procura si vite, de même que le clou rouillé qu’il lui avait fallu pour faire des trous dans le couvercle de cette boîte afin d’empêcher le petit brin de bête d’étouffer et un ruban d’or enfin qui complétait le tout et dont en un tour de main un artistique gros noeud double fut éclos entre scs doigts, boucle à défaut de quoi nul présent pas97 [pageend99]cal ne serait digne de ce nom. Ces préparatifs promptement achevés, toujours tambour battant, il avait une fois de plus bravé les périls nocturnes de la rue — car c’était vers les sept heures du soir quand il s’annonça dans ton pauvre boudoir de misère où —• te souviens-tu, Pépita — tu liérais ton corps à l’abandon du repos. — Qui est là? Ah, c’est vous? ! Tu remuas des chaînes et manœuvras nombre de verrous. — C’est moi Pépita. — Refermez vite la porte — fut ta réponse, mais que tu lui fis de dos, en te hâtant dans tes plusieurs épaisseurs d’habits, pantalons et vieux kimonos de misère, vers l’estrade de ton divin et majestueux divan (mais de quel meilleur nom désigner ce monument à paresser, ce trône de repos qui dans ta mansarde prenait toute la place, à ce qui fut le témoin de ta vie pendant plus de temps qu’aucun autre, et qui prit sur lui d’assumer le meilleur de toi-même ?) pour t’aller vivement replonger au chaud sous les draps — et raccrochez soigneusement les chaînes aussi, qu’arrive-t-il, Pépito, et que nous vaut cette visite en plein! territoire de nuit, dans la saison nocturne, et je dirais même presque en son milieu. . . Brr, ce froid, ce froid; Poisse, croyez-vous qu’il y ait aucun espoir que ça finisse jamais? — J’ai embrassé l’aube d’été, Pépita. — “Embrassé l’aube d’été’’? Ah bien j’comprends, mais pardon elle a drôlement l’haleine fraîche parce que moi, je sais pas mais qu’est-ce que je claque des dents. Nom d’un chien, où m’en vais-je vous mettre? Et vous comptez rentrer chez vous à cette heure-ci, qu’on ra- messe les gens qui traînent encore dehors, hé, hé, qu’est- ce que c’est que cette boîte, asseyez-vous mon ami, ce que j’apprécie, mon Dieu, votre réserve, c’est le coin comme par hasard le plus discret que vous choisissez pour vous y mettre, ne regardez pas derrière vous s’il 98 [pageend100]vous plaît, ce n’est qu’un vieux collant de ballet de quand je n’étais qu’à la maternelle, ça doit être que j’ai oublié de le ranger dans sa boîte, assurément il n’y a rien pour me séduire comme une discrétion pareille, qu’est-ce que vous mangez comme ça des yeux, Zyeux- Partout, mon ami, vos manières chevaleresques. . . Dites vite, allons, dites-moi ce qu’elle contient, cette boîte. — C’est pas comme ça qu’elle s’ouvrirait. Mais il vous suffit de l’ouvrir et comme ça vous le saurez. — Bon, c’est ça, je l’ouvre. Et je puis même dire que, dès que vous aurez fait un peu mieux connaissance avec moi, vous saurez la faveur qu’on vous fait, et si, j’ai peut-être l’air d’en exagérer l’importance, c’est que personne, et je pèse bien mes mots, personne m’entendez vous, n’est plus difficile que moi sur la question, de céder à celle-ci, ou de décerner cette autre, je veux parler de l’amitié ou quoi que ce soit, c’est une faveur, je le répète; et celle-là? où l’avez-vous dégottée, Mazette?! Elle est en or comme qui dirait ! Mon ami, il en faut beaucoup. Mais, allez, quand vous saurez ce qu’il en coûte, vous vous en mordrez les doigts, en vous repentant bien d’avoir jamais franchi mon seuil. Mon seuil, tu parles ! Quand je pense que c’est dans ce foutoir familial à Olga, la très chère, que je vous dis tout ça, chez Dédé l’honorable tonton dont je peux causer comme on cause des dieux quand ils ne sont pas là pour vous entendre : Ah, vous ne savez pas encore ce que c’est vous, que d’avoir son existence ravalée au niveau de celle du chien qu’on tolère, parce que du jour au lendemain, s’il leur en passait l’idée par la tête, ils pourraient me mettre dehors et moi, sacrée pauvre idole culbutée, cours toujours pour qu’on te réinstelle sur l’autel. . . Mais allez vous finir par vous décider à me le dire quand-même ce qu’il y a là-dedans, j’en trépigne d’impatience, ça m’excite et ça me, quelquechose a bougé Pépito ! C’est une souris ? 99 [pageend101]— Je ne dirai rien. — Faites attention, écoutez ! Vous savez bien qu’avec mon cœur hypotonique. . . Moi à la moudre secousse c’est fini, je tombe dans les pâmes. Peureuse comme je suis. . . — Ce n’est pas quelquechose qui puisse faire peur. — Qui, hem ! c’est vite dit. Moi les souris d’une part et les satyres de l’autre. Feu le père Tathuber, aux temps bénis où il y avait un théâtre, qu’il dirigeait (tempi passati) vous l’aurait bien dit lui, la crème des patrons, parce que des directeurs comme lui, ça n’existe plus, et c’est à jamais que je garderai, serti dans un cadre de prières car d’or je n’ai plus, tout ce qui me reste étant des reçus du mont-de-piété, son cher nom, car si j’en avais je porterais là, oui là, son souvenir dans un encadrement aussi pur que lui; de tous les directeurs c’est le seul à ma connaissance, et dans toute l’histoire du théâtre, quand je l’ai connu il avait déjà atteint évidemment un âge assez avancé mais, comme vous pensez bien, je n’ai pas attaché plus d’importance qu’ils n’en valaient à tous les ragots chuchotés entre elles par les petites cocottes affiliées à la mère Talia notre belle muse, ces cabotines, ces salopes (holà vous, n’allez pas m’apprendre à vous servir de ces mots-là) et pour ce qui est de cette petite des choeurs eh bien mais c’est tout simplement des jaloux qui l’avaient montée contre lui, mais oui, (le grand air de la calomnie, vous connaissez la chanson) le seul, vous m’entendez, qui ne vous fît pas signer vos contrats sur un plumard et, à l’exception d’une de ses protégées, une fille des chœurs assez malencontreusement engrossée par lui à qui d’ailleurs il versa jusqu’à sa mort une pension, il n’ a jamais, je dis: jamais abusé d’une situation ce doux, ce bon, ce brave père Tathuber, ni profité de sa position, mais alors là avec personne, même pas moi, bien que pourtant. Mais moi je vous le dis, en attendant, il ne faudrait 100 [pageend102]pas que quelqu’un s’avise de me palper, ne serait-ce qu’en pensée, ou de me caresser le (mais vous, ce ne sont pas des mots à dire, fi donc) le cul avec des yeux humides, c’est-à-dire que j’entends, bien sûr, du regard, comme à Lovrana, à l’hôtel, ce répugnant de satyre, ce voyeur, j’aimerais un peu voir ça parce que je vous assure que si quelqu’un osait me faire ça, il s’en repentirait, hein, il pourrait toujours aller se faire voir ailleurs, foutre ailleurs, l’individu qui oserait me refaire ça encore une fois, et même une demie fois, et puis qu’on n’en parle plus; c’est qu’à la fin moi j’en ai jusque là de cette foutue pourriture, foutue c’est bien le mot, de cette clique de parasites de la scène, tout ce tas de gorets, ah ! ils sont encore même bien trop bas pour qu’on leur chie dessus . . . Mais ça fi donc . . . ces mots- là ne sont pas faits pour votre bouche . . . gardez vous de les retenir et qui plus est . . . Oh ! Ho-ho : Oh ! un pptit lapinot-pinot . . . Oho ! un pp’tit pinousse ! — Et Joyeuses Pâques, Pépita. — C’est un vrai? — Tout ce qu’il y a de vrai, Pépita. C’est même le seul, puisque voué voulez tout savoir, vrai petit lapin que j’aie pu voir de tout le marché. — Et c’est pour moi, ce seul vrai-là? ! Pépito! Mieux eût valu . . . Ne vaudrait-il pas mieux . . . une autre —enfin, c’est pas possible, je ne puis croire qu’il n’y ait personne qui vous soit plus proche, il y sûrement quelqu’un, ce n’est pas pour me mêler de votre vie privée, mais . . . Mais c’est un conte de fées, guili-gouli, mon lapounard ! Et c’est comme par hasard justement à moi, qui ne suis pas celle-là, qui n’y avais droit en rien et à aucun titre et qui, souvenez-vous toujours de ce que je vous dis là, qui ne l’aurai jamais: Vous avez bien réfléchi, vous êtes vraiment sûr que c’est bien pour moi ? ! — C’est pour vous, Pépita. 101 [pageend103]—Oh, comme vous êtes tellement trop gentil. Oh, ephèbe céleste ! Elu d’Israël ! Sachez que si je n’étais pas la grosse mocheté, la vieille potelée que je suis, eh bien je vous danserais autour pour vous faire fête. Jeune David; va ! — Je suis euh ... heureux, de vous voir ... heureuse... —• Mon gamin chéri ... Je vous appartiens corps et âme . . . Vous m’avez toute prise ... Je ne suis plus moi . . . Oh ! Mon envoûteur, mon ami, mon tout. Lapin- perlinpinpin ! Oh, mon doux Seigneur Jésus, mon p’tit lap, mon pi-pineux, mon pin-pineur, si j’avais encore mon jardin !... Ah ! mes promenades dans les allées . . . Dans les azalées ... Et ces flâneries ... de rocher en rocher, dire que c’est comme si c’était encore hier, ah ! ... le jardin et tout, lâ-haut, Rue-aux-Anémones, j’avais encore un chez-moi décent, en ce temps-là, pour recevoir les gens, et puis quant-au jardin . . . Ah ! mes vagabondages sur les parterres, les pieds tapis dans des mules docrées, et les coussins de mousses où il fait si bon s’asseoir, et toutes, et toutes ces choses, et décor comme vous, pauvre de vous, mais vous n’avez jamais rien pu connaître de pareil, même en songe ! et ce public en or à mes pieds tous les soirs, et des bouquets en veux- tu en voilà ! et que j’étais encore une honnête femme . . . — Voyons Pépita . . . — Quand je repense que je faisais venir tout spécialement de Suisse mes pousses de gazon, sélectionnés une par une . . . — Mais, Pépita chérie, voyons ce n’est pas pour vous faire pleurer que j’avais voulu vous l’apporter. —• Veuillez n’oser jamais employer ce mot de chérie avec moi, je vous l’interdis, compris? C’est votre patte d’homme qui s’avance, celà déjà, votre vilaine patte d’homme qui en veut. Et je ne puis le souffrir. — Bon, je n’ai rien dit, rien de rien et, si vous voulez bien m’en donner la permission, je retire même ce 102 [pageend104]rien-là; seulement, n’ayez pas de la peine, autrement je le remporte moi, le petit lapin. — Et aujourd’hui, tout ça c’est fini, envolé, escamoté, et je ne suis plus qu’un déchet, si misérable, mais si misérable, une abandonnée, une proscrite, une carcasse plus bonne à rien — et c’est maintenant qu’un inconnu, car ne serait-ce qu’hier vous n’étiez encore qu’un inconnu pour moi . . . voilà qu’un inconnu s’amène, qui est venu pour me faire à moi, à qui une chose pareille n’était jamais encore arrivée, jamais de la vie, cette joie, cette fête, ce cadeau de Pâques, et alors moi, je chiale; non, oh, désormais non at non : Où diable ai-je bien pu laisser traîner mon mouchoir, permettez-moi de vous parler à coeur ouvert, permettez-le . . . Toute ma vie, toujours, tant qu’ il en restera un seul atome en moi, je m’en ressouviendrai, toujours, toujours, je vous consacre solennelement mon ami, je vous jure fidélité, je n’exige rien en retour, je ne vous demande même pas . . . —• Pépita ! — Pépito ! Alors ça vous plaît donc, de vous faire le chien errant d’une chienne errante, ça vous dit quel- quechose de devenir ça? ! C’est ça que vous aviez rêvé? ! D’une chienne galeuse ? ! Lapou-papou ! Loupinou- lopinet, lapinoulet ! Lapus-lapus ! Vron ! Cette oreille sans pareille, qui fait a claque comm’des p’tits pouces ! — Vous allez le faire mourir, si vous le mangez de baisers à ce point. — Mais non, mais non; mais non, mais non ! Nous n’allons pas mourir, dis ? ! C’est pas vrai ! Hop-là ! Hop- là ! Que nous sautons haut ! Il vous sauterait le Kilimandjaro, miam, miam. Oui je le mangerai. Parfaitement. Et ham, et ham. Pilim, pilim, pinlinpinpin ! Ce que je l’aime. C’est affreux ! Je suis dangerouse; méfiez-vous, vous savez; je peux bien m’en confiier à vous, un intime. C’est ma fatalité. Ces oranges de caresses. Et celà, vous autres, c’est ou bien que vous ne pouvez pas, ou bien 103 [pageend105]que vous ne savez pas : l’apprécier. Pline-pline, pomme de lapin, pom-pom ! C’est un mâle? Regardez moi comme il rougit jusqu’aux cheveux, mon aumônier principal. Il n’a même pas cherché à le savoir, le saint homme. Celà ne l’a pas intéressé. Eh bien moi, je m’en vais regarder, et pas plus tard que tout de suite. Hè ! bien sûr que c’est un mâle. Poussi-poussa ! Pilim-polom ! La- pinlinpin ! — J’irai lui cueillir de l’herbe, et du pissenlit, au petit lapin, hein Pépita? — Il va de soit qu’il lui faut donner un nom en votre honheur. . . J’ai trouvé ! je vais l’appeler Pitit-Popipépi- tolinus — (comme vous !) ma petite mascotte, et voilà, comme ça vous serez avec moi tout le temps. . . A propos d’aller à l’herbe, vous me faites penser qu’il est temps! que je vous donne la clef des champs. Je vois que vous vous apprêtez à partir, et je ne voudrais pas vous retenir. . . — Moi, Pépita ? — Oui, oui, faites comme si l’on vous mettait à la porte. Depuis si longtemps je menais une vie sans émotions, sans rien, et maintenant que d’un seul coup. . . Non, réellement je ne pourrais pas me le pardonner; savez-vous qu’avec votre infinie bonté vous m’avez si littéralement ravie, vous m’avez si totalement livrée à vous-même, que je ne saurais plus répondre de moi- même; ainsi donc, plutôt que nous fassions une bêtise irréparable. . . — Mais, chère et belle Pépita, maintenant? N’est-il pas plus de neuf heures, vous n’entendez pas les coups de feu ? ! Cette rafale ! La patrouille russe ! Ça ! Vous avez entendu ? ! —■ Que voulez-vous de plus? qu’attendez-vous d’autre de moi ? je suis déjà, en toute soumission, agenouillée comme une esclave aux pieds de la merveilleuse personne, du dispensateur de joie que vous êtes, et vous 104 [pageend106]vomiriez encore que par-dessus le marché je vous traite en héros, parce que je vous renvoie, et que dehors il pleut des balles? — Vous n’avez même pas un petit minimum d’inquiétudes sur ce qui pourrait m’arriver? Tenez, je vous fais la promesse solennelle. . . — Chut !.. — Ta main s’était jetée aux lèvres du Harpiste pour les reclore sur ses promesses — encore un mot et nous sommes perdus. Je ne veux pas que vous me disiez chère, jamais non plus que vous me trouvez belle, ni que vous me touchiez jamais, même pas que vous m’effleuriez, et je m’en vais d’ailleurs vous poser sur un piédestal digne de vos qualités angéliques, vous mettre au sommet d’une colonne de sainteté, si haut que vous en attraperez la vertige, oui. Il faut ça, il faut ça, soyez un saint, soyez-le. Et sachez que moi ce n’est pas mon affaire de corrompre les saints, surtout ceux qui vont à Pâques porter des petits lapins aux actrices; et maintenant filez, filez vite, je vous ouvre séance tenante, je ne vois pas d’inconvénient, au contraire, à ce que demain on se voie à l’heure du café à la Potinière de l’hôtel Ambrosia, dans la dernière loge, tout au fond, mais trouvez-vous autre chose à vous nouer au cou que cette especè de cravate, ce péril jaune, a-t-on jamais vu. . . Euh ! oui, restez une minute, je crois que, non je ne dois pas l’avoir ici, c’est à une de couleur brique que je pensais qui m’était restée de mon mari Oscar, une à pois, mais qu’importe : en outre touchez du bois, c’est demain matin que ça se décide et j’en ai déjà le trouillo- mètre à zéro. . . — Touchez-en vous aussi pour que je rentre sain et sauf. Mon trouillomètre à moi, Pépita, il est bloqué pour ce soir. —• Ah ! Mon Dieu ! Mon Dieu ! Pourquoi m’as-tu chargée de cette croix, encore? Le jour viendra, oui, un jour, 105 [pageend107]beaucoup plus tard, que vous me baiserez, me baiserez les mains en guise de merci, que vous me serez reconnaissante pour vous épargner la collection de choses pas belles que je suis; merci encore pour le lapin, et pour cette belle soirée, vous n’aurez pas plus tôt passé l’entrée, que moi. . . Et maintenant partez, celà ne vous regarde déjà plus. Je m’en vais pleurer tout mon saoul, ça me soulagera. . . . . .Te souviens-tu Pépita, te souviens-tu? ANSLAVS EGLITIS THE GOLD COIN Peter Florins was sitting in the very bowels of a cargo ship, way down below the water-line. The iron walls of the deep, capacious hold were beaded with moisture. On bits of planks, tops of packing-cases, spread-out newspapers, and on the rusty floor itself, men were squatting, sprawling, tightly wedged together, battling with sleep. The ship was overcrowded, there were so many refugees on board that every inch of space was occupied. A large light-bulb shed a harsh glare over the men who had shielded their eyes from it as best they could, with a cap, hat, or scarf, or by drawing their heads deep into their collars or covering their eyes with their hands. It was night. There was no talking or 106 [pageend108]whispering even in the corners, the only sound to be heard was the dull, monotonous drone of the ship’s engines which sent a continuous shiver through the huge hull whose iron responded to it with a quiet buzzing and humming. The men slept, slumped forward, sunk back, curled up into a ball. Only Peter Plorins stared with unseeing eyes into vacancy. Now and then he clasped his hands round his shoulders or elbows as though to make sure that this person really was himself, and that everything he saw and felt was not merely a bad dream. But the fact remained that he was a refugee, without possessions, without a country, without an aim. Strangely enough, he was not overcome by the crushing despair he might have expected to feel. It surprised him also that the disaster which had befallen a whole nation did not seem to touch him, and that all his thoughts revolved solely around his own personal misfortunes. Plorins did not know that nature can be very wise. It would have paralysed his will to go on living if he had grasped the full extent of his country’s ruin, the plight of the towns laid waste in battle, and the distress of people escaping with their bare lives and fleeing, fleeing everywhere. Instinctively, his mind dwelt only on his own sorry lot and trivial worries. Farmer Plorins was setting out towards an unknown fate, with nothing but his knapsack which had been filled with provisions by kindly folk in whose farmhouse he had spent the last night in his own country. A wave of bitterness rose into his throat. Other refugees on the ship sat behind stacks of bundles and suitcases, and wooden crates full of additional belongings had been stored away with the cargo, whereas he himself did not even have a clean shirt to change into. The coat he wore was old and threadbare, his short new fur coat had been left behind in the cart. His boots 107 [pageend109]were in need of repair, but the tall new boots had also been left in the cart. Everything had been left in the cart, while the cart itself. . . . It had all happened only because of the kindness of his heart: Florins had wanted to give his aunt a helping hand. Fie was already fleeing in a cart piled high with possessions when he heard that the tenant of his aunt’s farm had left without her. He immediately turned and drove back although the horizon was alive with the flash and rumble of gun-fire and everyone driving in the opposite direction called him mad. Florins had not seen his aunt for five or six years, and it gave him a shock to find her lying on a high featherbed, sunk back into a heap of pillows. Dreadfully emaciated, whiter almost than her sheets, she greeted him with a smile which unpleasant!}' puckered up her skin into a circle of fine, sharp wrinkles around the thin-lipped mouth with its few remaining teeth. Although Florins knew that she had been ill for a long time he had not realized the gravity of her condition, but now he could tell at a glance that her days were numbered. His aunt’s old maidservant volubly assured him that she would never leave her good, kind mistress, so help her God, and prepared to launch out into a Ibng, detailed account of ailments past and present, but Florins was in no mood to listen. “Why did you let the tenant go off with all the horses?” he shouted at her. “There’s no room in my cart. You’re lucky if I can squeeze in a sackful of belongings and perhaps a wooden chest!” “Don’t make such a fuss, my dear—anyway, I don’t want to go today, my back is aching, I’ve a stabbing pain in my sides. . .” “What on earth are you talking about? There isn’t a moment to lose! Don’t you hear the guns? Hurry up,” he turned to the old maid-servant, “put the pillows on the cart, for your mistress to sit on !” 108 [pageend110]"I don’t want to go in a cart, my dear. Think of the rattling and shaking ! A car, yes, that would be different. Get a car, and we’ll go!” ‘‘Where am I to get a car? The Russians are here, on the other side of the wood!” ‘‘Well, I won’t go, then. I’m in no hurry. These will get me anywhere, any time—” slipping her thin, blue- veined hand under the pillows, she pulled out a small bag. ‘‘Look, here are horses, here’s a car, here’s everything ! When I feel like going I’ll travel like a real lady.” She unfastened the bag and showed it to Florins. Gold ! Tsarist five-rouble pieces! Fifty of them, perhaps even a hundred. Who would have thought that the old woman was so rich? The little bag contained a veritable fortune. His aunt hid her treasure away and sank back into the pillows, exhausted. ‘‘You won’t come with me, then?” he asked for the last time. ‘‘No, not today,” she answered with a superior smile. ‘‘First I’ll have a nice long rest, and then I’ll see how I feel about it.” Plorins still wanted to argue with her, but the din of the firing had increased and shells were already exploding close-by. He hurriedly took his leave, flung himself into the cart, and drove off at a gallop. He had barely reached the highroad when a piece of shrapnel killed his horse. Somebody shouted that Russian tanks were moving up behind the garden. Plorins made an instantaneous dash for the bushes by the roadside. After running a couple of miles he encountered a Latvian army truck, and it took him to the port of Liepaja which had not yet fallen into Russian hands. And now, together with other refugees, he was sitting in the bowels of a cargo ship. 109 [pageend111]His heart smarting with bitterness, lie reflected on his state of poverty. It wouldn’t have hurt his aunt to have given him some of her gold coins. .She knew well enough that he was leaving for a foreign land. With a few gold roubles in his hand, he would have had a much easier mind while he was racing through those bushes. Before embarking, he might at least have bought some of the things he needed most. After all, gold was gold. Really, his aunt ought to have known better, she ought to have rewarded him for his good intentions, for the fearlessness with which he had rushed to her rescue In spite of people’s warnings and with no thought for himself. Besides, what use was that money to a woman at death’s door ? She would barely draw her last breath before the gold five-roubles were pulled out from under her pillows by the old maid-servant who had so devoutly sworn not to leave her mistress, and who had never once opened her mouth to persuade her to leave with Plorins. And if that old woman did not appropriate the money the Russians were sure to do so. Suddenly the thought flashed through Plorins’ mind that it had in fact been his duty to take the money. It was madness, it was criminal to have left it to the enemy.—-No, no, this was going too far! It would have been vile to steal from a sick old woman, his own relative, and to deprive her of the one hope which was keeping her alive. He was quite incapable of ever doing such a thing, and that was why the thought of robbing his aunt had never struck him until this moment. Plorins shifted his position on his piece of plank, curled up more comfortably, gave a little push to his neighbour who was leaning heavily against him, and tried to will himself to sleep. He tried in vain. The moment he closed his eyes he saw his aunt’s bloodless face before him, her repugnant self-satisfied smile, and the bony hand holding out the 110 [pageend112]little bag of coins. ‘Why didn’t you take it, you fool?’ she mumbled. Plorins sighed. What nonsense his aunt had talked: she was going to buy a horse, hire a car, even from the Russians themselves if need be. Gold was all-powerful, she had said. What wild, irresponsible talk! From the Russians, indeed ! Could she really have been in her right mind? No, of course not. He had abandoned a fortune to a dying madwoman, a woman past feeling or understanding. A quick snatch, a shriek, and he’d have been off in a flash. And now he’d be rich and—contemptible. Plorins sat up and rubbed his forehead. Yes, he was a fool! What was the use of pondering and lamenting over something that was gone past recall ? The Russians had overrun the part of the country where his aunt had her farm. And that was that. There was no more to be said. Heaving a deep sigh, he dropped his face in hisj hands and fell asleep. But the very next instant he started up, hot all over. He, Peter Plorins, was his aunt’s sole heir! It had been his gold, his Tsarist five-roubles. He had abandoned his own money, his own fortune—he had thrown away the just reward of a blameless, hard-working life. A few days earlier or later made no difference, he ought to have stepped into his rightful inheritance when he had the chance. His aunt was sure to be dead by now. WTith a groan, Plorins once again settled down to sleep. It must have been about four o’clock. Some of the men were already beginning to sit up and rummage in their belongings. Plorins’ neighbour, a tall and very thin old man, pulled out a stale piece of rye bread and started to breakfast on it. To escape his thoughts and nightmares, Plorins busied himself with his knapsack. He extracted from it some pork, butter, white bread, 111 [pageend113]tomatoes, opened his pocket knife, and suddenly encountered the old man’s timidly envious glance. “Have you nothing at all to put on your bread ?” “You know how it is when one packs in a hurry,’’ the old man said wearily. “I had a jar full of bacon fat, but I must have left it behind in Liepaja. There are many things I forgot.” Plorins looked' at him more closely. The old man’s coat was as shabby as his own, and his big hands bore the marks of hard work. Plorins offered him his pot of butter, cut him a large slice of pork, and added two tomatoes. When the old man had finished eating he gratefully stroked Plorins’ arm: “Thank you, son!” “Arc you travelling alone?” Plorins asked. “Yes, alone. My boy is in the army. My daughter is married, and she has left with her family. That is why I took only as much as 1 can carry. It will last me for what is left of my life.” He pointed to two smallish sacks which were strapped together, in such a way that he could carry the one on his back and the other in front. ‘Poor old man,’ Plorins thoght. ‘What am I complaining about? I’m young and strong, I can easily earn a living and buy all I need.’ He moved a little away from him, to give him more space. The old man was settling down to sleep again, and as he wrapped himself up he inadvertently struck Plorins’ hand a painful blow with the bottom of his coat. Plorins did not say anything, and the old man dozed off, leaning against his two sacks. ‘That’s how it is in this world,’ Plorins grumbled to himself. ‘You run to save your aunt, and you lose a fortune; you feed the hungry, and you get a rap over the knuckles. But how can a blow with the edge of a coat be so painful? It felt like a stone.’ Assuring himself that the old man was sound asleep, Plorins reached out his hand and fingered the hem of the coat. 112 [pageend114]His hand shot back as if scalded. Casting furtive glances about him, he again fingered the hem and then the front edge of the coat. The old man moved in his sleep, and Plorins drew back. It was money 1 Hard, round disks, exactly the size of Tsarist five-roubles, one beside the other—and a whole stack of them up the front edge on the right-hand side of the coat! His anger and resentment returned with redoubled force. The world was full of scoundrels, cheats, and heartless brutes. Choking with bitterness, he thought of the old man whose coat was crammed full of gold but who was not ashamed to accept meat and butter from him, Plorins, who was utterly destitute. Yes, it was only too true: to him that hath shall be given, and from him that hath not shall be taken away. The old man was even more evil and repulsive than Plorins’ aunt. He looked at him with distaste. A miser if ever there was one ! The skin of his face sagged like a grey rag, and the mouth with its shrunken lips gaped like a hole torn into it. He was probably about seventy, perhaps even older. The bags under his eyes were a sign of diseased kidneys, and his unwholesome breath meant that he had a bad stomach. There was a wheezing and rattling in his chest. His racking cough struggled upwards from deep inside him. A breeding-ground of diseases. How long could he hope to survive in unaccustomed surroundings? At most, half a year. But he was laden with money like the Devil himself, and he would never be able to spend it, nor would he even want to do so. With fear, revulsion and sorrow, Plorins caught himself on the brink of conceiving a terrible idea: to rob the old man. Shrinking into himself, broken and despairing, the farmer cudgelled his brains wondering how he could have fallen a prey to such an abominable impulse. 113 [pageend115]Never before had he noticed any evil tendencies within himself. He had spent all his life in rather straitened circumstances, it had taken him years of hard work to wrest his acres from virgin soil, and he had not even found time to marry. He had always paid his farmhands and day-labourers more than the agreed wages. Yes, and he had never in his life told a real lie, at least not the kind of lie that would have been profitable to himself. And now, when he ought to feel nothing but pity and love for his fellow-refugees—why did he now have to suffer like this? Thank goodness, he was no longer in a position to wrong his aunt, but why, why had fate sent him this old man with all the gold sewn up in his coat ? Could it perhaps be that fate was giving him another chance, considering how virtuous he had been and how his honesty had prevented him from grasping that first opportunity of enriching himself? There, quite close to him, was the corner of the old man’s coat, threadbare, stained with rust; who would have thought that it contained a whole fortune, a lifetime’s happiness? Poor Plorins felt his hands beginning to twitch and tremble. He raised his head and found himself looking straight into the old man’s inflamed eyes. The old fellow was not asleep after all! Could he have noticed anything ? But the old man merely shook his head and said: “Why do you look at me so sadly, son? Yes, I know, you are thinking about us and how poor we are, you and I—the poorest people on the ship. You have nothing, and I haven’t anything cither.” ‘What a hypocrite !’ Plorins thought, and asked : “Surely you’ve seen better days, haven’t you?” “Of course, of course,” the old man’s face momentarily brightened. “But what is the use—everything passes. Before the First World War, at the time of the Tsar, I was well off. I had my own saddlery in Liepaja, with 114 [pageend116]four apprentices working under me. Yes, I did very well in those days.” ‘Ah, that’s when he amassed the gold five-roubles,’ Plorins thought. ‘‘But I was unlucky after the war,” the old man continued. ‘‘I never again had a saddlery of my own. 1 worked as an assistant in a shoe shop and then as a shoemaker. I earned my daily bread, and that was all. Now I no longer care what happens. I am near the end of my life.” ‘Near the end of his life, but hoarding his money, the skinflint,’ Plorins thought angrily. ‘He’ll die with the money still inside his coat, and it will fall into the hands of another old scarecrow who’ll have no idea what to do with it and who won’t need it anyway. Lord, the many uses such money might be put to ! A charitable fund for refugees might be established. . . If the old fellow had been a man of honour he’d have taken me aside after that big breakfast I gave him, and he’d have said : Here you are, son, take it—no, not just one but five gold coins—you’re so good and kind, and what am I to do with the money, I’m an old man. . . But such things happen only in stories! ’ It was already day. The men kept scrambling up the steep iron ladder to visit their wives and children who were travelling steerage, and to get a breath of fresh air after the night deep down in the hold. The old man also made ready to go. ‘‘Take off your coat, it will be easier to climb up without it,” Plorins suggested in a shaky voice. ‘‘No, no, I can’t leave my coat behind. What if it gets lost ?” “I’ll look after it. I’ll stay down here.” “No, I won’t take off my coat. You can look after my bundles, son.” ‘He’ll never leave his coat, not he !’ Plorins thought 115 [pageend117]with a knowing smile as he assisted the old man in his laborious ascent on the narrow iron ladder and once more fingered the hem of his coat. Yes, its front edge was bulging with money. At one point, as it knocked against the ladder, it made a delightful jingling sound, and the old man hurriedly drew the coat more tightly about himself. As Plorins resumed his seat and leaned against the old man’s sacks he felt he was beyond salvation. At lunch-time, the old man again eyed the farmer’s knapsack while his horny hands toyed with a bit of stale bread. Plorins opened his knapsack wide, exhibiting the large freshly smoked sausage which lay curled up at its very bottom. ‘Let him eat,’ he thought, ‘let him stuff himself to bursting-point, the old carrion crow, he doesn’t know how dear he’s going to pay for it!’ It gave him an odd sensation to regale his victim. The old man ate heartily, in fact he practically ate enough for two. When Plorins heard that there was broth to be got in the galley he spared no pains to procure some for his companion; he made his way up to the steerage deck, wandered along endless corridors, stood in a long queue, and finally returned with a large mug of steaming hot broth. “Thank you, son, thank you ! God Himself must have sent you to me,” the old man prattled happily. “How can I ever repay yeu? I wish I had something to give you, at least something to remember me by. But I have nothing, only old clothes and a quilt.” Plorins gritted his teeth. Old clothes and a quilt ! Oh, the hypocrite, oh, the miser of misers ! Truly, it was no sin to rob such a man. When it was time for the evening meal Plorins opened his one tin of sardines and gave the old man tea sweetened with sugar. He spread his own coat over him; he gave up his seat to him so that the skinflint should have 116 [pageend118]more room to stretch out his legs. In a word, he looked after him as if the old fellow were his own father. The old man was much moved by these attentions, he shed tears of gratitude and declared that even his own children had never taken half so much trouble over him as Plorins, a stranger, had done. Yet he wrapped his shabby coat as carefully as ever round bis long legs, the miser. His heart turning harder than stone, Plorins thought of the moment when, with a perfectly easy mind, he would teach that confirmed hypocrite a lesson. If a speck of dust should'mar his shining good conscience it would be more than compensated by his present kindness and generosity. Night fell, and again there was no sound in the crowded hold but a light snoring and an occasional grunt which were swallowed up by the dull, steady drone of the ship’s engines. Everyone was asleep except Plorins who perched on the ladder, supporting his heavy head first with one hand and then with the other, and devising various schemes for stealing the gold five-roubles. In the morning, the ship arrived at Gotenhafen. With crumpled clothes, haggard faces and reddened eyes, the refugees crowded the decks, but it took all day before the cargo was unloaded and they themselves were sorted out into groups. Many of them wanted to stay on at Gotenhafen or Danzig, others made readj- to travel farther inland, and the rest were waiting to be taken to refugee camps. Peter Plorins belonged to the latter group. When he emerged from the depths of the hold into the crisp morning air and felt a fresh sea breeze ruffle his hair it seemed to him like an escape from purgatory. The sun was rising above the autumnal gold of the trees on the hilly shores which lay in a graceful semi-circle alxmt the port. Its light twinkled on the masts of the ships, danced on the crests of the frisking waves, and 117 [pageend119]finally reached Plorins himself. Merciful heavens, what dreadful thoughts he had been thinking those two nights down there, in the bowels of the ship ! Nothing but robbing, stealing, inheriting, grabbing and grasping ! Why ? What for? Here was a new world opening out before him, drenched in sunlight, with people hurrying, working, struggling; surely there would be room in it also for him. As to that pitiful old man and his money—let him go in peace ! Plorins no longer felt even the faintest regret at having squandered all his provisions on him to no purpose at all. But he had no wish to see him again. Plunging into the crowd, he made his way to the opposite end of the ship. Plorins spent the whole day standing by the winches, admiring the skill with which the sailors handled the crates and the luggage, watching the freight trains come and go, and gazing at the people milling about on the shore. Huge shadowy ships loomed up through the haze on the open sea, their outlines sharpening as they slowly approached the port, until they finally came floating in like stately palaces, saluting the shore with long banners of black smoke and sedately settling down at their moorings. Plorins stood and gazed, glad that his evil thoughts had all vanished away. But he felt a stab of pain every time he started to rejoice in the beautiful sights around him. Gone were the days when he might have said lightheartedly : “Yes, true enough, you’ve got some good things—but so have we ! Your port may be very modern—but our port of Riga is much bigger than yours!’’ He was like a tree with severed roots, dead timber drifting on the tides. The setting sun finally dipped below the misty horizon. From the streets, and from the lanes between the warehouses, the evening twilight spread across the quay and climbed the hilly shore to envelop the town itself. At 118 [pageend120]regular intervals, the increasingly bright beam from the big lighthouse pierced the deepening dusk. Blue lights appeared on the masts of newly arrived ships; the work of loading and unloading continued all through the night. People looked like ghosts in that bluish light, their faces an eerie yellow, and their eyes sunk into pools of darkness; their movements seemed as jerky as those of automatons. Here and there, overhead lighting or the beam of a searchlight picked out part of the crowd and the piles of their belongings in such brilliant relief that every gesture and movement stood out sharply defined and clearly visible. But the moment people stepped outside the protective radius of light they were swallowed up by the darkness which was everywhere, lying in wait, black as pitch, threatening to increase its hold on the light. The group to which he belonged at last moved forward. They disembarked and made their way to the train which stood waiting in the dark. Plorins had scarcely set foot on the shore when somebody clutched at his elbow—it was the old man. His face seemed to give out a ghostly light, and as he stood there, panting, his mouth more than ever resembled a hole torn into an old rag. “Where have you been, son? I’ve been looking for you/ all day. How good that I’ve found you at last! Don’t let me lose you again—it’s hard to be without a friend in a strange place.’’ Beads of perspiration broke out on Plorins’ brow. Was there to be no end to his nightmare? Desperate, he plunged into the throng of people, pushing and elbowing his way through them in the dark, almost at a run, aiming for the opposite end of the long train. Plorins made headway—he had his hands free, and the knapsack on his back w’as practically empty. 119 [pageend121]All along the train there was a panting, struggling mass of refugees, lifting and carrying their numerous heavy belongings into the compartments. Their nerves on edge, excited by the darkness, they shouted and quarrelled; children were crying, hushed and scolded by the women. Electric torches gleamed here and there like glow-worms, and in their pallid light the general tussle seemed even more frantic and disorderly. Plorins stopped. He had reached the end of the train. “Son !” a voice spoke in'his ear. “Son, let’s go round to the other side of the train ! We’ll get in more easily there.” The old man was gasping and wheezing, yet he had managed to keep up with Plorins in spite of the sacks he was carrying. He grasped the farmer by the hand and pulled him into the pitch-black night behind the train. A dreadful shudder passed through Peter Plorins. His muscles went as taut as bow-strings. Was it fate, or was it the Devil himself who would not let him go ? He gnashed his teeth and gripped the old man round the waist; surprised at his own strength, he tossed him up the high steps like a feather and pushed him into the train. But the front corner of the man’s coat remained in Plorins’ grip. The door slammed on it. A sudden wrench—he had torn off the piece with the gold coins. The old man cried out. Plorins leaped back into the night. He ran, stumbling, tripping up over points and railway lines. He ran faster even than he had done when racing through those bushes at home: then, he had fled only from the Russians, but now he was running away from himself. He ran until he had no breath left in his body. Running, he dug his nails into the strip torn from the old man’s coat, and prised the lining away from the cloth. The money slipped, jingling, into his hand; he caught it so carefully that not one coin escaped through 120 [pageend122]his fingers. Somewhere, at his feet, he caught a glimpse of water, threw the strip of cloth into it, and ran on. At last he reached the outskirts of the town. The lamps at the street corners shed a dim blue light. A street-car with blacked-out windows came to a halt beside Plorins. It was half empty, and he jumped in. Rattling and jolting, it hurriedly resumed its journey. Huddled up in a corner, Plorins opened his hand. He held a fistful of blue ten-pfennig pieces.—The old man must have had a hole in his pocket, and from there they had slipped behind' the lining of his coat. “Your fare, please! Twenty pfennigs!” The conductor, seeing that Plorins neither saw nor heard, took two coins from his trembling hand. (Translated from the Latvian by Ruth Speirs) JUDAH WATEN UNCLE ISAAC My sister and I spent a^year away from home. It was when Mother was sick in hospital and convalescent home and Father was working in the country. Our bits of furniture were stored and we were boarded with a childless couple some streets away from where we lived. We called the pair “uncle” and “auntie” and in some remote way they were related to us on our mother’s side. I don’t suppose they were more than 38 or so but we regarded them as old. Uncle Isaac was a little, fat man with a remarkable fund of odd bits of information. Any 121 [pageend123]sort of conversation was an invitation for him to bring forth his knowledge. If Auntie Fanny mentioned the price of fish he would ask us if we knew that sharks had more than one set of teeth. Uncle Isaac was always busy. He was for ever absorbed in his second-hand business in the city and he rarely spent much time in the house. But every evening after tea he spent a while in the dining-room. He would produce a ledger book and with great rapidity enter figures, adding and substracting out loud. Finished, he went to the mirror on the wall, stared at himself for a brief moment, arranged his tie, patted his fat cheeks, smoothed his greying, curly hair, and said in a serious voice, “Isaac, you must rest now.” Turning to me he said: “In Spain they have siestas after lunch, I have mine after tea. Do you know why they have siestas in Spain?” I can’t remember just why they have siestas in Spain but Uncle Isaac certainly told me. His own siesta was a hurried one. He lay down for barely a quarter of an hour and when he opened his eyes he stretched himself with pleasure, rose from the sofa and said, “Now I’m as fresh and lively as a two-year-old.” And out he went again. I was never sure whether he was going on business or to visit friends. He was not like any other head of a household I had ever known, he was like a boarder in the house. Auntie Fanny lived her own life, never commenting on her husband’s whirlwind comings and goings. Just as he was always in a hurry with only time to spare for imparting bits of information, she was always slow and measured in her movements and as grave and orderly as a religious service. Apart from her housework, over which she spent hours every day so that every floor shone with polish and every doorknob gleamed, Auntie Fanny daily sat in her rocking chair 122 [pageend124]and crocheted baby clothes for this woman or that in the neighbourhood. There was a time and place for everything in her house. We rose at the same hour every morning, we ate our meals at the same time every day. The merest trifle had its own place. There were cupboards for this and that, racks and shelves everywhere; it was maddening for my sister and me. And Uncle Isaas sympathised with us and he said that if there were children in the house all the time this order would never last. The Sabbath was an awesome day for us. Auntie Fanny was a very pious lady and she never allowed us out of her sight on this day. She was afraid Uncle Isaac wanted to entice me out of her hands and take me to the city. He sinned by driving his sulky on the Sabbath but she was determined to make sure I did not share in his sin. After synagogue and lunch, when Uncle Isaac disappeared from the house, Auntie Fanny read to us from her favourite parts of the Bible; the story of the captivity of the Jews in Egypt and the story of her favourite prophet, Jeremiah. Only at sunset did she let us go out of the house for a short stroll in the street. Our evening meal over, Auntie Fanny entertained guests in the sitting-room. There was Madame Koch, the retired midwife, a retinue of old ladies, and widow or two. I was never allowed into the company and I was even afraid to put my ear to the keyhole. There seemed something mysterious and frightening about the conversation within. Rare words occasionally did penetrate the door and wall. They were about births, and deaths, about deceased parents and the vanished past. Once Uncle Isaac came home unexpectedly and took me and my sister into the sitting-room. He wanted to show us off in front of the ladies. And I daresay he wanted them to see how well cared-for we were, so 123 [pageend125]that the news could be spread through the community. But Uncle Isaac took one look round the room and whispered to me so that all could hear: “A cheerful assembly, eh?” An old lady looked up sharply and said ironically. ‘‘Perhaps if you joined us you would make things more lively.” “Nothing I could say would make you any more cheerful,” he replied gravely. I could see that Uncle Isaac was no favourite in this company. Then one of the women without looking in his direction, said sneeringly : “I’m! sure it wouldn’t do the menfolk any harm if they spent a little more time with their wives.” “If I had a family perhaps I’d take your advice,” said Uncle Isaac weakly. He suddenly went red in the face at his own words. From his expression I was sure he would have gladly bitten off his tongue. He hurried us out of the room without speaking another word. It was not long after that I overheard a strange conversation betwen Uncle Isaac and Auntie Fanny. They were whispering together in the kitchen and the words that floated through the half-closed door that separated me from them made me listen intently. “The beginning of December I think. I saw the midwife, Mrs. Mendelsohn, today,” Auntie Fanny said. Her voice was agitated and Uncle Isaac coughed nervously. But they talked no more about the matter. Soon Uncle Isaac came out of the kitchen and sat down in his chair at the head of the round polished table. I could see he wanted to say something to me but the words were slow in coming. This was so different from usual when words shot from his mouth. His eyes roamed round the room from the polished candlesticks on the mantelpiece to the tapestry on the wall. Without look124 [pageend126]ing at me he picked up a newspaper and pretended to read. But soon the newspaper fell from his hands and he blew his nose impatiently. With an embarrassed smile on his face he drummed his fingers on the table and said.: “You’ll have to be very good to Auntie Fanny now. You must do everything she says and you must never annoy her.’’ I looked at him in astonishment for he had never spoken to me like this before. He had never shown any interest in our everyday behaviour and I did not think Auntie Fanny had ever spoken to him about us. I nodded my head as he continued to talk about how we should conduct ourselves, irrationally repeating his words over and over again, and it seemed to me that he was really filled with an impulse to unburden his heart but he just didn’t know how. For once he didn’t produce his ledger, nor did he leave the house as was his custom. From that evening onwards a great change came over Uncle Isaac. There were whole days when he stayed at home. He would drive away to his shop in the city and then return as though he had remembered something important. His yellow sulky standing before the front gate became a familiar sight in our street. His grey horse would stand patiently, a nosebag over his cars, waiting for the evening when Uncle Isaac would drive him away to the stable in the lane behind the house. Auntie Fanny had withdrawn into herself. We rarely heard more than a few words from her and from morning till night she crocheted baby clothes. She had lost interest in her housework and now she never reprimanded us for disturbing the tidy arrangement of things in the bathroom. Uncle Isaac often urged her to walk in the street with him but she invariably refused. 125 [pageend127]“Why this interest?” she said to him. “You never asked me to go out before.” He pretended not to hear her and noisily and clumsily pottered about in the kitchen. He wiped a few dishes, put them on the wrong shelves, rolled the wet dish-cloth into a ball and threw it into a corner of the room. Then he darted into another room looking for something new to do. He found a geographjr book that I had brought home from school and for a few minutes became immersed in the pictures of cities and maps of countries. He had discovered some new facts and promptly related them to Auntie Fanny who never lifted her eyes from her crocheting. All the time he looked at her with an expression of anxious interest. Suddenly she said: “Have you nothing to do outside?” “Don’t you want my help?” he answered in a hurt voice. “Then I shall go.” He left the house but he soon came back. Nothing would keep him away and just as once he rarely stayed in the house, now he never wanted to leave it. Auntie Fanny was often sick and in pain. There were days when she could hardly walk owing to the tormenting pains in her legs and she tottered about dragging her feet one behind the other. She bore her pain silently and it never found any reflection in her face. Even when beads of sweat stood out on her temples, when the pain was intense, her eyes still glowed warmly. But Uncle Isaac could not see her suffering in silence. His voice rose in vexation : “Please let me call Dr McDiarmid. Everyone speaks well of him. What does a midwife know?” Auntie Fanny obstinately refused to have Dr McDiarmid in the house. She was quite content with Mrs. Mendelsohn who was well spoken of by the ladies of the community. 126 [pageend128]Mrs. Mendelsohn had a large family of her own and when she visited the house she always brought her two youngest in a black-hooded perambulator that she left on the veranda. Auntie Fanny always took her into the best room and danced attendance upon her as though she were the patient. She made her cups of tea and had baked a cake in honour of her coming. Mrs. Mendelsohn ate heartily and talked loudly and never let Auntie Fanny ask those questions that troubled her. “What’s a bit of pain?” said Mrs. Mendelsohn as though anticipating Auntie Fanny’s thoughts.” I often say our grandmothers had a worse time and they survived and here we are today.” Uncle Isaac was very uneasy about the midwife. He had his mind fixed on Dr McDiarmid and he began to think that Mrs. Mendelsohn was in some way responsible for his wife’s poor health. One day as Mrs. Mendelsohn was about to wheel her large black-hooded perambulator off the veranda, Uncle Isaac approached her with a dignified expression and suggested that she call the doctor. He had read somewhere that new methods had recently been discovered and he was sure that so worthy a doctor as the Scotsman McDiarmid would be familiar with them. Mrs. Mendelsohn drew up her robust frame to her full height so that she looked down on Uncle Isaac’s greying curly hair and she shot him a glance of contempt from beneath thick, black eyebrows. “And why are you so concerned, pray?” she said. “Are you having the baby?” “I don’t know if you have ever read —” he began, but she interrupted him. “I wish you would attend to your own affairs. And read only those books that concern you. Like books on second-hand clothes.” She placed her Gladstone bag on the hood of the 127 [pageend129]pram and without another word pushed her children down the street. I knew she would never forgive Uncle Isaac for his lack of confidence. But Uncle Isaac had got Dr McDiarmid into his mind and when he found Auntie Fanny lying down he returned to the subject. “What does Mrs. Mendelsohn know? Call in a man of science, I beg you. I can’t bear to sec you suffer,” he pleaded. “I don’t want your learned men,” Auntie Fanny burst out, “I’m satisfied with my own people. You prefer the strangers, I know,” she added morosely. His ruddy face turned pale and only with difficulty did he suppress his vexation in front of Auntie Fanny. But as soon as he ran out of the house he began to shout ugly and hateful words at the inoffensive horse who looked at him with grateful eyes. I now spent many an hour with Uncle Isaac and even on the Sabbath I occasionally drove with him to his shop in the city. The shop was in a back street and there was an iron grille over the window. There were three different locks on the front door and Uncle Isaac complained that he wasted a lot of time opening and shutting them. It was a nuisance having to come at all, though now he opened the shop infrequently. This was the Uncle Isaac who had always been absorbed in his business and who took a delight in his second-hand goods. There was one special room of treasures he wouldn’t part with, old clocks with pictures on their faces, chairs with strangely carved legs, sets and sets of differentshaped cups and saucers, a long-stemmed German pipe. They were arranged around the room as at a museum. On the wall hung a sword that Uncle Isaac said had been used in the Franco-Prussian war. It had been the proud possession of a German officer. 128 [pageend130]Uncle Isaac knew everything about his treasures and as he related fact after fact about them he would find himself digressing into the realms of science, the history of mankind or the history of clockmaking. “Now take that brooch over there,” he said, pointing to a glass-topped box. “It was made in Paris over a hundred years ago. Paris then was ruled over by a king. The brooch was made by a firm that supplied the royal family. Who can say but that brooch was not worn by the queen herself?” The more often I came to the shop the more I learned about his treasures, right back to their genesis. Although he talked freely to me I was conscious all the time of his anxiety. It seemed to me his mind was with Auntie Fanny so that he was never able to rest in the shop. He ran from room to room, never dusted his treasures as he kept promising himself he would, and listened with impatience to the odd buyer or seller who came into the shop. One November day we drove home in the twilight, less than two hours after Uncle Isaac had opened his shop. A blue, rose-tinted haze hung over the house as Uncle Isaac quickly unharnessed the horse, filled the bin with chaff, and hurried towards the kitchen. We found Auntie Fanny sitting on a chair in the unlit room groaning and holding her hands beneath her stomach, while my sister stood against the wall staring wide-eyed at Auntie’s writhing lips. “What’s the matter?” Uncle Isaac asked in a hoarse voice. “Fetch Mrs. Mendelsohn. Go, hurry,” she whispered. Uncle Isaac fixed dilated eyes vacantly on his wife while seconds like hours passed. Suddenly he ran out of the kitchen, stopped in the middle of the yard, turned his head and shouted to me. “Help your Auntie to her room.” 129 [pageend131]She slowly shook her head. “You can’t help me,” she said. My sister and I walked behind Auntie Fanny, who almost fell at every step. The passageway was in complete darkness and I hurried back to fetch a lamp. Holding the lamp in front of me, I peered into Auntie Fanny’s room. I was frightened by the sight of her lying in her clothes on the bed, her face distorted, her wet cheek pressed against the pillow. Sweat was pouring into her sunken eyes. Auntie Fanny cast a weakly smiling glance at me and called me towards her. I was suddenly alarmed, for I thought she must surely be dying. “Take your sister into your room,’’ she whispered. “Don’t be frightened,’’ she went on. “I’ll be all right. I’m in God’s hands,’’ she added with a great effort, her eyes screwed up tightly. I clasped my sister’s hand and led her from the room, closing the door behind me. She whimpered protestingly but I was carried away by Auntie Fanny’s request that was like a sacred command and I almost dragged her the length of the passageway into our bedroom. I was filled with a sense of the importance of the occasion and I felt I was playing a very responsible role in the house. II. From our room I heard the voices of women in the passage-way. Uncle Isaac must have notified every lady in the community on his wild run for Mrs Mendelsohn, for I never saw so many of them in the house at once before. I walked back into the corridor but the women wouldn’t budge to let me pass. But they all made way 130 [pageend132]when through the open front door came Madame Koch, an old shrunken woman, followed by a retinue of women much like herself. The ancient lady wore a frilly white cap like an egg white and she and her followers made for Auntie Fanny’s room, opened the door and went in without speaking a word to anybody. “Madame Koch and her followers,” one woman in the corridor said, “they’re a plague.” Another said : “I thought she had long retired from practice.” “No one can keep her away from a confinement,” added yet another. But just then Mrs Mendelsohn, the midwife, and Uncle Isaac arrived. With a purposeful, serious expression on her round, swarthy face as though to say, “I have arrived in the nick of time,” Mrs Mendelsohn turned the doorknob of Auntie’s room and I caught a glimpse of the hunched shoulders of the old women> hovering round the bed in the streaky, yellowish lamplight. As the door closed Uncle Isaac turned frenziedly to the women in the passage and they, to cheer him up began telling him of their experiences and chiding him for his masculine weakness. I heard one woman out of Uncle’s hearing whisper to another: “You can’t blame him for behaving like a frightened child. By rights he should almost be a grandfather. But better late than never.” The other said: “She ought to be proud of her husband. Now, my man never blinked an eyelid when I had my last. He said to me, ‘You know the way to the hospital. Le me rest.’ ” “But of course it was your sixth.” “But what has that to do with the matter?” 131 [pageend133]I no longer listened to the conversation for the door of Auntie Fanny’s room opened again and out came the old women followed by Mrs Mendelsohn dressed in a spotlessly starched gown. They were all arguing loudly. The shrunken old lady with the frilly white cap protested in a high-pitched, toothless voice against Mrs Mendelsohn’s imperious ways. What right had she to cast her, Madame Koch, out of the labour room? She had been the first midwife in the community, long before Mrs Mendelsohn wore plaits. She, Madame Koch, had brought many into the world, even some of the people in this very corridor. She pointed a whithered hand at several women at the front door. The retinue of old women chimed in with angry voices; Madame Koch knew more than Mrs Mendelsohn would ever know. Mrs Mendelsohn impatiently tapped a foot on the floor and in a cold, dignified voice said, without even looking in the direction of her ancient rival, that she would have no truck with so-called midwives who practised spells and incantations. She was a real midwife with a diploma. With that Mrs Mendelsohn quickly turned her back ou her angry enemies and banged the door in their faces. The old women clustered round Madame Koch kept to themselves, refusing to stir from their place near the door. The others in the corridor moved closer to Uncle Isaac and stood near the front door and on the veranda. I sidled past the old women and joined Uncle Isaac. He seemed pleased to see me and asked me what I had done with my sister. Before I could tell him she was in bed he had turned away and was staring vacantly at the women talking animatedly round him. One said: “Madame Koch is as often in the death chamber as 132 [pageend134]the labour room now. Both places are the same to her, I should think.” “She goes to every funeral,” said another. Still another said: “These old crones shouldn’t be allowed into a room where there’s a new life. Preserve us from the evil eye,” she continued in a mysterious voice. “Thanks be to God my children aren’t here.” Uncle Isaac suddenly looked with loathing at the women with their complacent faces. As Auntie Fanny screamed again the blood drained from his face. “I can’t stand this any more,” he said loudly. "She’s dying in there and here I stand like a block of wood.” Then he continued with passion : “We live in an age of electricity, of steamships and scientific thought and I have to listen to all these old wives’ tales. The evil eye ! Did you ever hear of it ? ” Uncle Isaac, stirred by his own words, ran down the passage, through the back-yard towards the stable. Although I was by his side he talked to himself all the while he harnessed the horse who stumbled sleepily as it was led into the lane. I climbed into the sulky behind Uncle Isaac and he cracked the whip in the air and swung the reins round the horse’s head. Without looking this way or that he drove fast towards the doctor’s house. The horse responded to his demands as if it understood the importance of the mission and cantered over the uneven stones of the road. After Uncle Isaac had seen Doctor McDiarmid he drove more quietly and we arrived back a minute or so before the doctor drove up to the house in his open car. The lights of the car shone on a group of men, husbands of the women inside, who stood idly near the edge of the footpath. The clatter of the car brought some of the women to the gate. 133 [pageend135]Doctor McDiarmid, a stout, red-faced man with curled, waxed moustaches, good-naturedly pushed his way through the women who crowded the path and doorway. He said cheerfully to Uncle Isaac : “Where’s the patient ?” Then he asked in a puzzled voice : “What are all these people doing here?’’ Uncle Isaac began to make some explanation about the different customs of people from other countries but he stopped suddenly and walked hurriedly to the door of Auntie Fanny’s bedroom. He was too anxious to get the doctor to his wife to hold him up with talk. As the doctor opened the door Madame Koch and her group of old women, who had been watching him with darting eyes, stepped behind him into the room from which they had been driven. Uncle Isaac looked about helplessly and for once not a sound came from his mouth. Some men who had come up to him to speak words of encouragement shrugged their shoulders and left him alone. With his pale face, his vacant eyes, and his limp arms hanging by his sides he looked more dead than alive. It seemed that hours had passed when the door of the bedroom opened and the doctor came out, a large smile wrinkling his red face. “Congratulations, a boy,” he said to Uncle Isaac. Uncle Isaac stared open-mouthed for a moment. Suddenly he opened wide his arms and weeping for joy kissed me wildly on the face. He shouted to the assembly of men and women : “A boy ! My wife has given me a son ! Good folk, how can I repay my wife?” He kept repeating his words until the doctor said: “You can go in and see your wife now.” Uncle Isaac was more like himself when he grasped 134 [pageend136]tlie doorknob, but suddenly a smile of embarrassment passed over his face and he called to me: “Come in with me.” I joined him and held his burning hand as we came into the bedroom. I could just hear Auntie Fanny’s quivering voice as Uncle Isaac bent down to kiss her mouth. My eyes turned to the white and red living thing that was stirring in Madame Koch’s arms. The tiny boy was passed from hand to hand, each old woman mumbling a strange sounding blessing over him. Gradually their strange chorus rose to a rhapsody of joy. “Praise God for a new living being!” Madame Koch cried shrilly. Then, pronounced a perfect specimen, free from all blemishes, the child was delivered from the shrivelld but sure hands of the old lady into Uncle Isaac’s nervous grasp. He gazed down in astonishment and admiration at the tiny mouth from which came a long wail. Mrs Mendelsohn, the midwife, who had just finished drying her hands at a table near the head of Auntie Fanny’s bed watched the scene with rising anger and finally burst out to Uncle Isaac in a loud and peremptory voice: “Give me the baby. And please ask those women to leave at once.” And as an after-thought she added : “And go yourself. You have seen your wife and son.” A shrill chorus rose against Mrs Mendelsohn as she took the child from Uncle Isaac’s hands and put it beside Auntie Fanny. “Why do you give yourself such airs?” asked Madame Koch in a sing-song voice. “You should be thankful for the assistance I gave you.” “The assistance you gave me!” Mrs Mendelsohn gasped as if unable to believe her ears. 135 [pageend137]“Yes, the assistance Madame Koch gave you,’’ the retinue echoed. “This is all your doing,’’ Mrs Mendelsohn said into Undo Isaac’s face. “You brought the doctor and he, the fool, let these old women in. The work was done before your precious doctor came near the room. You cowardly men are all the same.” “Now be calm, Mrs Mendelsohn!” replied Uncle Isaac patiently. “Are you telling me,” he uttered each word with emphasis, “that Doctor McDiarmid, a man of science with degrees from Edinburgh, wasted his time in this room? Do you know where Edinburgh is? Do you know the school of medicine there has a history that——” He would have continued in his customary way but Mrs Mendelsohn wouldn’t hear another word. She said : “I have asked you to take these women outside. If you have no consideration for me at least show some feeling for your wife. She needs rest. Now, please go,” she almost shouted the last words. “Very well,” Uncle Isaac said with dignity. But he was a little crestfallen as we left the room, behind the old women, leaving Mrs Mendelsohn alone with Aunťe Fanny. Only a few people were still in the passage as Madame Koch and the old women pattered out of the house, well satisfied with their visit. Uncle Isaac shook hands with them and with the rest of the departing friends. Then he said to me : “Come, we’ll eat something. I’m hungry, would you believe it?” For the first time I felt sleepy. I had never been up all night before. I almost slept with my head on the kitchen table as Uncle Isaac buttered slices of bread and talked about everything that came into his head. He wondered what his son would be. If only one could see 136 [pageend138]into the future as one could see into' the past! He would like to see his son a great scientist, or a professor of medicine or a historian. I closed my eyes but I could still hear Uncle Isaac’s voice and the crow of the first cock in a distant backyard and a milk cart rattling down the lane. HANNA KAWA VIENS JOUER AVEC MOI Elle avait, la jeune mère, un beau petit garçon, tout rose, le plus beau et le plus gentil petit garçon de la terre. Il adorait sa maman et lui disait toujours que lorsqu’il serait grand, il ferait d’elle la reine du monde. Puis, l’enfant tomba malade. On du lui défendre de recevoir ses camarades et de jouer avec eux. Un jour pourtant, une ravissante petite fille parut sur le seuil de sa chambre et regarda le malade, qui, transporté de joie, s’écria : — Viens jouer ! oh, viens jouer avec moi — en lui tendant ses pauvres bras décharnés. Mais la maman de la fillette la prit par la main et l’emmena sans mot dire. Un soir d’automne, le petit garçon mourut. Mais au fond du cœur de la mère solitaire continuaient résonner toujours vivant, les airs que son petit garçon lui chantait, et les berceuses qu’elle lui chantait elle- 137 [pageend139]même. Et tous ces airs étaient dominés par le dernier appel de l’enfant: “viens jouer avec moi!”, triste refrain, déchirant de douceur, qui lui toujours réchauffait le cœur. Aussi, chaque fois, qu’il lui arrivait de rencontrer sur son chemin un être solitaire, elle cherchait aussitôt à l’approcher, à faire sa connaissance. Apercevant une personne que tout le monde semblait éviter, elle se disait : “Bien sûr, personne n’a jamais voulu jouer avec elle. . Un jour, son frère la fit sortir en ville. Us se mirent à la recherche d’un taxi. Dans la file où brillait une longue suite de voitures flambant neuf, elle remarqua une vieille guimbarde d’aspect peu engageant, et il lui sembla entendre comme dans un souffle: “viens, oh, viens jouer avec moi!” Ce fut la voiture qu’elle choisit sans hésiter. A son frère qui lui demandait un peu plus tard les raisons de son choix, elle répondit : — Mais voyons, si personne ne fait travailler le chauffeur de ce taxi, comment voulez-vous qu’il s’en achète un meilleur? Pendant les vacances, un jour, qu’elle cherchait à se loger dans un hôtel-pension plus ou moins bondé, on lui fit visiter, tout au bout du couloir, une petite chambre dont, visiblement, personne n’avait voulu. “Viens, viens jouer avec moi!” semblait lui dire le minuscule balcon blotti dans le feuillage d’un vieux tilleul, et ce fut cette pièce-là qu’elle choisit avec joie. Les années passaient. Presque toujours seule, la mère entendait d’une manière toujours plus distincte, toujours plus lancinante, le même appel qui traversait le vide de sa vie sans espoir: en effet, elle avait hébergé et choyé tour à tour d’autres enfants, mais n’avait jamais retrouvé sur leurs lèvres la douce voix de son petit garçon. Puis, une guerre mondiale — la seconde de sa vie — éclata. Quittant son pays et tout son passé, la jeune fem- 138 [pageend140]me prit le chemin de l’exode pour ne s’arrêter qu’à la frontière où elle sogna les blessés dans un hôpital de fortune. Au cours d’un bombardement, un éclat d’obus la frappa à mort. “Viens jouer avec Moi !” tel fut l’éclair de son ultime pensée. Au même instant, elle sentit que la promesse de son petit garçon s’exausait : le Maître de toutes les douleurs se penchait sur elle; — il avait pris le visage de son fils et allait faire d’elle une reine dans l’autre monde. . . 139 [pageend141]NOTES AND REVIEWS FIVE YEARS I first met Peteris Aigars at “Miller’s printing shop”, otherwise known as the Waverley Press. He was editing his Latvian paper “Cina” and I was publishing a book in Albanian. Looking back over these five years I can truly say that is was friendship at first sight. Our membership of PEN was our common ground and helped to break the ice. Just at that time elections to the new Executive Committee were being prepared. The late Andrew Colin had approached me to stand as representative of a rare specimen. I took it as a tribute to my small and, then, forgotten country. At the first meeting of the new Executive Committee Aigars was elected Chairman. Then, to my great surprise, he proposed me as Hon. Secretary. Although deeply touched by this gesture I pleaded my inexperience and the fact that I was not even a writer in the true sense of the word, or shall I say in the PEN sense of the word, that is to say I was neither a poet nor a novelist. I really thought myself unworthy of such an exalted position. Mr. Prawdin, in his dry matter- of-fact manner asked me if I was able to write letters, to which I replied “yes”, of course. He assured me that it was all that was needed and I could do no more than accept. To be quite honest I did not cherish the prospect of working with a poet as Chairman of an organisation of writers in exile. I imagined Aigars, as the others, with his head in the clouds, thinking in metaphors, indulging in poetic licence. The prospect was the more worrying as we were from the start plunged into very difficult problems. 140 [pageend142]I never felt so relieved to have been wrong. I found Aigars an accomplished realist with both his feet solidly on the ground and no messing about in the clouds when it came to business. We therefore worked as a team in the most perfect harmony. In some ways we completed each other. Being impulsive by temperament I was rather inclined to be blunt with people who did not go straight. Aigars, on the other hand, always calm, unruffled and extremely tolerant, was trying and succeeding to avoid open clashes by overlooking petty intrigues and double-dealing. His proverbial optimism was put to the test and came out triumphant in connection with our congresses in Munich and Dusseldorf. He assured everyone that everything would be all right when almost everybody had given up hope to get in time ticket and allowance for the journey. Meeting organised in such conditions were not without shortcomings but it is our position as writers in exile that is to blame for it. The only time I saw Aigars lose his temper was during the Congress in Frankfurt of the International PEN, but that was about something not directly connected with the work of our Centre. All members of the PEN Centre for Writers in Exile have to be thankful to Peteris Aigars on more than one account. During his Chairmanship some of the most outstanding and successful initiatives were carried out. Two book exhibitions, three congresses involving the whole Centre in Europe and America, to mention the most important. The one held last year in Stockholm has left a deep mark on all those who were present. It is fitting that it should have crowned the untiring and self-denying work carried by Peteris Aigars as Chairman of our Centre for five memorable years. Tayar Zavalani 141 [pageend143]GUSZTAV RAB Der Tod ereilte ihn spät in der Nacht. Er sass noch bei seinem Schreibtisch und arbeitete. Manuskripten, Aufzeichnungen, Bücher lagen umher in der kleinen Wohnung in Dreux, wo der ungarische Schriftsteller in der Emigration Gusztav Rab seit dem Hinscheiden seiner Gemahlin allein wohnte. Man fand ihn mit der Füllfeder in der Hand drei Tage später als er die letzte Zeile noch zu Papier bringen konnte. Gusztav Rab war ein junger Journalist als er den ersten Preis eines Romanwettbewerbes in Budapest gewann. Das Buch hatte einen schönen Erfolg, wie auch alle seine Romane, die er später schrieb. Nach dem Krieg wurde er durch die Kommunisten verfolgt, zwar nicht eingesperrt, doch es war ihm untersagt die Feder zu ergreifen. Er lebte auf dem Lande und verdiente sein mageres Brot als Hilfsarbeiter bei den Feldmesser. Nach der Revolution gelang es ihm mit seiner Gemahlin nach Frankreich zu fliehen, wo er seine schrifstellerische Tätigkeit wieder aufnahm. In seinem Roman “Le voyage dans le bleu” schilderte er das Leben der ungarischen Deportierten und die Freiheitssehnsucht der ungarischen Bauern. Das Buch erschien auch in englischer und deutscher Sprache und hatte überall grossen Erfolg. “Un jour d Budapest” war der zweite Roman, den Rab in der Emigration schrieb und es sind von ihm noch viele Erzählungen, Essays und Kritiken erschienen. In seinem Nachlass fand man zwei vollendete Romane. Gusztav Rab war ein begabter, talentvoller Schriftsteller. Er konnte farbig, interessant, spannend erzählen, die Figuren seiner Werke waren lebendig, sein Stil fein. Kein Wunder, dass er beliebt und popular geworden ist. Er war nur 62 Jahre alt, als er das Zeitliche segnete. E.H. 142 [pageend144]BRUNO SCHULZ He was small, unattractive and sickly, with a thin angular body and brown, deep-set eyes in a pale triangular face. He taught art at a secondary school for boys at Drohobycz in South Eastern Poland, where he spent most of his life. He had few friends outside his native city. In his leisure hours—of which there were probably many—he made drawings and wrote endlessly, nobody quite knew what. At the age of 40, having received an introduction through friends to Zofia Nal- kowska, a distinguished novelist in Warsaw, he sent her some of his stories. They were published in 1934 under the title of CINNAMON SHOPS—and the name of Bruno Schulz was made. Three years later, a further collection of stories, with drawings by the author, SANATORIUM UNDER THE SIGN OF THE HOURGLASS, was published; then THE COMET, a novella, appeared in a leading literary weekly. In between, Schulz made a translation of Kafka’s THE TRIAL. It is said that he was working on a novel, entitled THE MESSIAH, but nothing has remained of it. This is the sum total of his literary output. After his literary success, he continued to live at Drohobycz. The outbreak of the Second World War found him there. Together with other Jews of the city, he was confined to the ghetto and, according to some reports, ‘protected’ by a Gestapo officer who liked his drawings. One day in 1942. he ventured, with a special pass, to the ‘Aryan’ quarter, was recognised by another S.S.man, a rival of his protector, and shot dead in the street. When Bruno Schulz’s stories were re-issued in Poland in 1957, translated into French and German, and acclaimed everywhere by a new generation of readers to whom he was unknown, attempts were made to place his oeuvre in the mainstream of Polish literature, to find affinities, derivations, to explain him in terms of 143 [pageend145]one literary theory or another. The task is well nigh impossible. He was a solitary man, living apart, filled with his dreams, with memories of his childhood, with an intense, formidable inner life, a painter’s imagination. a sensuality and responsiveness to physical stimuli which most probably could find satisfaction only in artistic creation—a volcano, smouldering silently in the isolation of a sleepy provincial town. Schulz’s prose is as colourful as his drawings are drab and grey. His word pictures—if translated to canvas by a more talented artist—would produce a riot of colour, of yellows, ochres, verdigris and cinnobars, which he so often uses in his descriptions. On the other hand, the drawings and etchings which accompany some of the stories, though skilful, are unoriginal, slightly precious, reminiscent of Felicien Rops whom he much admired. The art master, the failed student of the Vienna Academy of Art, the failed architect of Lvov, was in fact a great, natural writer, as evocative in his prose as Julian Tuwim—another Polish Jew from the provinces and one of Poland’s greatest poets of all times —was in his poetry. The world of Schulz is basically a private world. At its centre is his father “that incorrigible improviser . . . the lonely hero who alone had waged war against the fathomless, elemental boredom that strangled the city”. Father, bearded, sometimes resembling a biblical prophet, is one of the great eccentrics of literature. In reality he was a Drohobycz merchant, who had inherited a textile business and ran it until illness forced him to abandon it to the care of his wife, who then retired to ten years of enforced idleness and to his own world of dreams and of pursuits which earlier he had to interrupt in order to support a family and to continue, as had been expected of him, in the family tradition. Father who surrounds himself with ledgers and pores over them for days on end—while in reality all he is doing is putting coloured transfers on the ruled pages; father who has zoological interests, who imports eggs of rare species of birds and has them hatched in 144 [pageend146]his attic, who is dominated by the blue-eyed servant girl, Adela; who believes that tailors’ dummies should be treated with as much respect as human beings; father who loathes cockroaches to the point of obsession; who in a last apotheosis rises above the vulgar mob of buyers and sellers and, drowning in a river of cloth, blows the horn of Atonement . . . Then there is mother, who did not love her husband properly and who condemned him therefore to an existence on the periphery of life, because he was not rooted in any woman’s heart. There are uncles and aunts and cousins, each described with a deadly accuracy, with an epithet- like a clinical diagnosis: Aunt Agatha, frustrated in her expansive fertility, her withered little husband Mark, Uncle Charles, looking deep into his body ana sensing in it an ‘unformulated growth, the harbinger of premature death’; Uncle Edward whose ringing voice and interest in Father's experiments led to his sad transformation into a house bell—these are the figures brought back to life, distorted, slightly7 grotesque—both hated and loved, but most of all understood: ‘in that old familiar smell was contained a marvelously simple synthesis of the life of those people, the distillation of their race, the quality of their blood and the secret of their fate . . These were Schulz’s people, the people of Drohobycz, at one time the Klondike of Galicia when oil was struck near the city and prosperity entered it and destroyed the old patriarchal way of life, bringing false values, bogus Americanization, and new ways of making a quick fortune—when the white spaces on an old map of the city were transformed into a new district, when the Street of Crocodiles became its centre, peopled with a race of rattle-headed men and women of easy morals, when the old dignity of Cinnamon Shops with their aroma of spices and distant countries changed into something brash, second rate, questionable, even slightly suspect. One could continue to quote from the stories, somebody might attempt perhaps a psycho-analysis of 145 [pageend147]Schulz on the basis of his writings. Polish and other critics have drawn attention to the influence that Thomas, Mann, Freud and Kafka have exercised on him. This may or may not be true: it is also said that Schulz first read THE TRIAL when the book was sent to him for reviewing after the publication of CINNAMON SHOPS. What is undoubtedly true is that the atmosphere of both Kafka’s and Schulz’s life in their respective provinces is not dissimilar, that these distant outposts of the former Austro-Hungarian empire with the memories of the ‘good’ Emperor Franz-Joseph still a living tradition, looked up to Vienna as the centre of cultural and artistic life much more than to Prague or Warsaw. But whether or not these derivations existed in fact does not really matter; the stories still speak for themselves in the same voice now as in the thirties and what emerges from them is a sunken world, lost forever under the lava of history: an ordinary provincial city with ordinary people going about their daily tasks, a city scorched by the hot summers of every schoolchild’s holidays, sometimes shaken by unexpected high winds from the mountains, but mostly sleepy and lethargic— here brought to life by the magic touch of a poetic genius, by a prose as memorable, powerful and unique as are the brush strokes of Marc Chagall.

We hope to print one of the stories in an early issue of Arena. 146 [pageend148]THE BRAHMAN EPISODE, St. Ambrose’s Version of the Colloquy between Alexander the Great and the Brahmans of India, edited from a Vatican manuscript. Translated from the Latin by S. V. Yankowski. Privately published by Elisabeth Kottmeier and E. G. Kostetzky, Ansbach 1962. Printed in Western Germany Gesamtherstellung: Wiedfeld und Mehl, Ansbach. (S. V. Yankowski read before the war at Oxford Latin and Greek and took his degree at London University. During the war he was a member of the Polish Army in France and England. After the war he taught in London. He moved to Australia and subsequently to the USA where Ezra Pound, with whom he was in close contact, encouraged him to translate from Latin Richard of Saint Victor. This translation he published in 1960. He now lives in England.) This small book of 64 pages certainly in weight and importance means more than hundreds of pages of the standard book production. It is surely not of interest only for a historian. It ought to be read, if not MEMORISED BY HEART, not ad usum delphinorum but for the innermost chamber of one’s private heart. The text is originally a part of work of Arrian, the Greek historian, whose writings on Alexander the Great are regarded as the most reliable. Arrian’s story depicting the encounter of the prototype of the conqueror, Alexander the Great and Dandamis, a foremost Brahmin of India, had a rough treatment by subsequent writers. Eventually it got into most competent hands of one of the most illustrious Fathers and Doctors of the Church. St. Ambrose whose idealised lace still gazes from a splendid gothic mural of the Karlstein, the magnificent Czech castle of the Emperor Charles IV, the founder of Prague University. It is easy to understand why St. Ambrose, if he really be the translator into Latin of this splendid piece of post-classical Greek writing, took in the Arrian’s piece such an 147 [pageend149]interest to devote his original mind to translating of the text: perhaps there had been there two circumstances which moved the splendid Father to undertake the translation. First, St. Ambrose certainly had been familiar with power as his father had been the Prefect of Gallia, including Britain: secondly, the saint wrote much himself on ascetics and morals and his book De officiis ministrorum is still considered to be a manual of Christian morality. St. Ambrose could not be but deeply impressed by the account of the famous scene in which the temporal power—Alexander—had been put into contrast with the spiritual power of the perfectly detached and saintly Dandamis, the Brahmin. He could not help, I like to think, to be deeply moved by the nobility of Arrian who, in spite of bringing the two most powerful personalities into a clash of two basic conceptions of the man’s destiny, was still clear-headed enough to write about the great Macedonian, erat enim in eo spiritus Dei. Sed. instigante daemone malo, inter ipsa principia (Dandami) muta- batur. The text, in Latin and in a very good English translation, tells a fascinating short story about Alexander who, on the summit of his splendour and glory, bethought himself and wished also to gain wisdom, “the mother of foresight”. To gain wisdom he wished to learn. He said: “O wisdom, visit me, I pray, serene power that thou art . . .” For this end he wished to meet the Brahmans of India. He had a foretaste of their learning and ways from a Quisling-Brahman, a certain Calanus, who had deserted the life of the sage and had embraced the ways of the conquerors. But Calanus was summarily cut to his proper measure by the Brahmans. Alexander then sent to Dandamis, the foremost of Brahmans, one of his friends by name of Onesicritus, with the message to ask Dandamis to come to speak to him. or, “Should he refuse to come, I want to know the reason, so that I myself may go and see him”. The text, with subtle irony, describes the messenger’s hamfisted zeal, which, characteristically and still acceptably even for our progressive age translates his master’s wish 148 [pageend150]into the following words: “Alexander, the king, son of the great god Jupiter and lord of the human race, bids you come to him. If you do, he will confer numerous gifts on you; but if you refuse to go and see him, you will be put to death for contempt of his royal person.” One can be only sorry, on reading this that Onesicritus, having been a member of an underdeveloped country, had not been as yet in the position to goad Dandamis by a high Party office. And the same spirit, that of backwardness, was unmistakenly, manifested by Alexander himself; Alexander after Dandamis’s refusal to come obeyed Dandamis’s invitation to present himself to him should he “stand in need of something”. Alexander went, dismounted from his horse and “Then he took off the diadem from- his head and, putting away all pride and vainglory which surrounded him. stepped into the wood alone, and watching at the same time the ground, untainted by blood, he approached the old man, stopped down at his feet and said . . .” Alexander asked the seeer: “Teach us some of your wisdom. They say that you converse with God himself. I want to knoio in ivhat sense you consider yourselves (Brahmans) superior to Greeks, and in what sphere you yourself either see better or possess a deeper knowledge than other people.” To this Dandamis gave the answer: “And I, too, would like to impart to you the understanding that I have received from God, but you will find no room within yourself for a gift of this kind. For your soul is filled with an avid and unbounded desire which, I know, is now struggling against me, as I appear to be tearing you away from it. To-day, hoioever. that desire shows signs of regret, because you are not being defiled by blood or by slaughter of any nation . . .” And then Dandamis expounded to Alexander the Vedanta, as far as Arrian gathered information about it and indeed had understood it. Alexander “listened to him willingly and without anger; for there was in him the spirit, of God.” Alexander finished by saying: “You have taught me to respect wisdom and have thus rendered me a great 149 [pageend151]service.” Thereupon he offered Dandamis his gorgeous gifts from which Dandamis accepted only oil which he poured into a fire offering it to God. In conclusion he told Alexander, if he -wanted to know the truth, to come to India and live in the wilderness, renouncing all the honours and all marks of distinction. The expounding of the doctrine and the exhortations of Dandamis make fascinating reading. There is no doubt that the Indian Brahman’s views were acceptable to St. Ambrose, including one key phrase which clearly shows how Dandamis looked upon the Brahman’s position: “Philosophus . . . non dominio alterius abtemperat, sed ipse dominatur.” In the last 16 pages Yankowski gives a bird’s eye view of the subsequent literature which had been written, all over the world, about the hero, Alexander. In a Slav scholar it is, it seems to me, inconceivable how he could have omitted to mention the Czech Alexandreis, the earliest to be written in a Slav language and certainly the best. Ivan Jelinek THE BOOK OF THE HAND, By PAUL TABORI. Published by Chilton Company. Philadelphia and New York, 1962. Paul Tabori tells the reader of this highly civilised, entertaining and witty book a great deal about the human hand, that miraculous appendix of the human body and mind. It is, in a way, as the blurb claims, a compendium of facts and legends since the dawn of history connected with the hand. In twelve chapters Tabori tells the story of hands and fingers, their employment in every kind of activity man has thought out. Tabori was 150 [pageend152]right, I think, to begin with the following expression of awe:' “From the moment of birth to death’s dark finality we carry a masterpiece throughout life which no sculptor has ever equalled, a precision instrument which has never been surpassed by the most elaborate mechanical brain or the most delicate tool—the human hand.” This causerie shows the author as a man of very wide and thorough erudition, familiar with most important works of anthropology and literature—and in addition with custom and proverb—which have any bearing on the subject. Before I finished reading the book which kept my interest all the time, the more so as the author forced me to look often with a mixture and anxiety at my own hands—you know our hands and their movements betray us!—I was wondering on what note Tabori, the story-teller, as I am fortunate to know him. would end. And sure enough, I was delighted when he had not failed me: he puts to the book a very good finale in a fascinating description of a performance of the famous Austrian graphologist, Raphael Schermann over several manuscripts of very important people indeed, like Lajos Kossuth and Emperor Francis Joseph. And then, logically, he winds up with a chapter devoted to several famous handless people. Here and there, it seemed to me, there are, however, gaps, particularly when the author deals with the hand in mythology and religion. Surely it is a pity he omitted the first man of legend, the Gilgamesh, the king of Uruk who with his hands tamed the cattle, killed the Bull of Heaven and vanquished the lions in the mountains before entering the Nether World. Also, to give another example, why not mention the strange and obscure “handymen” of the Mother of Gods, Rhea, Idaios Dactyloi? On the other hand I was delighted he retold the story of Buddha and the Demon and Buddha’s fingers. I missed, in the book, the hands of Jesus, something about the old quarrel as toby which part of His hands Jesus was nailed to the Cross; and naturally, as I raise this particular point I think it is a pity hands bearing stigmata were forgotten. But after 151 [pageend153]these very few objections—I realise the author could not give us other longish chapters on jewelry or the hand in dance and painting and sculpture, nor could he quote from the tremendous treasure of poetry devoted to hands—I must say he thought of writing such a charming and useful book which in our time of patchy learning can give many a reader very much indeed. Ivan Jelinek OUR CONTRIBUTORS J. C. ARKAY—see ARENA No. 10. Ka t e BARLAY was born in Budapest, Hungary, and has lived in England since 1937. Her books include THE STORY OF A CARROT and THE STORY OF FRISKY (both for children), and a book on Hungarian cookery. Her short stories have been published in The New Yorker, Seventeen, Argosy and many Continental magazines. She has written, alone or in collaboration, about fifty television films.

Vic t o r HATAR, poet and novelist, born in Hungary, 1914. Architect by training, he gradually changed to literature. His first great novel (‘The Outback of Outer Eurasia—No Man’s Wonderland’ in two volumes, written in 1939-42) was seized by the authorities for its ‘anti-totalitarian’ tendencies, and the author sentenced 152 [pageend154]to five years in prison. After the war he published ‘Heliane’, a tetralogy (1947), ‘Liturgicon’, a collection of poems (1948) and, in various reviews, a great many short stories, essays and literary criticism. Yet, because of his stand against dictatorship, he was soon once again reduced to silence and imprisoned, this time by the Communists. After his release in October, 1952, he had to wait a couple of years for the ‘thaw’ when he translated from English, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian and German a few distinguished mediocrities for a living, and some great masters like Rabelais, Sterne, Quevedo, Solorzano, Turgeniev, Jack London, etc., for pleasure. As it was only too clear that under Communist rule he would be barred from publishing original works for ever, he escaped from Hungary, at the end of 1956 and now lives in London. The excerpt printed here is the eighth chapter of his novel ‘Pepito and Pepita’ which is going to be published this year by Julliard, in the translation of the young French poet P. Groze.

Pa u l TABORI—see ARENA No. 9. 154 [pageend156]COMMENT We are both happy readers of Arena which comes regularly. I feel very privileged to have in English the writings of the exiles from Eastern Europe. The quality of their writing is highly sympathetic to me, and the frequent rural locale gives their work a sense of timelessness. I once told you that I could not find a successor for Anatole France but I have, in many of these short stories, felt strong kinship—so strong that I really feel the family of man. I would like to take a lifetime subscription to Arena. E. A., Washington, DC. Das Aeussere lässt zu wünschen übrig. Ich nehme an. dass das Format so bleiben muss. Aber dann müsste zumindest das Papier und der äussere Einband besser werden. Wenigstens in Deutschland ist es doch so, dass ein simpler Reklame-Kalender besser aussieht als unsere “Arena”. Von den grossen Zeitschriften ganz zu schweigen—zB “Westermanns”. Es ist natürlich eine reine Geldfrage. Vielleicht sollte man die “Arena” seltener herausgeben, dafür dann aber representativer gestalten? Z.A., Germany Of course, I know “Arena” and I have read it with increasing interest. It has become a truly international forum of literary life and reflects very aptly a significant layer of contemporary thought and sensitivity which elsewise would escape general notice. Moreover it assures historical continuity to achievements and endeavours which elsewhere would remain dispersed and lost in the convulsive changes of the contemporary world. The pertinent modesty of “Arena’s” presentation itself appears to me as a guarantee of its authenticity. The 10th issue, which I have received, is excellent all the way. A.A., University of Iowa 155 [pageend157]I am most interested in your review Arena and I am reading it always with great pleasure. Some works in it have been very impressive and on a very high literary level. I have already recommended this review to a few of my English and American friends who are interested in our part of Europe. S.B., London NOTES OF THE P.E.N. CENTRE FOR WRITERS IN EXILE At the Annual General Meeting of the Centre held on February 15, 1963 in London, a new Executive was elected which, in turn, elected the following officers: Ivan Jelinek, Chairman; Michael Prawdin. Vice- Chairman; A. R. Kenedy, Honorary Secretary; Peteris Aigars, Honorary Treasurer; Paul Tabori, Permanent International Delegate. Members of the Executive: Gert Helbemäe. Theodosya Lisiewicz, Velta Snikere, Laszló Cs. Szabo and Tayar Zavalani. The Executive has decided to hold social meetings for the members in (and within reach of) London, to follow its own meetings. These will be held, unless previously announced for other dates, on the third Friday of each month, at the Polish Hearth, 55 Princes Gate, London, S.W.l, at 8.30—9 p.m. The London Centre is organizing a three-day meeting for delegates from the various branches and geographical areas. This will take place on May 24—26, immediately preceding the meeting of the International P.E.N. Executive at Brighton. We hope to welcome members from New York, Paris, Germany, Stockholm, 156 [pageend158]and Lisbon to discuss, with the London and other members, plans and projects for the next few years. A report of the meeting will be published in Arena. We would welcome from all our members regular news of their activities, their publications and plans. These should be sent to the editorial office of Arena, 14 Stafford Terrace, London, W.8. At the time of writing it seems unlikely that the Congress planned to be held in Teheran first for April and later for September, 1963, will take place. Plans are being worked out for a smaller meeting at Rheims in October on the lines of the Rome Round Table Conference in November, 1961; its theme would be the translation and adaptation of theatrical works. The 1964 International Congress seems to be definitely fixed for June at Oslo. We hope to send representatives to the Poetry Biennale at Knocke this autumn.

Our subscription is still £1—or S3.00 annually and we once again ask those who have been receiving our issues for the past two years to let us have this sum by cheque or money order. These should be sent to the P.E.N. Centre for Writers in Exile, c/o the Poets’ and Painters’ Press, 146 Bridge Arch. Sutton Walk. London. S.E.l. Some of our friends have asked us about life-subscriptions and after some heart-searchings we have decided to be optimistic enough to set these at £20—or $50.00. We hope there will be a good many of them. ARENA now circulates in over seventy countries. Our next issue is an Albanian one; the anthology will be edited by Tayar Zavalani and there will be other contributions by Robert Neumann and Josef Wittlin, Aleksis Rannit and Dr. Ivar Grünthal. Our fourteenth issue (due in July) will be a Spanish anthology edited by Julian Gorkin and his associates and will be followed in September by the special drama issue edited by Algirdas Landsbergis. Later we expect to publish Chinese, Yugoslav, Portuguese, Slovak and Catalan anthologies in addition to several special issues. These will include the one devoted to scholars of foreign origin in the United States and in Britain (to be edited by Professor John Kosa of the University of North Carolina) and one to unpublished work by exiled writers in the form of extracts and synopses which is being edited by Thomas Aczel. Manuscripts and letters for this issue should be addressed to him at Flat 2, South Hill Mansions, South Hill Park, London. N.W.3.
