He has accomplished his main goals for the Society: to start a new scholarly journal in English, i.e., Kosmas (for additional details see below); to give it and other publishing activities an assured financial basis; and to promote a membership drive, especially among younger scholars. Although a more systematic drive will be necessary to reach this goal, 195 new members already have been accepted since 1980. He then continued with partial summaries of officers’ reports on various issues: Kosmas, Zprávy, Proměny, Bulletin; Treasurer’s financial statement; new published or subsidized books; new Biographical Directory going into print; (he project of a Who’s Who Among Czechs and Slovaks Abroad, and comi..ented briefly on the existing sections (Anthropology, Biology, Bohemistica, History of Art, Political Sciences and Fine Arts) and several working committees. The Society currently has sixteen local chapters: six in the U.S., four in Canada, two in Australia, and one each in Austria, Switzerland, Great Britain and South Africa. Its last Regional Conference was hosted by the Montreal chapter; the Swiss chapter is preparing for the upcoming one in Summer 1983. In July 1982, the Vienna chapter organized a Week of Czechoslovak Culture in conjunction with the Sokol meet. (A full version of this report in Czech is available in Zprávy SVU, Vol. XXIV.

Pennsylvania takes great pride in the richness of its ethnic diversity, and we recognize that, by remembering and continuing to cultivate the cultural heritage of our ancestors, we add to the diversity of our own society and increase our understanding of the cultural factors that shape the lives of all Americans. The Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences has played an important role in the preservation and promotion of Czech and Slovak literature, art, music and cultural traditions, and I share your enthusiasm for that goal in recognition of the fact that our past gives us a firm blueprint for our future success. Your efforts in reminding citizens of the painful lack of human rights in your homeland have also been noteworthy, and I join with you in the hope that one day the dream of freedom will become reality for the people of all nations throughout the world.

Gaydos of Pennsylvania in the House of Representatives (Excerpt - Congressional Record, Extensions of Remarks, November 29, 1982) MR. GAYDOS. Mr. Speaker, during the recent recess, the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pa., was the site of a most impressive convocation of scholars, artists, musicians, and writers. It was the 11 th world congress of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences and was held over the weekend of October 28-31. The society is a nonpartisan, non-profit organization of 1,600 members, dedicated to the principles of free search for truth and knowledge and the free dissemination of ideas. They come from the ranks of refugees who fled Czechoslovakia after the Nazi occupation in 1939, the Communist coup in 1948 and the invasion of the Warsaw pact powers in 1968. The organisation of these intellectuals and professional people began in 1958 under the leadership of the late Prof. Vaclav Hlavatý, a mathematician at the University of Indiana, and Dr. Jaroslav Nemec of the National Library of Medicine. Bound by the common purpose of advancing Czechoslovak culture, research, and scholarship in an atmosphere of freedom, the Society held its first congress in April 1962, here in Washington, D.Č. Since then, the society has met biannually throughout the United States with interim congresses at Switzerland, Canada, and Los Angeles, Calif. It has made its presence known throughout the world. In the West, its establishment has been welcomed and supported over the past 24 years. However, comments in the controlled press of Czechoslovakia range from outright condemnation to reluctant acknowledgement of its significance. The society has local chapters scattered throughout the United States and abroad. Its members teach at approximately 100 colleges and universities in the United States, Canada, and Western Europe. From its inception, the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences has maintained its nonpolitical character, refusing to become an instrument of the so-called cold war. Its membership is opposed to any totalitarian ideology of either the left or the right, being fully aware that culture and freedom are inseparable. Mr. Speaker, I deem it appropriate and proper to insert into the Congressional Record this recognition of the Czechoslovak. Society of Arts and Sciences for the attention of my colleagues. ★ Honorary Committee The Honorable Richard S. Caliguiri, Mayor of the City of Pittsburgh The Honorable Joseph M. Gaydos, United States Representative The Honorable John Heinz, United States Senator The Honorable Richard L Thornburgh, Governor, State of Pennsylvania 5 [pageend5]University of Pittsburgh CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY December 6, 1982 Mr. Leopold Pospisil Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences Yale University 554 Orange Street New Haven, Connecticut 06511 Dear Mr. Pospisil: Allow me to thank you once again for the honorary membership certificate which you presentee' in behalf of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences. I truly cherish this honor. Thank you as well for your letter. Indeed, it was my pleasure and the privilege of this University to participate in the Congress. I felt the activities were a tribute to the society in their diversity and depth. I took special pride in a|l of this, of course, because of our shared heritage. / ) Wesley**. Posvar Chancellor 6 [pageend6]IN REMEMBRANCE AND HONOR OF VICTIMS OF NAZI CRIMES A Declaration by the Eleventh Congress of The Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences in the Free World Forty years ago, in the summer of 1942, the power holders of Nazi Germany ordered ruthless killing of Czechs as a reprisal for the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, the infamous Nazi and military governor of the lands of Czechoslovakia seized and occupied by Germany. In a single campaign of terror and brutality, the Nazis killed 2,300 Czech men and women, including those of the two villages of Lidice and Lezaky, arrested 10,000 people and sent many of them to concentration camps. Most of these prisoners never returned. The Nazi campaign of vengeance and murder was directed with particular fierceness against the Czech men and women who belonged to the academic, intellectual, cultural and artistic strata of society. The selective killing of the talented and gifted was intentionally aimed at destroying the spiritual roots of the Czech nation and to reduce its chance of revival in the future. These killings and the brutalities perpetrated as a regular occurence during the years of occupation between 1939 and 1945 set in motion the developments that eventually made it possible for the Communists to seize power in Czechoslovakia. The war thus became the most significant factor without which Communism had no chance to establish its tyranny over the peoples of Czechoslovakia and other nations in Central and Eastern Europe. The remembrance of these tragedies is meant to serve as a reminder that to fight against evil in all its forms remains a constant obligation of man. Pittsburgh, October 29, 1982 ★ ★ ★ ACADEMIC PROGRAM Twenty-eight sessions, most consisting of five papers or panel discussions, were scheduled between the afternoon of Thursday, October 28 and Sunday noon, October 31. They were held either in the classrooms of the Pittsburgh University’s Cathedral of Learning or in the modern Forbes Quadrangle. Abstracts (SVU Press, 1982, 109p.) and detailed programs in English were made available for the complex logistics of the academic part of the Congress. We can only list here the individual sessions: “Western Europe and North America - One or Two Civilizations?”; “Cultural History”; The Women Question”; “Initial Unionistic Endeavors Toward Church Unity”; “Lingusistics I & II”; “Readings by Authors from Current Writings”; “Aspects of Czech and Slovak Art”; “History of Art”; “♦Commemorative Panel on Jan Masaryk”; “Philosophy”; “*Philosophy and Political Foundations of Czechoslovak Foreign Policy”; “Contemporary Czechoslovakia”; “Medicine”; “Literature I & II”; “Modern History”; “Anthropology”; “Czechoslovakia, Eastern Europe, the USSR and the West”; “Czechoslovak Economy at Crossroads: Stagnation or Reform?”; “History of Science”; “International Relations”; “Contemporary Poland and Czechoslovakia”; “Assorted Issues in Czechoslovak/East European Economics”; “The Natural Sciences”; “Music”; “Social Sciences”; “Sport and Physical Education”; and finally “Reanimatology and New Definition of Death.” ♦Presented in Czech. ★ ★ ★ 7 [pageend7]SPECIAL EVENTS On Thursday, October 28, two special events took place, both in the Frick Fine Arts Building: an opening of the art exhibit at 5:30 p.m. and the Commemoration of Czechoslovak Independence Day that brought the day to a close. Director of the exhibit, Ladislav Hanka, chose as its title “Czechoslovakian Artists Working Abroad.” The twenty-five exhibitors, living in the U.S., Canada and Europe, represent many styles and media, as well as several generations. According to the program data, their schooling and dates of birth range from a Prague-formed painter born in 1914 to a photographer born in the U.S. in 1960. The 28th October celebration was hosted and coordinated by the Czechoslovak Room Committee, chaired by former SVU Vice-President Milan P. Getting, Jr. One of the main discourses of the program, entitled “Nationality Rooms and Intercultural Exchange Programs, Past and Present,” was movingly presented by Mrs. Ruth Crawford Mitchell, Director Emeritus and a faithful friend of Czechoslovakia. Mr. Paul Štefánik and Ms. Oxanne Kaufman from the Hillman Library delivered the “Acceptance of Slovak Bible.” Two Pittsburgh-based Slovak groups presented their folk dancing and singing. American and Czechoslovak anthems were sung by the audience at the opening of the program. Friday night was reserved for the customary SVU Banquet and Ball, in the course of which Honorary Membership was awarded to Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar, and Dr. Ivan Getting. All the participants seemed to enjoy the social whirl iriThe Club Rooms of the Pittsburgh Athletic Association. V: Czechoslovak Writers Forum was coordinated by Jiri Kovtun from the Library of Congress něxt day in the afternoon. The audience had many questions and comments for the discussants, writers Josef Skvorecky and Arnošt Lustig. Heinz Chapel provided the setting for the evening Organ Recital featuring organ works by Czech and Slovak composers, from the 18th century to the present, alternated with vocal numbers sung in Czech. SVU member Karel Paukert performed at the organ. He was assisted by Noriko Fujii, soprano. Mr. Paukert currently holds the position of Curator of Musical Arts at the Cleveland Museum of Art and Miss Fujii is-é member of the music faculty of Cleveland State University. The final event of the Congress was a “Czech and Slovak Film Showing” on Sunday afternoon. ★ ★ ★ THANKS FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE CONGRESS The President and the Officers of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences wish to express their deep gratitude to Professor Burkart Holzner, Director of the Center for International Studies of the University of Pittsburgh, for his invaluable assistance in preparing the Eleventh World Congress of 1982. The Society also acknowledges with thanks the cooperation of the Center's staff, especially Dr. Joe Makarewicz and Ms. Linda Hudak, who helped organize various technical aspects of the Congress.♦ 8 [pageend8]I wish to particularly thank Professors Jan F. Tříska, Milan Fryščák, Jan Various, Věra Láska, Wilma Iggers and Peter Safar for their generous help in organizing the academic sessions.

Thanks go to them and to all active participants in the academic program, as well as to their appreciative audience. ★ ★ ★ THE CZECHOSLOVAK NATIONALITY ROOM, UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH, CATHEDRAL OF LEARNING, 113 One of the interesting features of this SVU Congress was its location in a city very conscious of its ethnic heritage. A number of Nationality Rooms are a part of the unique 42-story Cathedral of Learning that towers over the campus. A permanent committee for the building of the national room was established in 1927. Its members, official sponsors and contributors came from both sides of the Atlantic. Prague architect Bohumil Slama drew the plans. The wood and many of the other materials were sent from Czechoslovakia. In 1938 the painter Karel Svolinsky and his wife arrived in Pittsburgh to decorate the room in an authentic folk style. 9 [pageend9]The portrait panels depicting Cyril and Methodius, King St. Wenceslas, Jan Hus, Comenius, Jan Kollar, Ludevit Stur and Bishop Stefan Moyzes were painted in Prague by Richard Wiesner. A bronze portrait of T. G. Masaryk was created by the sculptor O. Spaniel. Embedded in the wall is the English translation of the royal proclamation issued by Charles IV on the occasion of founding the University of Prague in 1348. Some correspondence with President Masaryk is also kept in the room. The Czechoslovak Nationality Room was officially dedicated on March 7, 1939 a week before Czechoslovakia was occupied by Hitler. Jan Masaryk was one of the speakers on that occasion. Later that fatal spring Dr. Eduard Benes and Mrs. Hana Benes visited the room, and Dr. Alice Masaryk delivered a speech there. “The Czechoslovak Room is one of the few places in the world where there is recognition of the historic ideals of the Czech and Slovak peoples,” according to the University of Pittsburgh publicity material. POST-CONGRESS DECISIONS In the subsequent meetings of the Executive Board the following decisions were made: Ing. Milos K. Kucera from New York was duly elected as Secretary General. Dr. Jaroslav Nemec from Washington, D.C., consented to edit Zprávy, as he had done in the past. His proposal to appoint Miss Irena Lettrich as Slovak editor for Zprávy was unanimously approved. Editor of the Bulletin: Dr. Zdenka E. Fischmann from California was reappointed. SVU Books: Mrs. Ružena Bunza will continue to take care of this function. Chairpersons of several committees were appointed: Publications: Vice-President Jiri Nehnevajsa Local Chapters: Vice-President Igor V. Nabelek Fund Drive and Public Relations: Vice-President Charles S, Bednar World Congress and Annual Conferences: Vice-President Thomas G. Winner Conciliation and Arbitration, and Committee for the By-laws: Dr. Jiri Glos The nominations for chairperson for Membership Committee and the editor for Proměny have not yet been confirmed. ★ t + irir-fr-fc-fririrjr-fr IO [pageend10]SVU Activities NEW BIOGRAPHICAL DIRECTORY The fifth edition of the SVU Biographical Directory was almost ready for print by the time of the Congress. We repeat the pre-publication offer of a reduced price of $7.00. The Directory will be later sold for $10.00 (members) and $15.00 (non-members). Inquiries are to be directed to the editor of the Directory, Mrs. Eva Rechcigl, 1703 Mark Lane, Rockville, MD 20852. ★ ★ ★ INVENTORY OF CZECHS AND SLOVAKS ABROAD AND OF INDIVIDUALS WITH A PROFESSIONAL INTEREST IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA This important SVU project was described in detail in Bulletin II/3, September 1982. Dr. Miloslav Rechcigl (1703 Mark Lane, Rockville, MD 20852) director and coordinator of this activity, appeals to all readers to send him data on persons who fall, or seem to fall, into the above categories. At this stage he is collecting names and materials (press cuttings, obituaries, references from various Who’s Who and similar publications, addresses of persons to contact, etc.). He is especially interested in finding second and subsequent generations of individuals of Czech and Slovak descent who might have lost direct contact with Czechoslovak organizations but are significantly contributing to the growth of their countries of residence. Of equal interest are the persons of other ethnic backgrounds who work in some fields related to Czechoslovak topics. The inventory is a vast project that requires the cooperative effort of many volunteers. However, those who send materials should not expect much correspondence. Dr. Rechcigl and coworkers will eventually critically evaluate all data. For the time being duplications or “doubtful” materials do not matter. The idea is to call attention to the biggest possible number of persons as to make the inventory all-inclusive and representative of Czechoslovak ethnic history abroad. As an example of a second generation Czech-American’s success we want to stress the recognition given to the work of Mary T. Absolon. She is a graduate of Case Western Reserve University, and her specialty is community health nursing, with a focus on health planning. She was active with the Ohio Nurses Association as Assistant Executive Director. On the occasion of her retirement from that position, the Ohio Senate adopted a resolution, No. 1575 of November 1, 1982 recognizing her efforts on behalf of the nurses in Ohio and honoring her for establishing the legislative department for the Association. She now accepted a similar position in Minnesota. Mary, a member of Sigma Theta Tau and a consultant for several nurses’ organizations, is the eldest of four children of Dr. Karel Absolon and follows in the footsteps of her mother who has also been a nurse. She is proud of her Czechoslovak heritage and her SVU membership. We urge all readers to let Dr. Rechcigl know what their children and grandchildren are doing, since this is a very important aspect of the inventory. ★ ★ ★ 11 [pageend11]KOSMAS The first issue of Kosmas, the new English journal of the Society, has been recently sent to subscribers and the second issue is in print. The first volume was edited by Professor John N. Bradley, University of Manchester. An Executive Editorial Board, composed of Karel B. Absolon, Jiri Nehnevajsa, Leopold Pospisil and Miloslav Rechcigl, all SVU officers, and an International Editorial Board of honorary and executive members were established to promote the journal as widely as possible. The “Editorial Avant-Propos” states that “the Editor, all the staff and members of the board are not entirely satisfied with the shape of the first issue. However difficult a beginning this may be, henceforth only improvements can follow.” Whatever imperfections or practical problems might be alluded to in that statement, they will certainly be resolved with time. The content of the first issue is of interest and the format seems to be adequate. Some biographical data on the authors would be welcome. Also welcome would be uniform information on all articles. It is not clear, for instance, whether “extracts” were taken from published works and whether the authors were responsible for the English version, in the event of works originally published in another language. The current presentation of such “extracts” whets the reader’s appetite without guiding him/her toward the source for further reading. Some articles apparently had been written specifically for this issue, and that fact should also be confirmed for accurate future reference. However, a good start has been made, and we hope many persons will want to have a complete Kosmas on their bookshelves. We reprint the contents of the first issue as well as subscription information. Please take notice that, starting with the second volume, scientific contributions should be addressed to Professor Zdenek Suda, newly appointed as Editor. Also, subscriptions of non-members should be paid directly to the publisher. SVU members can subscribe Kosmas with their yearly dues. ★ ★ ★ JAN LOEWENBACH SCHOLARSHIP We informed in September 1981 about the establishment of the Jan Loewenbach Graduate Scholarship in Musicology in Czechoslovak Music by the department of Music, San Diego State University.

SVU lost in him an honorary member and a teacher-colleague of many Czechoslovak linguists, especially those belonging to the Prague Linguistic Circle, which he cofounded during his years as a Professor of Slavic Studies at the Charles University in Prague and later the Masaryk University in Brno (1921-1939). After he came to the United States at the beginning of World War II, his influence on innumerable students at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as the impact of his lectures delivered in six languages all over the world, were immeasurable. The bibliography published at the time of his 75th anniversary carried five hundred titles of books and essays. Even then, Jakobson, nominally retired as Professor Emeritus, continued to write and publish, adding another hundred titles. However, he did not live to see the publication of his Dialogues, a collection of conversations with his wife Krystyna Pomorska, a Polish philologist. The book was siated to appear two months after his untimely demise. Roman Jakobson was born in Moscow, received his doctorate in Prague during his exile in Czechoslovakia, and arrived in the U.S. after living in Norway and Sweden. He could read approximately twenty-five languages and used different languages for different areas of his life. At home with his wife he spoke Polish, for literature preferred French, for scholarly work English, and for politics Czech, thus reflecting verbally and emotionally various stages of his life history. He was personally acquainted with such Russian poets as Mayakovsky and Pasternak, numerous Czech writers and poets, President Masaryk and many other well-known personalities. Over the years he wrote with the same depth on subjects as varied as Nej stars: ceske pisne duchovni (The Oldest Czech Religious Songs), Questions de poetique, Form und Sinn, New Trends in the Science of Language or a structural analysis of one of Shakespeare’s sonnets (with L.G. Jones). He also edited Studies in General and Oriental Linguistics (with Shigeo Kawamoto). In 1968 a festschrift entitled To Honor Roman Jakobson: Essays on the Occasion of His Seventieth Birthday was published in three volumes totalling 2464 pages, by Mouton Publishers in Holland to which over two hundred philologists contributed in English, French, Italian, German, Russian and Serbocroatian. His Studies in Verba Art. Texts in Czech and Slovak were published on the occasion of the author’s seventy-fifth birthday by the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences and the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 1971. The book is out of print, but the University of Michigan (Modern Languages Building, Ann Arbor, MI 48109) offers Jakobson’s The Framework of Language (paperback, $6.00). Another festschrift, Studies Presented to Professor Roman Jakobson by His Students, E. Gribble, ed. (1968, 333 p., soft cover $12.95) is available from Slavic Publishers (Box 14388, Columbus, OH 43214). A new book, Brain and Language.

His friends will remember him as a man whose person radiated composure, an undying optimism and a faith in man and God which one can attain only through years of living, and the wisdom that is granted to those who have lived well. His life was a happy and rich one. He had known suffering and the sorrow of being parted forever from his beloved homeland, but he could always find happiness in the joy of the moment, in communion with nature. He was not rich in earthly possessions, but in that he had a wealth of knowledge and experience, endless interest in life and an ever increasing circle of friends and family whom he held dear. He spent most of his life in exile, during both World Wars and after the 1948 Communist coup in Czechoslovakia; in 1949 he left his native country for the last time, never to return. He studied at Charles University in Prague and found employment with the Skoda Works in Prague. In 1934 he was sent to Iran, as director of the Skoda Works in Teheran. He spent twelve years in Iran. He was recalled in 1939 to Prague when the Skoda Works became part of the German Goeringwerke. He refused to collaborate with the Germans and was dismissed. He remained in Teheran as the Head of the Committee for Free Czechoslovakia under the tutelage of the British and French embassies in Teheran. In 1941, when the Czechoslovak government in exile from London sent a military mission and its diplomatic representative to Iran, Josef Zanda returned to his former position with the Skoda Works. He returned to Prague in 1946. In 1949 he was once more sent to Teheran, on the insistence of the Iranian government. When his daughters escaped to West Germany, Josef Zanda asked for political asylum in Iran and left the Skoda Works. He rejoined his family in La Paz, Bolivia in 1951. The last 30 years carried him through South America - he also lived in Brazil and Peru - to the U.S. in 1958, where he lived in Salt Lake City, Denver, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and Thousand Oaks. Among his other activities, Mr. Zanda collected materials for the SVU archive. One of his greatest concerns was attracting to the Society the younger generation of our compatriots, those who need and want to maintain emotional and intellectual connections with their roots in spite of their education in English-speaking schools. Consequently, Mr. Zanda always supported SVU editorial plans for publications in English. We received in sorrow the sad news of his passing. In spite of some health problems he had, we expected that we would celebrate his 90th birthday in February 1983. V.B. ***★*★**★★★***★★★*****★*****★★** 16 [pageend16]What’s Your Thing?

As we approach the Centennial of Franz Kafka’s birth on Juiy 3, 1983, the “Kafka industry” works full blast. One of the most beautiful tangible “outputs” is the traveling exhibit arranged by the Jewish Diaspora Museum in Tel Aviv. After a successful stop in New York the 100-odd photos of Kafka’s 41-year lifetime came to the B’nai B’rith Klutznick Museum in Washington. The eerily haunting black-and-white pictures were mostly taken by Jan Parik, 1946 graduate in cinematography from the Arts Academy of Prague who fled to West Germany in 1965. In 1979 the International Center of Photography (ICP) in New York bought the bulk of the photos. The exhibit features the writer, his family, his women, manuscripts and letters, plus photos of the city where he lived and wrote his books. The pictures and captions artfully and carefully flesh out the life and times of this peddler of despair, who as it turns out, had his moments of happiness: he fell in love with Milena Jesenská, a young Czech writer, and with Dora Diamant, his teenage mistress, who nursed him before his death from tuberculosis. He also had moments of hope. Born to a well-to-do Jewish family, Kafka dreamed in his final years of emigrating to Palestine. Much of the collection concerns Kafka’s growing interest in Judaism and his deepening commitment to Zionism. The exhibits are tastefully presented in easily digested segments: childhood, Jewish identity, women, and works. Old photos are intermingled with pictures by Parik: thoroughfare along the Masny Trh (Meat Market) where Kafka attended elementary schc >1; workers district in Karlin where Kafka often went as an accident inspector for the government; the many staircases at Kafka’s apartment on Bilkova ulice which look endless and inaccessible; corridors and streets which seem infinite, with big and frightening buildings; night shots where street lamps look like fallen stars. All appearing in the part of the display showing Kafka’s final years. The captions tell us that Kafka got a law degree so he could support himself while he was writing. At the Workers Accident Insurance Institute he handled safety ratings of industrial plants - a sort of OSHA — working deep in bureaucracy’s corridors of despair. He knew at first hand the arrogance, incompetence and meaningless hostility of petty clerkdoms and 17 [pageend17]the mindless routines and regulations that eroded souls of clerks as well as souls of their harassed and baffled victims. “How modest these men are,” he wrote. “They come to us and beg. Instead of storming the institute and smashing it to little pieces, they come to beg... ” This captures the essence of the nightmare in The Trial and The Castie. Kafka had little sense of family. He rarely spoke to his parents or his three younger sisters. Yet he longed to be a family man. He remained in contact with women all his life, corresponding with them for years after the love affairs ended. Two of his “flames” died in concentration camps; so did all three of Kafka’s sisters. The visit to the Klutznik Museum is rewarding in many other ways. The B’nai B’rith exhibit was accompanied by a series of Sunday afternoon lectures, presented by prominent “workers in the Kafka industry.” And the museum gift shop carries a line of Kafka’s books, as well as a booklet on the Centennial Tribute to the B’nai B’rith in Europe, the world’s largest and oldest Jewish service organization which was founded in 1843. It contains a list of 16 lodges in pre-World War II Czechoslovakia, with names of all its 1936 officers, as well as the March 4, 1944 Charter Presentation of the Josef Popper Lodge in Forest Hills, New York, founded by Czechoslovak refugees. The JP Lodge, named after the BB President in Czechoslovakia, is still active. Another curiosity are the 1967 Judaica series of five stamps printed as part of government plans to commemorate the millenium of Jewish presence in Czechoslovakia. After the demise of Dubček’s regime (“Prague Spring”) and the Soviet invasion of August 1968, all preparations for celebrations had to be scrapped, because the new official policy was opposed to presenting Jewish heritage and culture in a favorable light or inspiring sympathy by remembering the Holocaust tragedy. By then, however, it was too late to cancel the issue of stamps which feature different aspects of Jewish cultural heritage in Czechoslovakia over the past thousand years. The stamps became “officially” unavailable; recently some were rediscovered. The designs are based on Jewish objects, confiscated by Nazi “Final Solution” experts and destined for the Anti-Jewish Archives the Nazis planned on the site of the ancient Prague Ghetto: (a) an embroidered torah curtain dated 1593; (b) a 1530 coat-of-arms of the Prague Jewish Printers Guild; (c) clay water or wine jug originally belonging to the Mutual Funeral Society in the thriving Jewish community of Mikulov (Nickolsburg); (d) the 1268 early gothic “Old-New” Synagogue (“Alt-Neu Schul”), still standing, a splendid landmark of the former Prague Ghetto; and (e) memorial candelabra from Pinkas synagogue in Prague, pictured against the background of names of World War II concentration camps where most Czechoslovak Jews perished. The series of stamps, all officially cancelled in 1967 by the Czechoslovak Postal Service, can be obtained from Goodwill Ambassador (P.O. Box 26 - Station “A,” Flushing, N.Y. 11358). The permanent exhibits of the Klutznik Museum also contain a collection of banknotes used in the Terezin (Theresienstadt) concentration camp during World War II. In short, a visit to the Klutznik Museum is a worthwhile venture into Judaica Czechoslovakiana. Frank Meissner Washington, D.C ★ ★ ★ 18 [pageend18]Kafka’s “Metamorphosis” in Los Angeles A staged version of Kafka’s novella by Steven Berkoff had a run in Los Angeles Mark Taper Forum in October 1982. The unhappy (anti)hero Gregor was played by Brad Davis. Los Angeles Times Theater Critic Dan Sullivan called his performance “a heroic one.” Davis created.“a striking physical impression of a human soul cramped into the machinery of a bug,” making the audience ‘‘feel the shame of bughood.” The actor managed to convey this image with the aid of whiteface makeup of a mime only. The adaptation and staging were an interesting attempt to interpret this tragic “Oedipus-in-reverse” situation of a father killing his son. ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ BOOKS OF INTEREST Field, Henry: The White House Years 1941-1945 Field Research Project Publ., P.O. Box 585, Cocoanut Grove, Florida 33133; $10.95, pp. 134. Hardbound To be a scientist and explorer should be enough of an ambition for a lifetime. If we add to it the ability to write, organize enterprises such as major scientific expeditions, we describe Henry Field: scientist, humanist, explorer. Field undoubtedly received some of these characteristics from the cultural endeavors of the Marshall Field clan of Chicago. A good reason for Henry Field to be a member of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences is his interest in the culture, albeit prehistoric, of Central Europe and Czechoslovakia. I have personal reasons to write this essay. His association with my father, Karel Absolon, Professor of Geography at Charles University in Prague, spanned several decades from 1927 on. In addition, a book I had written, the Conquest, in part a philosophical study of the human desire to conquer, was printed by the “Field Enterprises.” I really got to know Henry Field only in recent years when I realized that his knowledge of the Moravian Karst allowed him to edit with understanding my monograph Conquest for the English speaking reader. The White House Years is Henry Field’s most recent book, an account of his service as a special advisor to Presidents Roosevelt ..nd Truman on Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. This volume follows The Track of Man. Adventures of an Anthropologist which was published in four editions, including Braille. The Middle East remains a focus of political turmoil; Henry Field’s analyses thus are especially pertinent to our daily events. As a world-renowned anthropologist, familiar with the people, language and terrain of southwestern Asia, who grew up and was educated in England at Eton and Oxford, Dr. Field was commandeered early in 1941 for a special White House intelligence unit. He served in the COI and the OSS under General Donovan and performed several high priority assignments for FDR, including the “M” Project, a master plan for the resettlement of displaced persons, and special missions to Trinidad and Tobago. 19 [pageend19]Written in a warm and entertaining style, The White House Years relates Dr. Field’s personal observations of such persons as General MacArthur, General Bill Donovan, Lord Halifax, the Kennedys and Stalin, as well as his experiences with President Roosevelt and President Truman. Historians, librarians, fellow scientists, and all avid general readers will find Henry Field’s inside story an important addition to their collections about World War P Henry Field’s The White House Years complements his Trail Blazers: Chicago to Moscow (1980), an informal portrait of bold, influential personalities encountered during his sojourns in Chicago, Washington, Europe, Africa, the Near East, and the Soviet Union. Included are Adlai Stevenson; the industrialist William Bendix; Nazi prisoner Ernest Hanfstaengl; Abbe' Breuil, world authority on cave art; and the Sheiks and scientists who crossed his path. His Arabian Desert Tales: Between the Two Great Wars (1977) is now used in ARAMCO training programs. It provides insight into the character and life of desert dwellers. It captures the spirit on the North Arabian desert through stories of the Bedouins, the oil field workers, and the pilgrims, scholars and travelers who ventured there. About the Author: “What is your greatest wish?’’ a student recently asked. Henry Field replied without hesitation: “To see the Peking man and the recent excavations in China.” Now approaching eighty, Dr. Field’s search for Ancient Man began in his boyhood when, with high hopes, he excavated a barrow in Leicestershire where he was brought up by his American mother and English stepfather. Aside from brief interruption, such as the war years, this quest has preoccupied him throughout his lifetime, taking him to the deserts of the world: the North Arabian Desert, the Sahara, Cholistan and Gobi. It has drawn him into the depth of caves and to the high plateaus where conditions might have favored the development of the Early Man. With a doctorate in science from Oxford University, he has been associated with the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Harvard University’s Peabody Museum, the University of Miami, the University of California and other learned institutions. He has led, or participated in twelve major expeditions to Europe, Asia, Africa and Mongolia. His publications, both scientific and popular, are voluminous. He works daily at his desk completing Volume III of The Track of Man and edits scientific manuscripts. Henry Field and Czechoslovakia. When Henry Field made one of his many trips to Czechoslovakia, it was for the purpose of participating in Professor Karel Absolon’s excavations of the prehistoric man in the Pekarna cave in the Moravian Karst and the Venus locality of Dolni Věstonice (Wisternitz) in Southern Moravia. He also viewed the development of Absolon’s “Anthropos” Institute for study of man in Brno. His duty as a curator of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago was to purchase materials for an exhibit of the prehistoric man. One item he hoped to acquire was the world-famous “Venus of Věstonice.” He thus offered $100,000 to Absolon for the statuette of the well-endowed female. Absolon naturally could never have parted from this unique find, but, as he did not receive compensation from the authorities for his excavations, he let 20 [pageend20]Henry Fieid negotiate with Czechoslovak authorities, including Eduard Benes, then the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Dr. Benes refused the offer for the Venus; it is now exhibited in Chicago, in exchange for reducing the Czechoslovak foreign debt. The Ministry of Culture shortly afterwards fulfilled the order to repay Absolon’s expenses for his scientific explorations. This was one of Henry Field’s contributions to the continued explorations in the prehistoric localities in Moravia. Today’s visitors to Field’s Natural History Museum in Chicago can view an exhibit of the prehistoric man of Czechoslovakia, Like the great Czech- American anthropologist Ales Hrdlicka, Henry Field has become a contributor to Czechoslovak arts and sciences.

IX+ 319, $12.75, paper. An exhaustive review of the above book by Anthony T. Bouscaren, Le Moyne College, was published in The American Political Sciences Review, Vol. 76, p. 713. We quote briefly from the review: Professor Kalvoda left his native Czechoslovakia'in 1948 and returned in 1968, in time to observe the “Prague Spring” and the Soviet invasion. He has drawn on many previously untapped Soviet and Czech Communist documents to provide us with new insights into relationships between Soviet and Czech leaders. Fifty-eight pages of notes are filled with additional information, and the bibliography is excellent. The author analyzes the politics and foreign policy of Czechoslovakia from its birth through 1968. Tomas Masaryk and Eduard Benes are faulted for their failure to perceive Soviet designs. ★ The Communists could have seized complete power in 1945, according to Kalvoda, but decided to “play a comedy with democracy” in order to “attain their domestic objective more efficiently and to promote the objectives of Stalin’s overall strategy for extending Communist power far beyond the borders of Czechoslovakia.” Kalvoda believes that an abrupt Soviet take-over would have had an adverse effect on British and U.S. behavior. The 1948 Soviet coup was facilitated by the Socialist failure to support the democratic opposition, the weak role played by President Benes, and the inability of the democratic parties to detect the Soviet role in playing divide and conquer of the Slovak issue. “The lack of solidarity of the Czech ‘democrats’ with their Slovak colleagues weakened the democratic forces.. .and facilitated the arrival of the second stage of the revolution in February 1948” (p. 214.) The author clarifies the curious roles played by Antonin Novotny in 1967 and Alexander Dubček in 1968 as party secretaries. The Soviets installed Novotny thinking he would be a hard-liner, which he was not. Novotny’s ouster was also facilitated by the rupture of diplomatic relations with Israel and the ensuing fear of anti-Semitism. Then the Soviets turned to Dubček, considering him to be “our Sasha” (Brezhnev). This also turned out to be incorrect. ★ In his conclusions the author declares (p. 285): “People living in free countries ought not to repeat the mistakes which have been made by Masaryk and Benes. The events in Portugal in 1975 have demonstrated, again, that communism is not merely a Russian problem and that no country should take for granted its complete immunity to a revolution mounted from within by a small but determined minority led by professional revolutionaries.” 21 [pageend21]SVU member Josef Kalvoda is Professor of History and Political Science at St. Joseph College, West Hartford. One of his latest studies is “Czech and Slovak Prisoners of War in Russia During the War and Revolution” (p. 215), in Essays on World War I: Origins and Prisoners of War, edited by Samuel R. Williamson, Jr. and Peter Pastor (New York: Social Science Monographs^ Brooklyn College Press, distributed by CUNY, 1983). Another essay in this monograph also directly pertains to Czechoslovakia: Rowan A. "Williams’ “The Czech Legion in Italy During World War I” (p. 199). ★ ★ ★ Dr. Vera Laska, Chairman of the Division of Social Sciences and professor of History at Regis College, Weston, had her book Benjamin Franklin, The Diplomat published last June.

K. Sharpe, 1982; 200 p., $20.00 This is a comprehensive overview of national urban and settlement system strategies as they have evolved in the U.S.S.R. and the socialist countries in Eastern Europe: Czechoslovakia, Poland, German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. To the lay reader Musil offers some understanding of the complex situation in urban policy development during the past twenty years in socialist countries of Europe. The most striking difference between the professions of urban planning in the West and those in Eastern Europe is that, unlike its capitalist counterpart, socialist urbanization is a planned and managed process within the framework of settlement economics. Yet, it is surprising how similar are the conceptual and technical problems faced by urbanists both in the West and the East, when they try to show policy makers what to do, how, and why. The numerous economic and industrial development policies, as well as urban settlement strategies of the eight socialist countries, provide a wealth of relevant experience to other countries on the verge of leaning toward national rather than traditionally decentralized urban policy approaches. This centralization is forced on us by the energy crisis, shortage of national resources, growing concern with environmental protection and other “blessings” of the twentieth century. If nothing else, Musil’s review of experiences of the socialist world at least provides us with useful lessons about urbanization strategies that should be avoided. That alone justifies the price of this book.

CONTRACT FOR COMBAT BOOTS Excerpt June 1, 1982 The U.S. Department of Defense has awarded a $10.1 million contract to the Bata Shoe Co. to manufacture combat boots, a company official says. The company, located in Belcamp, Md., won the bid for a boot it has made since 1971 that has a retail price of $70. “It’s a cold-weather boot that keeps a soldier warm down to 50 degrees Fahrenheit below zero,” said Bata spokesman Albert Kotras. The boot weighs 3 pounds and contains multiple layers of nylon, rubber and felt. Kotras said the contract does not mean Bata, whose work force of 1600 is the largest for any private company in Harford County, will hire more workers. “This just means that the workers making this shoe will keep on working,” he said. Employees in a few departments, including the one that makes sneakers, were laid off because of lack of work, Kotras added. Belcamp is the main Bata plant in the United States. The Bata Shoe Co. of Canada, Ltd. is located in Batawa, Ont. where the President, Thomas John Bata, SVU member, works. The Bata organization has been often called “the Ford company of Czechoslovakia.” The founder, Thomas Bata, Sr. started it in Zlin, Moravia, at the time of the First Republic, but today it is an international company with factories and stores in all corners of the free world. To be a “Batovec,” a “Bata-man,” usually has meant a life-long career. The company, and this Society, just lost one of the “Bata-men.” Dr. Karel Cvachovec, expert in corporate and international law, and graduate of Charles University in Prague, joined the Company in Czechoslovakia, moved to Canada in 1950 and retired in 1972. He tragically perished on October 23, 1982 as a victim of a car accident in Miami, shortly before lis 74th birthday. ★ ★ ★ A CZECH SINGER IN SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE Miluška Šimkova, SVU member, sang in the Sydney production of Janacek’s Jenufa and in Puccini’s Suor Angelica.
