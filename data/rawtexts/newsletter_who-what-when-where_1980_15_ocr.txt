Its path is far from straight,its turns and renewed take-offs take us often by surprise. Five years ago, in Hel- sinki,several governments with a record of systematic suppression of basic liberties did not hesitate to affix their signature on an international document which among other thing stipulates that the "participating states will respect fundamental rights and freedoms... pro- mote and encourage the effective exercise of civil, political; economic, social, cultural and other rights and freedoms... and respect the freedom of the individual to profess and practice... religion or beliefs in accordance with the dictates of his own conscience.” r SUGGESTIONS (green pages) Í" USEFUL ADDRESSES _______ 0 FUNDS SOLICITED (beige pages) U r g OURSELVES (salmon pages) g g ! we have READ ן LATE NEWS (blue pages) K Q___INDEX________________ (white oaaes) No doubt, the governments in question conside- red the Helsinki Final Act as yet another pie- ce of paper which may as well be forgotten at the very moment of tis signature. How wrong they were 1 Human rights activists in practi- cally all the countries, notably in the Soviet Union, have'made of the Helsinki pledges both a weapon and a shield, have formed citizens' Helsinki Watch Groups, and did not cease to demand, openly and courageously, that the humanitarian clauses of the Final Act be at least partially honoured and applied. Thus one may speak to-day about an international soli- daritv movement of the oppressed which, in turn, is being silenced and persecuted, its protagonists jailed or exiled -all being guilty of requesting their respectives govern- ments to honour their own solemn obligations’ IT IS UNTHINKABLE that this fact alone, richly documented, would not form the very corner- stone of the preparatory sessions to, and the actual meeting of, the CSCE review conference in Madrid. To make sure that there would be no prevarications on the part of the participating states, a number of human rights groups, among them Help and Action Coordination Committee, have prepared voluminous documentation on the persecution of Helsinki Watch Groups (see in this issue under Ľ) and will insist that dele- gates to the Madrid conference take up this particular matter in all committee and plenary [pageend1]sessions dealing with the application of humanitarian clauses of the Final Act. In addition, HELP and ACTION, in cooperation with other similar groups, has opened a permanent office in Madrid (for details see pages D,D1,H), where documents, films, exhibitions etc., will be avail- able both to the delegates and to the public. THE WORKERS}’ REVOLT IN GDANSK and the wave of the strikes which enveloped Poland in the past weeks, have already made history, whatever the final out- come may be. Or, more precisely, this is an event of historic importance in the never-ending, bloody but glorious struggle for the life of every indi- vidual in freedom, justice and dignity. PLEASE JOIN US IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS MOTORCADE from Helsinki to Madrid (for details see pages H1,H2 Of this NEWSLETTER) [pageend2]A In need of HELP _TATIANA VELIKANOVA^,. The prominent Soviet human rights activist, 48, one of the founders of the Helsinki group monitoring the Soviet Unions's compliance with the Helsinki Final Act (see also Newsletter N°12 under A) , was found guilty (on 29 August in Moscow) of "anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda". She was sentenced to four years in a strict-regime labour camp and five years internal exile. RELATIVES emerging from the courtroom in east Moscow said that spectators at the trial shouted, "Not Enough! Not Enough!" as the sentence was read out. Most of Mrs. Velikanova's own supporters were barred from the three-day trial. Shortly after Mrs. Velikanova was sentenced, a van believed to be carrying her left the courthouse. About 20 of her supporters called out her name as the van departed. Her son, Mr. Fyodor Babitsky, who was allowed into the courtroom from which western correspondents were barred, declared that his mother said nothing when the sentence was announced, though she said after an earlier trial session : "The farce is over." THE COURT found Miss Velikanova guilty of participating in the production and distribution of the Chronicle of Current Events, a samizdat publication that for more than 12 years detailed arrests, searches and trials of dissidents. Mrs. Velikanova is one of the central figures of the dwindling band of Soviet dissidents. Until her arrest last November, she regularly informed foreign journalists of arrests and trials against opponents of the regime, especially members of un- recognized religious sects and Soviet minorities, such as Crimean Tatars and Volga Germans who had been deported to Central Asia under Stalin. (For action on behalf of Mrs.Veli- kanova see under E). GLEB YAKUNIN. The founder of the unofficial Christian Committee for the Defense of Believers Rights, 46, and a Russian Orthodox priest (see also Newsletter N°13 under A) was sentenced in Moscow on 28 August to five years hard labour and five years internal exile. The charge : "anti-Soviet propaganda and agitation". YAKUNIN WAS ARRESTED ON NOVEMBER 1, 1979 at the same time as Tatyana Velikanova. As with Yakunin, Western reporters were barred from both trials. Friends quoting Mr.Yakunin's wife, Iraida, who was the only relative allowed into his trial, said that he told the court that he did not consider his activity as head of the Believers' Rights Committee as being anti- Soviet or aimed at subverting the Soviet State. Yakunin was quoted as saying : "I consider my activity as the action of my priestly religious conscience, as a Christian matter." (For action on Father Yakunin's behalf see under E). A [pageend3]ALEXANDER OGORODNIKOV. The third prominent human rights activist to be sentenced in the Soviet Union within two weeks. Ogorodnikov, 29, was found guilty, as Velikanova and Yakunin, of "anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda", and sentenced to six years in a labour camp followed by five years in internal exile. The verdict was passed after a two-day hearing on 5 September at Kalinin, 100 miles northwest of Moscow. IN EARLY 1979, Ogorodnikov was jailed for a year on charges of "parasitism" (see News tetter Nos.lO/A, 12/A, 13/A, 14/A). (For action on behalf of Ogorodnikov see under E in this issue). EDUARD ARUTYUNIAN. Mathematician, member of the Armenian Helsinki monitoring group (see News tetter N° 14 under A 6) was sentenced on March 10, 1980 to two-and-a-hatf years labour camp. This news became known in the West only in August. YURI ORLOV. Founder of the Helsinki "watch-dog" committee, 56, has been given a second six-month term of solitary confinement in the labour camp where he is serving a seven- year sentence. In a statment handed to Western reporters, Mrs. Orlov said her husband was being punished for comp- laining about delays in his personal correspondence and about general camp conditions. "HIS HEALTH HAS SEVERELY DETERIORATED", Mrs Orlov said."I fear that he will not survive the new term of prison con- finement." Orlov, completed one six-month term of solitary confinement last April in the punishment block of his "strict-regime" camp near Perm in the Urals: In May,1978, he was convicted of ,hnti-Soviet agitation and Dropaqanda" for his dissident activities and sentenced to seven years in labour camps to be followed by five years of exile. (See Newstetters N0S.13/B3, 14/B5.) VYACHESLAV CHORNOVIL. This Ukrainian human rights activist is gravely ill in a prison in Bolshaya Markhta in the Yakut Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. His wife reports that he looks 'like a skeleton" and is "extremely weak". He was sentenced on 6 June 198 0 to five years imprisonment. Chornovil was first arrested in November, 1967, after documenting and protesting against legal violations during trials of Ukrai- nian intellectuals in 1965 and 1966. He was convicted of "anti-Soviet propaganda" and served 18 months' imprisonment. After his release, Mr. Chornovil played an active part in the Ukrainian national rights movement, mainly defending other imprisoned dissidents. In January, 1972 he was re- arrested. While serving his second sentence he is known to [pageend4]A2 have been punished frequently for taking part in protest actions. ALEXANDER PODRABINEK. One of the founders of a group in the Soviet Union that has exposed the use of psychiatric hospitals for political purposes (see Newsletters Nos. 9/A1, 10/A1, E). Podrabinek was re-arrested on 13 June, 1980. He was first arrested in May 1978 for "anti-Soviet slander", and tried in August of that year. His arrest followed months of harassment, when he was constantly shadowed by the police and on a number of occasions threatened. Podrabinek is suffering from a liver disease and has lost a great deal of weight. KIRIL PODRABINEK, Alexander’s brother, has also been resentenced, according to the Association for Human Rights in Frankfurt/Main. On 15 March 1978, Kiril was sentenced to two-and-a-half years imprisonment and he served this sentence out at the Chistapol Prison in the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Republic. He has again been charged at the prison for "slandering the Soviet state and society". ROBERT NAZARYAN, 31, founder of the Armenian Helsinki Group was sentenced to five years in a strict regime camp, followed by two years' exile, after being found guilty of "anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda" by a court in Yerevan, Armenian SSR. He is now serving his sentence in a camp in the Urals (camp N°3, Mordovian ASSR). Nazaryan founded the Armenian Helsinki Group, together with Eduard Arutyunian, in April 1977. They announced their intention of fighting for human and national rights in Armenia and issued a number of documents describing the treat- ment of Armenian political prisoners in Soviet camps. The Helsinki Group was attacked in the Soviet Armenian press, which libelled Nazaryan in an article entitled "The False Prophet" (Sovetakan Haiastan, 5 May 1977) . (For action on behalf of Nazaryan see under E.) VASYL SEMYONOVICH STUS, 42, is a leading Ukrainian poet and translator who, until August 1979, was for nine years one of Amnesty International's "prisoners of conscience", having been sentenced in September 1972 to five years imprisonment and three years internal exile. Shortly after he returned home to Kiev, where he was placed under administrative surveillance by the KGB, he joined the Ukrainian Helsinki Watch Group in his home town. Nine months after his release, on 14 May 1980, Stus was re-arrested on the same charge of "anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda". He now faces a maximum sentence of ten years in a labour camp and five in "internal exile". (For action see under E). A2 [pageend5]A3 VIKTOR NEKIPELOV, 51, member of the Moscow Helsinki Group, was sentenced on 13 June, 1980 to seven years labour camp and five years internal exile (after a three-day trial at Kämest- kovo near Vladimir). He was arrested on 7 December 1979. Nekipelov served two years in labour camp in 1973-75 for contributing to the unofficial journal Potski. (Refer to Newsletter Nos. 11/A1, 13/A1, 14/A1.)(NOTE: The Helsinki Watch Committee in New York reported that by August 1980, forty-three "Helsinki monitors" in the Soviet Union were in prison or exiled. For action on behalf of these human rights activists see in this issue under E). VITALY KALYNYCHENKO, 42, has been sentenced in June 1980 to seven years imprisonment and three years internal exile for alleged "anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda".(See Newsletter Nos. 13/A, 14/A1.) MIKHAIL KHOREV, 48, the Baptist leader, was recently sent- enced to five years imprisonment for his religous activities, reported Amnesty International in the September issue of the organization's Newsletter. Pastor Khorev is said to be ill and almost blind.

KAREL SOUKUP, 29, the Czech pop group singer, was held on 1 July in Prague. Apparently he created a commotion by one of his songs at a wedding and was arrested for "disturbing the peace." The charge likely to be brought against him concerns disorderly con- duct and "incitation to subversive activity" and could result in a prison term of 6 months to three years. Soukup is a composer A4 For details about these prisoners see INDEX [pageend7]A5 and singer for the popular pop music group in Czechoslovakia, the Plastic People of the Universe. In addition to his musical career, he had joined Charter 77 which resulted in the termlna- tion of that career. Since that time he has worked as a lumber- man. RUDOLF BATTEK, 55, a spokesman for Charter 77 who was arrested in Prague on 14 June 1980, has been placed in detention pending trial on charges of "physically attacking a public official". The sociologist, who is also a member of the Committee for the Defence of the Unjustly Persecuted(VONS) ,faces, if convicted, a possible sentence of one to three years. Battek has been detained three times in the last three years, but never pro- secuted. Battek was recently entrusted by Charter 77 to take up contact with the Socialist International. OTKÁ BEDNÁŘOVÁ, 53, a member of VONS, formerly a prominent Czechoslovak journalist, was arrested in May, 1979 and sentenced in October to three years imprisonment. She is now gravely ill in Opava prison, suffering from chronic gall bladder inflammation, progressive liver damage and recurrent gynaecological haemorrhages. On 3 July 1980 the Opava Municipal Court rejected an appeal by Mrs. Bednářová for suspension of her sentence on health grounds. An appeal by her mother to the President of the Republic has been passed from the office of the President to the Ministry of Justice. Otká Bednářová has told her family that she has reached the end of her physical strength. (For action suggested see under E). JAROMIR SAVRDA, 47, a Czech writer and human rights activist, sentenced in August 1979 to two-and-a-half years in jail, is seriously ill and his life may be in danger (heart disease, tuberculosis). - In October 1979 Dr. Savrda’s wife appealed to the Czechoslovak President for pardon for her husband. How- ever, her appeal, as well as a subsequent letter written in March 1980, remain unanswered. In December 1979 Dr.Savdra's lawyer asked the Czechoslovak authorities for the second half of Dr. Savdra's sentence to be remitted. Following the Presi- dential amnesty of 8 May 1980, he also asked the Minister of Justice of the CSR for a re-examination of Dr.Savdra’s case. (For action on Savdra’s behalf see under E). IN YUGOSLAVIA, DR NIKOLA NOVAKOVIC, a former member of the Croatian Peasant Party, is said to be seriously ill in Foca prison. He was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment in August, 1977, for "establishing contact with hostile organizations abroad" and for disseminating "hostile propaganda". After his arrest, Dr.Novakovic is said to have been held in solitary confinement for over four months. He is now 67 and, as well as having a history of cardiac disorders, suffers from rheu- matism. Recently, he was reported to have undergone an operation. A5 [pageend8]A6 A RISE IN YUGOSLAV POLITICAL TRIALS was reported by Amnesty International in its August, 1980 Newsletter : "RECENT STATEMENTS by high ranking government officials have confirmed reports reaching Al that there has been an increase in the number of political trials in Yugoslavia over the past year. On 25 June 1980 the Federal Minister of the Interior, Franjo Herljevic, stated that 120 people had been prosecuted for anti-state activities since the beginning of 1979. And in a newspaper article a few days later the Federal Public Prosecutor, Dr. Vuko Gozzegucetic, spoke of a rise in the number of political offences since the end of 1979. The Federal Prosecutor attributed this rise to international political tensions and the activities of Yugoslav emigre organizations. (...) (Amnesty International) has recently adopted as prisoners of conscience eight ethnic Albanians sentenced on 9 June 1980 to prison terms ranging from three to eight years on charges of "hostile propaganda" and "association for the purpose of hostile propaganda"; the sentences were imposed by the district court of Pristina in the autonomous province of Kosovo. (...) IN MARCH 1980 the Yugoslav news media reported that 50 Kosovo Albanians were due to be tried; it is not known whether most of those arrested in late 1979 have been released or whether the trial on 9 June was merely the first of a series. Other Yugoslav prisoners of conscience adopted by Al since the beginning of 1980-all convicted of "hostile propaganda"- include: IVAN ZELEMBER, 46, sentenced in March 1980 by the district court of Osijek to 5 years’ imprisonment for bringing emigré journals into Yugoslavia; ZARKO ALEKSIC and MILORAD JOKSIMOVIC, sentenced in April 1980 by the district court of Doboj to seven and two and a half years' imprisonment respectively after being accused of praising the Chetniks (Serbian royalists who opposed the communist-led partisans in World War II); MOMCILO SELIC sentenced in April 1980 by the district court of Belgrade to seven years' imprisonment after he had written and distributed to friends a text strongly critical of President Tito and certain aspects of the Yugoslav Communist Party's history and politics." (NOTE : The Soviet government paper Izvestia accused recently Amnesty International of committing... sabotage: "Anti-Soviet sabotage, including the infiltration of agents and hostile literature, is today an important part of Amnesty International's activities." A6 [pageend9].\ך ROMANIA: PSYCHIATRIC PENALTY FOR DISSENTERS. According to Amnesty International (Newsletter N°.7,July 1980) "A wide range of legal and extrajudicial penalties have been used in Romania against political, social and religious dis- senters - including imprisonment, "corrective labour", phys- ical intimidation and compulsory confinement to psychiatric institutions. (...) ONE EXAMPLE of how the authorities act against dissenters came in February last year, when a group of intellectuals and workers from Bucharest and Turnu Severin announced the formation of the Free Trade Union of Romanian Workers(SLOMR). (...) In their manifesto they drew attention to increased unemploy- ment and to the forced retirement of dissenters on false psychiatric grounds. They called for better working conditions and the abolition of special privileges for Communist Party members. The manifesto won support from workers in a number of Romanian cities. ON 4 MARCH THE SLOMR MANIFESTO was broadcast on a foreign radio station. Two days later the telephones of the move- ment's two representatives-Dr. IONEL CANA and an economist, GHEORGHE BRASOVEANU-were cut off. (...) On 10 March Dr.Cana and Gheorghe Brasoveanu were arrested. Both were said to have been confined to the psychiatric section of Jilava Prison Hospital soon afterwards. (...) Dr. Cana was subsequently sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment (reduced on appeal to five and a half years’) on unspecified charges. Al has since received reports that Gheorge Brasoveanu has been sentenced to three and a half years' imprisonment. ACTION WAS ALSO TAKEN against associates of the two men. One, FATHER CALCIU, a Romanian Orthodox priest and professor at the Orthodox Theological Seminary in Bucharest - an acquaintance of Gheorghe Brasoveanu - was arrested on 10 March 1979. He was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment on charges that have never been made public. A SLOMR member- NICOLAE PASCALU - who had reported the arrest of other members of SLOMR to friends abroad and had also announced that a number of people in Bucharest had decided to apply to join AT was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment (reduced on appeal to 10 months’) for having disseminated information abroad ־without legal authorization. (He has served his sent- ence and has been released). Many other SLOMR members were either fined or sentenced to terms of imprisonment of־׳up to six months on charges of "parasitism". Several are known to have been confined for some weeks in psychiatric hospitals." A7 [pageend10]A8 IN THE GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC: BERND AND GERDI SOBE were sentenced on 29 April 1980, in Dresden, to five-and- a-half years and four-and-a-half years imprisonment respect- ively, on charges of "treasonable transmission of information". The ,information" were letters from the Sobes to the General Secretary of the UN, the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva and the West German Trade Union concerning violations of human rights in East Germany. This was reported by the West-Berlin Working Group for Human Rights on 18 July 1980. IN THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM : FORTY CATHOLIC PRIESTS IN PRISON. The Vietnam Committee and the review Que Me (editor Mrs Vo Van Ai, 25 rue Jaffeux, 92230 Gennevilliers, France) published (on 4 August) a list of 40 catholic priests "out of a total of 200 who are in prison for five years now".

GLEB YAKUNIN, TATIANA VELIKANOVA and other recently tried and sentenced human rights activists in the Soviet Union (see under A) The British government expressed "great concern" over the trials of Father Yakunin, Tatiana Velikanova and others. The government declared that the Soviet record on human rights should be scrutinized at the European security conference (CSCE) in Madrid this autumn. A similar state- ment was issued by the U.S. State Department. ANTANAS TERLECKAS (see Newsletter NOS.12/A, 13/A, B3, 14/A, 15/A) Thirteen Lithuanian activists have appealed to UN Secretary General Waldeheim, the signatory governments of the Helsinki Final Act, to Amnesty International and to a number of Helsinki groups, to do their utmost for the liber- ation of this Lithuanian writer and human rights activist. YURI KUKK. More than 500 signatures have so far been obtained within the French chemist community on behalf of this former professor at Tartu University in Soviet Estonia. Kukk was arrested on 13 March 1980 following his dismissal from the Communist Party. He had requested permission to leave the USSR with his family. It is believed that he has been interned in a Soviet psychiatric hospital. Kukk worked for several months at the CNRS laboratories in Paris and is well known to his French colleagues. The appeal demands the release of Kukk and "the authorization for him and his family to leave according to his will the territory of the Soviet Union and in accordance with the rights recognized in the Helsinki accords". 39 WHO BELIEVED. A list of thirty-nine Helsinki monitors in the Soviet Union who were imprisoned or exiled. Published by the Helsinki Watch, the U.S. Citizens’ Committee to Moni- tor the Helsinki Accords (for details see in this issue un- der I). The Committee declares in a circular letter, signed by the organization's chairman Robert L. Bernstein and Vice- Chairman Orville H. Schell : "WE URGE YOU, individually and together with professional and community groups, to speak out on behalf of these Helsinki monitors, demanding their release. (...) The continued abuse of the Helsinki monitors in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe makes a mockery of the (Helsinki) Accords. We cannot allow this travesty to continue."(See also under E.) ANDREI SAKHAROV. An "open letter" was published. It was in June in two Australia's leading papers, addressed to Aca- demician Sakharov and signed by six Sydney scientists. They appealed to fellow-Australians to send letters, telegrams etc. to Sakharov, wishing him well and expressing admiration for his courage". B [pageend13]Bl FRIENDS OF SAKHAROV DEMAND CREATION OF SPECIAL SOVIET COMMISSION. A letter by nine friends of Andrei Sakharov has been sent on 2 June 1980 to President Brezhnev re- questing him to create a special commission of the Sup- reme Soviets to be charged with the revision of conditions imposed on Sakharov. The friends included, Georgy Vladimov, Lev Kopelev, Boris Altschuler, a physicist ; Felix Serebrov, a member of the Moscow Helsinki Group's Committee against the Misuse of Psychiatry for Political Purposes; Ivan Kova- lev and the attorney, Nina Kalistratova.

He was arrested on 21 February 1979, the day after the planners of an "unofficial" Leningrad art festival met in his apartment, and in September of that year sentenced to four years in a labour camp. He was convicted of having profited from the sale and reproduction of pictures exhibited in his apartment, a "crime" he denied having committed. Mikhailov began collecting photographs in 1974. His flat soon became an exhibition room, and he has estimated that in the five years that followed about 9,000 visitors came there to see the work of more than 100 artists. R1 [pageend14]B2 IN BRUSSELS THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT sponsored the 23rd and 24th of June 1980 a public hearing on the three "baskets" of the Final Act of Helsinki with a view to the Madrid Conference in November 1980. The European Parliament’s Political Affairs Committee chaired by Mariano Rumor presented a report of the hearing at the October session of the European Parliament. Experts included Mr.Jonathan Alford of the International Institute of Strategic Studies in Lon- don, Mr. Stefano Silvestri of the Institute of International Affairs in Rome and Mr. Max von der Stoel of the Dutch Labour Party. These experts spoke on security matters. Basket two experts included Mr.Guido Carli of the UN, Mr.Charles Levin- son of the International Federation of Workers of Chemical Industry and Mr.Edmund Wellenstein, a former member of the European Commission. Basket three speakers were Mr.Vladimir Bukovsky, a Soviet human rights activist, Mr.Martin Ennals of Amnesty International and Mr.Pavel Kohout, a Czech human rights activist. THE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANIZATION (ILQ) IN GENEVA renewed its criticism of the policy of discrimination unemployment applied in Czechoslovakia for a number of years. Already in 1978, the ILO criticized Czechoslovakia on the basis of a complaint by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions accusing the government in Prague of discriminating against those who signed the Charter 77. Hundreds of journa- lists, writers, university teachers, research workers and scholars had been dismissed for doing so. The Czechoslovak representatives had countered that Article 53 of the Czecho- Slovak Labor Code empowered employers to dismiss employees in whom they had "lost confidence". They argued that those who had signed Charter 77 were engaged in activities aimed at disrupting public order, discrediting Czechoslovakia’s international reputation, and changing the socialist system by unlawful methods. An ILO committee of experts then con- eluded that it was unclear whether signing Charter 77 amoun- ted to an act against the security of the state and hence was incompatible with employment. THE CASE OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA was placed on ILO’s agenda for a second time this year, and on May 12 the organization's committee of experts issued a statement that it could not accept the argument that Charter 77 represented any threat to public order : "It does not appear that the signing of, or adhering to, such a document by workers could in itself justify any derogation from the basic protection provided by the Convention in matters of political opinion." ON MAY 15, 1980, CHARTER 77 published a long response in Prague to the ILO's statement. Job discrimination was con- tinuing in Czechoslovakia, it said, and was being applied not only against those who signed Charter 77 and their sup- porters but also against large sectors of the public. Though Article 153/1969 of the Labor Code, which was at odds with both Convention III and the Czechoslovak Constitution, had B2 [pageend15]B3 been amended to bring it into line with the convention, the Charter document said, "in practice the filling of jobs does not proceed in accordance either with the convention or with the Czechoslovak Constitution and Labor Code, but follows internal instructions unknown to the public and so impossible to scrutinize." The document concluded by saying that viol- ations of Convention III were continuing against Charter members and by offering to supply the ILO with pertinent evidence. It urged the ILO to sent a fact-finding mission to investigate on the spot. HUMAN RIGHTS CONFERENCE* APPEAL. A private human rights con- ference ended in Warsaw on 6 July with a call for world lea- ders to observe civil liberties : "The abuse of human rights creates conditions of tension among nations which are obstacles to detente", the final statement said, "We consider that detente is not and should not be limited to arms alone. Detente is necessary also in the field of human rights",it said, underlining the difference in definition of human rights in the East and West. The conference, the first such held in an Eastern block country, was sponsored by an American millionaire, Mr.Armand Hammer, a director of the International Institute on Human Rights.

RESPONSE is a British charity. RESPONSE is small and versatile. RESPONSE exists to provide urgent aid to those who suffer, throughout the world, for their political and religious beliefs. RESPONSE will, for example, send money to prisoners of conscience, or their families, in such countries as the USSR. Vietnam. Chile, Czechoslovakia, Argentina, Singapore. Indonesia, East Germany, South Africa. RESPONSE will also help refugees from these and other countries - like Cambodia or Ethiopia - where individual human rights are being violated. RESPONSE has limited funds. We are sure, however, that we can be useful. Often small sums are of crucial importance to the individuals with whom RESPONSE is concerned. The purchase of books or an exit permit, the cost of a ticket to visit a relative in prison or to reunite a family, money to help a destitute family in a refugee camp or towards rent in a country of exile, can make an enormous difference. It is this sort of assistance - help on the margin - which RESPONSE seeks to provide. RESPONSE has a second function. As well as helping individuals directly, RESPONSE is empowered, under the terms of its charitable trust deed, to commission and dis- seminate educational research into the social, economic and political problems which arise when human rights are violated. The plight of the Indochinese refugees shows how RESPONSE could be useful. If their desperate situation had been earlier understood, then other countries might have reacted more quickly and humanely. RESPONSE will increase such understanding. Obviously, the more money RESPONSE can raise, the more people it can help. If you pay tax in the United Kingdom the most effective method of payment is by seven year deed of covenant. This enables RESPONSE, as a tax-exempt charity, to recover from the Inland Revenue tax that you have effectively deducted; thus an annual pay- ment of £50 over seven years is worth £500 at standard rate of tax. Annual payments by banker’s order can also be made by those who are not resident in the U.K. but they do not have the same tax advantages for RESPONSE. Those who wish to make a single gift should send cheques, made out to RESPONSE, to the above address. We hope that you will contribute to RESPONSE. We will use your money carefully to help as many as we can amongst those millions of people who suffer because they seek freedoms which arc often taken for granted in the West.

Name (Block letters) Add ress [pageend18]EVENTS and comments AT THE OCCASION OF THE FORTHCOMING CSCE CONFERENCE which is to open in Madrid in November, Academician Andrei Sakharov wrote a statement in his internal exile in Gorki. The U.S. Helsinki Watch Committee translated and distributed the text, a shortened verson of which follows : "THE HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE OF THE HELSINKI ACCORDS, the sub- ject of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe now opening in Madrid, lies in its affirmation of a crucial principle : International security and confidence are linked to respect for human rights. THE MOST COMPLETE STATEMENT of this idea is contained in Principle VII, Section I (a) of the final act, which commits the participating states to fulfill all the provisions of the International Covenants on Human Rights and of the Uni- versal Declaration of Human Rights. THESE PROVISIONS INCLUDE guarantees for freedom of opinion and information, freedom to choose one's country of residence (and not just within the context of family reunification), freedom to choose one's domicile within each country, free- dorri of religion and freedom of association. THE HELSINKI ACCORDS also acknowledged the right of the participating state to monitor each other's record of com- pliance. Such monitoring is regarded not as intervention in internal affairs but rather as a contribution to international ideology of human rights. Unfortunately, its principles have not been put into practice in a satisfactory fashion. I suppose that human-rights violations have occured in many countries, but I shall speak about what I know best - the situation in the Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe. THE OBSERVANCE OF FUNDAMENTAL CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS in these countries has not just failed to improve over the past five years; the situation has in fact grown worse. Repressions against groups organized to promote observance of the Final Act, including the Helsinki watch groups in the Soviet Union and Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia, constitute the most brazen and challenging example of violations that demand from the participating states an unequivocal, uncompromising response- effective actions not limited to verbal protests. MORE THAN 40 MEMBERS OF THE HELSINKI WATCH GROUPS are impris- oned. Many others also have been arrested: individuals who, although not formally members•of the Watch groups, worked to promote the exchange of information and the defense of human rights as contributors to "samizdat" news magazines or journals of opinion, as participants in the movement for freedom of religion and freedom of emigration or in other ways. [pageend19]Cl The governments, nongovernmental organizations and concerned citizens of the participating states are under an obligation to defend all such victims of repression. PEACE IN THE WORLD is indivisible. The consequences of any deviation from this principle only confirm its truth. There- fore, I cannot agree with those who consider the Soviet in- vasion of Afghanistan an event unrelated to security in Europe. I also cannot agree with those who suggest a boycott of the Nov.11 Madrid conference as a response to Soviet act- ions in Afghanistan or to the increased repression of dis - senters. I BELIEVE that the participating states should use the opportunity offered by the Madrid conference to further a political settlement in Afghanistan, which must provide for the withdrawal of Soviet troops and international guarantees of peace, neutrality and free elections. The participating states should also promote the release of prisoners of con- science in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and in Western countries as well if persons are imprisoned there who have not used or advocated violence. THE CRITICAL INTERNATION SITUATION requires that the Western participating states coordinate their tactics and pursue their goal with more determination and consistency than at Belgrade. The Helsinki accords, like detente as a whole, have meaning only if they are observed fully and by all parties. No country should evade a discussion of its own domestic problems, whether they be the problems of Northern Ireland, the Crimean Tatars or Sakharov’s exile (here I am speaking objectively). Nor should a country ignore violations in other participating states. The whole point of the Helsinki accords is mutual monitoring, not mutual evasion of difficult problems." WORLD CONGRESS TOLD ABOUT PLIGHT OF HISTORIANS IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA. The attention of the 15th International Con- gress on Historical Sciences (Bucarest 10-17 August), has been drawn to the blacklisting of Czech and Slovak historians and their endeavours to continue research under conditions of political excommunication. A 290-PAGE VOLUME entitled : Independent Historic)- gnaphij 'n Czechoslovakia 1969-1980 has been edited by Dr. Vilém Precan (a historian of Czech origin who lives in Germany) to inform the Congress about־, the oppressive situation. (The volume may be ordered in German and English, through Help and Action,) THE PRESENT VOLUME is a sequel to Acta Persecution's, a list of 145 victimized historians, which Dr.Precan sent to the previous congress in San Francisco in 1975. The 1980 public- ation bears eloquent testimony to the fact that independent CJ [pageend20]C2 historiography has not been silenced in Czechoslovakia. More than 180 books, articles, essays, and other historical writ- ings are listed and annotated. None of them has been offici- ally published, although some appeared in samizdat form and others have been published outside Czechoslovakia. DR. PRECAN has sent the book to several participants of the Bucharest congress. In an accompanying letter he says : "NEEDLESS TO SAY, it is not my intention to introduce a political element into the deliberations of the congress. I continue to uphold the belief,expressed in my open letter to the San Francisco congress in 1975, written at that time from Prague, that political compromise is imperative if mankind is not to die in a war. At the same time, to remain silent about the suppression of culture including historical science in a single country would be tantamount to abdicating the rights and obligations which pertain to men of culture every- where in the world." THE COMMUNITY OF HISTORIANS in Czechoslovakia has been among the hardest hit next to writers and journalists by the "norm- alization" practice of the postreformist leadership. Nonethe- less, as Acta Creationis convincingly proves, a group of independ- ent historians has emerged from the ranks of those who were consigned to permanent oblivion. They earn their living as manual workers or low-level white-collar employees. Some have retired prematurely on disability pensions, and many have difficulty in making ends meet. THREE SOVIET WOMEN wrho advocated in an unofficial feminist review, that Soviet women advise their sons to go to prison rather than fight in Afghanistan, have been expelled from the Soviet Union and have had their Soviet citizenship re- voked. Tatiana Mamonova, a chemist, painter, poet and mother of a 4-year-old son, Tatiana Goritsheva, a philosopher and Natalia Nalachoskaya, a philologist, arrived in Vienna on 20 July 1980 on a flight from their home in Leningrad. The three women are the editors of the unofficial Soviet public- ation Jfo/nen and Russia and The Russian (the first was edited by Mamonova while Goritsheva and Nalachoskaya produced the second.) Mrs. Mamonova was accompanied by her husband and 4-year-old son while Mrs. Nalachoskaya arrived with her 9-year-old son. Speaking to journalists in Vienna, Mrs.Mamonova said that "The Russion women were suppressed in a double manner, in the family as well as by the state". Mrs. Goritsheva told reporters that "We are not feminists in the Western sense but stand in the forefront of the general dissident, movement because of the imprisonment of so many of our men". The women traveled on an Israeli visa though none are Jewish. VLADIMIR BORISOV FORCIBLY EXPELLED FROM SOVIET UNION. Vladimir Borisov, 36, a founding member of the Free Inter- professional Association of Workers (SMOT), was taken by Soviet security authorities form a prison in Leningrad and on 22 june 1980 by force placed on an airliner carrying 95 C2 [pageend21]C3 Jewish emigrants to Vienna. In Vienna, he refused to leave the plane and was taken from the plane by force. Borisov arrived with his brother Oleg and the 9-year-old son of his brother v7ho is to be treated by specialists in the US for brain damage. Borisov's wife, Irina Kaplun, is reported to have said in Moscow that she was not yet aware of whether she and their infant daughter will be allowed to travel to Vienna. "My husband and I were separated by force, and I don't know whether I will be able in any way to have contact with him." Borisov has spent some 9 years in prison and psychiatric hospitals in the USSR because of his "deliberate opposition" and because of his refusal in 1977 to emigrate to Israel. IN AN INTERVIEW with Le Monde, Borisov says his first exper- ience of disillusionment in the Soviet Union came already at the age of 12 when during the 20th Party Congress Stalin suddenly became less than a god. At the age of 18 he was re- leased from his first job because of his participation in a strike for pay increases. SMOT was founded, says Borisov, largely because of the efforts of Vladimir Skvirsky who attempted to salvage something of Vladimir Klebanov's Free Trade Union founded in 1977 (Klebanov is now interned in a psychiatric hospital and Skvirsky is serving 5 years in internal exile). At present, SMOT has about 200 members di- vided into some 10 groups with each group having an elected representative, who participates in regularly held conferences. Borisov believes that a free trade union movement in the USSR is increasing because of low wages, unsafe working conditions and inadequate food provisions. A FEW DAYS LATER, BORISOV has testified as a key witness in a court case in Vienna. In a press court case between the Socialist newspaper Arbeiter Zeitung and the communist Volks stimmeכ he gave evidence about Soviet dissidents who have been im- prisoned in psychiatric clinics and treated against their will. His unexpected arrival gave Arbeiter Zeitung the witness it needed in a case which has lasted for years. It arose after Austrian psychiatrists visited the Soviet Union. From statements they made on their return Volksstimme deduced that they had concluded that most dissidents in psychiatric clin- ics needed treatment. Reaction from Arbeiter Zeitung resulted from the case. In his case, Borisov knew that the doctors were convinced that he was mentally sound, although the official diagnosis was "schizophrenia of organic origin". Throughout his terms in psychiatric hospitals ho had never been given medicines. He said no Western doctor, however competent, could make an instant diagnosis in a Soviet clinic, nor could he rely on the interpreters provided by the authorities. [pageend22]C 4 STILL A FEW DAYS LATER, the Western information media reported that Mr. Borisov’s wife Irina has been killed in Lithuania in a car accident. Borisov, and other SMOT members in the West, believe that Irina Borisova’s death was engineered by the KGB. "I believe the KGB murdered my wife because she refused to leave the Soviet Union and continued to work for SMOT," said Borisov. "I have spoken to my wife’s relatives inside the Soviet Union, and they were given two suspicious explan- ations for the car crash." FATHER DUDKO CONFESSES GUILT ON MOSCOW TV. The Russion Orthodox priest, Dimitry Dudko, 58, in a statement read on Moscow television on 20 June 1980 , admitted that he was guilty of "anti-Soviet activities". Dudko was arrested on 15 January 1980 at which time the Soviet authorities began an investigation into the activities of Dudko. KESTON COLLEGE, the United Kingdom organization which monitors religious persecution in the USSR and the other communist count- ries, has issued a statement which reads as follows : "FATHER DIMITRI DUDKO’S TELEVISED CONFESSION’ in Moscow on 20 June has come as a great shock to everyone who followed his courageous career from afar. It is surely impossible to believe that such a man could renounce all that he had pre- viously stood for - and Keston College does not believe it. We do not yet know the full story, but there are not at pre- sent sufficient grounds for believing that Father Dudko has in fact recanted his convictions. IN HIS TELEVISED STATEMENT, subsequently published in the Soviet press. Father Dudko said that he had reconsidered his previous activities, and now believed them to have been 'anti- Soviet’, directed against the state, and not purely religious. "I renounce what I have done, and consider my so-called fight against godlessness to have been a fight against Soviet power", he said. However, we must remember that Father Dudko has been in the hands of the KGB for six months, during which time no one at all, including his close relations, was allowed to see or speak to him. This is more than enough time for some of the KGB's infamous methods of ’persuasion’ to have been applied to him, and there is reason to think that these could have included powerful, mood-changing drugs. WHATEVER THE TRUE STORY, Father Dudko's twenty years of ser- vice as a priest will stand as a timeless memorial to his courage and faith. His influence extended throughout Russia, and many lives have been changed and given a new, Christ- centred direction as a result of his ministry. Many Christians in the West have had their faith deepened through his books. Anyone whose life has been touched by his words will have some idea of the almost unimaginable pressure which must have been put upon him in order to induce him, willingly or unwillingly, to make his ’confession". May he and his family feel our prayers and compassion upholding them now." C4 [pageend23]C5 JIRI LEDERER, the well-known Czech journalist, human rights activist and Charter 77 signatory was forced to emigrate. (On Lederer see Newsletter Nos. 9, 11, 12, 14.) He arrived in Germany on 1 September with his Polish-born wife Elzbieta. Released from prison (in which he had served his full three year term) in January 1980, Lederer has been continually harassed by the Czech political police, and the authorities threatened to deport his wife to Poland. THREE HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS IN THE U.S.S.R., were recently released from prison and authorized to emigrate : Mikhail Kheifets, Andrei Tverdokhlebov and Svyatoslav Karavansky. YURI YARYM-AGAYEV, a Russian physicist and of the Moscow Helsinki Watch Group was exiled in July at a press conference organized by the New York Helsinki Watch Committee, Dr.Yarim- Agayev declared that "the crackdown against dissidents, while accelerated by plans to clear Moscow for the Olympic Games, is in fact part of a long-range program to suppress political dissent in the Soviet Union, a campaign which is stepped up or toned down according to Party directives at a given time." The campaign was intensified last August with an increase in the number of people arrested and a marked deterioration in the standards of due process used in political trials. "While the charges and evidence at the trials of Ginzburg, Orlov and Shcharansky ־were blatantly fabricated" , explained Dr. Yarym-Agayev, "the authorities today exert even less effort to give the trials some semblance of legality. THE REMAINING MEMBERS OF THE MOSCOW HELSINKI WATCH GROUP, according to Dr. Yarym-Agayev, have all been warned offici- ally that they are in danger of arrest for their activity. "The members of the Helsinki Watch Groups must be defended by all groups in this country," said Dr. Yarym-Agayev, "because they act as the major channel of information and defend the rights of all human rights activists in the Soviet Union, including those who struggle for national rights, emigration, and religious liberty." JULIUS TOMIN, the Czech philosopher and dissident was author- ized to leave Czechoslovakia to lecture at Oxford University. Mr. Tomin, a signatory of Charter 77, has been arrested re- peatedly and harassed for taking part in university lectures in private houses and flats. Visiting professors from Oxford, with whom he has long had contacts, were harassed and in some cases deported. Tomin has settled in Oxford, accompanied by his wife Zdena, (a former spokeswoman of the Charter 77 movement,) and their two sons.

In your communication (letter, telegram, personal visit to the Ministry) you will respectfully request that the government’s delegates to the review Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) - which is to open in Madrid on 11 November) raise, openly and boldly, the following points : a) in the Soviet Union, a signatory country of the CSCE Final Act, at least forty-three Helsinki moni- tors (i.e. men and women who publicly remind the Soviet authorities of their obligations under the humanitarian clauses of the Helsinki Accords) have been imprisoned or exiled, b) this relentless persecution is a flagrant violation of the Accords and cannot be tolerated by the other signatory countries, c) consequently, and in accordance with the Final Act (which confirms the right of citizens "to know and act upon their rights"), the Helsinki monitors im- prisoned in the U.S.S.R. must be released, d) the continued abuse of the Helsinki monitors in the Soviet Union makes a mockery of the humanitarian clauses of the Accords. In your communication you may add names of all (or some) of the forty-three persecuted members of the Helsinki Watch Groups (see below). DO NOT FORGET THOSE IN THE OTHER WARSAW PACT COUNTRIES jailed or harassed by the political police for their defence of basic human and civic rights.

E7 [pageend34]ES IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA, HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS, MEMBERS OF VONS (Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Persecuted) are engaged in a parallel struggle to the one waged by the Hel- sinki Watch Groups in the U.S.S.R.: defending those who were, and are, persecuted (tried, jailed, harassed by the political police) for their opinions or beliefs. Once again, the human- itarian clauses of the Helsinki Accords are constantly viol- ated in this Soviet-occupied country, a signatory of the Final Act. This state of affairs, richly documented, cannot pass unnoticed in Madrid in November. LIST OF HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVITIES JAILED OR OTHERWISE PERSE- CUTED IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA : 1.

The police seized a draft text prepared by the group (all Charter 77 signatories) to be presented to delegates to the CSCE follow-up conference in Madrid. They were warned that "serious consequences" will follow if such a text is circulated and publicized. Questioned for many hours, and for the same reason, were Jan Bednar, Eva Kantůrkova, Jiri Nemec, Tomas Hr aditek.The text was a review of non-application, in Czechoslovakia, of many of the humanitarian clauses of the Final Act. SINCE EARLY 1977, HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA have been tried, jailed, arrested, re-arrested, continuously harassed, discriminated in employment and education of their children, forced to emigrate. HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS IN POLAND are similarly treated and harassed, sometimes several times a week, by the police. By way of one recent example : 1.- 28. Jacek Huron, Adam Michnik, Miroslaw Chog’ecki, Jan Litynski, Henryk Wugec, Dargusz Kupiecki, Zbigniew Romas zewski, Josef Sreniowski, Marek Beylin, Hog ceck Celinski, Jo,n Cywinski, Hi told Luczy No, Zenobia Lukasiewicz, Ho g dech Ostrowski, Haclaw Miku I ski, Malgorzata Pavlička, Jan Sek, Macieg Stroj, all members of KOR (Social Self-Defence Committee) were held by the police for 48 hours (some of them for a longer period) on 20 August, 1980. On the following day, Hieslaw Kecik, Sergiusz Kowalski, Ulla Droszewska, Aleksandra Serata,‘ Jan Hale, Anka Szwed, Krystyna Iwaszkiewicz were held, questioned and finally re- leased. Reason: "inciting" the striking Polish workers, whose conditions for ending the strikes were, a few days later, officially approved and accepted by the Polish authorities. ACTION, AS OUTLINED UNDER E IN THIS SECTION OF THE NEWSLETTER on these and other cases, all in contradiction to the "third basket" clauses of the Helsinki Final Act, is of greatest urgency. ACT NOW!

Wiesner TO THE MADRID REVIEW • CONFERENCE The forced exile to Gorky of Nobel Laureate Dr. Andrei Sakharov, whose courageous defense of human rights has been a source of hope for his country and the world, is an arbitrary and illegal act that must be protested vigorously. The exiling of Dr. Sakharov is a part of a concerted government policy of repression against human rights activists throughout the USSR. We protest this campaign of repressions, which violates the human rights provisions of the Helsinki Accords. In particular we would like to express our protest of the imprisonment of Yuri Orlov, founder of the Moscow Helsinki Monitoring Group; Anatoly Shcharansky, a member of the Moscow Helsinki Monitoring Group and an activist in the Jewish movement for emigration to Israel; Mykola Rudenko and Lev Lukyanenko, founders of the Ukrainian Helsinki Monitoring Group; Olha Heyko, a member of the Ukrainian Helsinki Monitoring Group; Viktoras Petkus of the Lithuanian Helsinki Monitoring Group; Robert Nazaryan of the Armenian Helsinki Monitoring Group; Merab Kostava of the Georgian Helsinki Monitoring Group; Father Gleb Yakunin of the Christian Committee for the Defense of the Rights of Believers; Lev Volokhonsky of the Free Inter-Professional Organization of Workers (SMOT); Vyacheslav Bakhmin and Leonard Ternovsky of the Working Group on the Use of Psychiatry for Political Purposes; Malva Landa, an Administrator of the Russian Social Fund; Tatyana Velikáne associated with the Chronicle of Current Events; Nikolai Goretoy, leader o the Pentecostal Church in the USSR; and Rollan Kadiyev, a Crimean Tatar human rights activist. All of these men and women were imprisoned for defending civil, religious, and national rights. In defending these prisoners of conscience we are also defending the very large numbers of men and women who are incarcerate■., in Soviet prisons, psychiatric hospitals, and forced labor camps, simply for expressing their views. On the eve of the Madrid Review Conference we can think of no more appropri demand to make than the immediate and unconditional release of all prisoner of conscience in the USSR and the release from forced exile of Dr. Andrei Sakharov. We appeal to people of good will throughout the world to endorse and suppor our appeal, and request that the Madrid Conference make the question of human rights a central part of its proceedings.

It is the intention of the Help and Action Coordination Committee to be of meaningful and concrete assistance to government deleg- ations participating at the CSCE review conference in Madrid. In close cooperation with other human rights organisations H + A is providing these delegations with documents, reports, facts and figures about violations of the humanitarian clauses of the Helsinki Accords in the Soviet Union and the other Warsaw Pact countries. This selectivity does not mean that violations do not occur in other signatory states, and it is certainly not ideologically motivated: it simply reflects the fact that H + A was founded in 1974 as a voluntary organisation specializing in the human rights situation in Eastern Europe. Other groups "cover" other regions and countries. In addition to the work described above and connected with the Madrid follow-up conference, H + A has rented, on a sharing basis with other organisations, an office/information center in a Madrid hotel (see under D and F in this issue) and parti- cipates in the preparations for an exhibition, film projections, press conferences. And it initiated a joint manifestation: a Human Rights Motorcade - From Helsinki to Madrid (for details see overleaf under H 1) . Reminder : Those human rights groups desiring to share during the CSCE session the office/information center facilities in Madrid, should address themselves to the Secretary, Gesellschaft für Menschenrechte, Kaiserstrasse 40, 6000 Frankfurt/Main;tel.

HUMAN RIGHTS MOTORCADE - From Helsinki To Madrid. Aim : To demonstrate in a spectacular manner that human and citizens' rights are violated in a number of countries, sign- atories of the Helsinki Final Act. This document binds the governments of these countries to protect and to apply basic freedoms and rights. The aim of the motorcade is to dramatize this situation and to appeal to the governments represented at the Madrid review conference to condemn the many flagrant breaches of the Final Act, and to find ways and means for a stricter application of the document's humanitarian clauses. Realization : Volunteer teams (two, four, six persons, pre- ferably young people) would drive cars from their respective countries across Europe to Madrid. All the participating teams would converge in the Spanish capital on 10 November, on the eve of the scheduled opening of the conference. The cars would carry signs, posters, slogans, explaining the aims of the demonstration (in several major languages and in Spanish), as outlined above. Each team should be well versed in human rights questions and in command of several languages. Information materials, leaflets, photographs etc. should be carried along and distributed to interested parties. The arrival in Madrid (at a meeting place near the conference building) should command a maximum of publicity via inter- national and Spanish information media. The cars and their teams would stay in Madrid for 24 hours and then return, in groups if possible, to their respective countries, still displaying posters and slogans and follow a different itinerary from the one used on arrival, so that as many people as possible in a great number of cities could be reached. The start of the trip should also be publicized in the participating countries. The itinerary: The cars would have to leave the respective capitals so that all participating teams could meet in Lyon (France) on 8 November during the day, and then continue on their way to Marseille and Madrid. The following routes and participation are envisaged: 1. Helsinki-Stockholm-Oslo-Copenhagen for Finnish, Swedish, Norwegian and Danish teams. These would meet in 2. Hamburg with the German team, and continue via Bremen- Bonn-Frankfurt to Strasbourg. There the five groups would be joined by the Austrian team coming from Vienna via Saiz- burg and Munich. The teams would then drive to 3. Basel9 to be met there by the Swiss, and continue to Geneva and further to Lyon. Hl [pageend42]H2 4. Another "convoy" would start from Amsterdam (Dutch) and travel via Rotterdam-The Hague and Ostende.Meeting there the British coming from London, they would drive to Brussels to be joined there by the Belgians, and continue via Lille to Paris. The French would be waiting for them and the convoy would proceed to Lz/o^to join hands with teams enumerated under 1,2, 3 above. 5. All groups would take the direction to and to the Spanish border, to be joined there by Spanish,Italian, Portuguese teams. Arrival in Madrid on 10 November in the afternoon. Organization and financing: The national human rights groups (or individuals) would be in charge of promoting the manifes- tation, make necessary personnel and technical arrangements and provide the necessary funds to offset travel and other expenses.

Members of the Help and Action Co-ordination Committee support the four ’,points of action" outlined by the Gesellschaft für Menschenrechte in its press release dated 1 August 1980, and communicated to the CSCE governments, i.e. a) the question of application of human rights in the signatory countries, as stipulated in the humanitarian clauses ("third basket") of the Helsinki Final Act, must be discussed fully and openly at the Madrid review confe- rence, b) a review of the application of these clauses should form an integral part of the negotiations, and, if possible, aired in open sessions, c) the conference should propose a declaration which would ratify the citizens’ control activity as to the application, in their respective coun- tries , of the humanitarian clauses of the Final Act ("Helsinki Watch Groups"), d) the Madrid follow-up conference should, at least for a period during its session, be attended by foreign ministers of the partici- pating countries. 2. In addition. Help and Action proposes: e) the "Complaint Centre" proposed by the Gesell- schaft in the above mentioned press release, and which is to function prior and during the Madrid conference, should be transformed into a permanent international clearing house for citizens’ complaints concerning non-application of the "third basket" clauses. An international lawyer should be appointed by the Frankfurt meeting and charged with working out a charter for such an institution. Participating organisa- tions would then discuss and approve the charter. Announcement of the creation of such a permanent clearing house could be made at the? close of the Madrid CSCE session.

JULIUS SASNAUKAS (see Newsletter 13/A , 14/A2) was sentenced to eighteen months in a labour camp and five years of in- ternal exile on charges of "anti-Soviet propaganda". ALEXANDER SHATRAVKA (see Newsletter 10/A1) , a human rights activist who described in detail the continuous misuse of psychiatry for political purposes, was arrested on 17 September in the region of Murmansk. Previously, he has spent five years in a special psychiatric hospital in Dnepropetrovsk after having left clandestinely Soviet Union for Finland and handed over by Finnish authorities. YURI KISSELEV and VSEVOLOD KUVAKIN (see Newsletter 12/A) who were active in the independent trade union organization (SMOT) were questioned by the police. IT WAS FURTHER REPORTED that on 22 September in Moscow the trial of LEV REGELSON and VYACHESLAV BAKHMIN opened (see previous Newsletters) . Both are being tried on charges of "anti-Soviet propaganda". VIKTOR KAPITACHUK (see Newsletters 12/A, 14/A3), another human rights activist, appears in the same trial as witness and will himself face trial. While Regelson pleaded guilty, Bakhmin refused to answer, since he was not authorized to defend himself. FINALLY, VALERY ABRAMKIN (see Newsletters 13/A1; 14/Al) , editor of the samizdat review Pozski (”Researches") is also being tried in Moscow. With him, facing the tribunal, are three members of the editorial board of Pbtski, VLADIMIR SOROKIN, YURI GRIMM and VIKTOR SOKIRKO (see previous Newsletters).
