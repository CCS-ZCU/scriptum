[pageend4]Czechoslovak Constitutionalism Vratislav Pěchota The Kingdom of Bohemia, one of the predecessors of the 20th century Czechoslovakia, entered the European scene as a sovereign entity in the 10th century and led an independent life until it was absorbed by the Habsburg Empire in 1627. For a moment the Přemysl dynasty dominated Central Europe: the conquests and acquisitions of Otto (Otakar) II (1253- 1278) brought Bohemia to the height of its power, extending its possessions from the Oder to the Adriatic; in 1300 Wenceslas (Václav) II of Bohemia was crowned king of Poland and raised his son, Wenceslas III, to the Hungarian throne; during the reign of King-Emperor Charles (Karel) IV, his Golden Bull (“Zlatá bula,” 1356) permanently established the kings of Bohemia as electors of the Holy Roman Empire. The elected King George (Jiří) of Poděbrady (1458-1471) put an end to religious wars in Bohemia and decreed the equality of the Catholic and Protestant creeds. Bohemian independence was crushed in the battle of the White Mountain (1620) which started the Thirty Years’ War: the rights of the Protestants Historical Background Constitutionalism is something more than a written constitution. It is a system of commonly shared values and judgments about the political organization sustaining the statehood, as well as a set of agreed principles creating a legitimacy. Constitutionalism is an outgrowth of the political culture of each society and its experience with self-government. Western constitutionalism rests on the following pillars: consent of the governed, limited government, open society, the sanctity of the individual, and the rule of law. It is clearly society-oriented and is generally disinclined to encourage federal structure of government based on the principle of nationality. Czechoslovak constitutionalism is a synthesis of separate Czech and Slovak historical development spanning ten centuries and of common constitutional experience only since 1918. [pageend5]2 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al were suppressed and the new Bohemian constitution of 1627 imposed by the Habsburgs reduced the country practically to a province. The revolution in the Hapsburg empire in 1848-1849 opened up new possibilities for liberal constitutional development. Calls for freedom of the press, jury trial, civil rights, end of religious discrimination, academic freedom, and representative government rose to the level of political demands that could not be ignored. The result was the short-lived liberal Constitution of March 7, 1849, which the neo-absolutist government in Vienna abrogated as soon as the tidal wave of revolution began to recede. Yet the 1849 constitutional experiment had a residual impact on subsequent legal developments in such areas as equality before the law or land reform. Some elements of the 1849 Constitution were revived in a series of five constitutional laws of December 1867, which inaugurated transition to constitutional government in the Hapsburg empire. The first of the five laws provided for a bicameral parliament in Vienna with broad legislative powers. The second law guaranteed to all citizens fundamental civil rights; it also affirmed the right of all ethnic groups to preserve and cultivate their nationality and their language. The third law established an imperial court (Reichsgericht) to safeguard the rights of the individual. The fourth law proclaimed the independence of the judiciary. The fifth law defined the powers of the executive branch of government, including its legislative and emergency authority. These five laws, which sometimes are called The Austrian Cisleithenian Constitution of 1867, were applied in the Western part of the Hapsburg empire, including Bohemia, until the dissolution of the empire in 1918. Perhaps the most important constitutional development was Ů\e Austro- Hungarian Settlement of March 1867, which created an association of two independent states of equal rights, Austria and Hungary, with a common ruler, the Emperor of Austria and the King of Hungary. The Austro- Hungarian empire was neither a federation nor a confederation; the terms of the Settlement contemplated a political structure sui generis. A similar Czech demand—that Bohemia be accorded an independent status within the empire—was rebuffed. This refusal to treat them as equal partners alienated the Czechs and partly accounted for the withdrawal of their loyalty to the empire at a critical moment of its history, which contributed to its eventual disintegration. Slovak constitutionalism draws upon several sources in its historical development. Like the Czechs, the Slovaks are one of the old European [pageend6]Cz e c h o sl o v ak Co n st it u t io n al ism 3 During World War I, agreement was reached between the Czech and the Slovak leaders to seek a union of the Czech and Slovak lands in a common state. The agreement, concluded on May 30, 1918 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, declared that “the Czechoslovak state shall be a republic, and its constitution a democratic one.”1 Alternative drafts for a constitution of an autonomous Czech state circulated in Prague during the war; they envisaged that Czech sovereignty would be restored within a reconstructed Hapsburg empire or some other transnational formation in Central Europe which might replace the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. The declaration of Czechoslovak independence on October 28, 1918 made these constitutional models obsolete. The Act on Czechoslovak Independence (Zákon o zřízení samostatného státu Československého) (No. 11/1918 Coll, of Laws) was passed by the National Committee (Národní výbor), representative body constituted by agreement among Czech and Slovak political parties and organizations. The Act expressly stated that the existing laws would remain in force pending enactment of new legislation, and made it clear that all administrative and judicial bodies should continue to apply these laws. It made the state and local government accountable to the National Committee which assumed the exercise of sovereignty within the boundaries of the country, while the Czechoslovak National Council (Československá národní rada) in Paris—formerly a government in exile—was to exercise Czechoslovak sovereignty in international relations. Although the Act did not immediately declare the newly independent state a republic, it effectively foreordained the outcome by leaving it to a future National Assembly (Národní shromážděno and the Czechoslovak National Council in Paris to determine the form of the Czechoslovak statehood. The Council, unlike certain groups in the National Committee, was firmly committed to the republican form of government. The primary concern of the National Committee was the organization Origins of Modern Czechoslovak Constitutionalism nations, and their history reaches back to their common statehood with the Czechs. The Great Moravian Empire of the 9th century provided the early link between the two nations. From the tenth century on, the Slovak populace lived under the Magyar rule in Hungary. In the 19th century, the Slovaks sought to satisfy their aspirations within the Hapsburg Empire, but the 1867 Austro-Hungarian settlement dashed their hopes. [pageend7]4 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al The first draft of a permanent constitution was prepared by Jiří Hoetzl, Professor of constitutional law at Charles University. His draft envisaged a two-chamber legislature, consisting of a chamber of deputies and a senate. The senate was to be partly elected and partly appointed by the President. On the issue of presidential powers, the draft unequivocally sustained the concept of strong presidency. The Constitution was adopted by the National Assembly on February 29, 1920 (No. 121/192 Coll, of Laws).2 The models included the American and the French Constitutions as well as the Constitution of the German Weimar Republic of 1919. But the predominant influence was domestic constitutional experience and political concerns of the moment. Despite the change from a monarchy to a republic, continuity loomed larger than discontinuity on the Czechoslovak constitutional scene during the period of 1918-1938. Many of the fundamental political traits that characterized the pluralistic society of pre-1918 Bohemia survived and there also was a sufficient carry-over of parliamentary, administrative and judicial practices. The Constitution expressly declared Czechoslovakia to be a democratic republic in which the people were the sole source of state authority. As regards the Czech-Slovak relationship, the Constitution proceeded from the now abandoned notion that there was a single Czechoslovak nation and The Constitution of 1920 of government. This concern was addressed by the Act on a Provisional Constitution (passed by the National Committee on November 14, 1918, No. 37/1918 Coll, of Laws). The Act provided for a legislative body, a president, and a Government. It did not create a new judiciary, but clothed the existing courts with the power to make decisions in the name of the Czechoslovak state. One of the first constitutional controversies involved the grant of powers to the presidency, which has remained a vexing problem of Czechoslovak constitutionalism ever since. The immediate cause of the conflict was the issue of who should appoint and dismiss the cabinet, the President, and the National Assembly. The conflict between the opponents and the proponents of strong presidency was resolved in favor of the latter. Act No. 271/1919 Coll, of Laws, amending the Provisional Constitution (Prozatímní ústava), gave the President an almost unlimited power to appoint the Government. [pageend8]Cz e c h o sl o v ak Co n st it u t io n al ism 5 one Czechoslovak language. As a result, Czechoslovakia became a unitary, not a federal, state. Slovak opposition to the idea of a single Czechoslovak nation resulted in national disunity and alienation. A special provision of the 1920 Constitution implemented articles 10-13 of the “Lesser” Treaty of St. Germain-en-Laye of September 10, 1919 under which Ruthenia (Carpathian Russinia) became a self-governing part of Czechoslovakia. (The territory was ceded to the Soviet Union in 1945 and became part of the Ukrainian SSR.) The legislature, called the National Assembly, was composed of two chambers: the Chamber of Deputies (poslanecká sněmovna) and the Senate (senát). Both houses were elected by popular vote in direct, general elections in which the equality of both sexes was fully recognized. The Constitution vested the executive power in the President and the Government, creating a delicate balance. The President’s prerogatives were limited to those expressly conferred upon him by the Constitution: in addition to appointing and dismissing the Government, summoning and dissolving the National Assembly, and exercising a suspensive veto with regard to bills passed by the legislature, he wielded real executive power only in the fields of foreign policy and defense, and made appointments to high positions in the judiciary and the civil service. All other executive powers were vested in the Government. The Constitution established the principle of collective responsibility of the Government to the National Assembly, including responsibility for all official acts of the President. The President was not chosen directly by the people, but was elected by the National Assembly. As regards the economic system, the Constitution guaranteed private ownership and free enterprise. Fundamental freedoms of the individual were fully recognized and national and racial minorities were guaranteed equal treatment and protection of their rights. These included the German, Hungarian, Polish, and Ruthenian national groups. In addition to according equality before the law to every individual belonging to a minority, the Constitution guaranteed to the national minorities the right to receive instruction in their respective languages and forbade forcible assimilation. A Constitutional Court (Ústavní soud) was to protect the Constitution from erosion through legislative process. A Supreme Administrative Court (Nejvyšší správní soud) was to adjudicate grievances and complaints against infringements of individual rights by administrative bodies. The twenty years of parliamentary democracy in Czechoslovakia (1918-1938) demonstrated the vitality of the 1920 Constitution.3 This is [pageend9]6 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al not to suggest that the Constitution was flawless. It was a creation of politicians espousing different social and political ideals but united in their desire to make a smooth transition from the ancien régime to a new republican order. As such, it reflected both their shared values and their differing political ideas. Consequently, it left room for valid criticism of some of its notions and provisions. The 1920 Constitution remained in force until 1948. However, the Munich crisis of 1938 and the resulting subjugation of Czechoslovakia by Hitler suspended its application for all purposes except the legitimacy of the Czechoslovak government in exile in London during World War II. In Slovakia, which declared itself a sovereign Slovak state under the German suzerainty on March 14, 1939, a Nazi-inspired constitution was promulgated by the Slovak Diet on July 21, 1939. This constitution passed away together with the Slovak Republic in 1945. The issue of continuity, which flared up in 1991 in connection with the Czechoslovak-German Treaty, is not a constitutional but an international matter. (To remind the reader, the issue was raised in a joint protest by the Slovak Premier Camogurský and the Chairman of the Slovak National Council Mikloško against the preamble of the draft treaty of friendship between Czechoslovakia and Germany, which stated that Germany recognized the continuity of the Czechoslovak state since 1918, a statement aimed at acknowledging the legal invalidity of the Munich Agreement and the resulting disintegration of Czechoslovakia. Camogurský and Mikloško disagreed with the statement on the ground that the creation of the Slovak Republic in 1939 was a legal fact that could not be ignored.) The issue of Czechoslovak continuity was decided during and after World War II by the allies in several binding documents which are part of the post-war European setup. Legally, Czechoslovakia did not cease to exist, and both the Protectorate and the Slovak State, being the creation of Hitler, did not enjoy international recognition. After the restoration of Czechoslovak sovereignty in 1945, the 1920 Constitution provided an interim basis for the revival of national institutions. At the same time, the new geopolitical situation and the changed social and economic conditions made it impossible to resuscitate parliamentary democracy in its pre-war complexion. The Constitution of 1948 In contrast to prewar constitutionalism, the history of postwar [pageend10]Cz e c h o sl o v ak Co n st it u t io n al ism 7 constitutions is a story of notable retreats from democratic traditions. The arrival of the Soviet army in the spring of 1945 and the ascension of the Communist party to a dominant partnership in the ruling coalition spelled the end of two fundamental tenets of liberal democracy: the free interplay of political forces and the sanctity of private property. In the binding political compact entered into by the parties represented in the London government of President Beneš and the Moscow-based Czechoslovak Communist leadership (the so-called Košice Program of April 5, 1945), the range of political forces allowed to enter the post-war Czechoslovak scene was reduced to a handful of parties representing the left and the center of the political spectrum. All approved political parties were required to be part of an umbrella organization called the National Front (Národní fronta) of the Czechs and Slovaks, in which the Communists soon began playing more than an equal role. It was also agreed that the key sectors of economy should be nationalized. Finally, the agreement provided that “the truly democratic elements” of the 1920 Constitution should be taken into account, which left the status of the Constitution as a whole uncertain. The program defined the system of government for post-war Czechoslovakia as “people’s democracy.” According to the Communist interpretation, this concept derived from Lenin’s postulate that the transition of different countries from capitalism to socialism will take a variety of forms, but the substance will remain the same: organization of the proletariat into a ruling class. This political theory accentuated the notion of power and social purpose and vigorously reduced the restraining function of law. After the Communist takeover in February 1948, the 1920 Constitution hurled itself into collision with the Marxist ideas about state and law. As class hegemony and unrestricted one-party rule began replacing political pluralism and coalition-building, democratic concepts such as separation of powers or judicial review were increasingly viewed as alien to the purpose of realizing socialism. They were derided more than any other constitutional principles as “bourgeois” and, therefore, seeking to preserve capitalism.4 This was quite consistent from the point of view of Marxism, which denied the possibility of an objective, politically neutral legal principle and considered law as an instrument of class interests. The resulting effect was that the underlying assumptions of the 1920 Constitution and many of its provisions were practically set aside, even though the Constitution was not formally abrogated. The initial draft for a new constitution based on the Košice Program [pageend11]8 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al was prepared long before the Communist takeover and reflected a political compromise that had the support of President Beneš and other democratic leaders. However, the draft was hastily rewritten after the February 1948 coup and its preambular part and many important provisions were cast in new socialist terms. It affirmed the will of the people to build the state as a “people’s democracy which will ensure to us a peaceful road to socialism”5 and paid a lip service to Czech and Slovak democratic traditions, identifying the national aspirations of both nations with those of “the great Slav power, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.” The post-February 1948 parliament, purged of independent noncommunists, adopted the revised draft on May 9, 1948, the third anniversary of the liberation of Prague by the Soviet Army. Thus, the second Czechoslovak constitution came to be known as the Constitution of the 9th of May (Ústava 9. května) (No. 150/1948 Coll, of Laws). In a dramatic move, the ailing President Beneš refused to sign the new constitution and abdicated in protest against its anti-democratic character. The new President, the leader of the Communist party, Klement Gottwald, swore to put its socialist objectives into effect. The 1948 Constitution abandoned the fiction of a Czechoslovak nation and declared the Czechoslovak Republic to be a state of “two Slav nations possessing equal rights, the Czechs and the Slovaks.”6 However, it preserved the unitary character of the republic. As a compensation, it created two national Slovak organs, the Slovak National Council (Slovenská národná rada) and the Board of Commissioners (Sbor povereníkov), and vested in them the legislative and the executive power in Slovakia, respectively. No similar organs were established in the Czech lands, Bohemia and Moravia. This asymmetry created practical jurisdictional problems which were solved, as a rule, by affirming the jurisdiction of the central government. The supreme organ of the legislative power was again the National Assembly, a parliament consisting of a single chamber. The actual role of the new parliament fell off dramatically compared to the National Assembly under the 1920 Constitution. In downgrading the concept of the separation of powers, the new Constitution paved the way toward accepting the Communist party as a coalescing force behind all legislative, executive and even judicial activities of the state. Under this arrangement, there was no need for a system of checks and balances guarding against usurpation of power by one branch of government at the expense of others. The party reserved for itself the right to arbitrate any disputes regarding competence. [pageend12]Cz e c h o sl o v ak Co n st it u t io n al ism 9 Constitutional theory holds that a constitution is primarily an instrument to distribute political power. The 1948 Constitution introduced a system that resulted in executive dominance sustained by Communist party supremacy. Its two mainstays were the Government and the National Committees. The Government became the principal organ carrying out party and state policy. Its increased role was only partly due to the constitutional grant of power; it also grew as a result of the Government’s role as the manager of the nationalized economy. The National Committees, representative bodies of local government, constituted an ancillary structure for administering people’s democracy. The National Committees were first organized in 1945 and operated as organs of state power and administration in the lands (Bohemia and Moravia), regions, districts, and municipalities. They had the authority to issue decrees of general application within the territorial limits of their jurisdiction, and acted as local outposts of the central government. The 1948 Constitution incorporated the National Committees into the constitutional system and defined their jurisdiction and responsibilities. The Constitution retained the institution of presidency, even though the Soviet Union and other people’s democracies—with the exception of Poland—had opted in favor of a collective head of state. The office of the President was held, as a rule, by the incumbent at the helm of the Communist party. Perhaps the most important part of the 1948 Constitution were its provisions concerning the economic system. They rested on “the nationalization of mineral wealth, industry, the wholesale trade and of finance” and empowered the state to direct “all economic activity by a uniform economic plan.”7 They formally recognized the private sector as a legitimate part of the economy, but the policy of socialization pursued by the Communist party turned the constitutional guarantee into a dead letter. By 1950, the private sector was practically eliminated. The Constitution guaranteed all the traditional civil rights and incorporated social, economic and cultural rights. But they were embodied in a socialist manner: they could be restricted “on the basis of the law,” which included restrictions decreed by the executive branch of government. It was in this area that the lack of checks and balances in post-1948 Czechoslovakia was particularly noticeable. As far as individual rights and freedoms were concerned, there was one constitution known to all and a second, secret one, composed of internal directives and party resolutions. It was the second constitution that governed in practice. [pageend13]10 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al The 1948 Constitution lasted only twelve years. During its life, which partly coincided with the period of Stalinist lawlessness, Czechoslovak constitutionalism reached its lowest ebb. The Constitution was for the most part disregarded and the Communist party’s policies and decisions took priority over constitutional rules and guarantees. In April 1960, the Communist party’s Central Committee decreed that the country needed a new constitution which would “not only embody the attained stage of development of our society but also express the principal trends of the future development.” The decision was partly prompted by reasons of prestige and ideology: Antonin Novotny, the First Secretary of the Party and President of the Republic, wanted to elevate Czechoslovakia to the rank of states which had already attained socialism and—like the Soviet Union—embarked upon the road toward its higher stage: communism. The Constitutional Act of July 11, 1960 (No. 100/1960, Coll, of Laws) was the third Constitution adopted since the restoration of the Czech and Slovak statehood in 1918. In its preamble, the Constitution exclaimed that “socialism has triumphed in our country!”8 It changed the name of the state to the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and declared in Article 4 that “the guiding force in society and in the state is the vanguard of the working class, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, a voluntary militant alliance of the most active and most politically conscious citizens from the ranks of the workers, farmers and intelligentsia.” The leadership role of the party was again emphasized in Article 6 which stated that “the National Front of Czechs and Slovaks, in which the people’s organizations are associated, is the political expression of the alliance of the working people of town and country, led by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.” Whereas the 1948 Constitution declared that “the people shall be the sole source of power in the state,” the 1960 Constitution attributed all power to “the working people,” explaining that it meant “the firm alliance of the workers, farmers and intelligentsia, with the working class at its head.”9 Socialist democracy replaced the people’s democracy of the 1948 Constitution. The 1960 Constitution was concerned mainly with establishing a legitimacy of the Communist rule. The Constitution assumed that political and moral values derived from Marxism-Leninism must guide collective endeavors in the political, economic, social and cultural spheres. It also acknowledged the preeminence of the Soviet Union and pledged to The Constitution of 1960 [pageend14]Cz e c h o sl o v ak Co n st it u t io n al ism il follow its example. Like its 1948 predecessor, the Constitution declared Czechoslovakia to be a unitary state of two fraternal nations, the Czechs and the Slovaks. It somewhat broadened the prerogatives of the Slovak National Council, but ignored the Slovak demands that they should be granted political autonomy. Only the Hungarian, Polish and Ukrainian minorities were granted the right to education in their mother tongue and guaranteed free cultural development; the equally important German minority was not even mentioned by name. The new Constitution eliminated the vestiges of the separation of powers which could still be found in the 1948 Constitution. It advanced the concept of the single, undivided power of the working people from which the authority of all organs of the state was derived. The relations between the supreme state organs, the National Assembly, the President and the Government were to be based on the unity of power and a division of responsibilities. The National Assembly assumed additional responsibilities in performing supervisory functions with regard to other state organs as well as National Committees. It was given an express authority to annul the laws enacted by the Slovak National Council, if they conflicted with laws enacted by the National Assembly. After some initial debate whether to preserve the institution of presidency, the 1960 Constitution incorporated most of the provisions of the 1948 Constitution concerning the powers and responsibilities of the President. A new element was the accountability of the President to the National Assembly. The pivotal role of the Government as the supreme executive organ of state power emerged clearly from the constitutional provisions defining its responsibilities. The socialist economic system and socialist ownership, together with the state management of the national economy, was elevated to a paramount constitutional principle. The Constitution afforded protection to personal ownership by individuals, defining it as property intended for the satisfaction of their material and cultural needs. At the same time, the absence of any provisions on private property served as a notice that socialist relations ruled out private ownership of means of production. Individual rights were left for determination by the political process rather than being enforced by the judiciary. The 1960 Constitution gave the Government an excuse to abridge fundamental freedoms in the name of social and economic programs and to reduce basic individual rights in the name of collective rights. The situation sharply deteriorated after 1968, when hundreds of thousands of citizens were arbitrarily deprived of [pageend15]12 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al Even though socialism for most Czechoslovaks was something that had come on the coattails of the Red Army in 1945, they were not implacably opposed to it. They had accepted it in exchange for the economic security and tried to improve upon it. Although they gradually moved toward party pluralism and private ownership, in essence the movement was for more democracy under socialism, not for discarding the system. The 1968 reform movement for a “socialism with a human face” would almost certainly have led to a fundamental overhaul of the constitutional and legal order, had it not been violently ended by the Warsaw Pact intervention and the subsequent occupation of Czechoslovakia. One aspect of the constitutional reform, the federalization of the Czechoslovak state, was accomplished during the brief period of democratization. The idea of a federal state was proposed by the Slovak National Council (Slovenská národná rada) in a proclamation of June 15, 1968. On June 24, 1968, the National Assembly passed a law on the preparation of a new structure for constitutional relationship between the Czech and the Slovak nations. At the same time, it created a Czech counterpart of the Slovak National Council, the Czech National Council (Česká národní rada). The two National Councils were given the mandate to represent their respective nations at the negotiating table. On the political level, the Dubček leadership of the Communist party supported the idea of federalism: its action program proposed the reconstitution of the Slovak National Council as a legislative body and the establishment of a Slovak Council of Ministers (Slovenská rada ministrov) as an executive branch, together with an expansion of the competence of Slovak organs. The Slovak representatives, mindful of the past, when hesitant pledges to expand the powers of the Slovak organs had in each instance been The Constitutional Law of 1968 their rights in retaliation for their involvement in the Prague Spring. It was during the life of the 1960 Constitution that a group of courageous Czechoslovaks, led by Jan Patočka, Václav Havel and Jiří Hájek, raised their voices against the pattern of violation of human rights guaranteed by the Czechoslovak Constitution and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Czechoslovakia ratified in 1976. The Charter ’77 Manifesto, which gave rise to civic activity of unexpected proportion, documents the absence of human rights guarantees in the 1960 Constitution.10 [pageend16]Cz e c h o sl o v ak Co n st it u t io n al ism 13 followed by renewed centralism, insisted on a detailed revision of the Constitution within a fixed time. They proposed that agreed constitutional changes be promulgated by October 28, 1968, the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the Czechoslovak Republic. This was achieved by Constitutional Act No. 143 of October 27, 1968 concerning the Czechoslovak Federation (Československá federace). The Act recognizes the inalienable right of the Czech and Slovak nations to self-determination even to the point of separation, and creates two sovereign republics, the Czech Socialist Republic and the Slovak Socialist Republic, having equal position in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. On the federal level, the supreme organ of state power and the sole legislative body is the Federal Assembly (Federální shromáždění), a bicameral parliament, which comprises the Chamber of the People (Sněmovna lidu) and the Chamber of Nations (Sněmovna národů). The Chamber of the People represents the population of the country as a whole, and is elected by direct vote in the whole Czechoslovak Republic. In contrast, one half of the Chamber of Nations represents the Czech voters and the other half the Slovak voters. Complex voting procedures, which make it impossible for the deputies of one republic to outvote the deputies of the other republic, are provided for making decisions on issues involving national interests of either nation. Both the Government and the President are accountable to the Federal Assembly for their activities. Each of the two republics has its legislature, the National Council (Národní rada), and its national government. The Act carefully balances the competencies of the federation and of the republics and defines the powers of their respective organs. Perhaps the equally spectacular innovation was the provision for creating a Constitutional Court (Ústavní soud) with broad powers of judicial review. However, the establishment of the Constitutional Court was being postponed indefinitely by the postinvasion Husák leadership after it reimposed strict party control known as the policy of “normalization.” This created a paradoxical situation under which one of the principal organs envisaged by the Constitution was completely eliminated from the picture. On October 27, 1968, the National Assembly passed a companion Act on the Status of Ethnic Groups in Czechoslovakia (Zákon o postavení národností v Československé socialistické republice) (Act No. 144/1968, Coll, of Laws). The law recognizes the minority status of the Hungarian, German, Polish and Ukrainian ethnic groups and accords them basic minority rights. [pageend17]14 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al The consolidated text of the 1960 Constitution and of the 1968 Act on Czechoslovak Federation constituted the Czechoslovak Constitution which was in effect at the time of the November 1989 democratic revolution. Since the revolution, the Federal Assembly has repealed the provisions concerning the leading role of the Communist party and has made substantial changes in other constitutional provisions. Subject to these amendments, the socialist Constitution of 1960 remains in force to this day. This piecemeal approach to the making of a new constitution has produced two constitutional enactments that truly made history. The first was the Constitutional Act of January 9, 1991 promulgating the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms (Listina základních práv a svobod) (No. 23/1991, Coll, of Laws).11 The Charter is the equivalent of the Bill of Rights of the United States Constitution: it is an enforceable standard and, at the same time, a yardstick by which to measure the constitutionality of legislative acts and governmental regulations. No less important is a provision of the Act that affirms the binding force of relevant international treaties on human rights, makes them the law of the land throughout Czechoslovakia, and places them above all domestic laws. Czechoslovak courts are now required to enforce legitimate claims made by individuals under such international treaties as the International Covenants on Human Rights or the European Convention on Human Rights. The second amendment which changed the Czechoslovak constitutional landscape was the Constitutional Act of February 27, 1991 establishing the Constitutional Court (No. 91/1991, Coll, of Laws).12 The Act vests the Constitutional Court with the power to rule on conflicts of jurisdiction between federal organs, between federal and republic organs, and between organs of the two republics. The existence of a judicial body with the power to invalidate laws on constitutional grounds is likely to have beneficial effect on the generally unstable constitutional equilibrium in Czechoslovakia. It will reinforce constitutional checks and balances and keep the legislative process on course. Furthermore, the constitutional process since 1989 has singled out federalism as the most important constitutional value. The federal structure of the Czechoslovak state is not only fait accompli, but it is the best guarantee of the Czechoslovak statehood. Federalism provides the best possible basis for Czecho-Slovak cohabitation, as it seeks to achieve unity Constitutional Improvisation [pageend18]Cz e c h o sl o v ak Co n st it u t io n al ism 15 Apart from these positive developments, Czechoslovak constitutionalism is facing serious problems that test its staying power. The newly awakened nationalism has injected a new dimension into the constitutional process: the Slovak claim of sovereignty. Sovereignty is a legal concept that is rarely used in a constitutional context. It denotes supreme power within the state, and in relations with other sovereign entities it conveys the idea of independence. Can there be a federation whose members exercise supreme power and are independent of each other? The recent developments in the former Soviet Union give a straightforward answer to this question. The new Commonwealth of Independent States is certainly not a federation and hardly a confederation. The Slovak claim could probably be accommodated within a confederacy. Confederacy is a union of independent states that are willing to delegate certain attributes of their sovereignty to a common authority. However, historical experience shows that confederacy cannot work in the long run. As James Madison observed, after studying the experience of the Belgian Confederacy, “what are the characters that practice has stampt on it? Imbecility in the government; discord among the provinces; foreign influence and indignities; a precarious existence in peace, and peculiar calamities from war.”13 America decidedly rejected confederacy as the form of its government, and went to civil war when the proposition was dramatically reintroduced in the context of South-North conflict in the 1860s. This is not to suggest that Czechoslovakia should follow America’s example. However, Madison’s assessment has a bearing on the present Czechoslovak situation. It forewarns of possible alienation resulting from separate economic, social and legal developments within the parts of the confederacy. Imagine what would happen if the Slovak Republic chooses a system that provides for socialist redistribution of wealth, while the Czech Republic consistently implements the program of transition to a market economy. A total break would probably be inevitable. Confederacy The Crisis of Czechoslovak Constitutionalism while also preserving national identity. It encourages idiosyncracies and self-expression, and reinforces self-government. Federalism, like the separation of powers, also serves to protect individual freedom. Whatever were the reasons for which the politicians in 1918 opted for unitary government, it must be recognized that it was a fateful mistake for which the succeeding generations have paid dearly. [pageend19]16 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al Although the need for a new constitution is generally recognized, the constitutional process is stalled after several rounds of political talks initiated by President Havel. The Federal Assembly has virtually been excluded from participating in the present stage of the constitutional process. Instead, the partners to an extra-parliamentary dialogue agreed that the legislatures of the two republics, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, enter into a state treaty (whose legal meaning remains undefined: will it be a treaty under international law or under constitutional law?) which will lay down the principal provisions of a future federal constitution. The treaty will be binding upon the Federal Assembly which cannot depart from it when adopting a new federal constitution. The whole process is immersed in the sea of ambiguity. For example, no answer can be extracted from the principal partners to the question whether the federal Constitutional Court will have the power to interpret the state treaty and the constitutional provisions based on it. If the Constitutional Court can rule on the interpretation of the state treaty, then the treaty is an instrument of national law. If the treaty is subject to international law, The Thorny Road to a New Constitution may perhaps become the acceptable principle of state organization within a broader Central European framework. As Central Europe gropes for a separate identity between the increasingly assertive Germany and a potentially hegemonic Russia, it may find it of advantage to fill the power vacuum betweeen the Elbe and the Bug by creating a Polish-Czech- Slovak-Hungarian union (which Slovenia and Croatia, and perhaps even Austria, may wish to join). The issue of sovereignty opened a Pandora box which let loose all Czechoslovak federation’s misfortunes. The essence of the ensuing crisis is the extent to which the federation can exercise its own sovereign powers. If the federation should become merely an agent of the republics without powers of its own, it would be reduced to a pawn not worthy of the world’s care. The preliminary drafts of the constitutions of the republics, which have been circulating in Prague and Bratislava, suggest that the federation would be left practically powerless. Discord over the procedure to be followed aggravates the crisis. President Havel’s insistence on a referendum as the method of determining the future setup of the state has been effectively mooted by the Federal Assembly’s inability to pass an implementing legislation. [pageend20]Cz e c h o sl o v ak Co n st it u t io n al ism 17 President Havel’s recent proposals concerning the future constitutional setup have raised a number of important issues touching upon the substance of Czechoslovak constitutionalism. One of them is the role of the president. The Czechoslovak president is the head of state but not the chief executive. He has less power than the Prime Minister or the leader of a parliamentary faction: only the prestige of the personalities of Tomáš G. Masaryk, Eduard Beneš and now Václav Havel has afforded these presidents actual powers that outgrew the narrow limits of their constitutional prerogatives. The 1960 Constitution, which is still in force, was not Parliamentary or Presidential System? then it should designate an international body that will be competent to decide disputes concerning its interpretation and application. Unfortunately, the constitutional debate in Czechoslovakia is becoming increasingly ideological. It obscures the values of federalism, the basis of which is choice. President Havel seems to have grasped this basic truth. He has initiated legislation which, if enacted by the Federal Assembly, will reinvigorate the constitutional process and give it a sense of direction. His goal is to find speedy and practical solutions to outstanding constitutional issues. Also, the federal government has taken a firm position by proclaiming seven basic conditions necessary for the existence of a common state: direct elections to the federal legislature; recognition of the federation as a sovereign entity under international law; a common constitution for the entire country; exclusive federal jurisdiction in matters that are of essence to the functioning of the state; the need for a single market, currency, and economic legislation; a common social policy; and the ability of the federation to finance important economic and ecological projects. If the stalemate continues, can the country live without a constitution? Of course it can. There are democracies that function without a written constitution. The most notable examples are the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Israel. Their constitutional principles and rules are embedded in customary and statutory law, and they follow these principles and rules with remarkable consistency and continuity. Czechoslovak constitutionalism has accumulated principles and rules that can serve as a default constitution if no accord is reached soon on the text of a written constitution. A functioning Constitutional Court can amplify these rules and suggest legislative substitutes for constitutional rules. [pageend21]18 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al based on a separation of powers but on the principle of “supremacy” of parliament, naturally under the leadership of the Communist party. The president’s actual powers did not stem from the constitutional award but from the fact that he was the head of the Communist party. The present incumbent does not enjoy this privilege. His legal powers are extremely limited. The experience of the twenty-four months of renewed Czechoslovak democracy suggests that a stronger presidency may be needed to counteract the increasingly unpredictable legislative power. A great number of political parties unable to agree, deputies with shifting loyalties, and frequent splits along national lines impair the role of parliament as the mainstay of the Czechoslovak constitutional system. Although the Czechoslovak state was conceived, in 1918, as a parliamentary democracy, there is no compelling reason to continue it as such. This is the time for Czechoslovakia to decide whether to choose a parliamentary or a presidential system. In theory, a parliamentary system offers advantages over a presidential system. It provides incentives for smaller parties to operate within the established order rather than to resort to violence (the dubious value of this argument was demonstrated by the behavior of the Communist party under the leadership of Klement Gottwald in pre-World War II Czechoslovakia). It is true that a presidential system offers fewer guarantees that small parties will have the possibility to influence policy, as it has the tendency to promote the creation of a strong two-party system. However, this may not be a bad idea at a time when the country suffers from excesses of small party politics. A presidential regime can be as democratic as a parliamentary system. The system existing in the United States for more than two centuries convincingly proves this. The powers of the president are effectively checked by both the legislative and the judicial branch of government. So experimentation is quite in order. “Just as Americans found it necessary to change our structure radically in order to survive as a nation, so too the Czechs and Slovaks may have to drastically change theirs. Whether they have time to experiment given their immediate economic problems, and whether future difficulties will bring them together rather than drive them farther apart, are questions that time alone can answer.”14 Even if the Czechoslovaks decide to maintain parliamentary democracy, they may wish to change the rule according to which the president is not chosen by popular vote but elected by the parliament. At the present time, the President lacks a democratic legitimation through popular [pageend22]Cz e c h o sl o v ak Co n st it u t io n al ism 19 Any future constitutional arrangements should seek to encourage democratic development and economic recovery of the country. For this purpose, it should adequately reflect Czechoslovakia’s status as an independent nation and a federal democracy; provide the most suitable framework for the economic, social and political development of Czechoslovakia as a democratic state based on social justice; recognize an appropriate division of responsibilities between the federation, the republics, and local government; reintroduce separation of powers and the system of checks and balances; and ensure that individual rights are not left for determination by the political process, but are enforceable in courts of justice. 1.

Gordon Skilling Masaryk was born 1850 in Hodonín, a Moravian village in what was known as Slovácko, or Moravian Slovakia, situated on the border of Slovakia proper and having a mixed population of Slovaks, Moravian Czechs, Germans, and a medley of Czech and Slovak dialects. His father was a Slovak peasant, who spoke only Slovak; his mother was a Germanized Moravian Czech who spoke primarily German and had some difficulty with Slovak. Tomáš grew up as “a real slovácký lad,” according to Nejedlý.2 As a boy and youth he spoke Moravian or Slovak, and as an Masaryk’s Slovak Roots Tomáš Masaryk was unusual among Czech politicians for his deep interest in the Slovaks of northern Hungary, and for his persistent striving to assist them in their struggle for national rights. Most other Czech political leaders felt constrained by the Dualist System not to interfere in the affairs of the Hungarian Kingdom and bent their efforts almost exclusively to the attainment of Bohemian state right for the Czechs in Austria. Masaryk was a bitter critic of the Dualist System and of the oppressive policies of the ruling Magyars with regard to their national minorities, especially the Slovaks. He also severely criticized the attitudes of the dominant Slovak Nationalist movement, and inspired the development of new Slovak tactics for attaining national rights. He exerted a great influence on younger Slovaks, both those who were studying in Prague, and those at home in Slovakia. As in so many other issues, however, Masaryk was a somewhat isolated figure, supported by a relatively small fraction of Slovak nationalists and bitterly attacked by the Slovak leaders of the old school. Although a number of other Bohemian Czechs were concerned about the fate of the Slovaks, they were interested mainly in giving them a helping hand in literary and cultural fields and did not usually share Masaryk’s more political approach.1 [pageend24]T. G. Masar yk an d t h e Sl o v ak s 21 In 1900 Slovaks numbered approximately two million, about 10-12% of the population of the Hungarian Kingdom. Largely agrarian in occupation, they were poor and socially disadvantaged, and had only a slightly developed petty and middle bourgeoisie. The Magyars were the big landowners and dominated industry. The social misery of the Slovaks led to an enormous emigration—some 300,000 between 1899 and 1913. It also produced a strong tendency towards assimilation to the ruling nation, due in part to a striving for social advancement, but also to strict official policies of Magyarization in education and other spheres of life.4 For decades Slovaks had been uncertain as to their linguistic identity, some favoring the use of Czech, others, such as the Catholic priest, Father Bemolák, a distinct Slovak language, based on the Western Slovak dialect, and others, such as the poet Jan Kollár, and the scholar, Pavel Josef Šafařík, advocating a unified language, alternately called Czechoslovak or Czechoslav. In the 1840s, under the influence ofĽudovít Štúr, Slovaks opted for a separate Slovak language, based on the Central Slovak dialect, thus separating themselves from the Czechs linguistically.5 With the establishment of the Dualist System in 1867 Slovaks were also cut off from the Czechs by a political frontier and enjoyed no political autonomy in the regions of northern Hungary which they inhabited. In the revolution of 1848 they sided with Austria against Hungary and again The Slovak Situation adult he could still speak Slovak. His name was spelt in different ways in the several dialects of the region (Masarik, Masařík, etc.) but as early as 1868 his own preference was Masaryk. He knew German well as a result of the influence of his mother and his early schooling, of wide reading of German literature, and of studying and teaching in Vienna. He gradually developed a knowledge of literary Czech but did not write it without errors. During his years in Vienna, as a student, Masaryk maintained his interest in his homeland by frequent visits and was active in Czech and Slovak student groups. When he went to Prague as university professor in 1882, he had consciously to make himself a Czech by acquiring a greater proficiency in the language. Thus it is not easy to identify Masaryk’s real national origin or even his national consciousness. Although in his earlier years he sometimes called himself a Czech or a Moravian, in later life he claimed that he was half-Slovak or sometimes that he was of pure Slovak origin.3 [pageend25]22 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al in 1861, in a memorandum presented to the Emperor, they sought support from Vienna. After 1867 their only recourse was to appeal to Budapest, requesting legal recognition of Slovaks and their language, and the establishment of an Upper Hungary Slovak Region, as set forth in the memorandum of 1861. Hungarian centralized absolutism had no sympathy for these claims and adopted, in breach of the Nationality Law of 1868, a policy of ruthless Magyarization of schools, offices and cultural institutions. A very limited suffrage, Magyar manipulation of elections as well as an initial policy of non-participation, blocked significant Slovak political participation. In four elections between 1869 and 1881 they had no seats in the Hungarian parliament; in a fifth, in 1872, only two. In the next five polls, between 1901 and 1907, Slovaks were able to elect a total of fifteen representatives, with a high point of seven in 1906; this representation fell to three in 1910 and 1912.6 By 1900 the demands of the 1861 program fell into desuetude and the national movement recognized the integrity of the Hungarian kingdom. They focussed their demands on the implementation of the 1868 nationality law and concentrated on cultural activities such as establishing Slovak schools. The memorandum of 1910, for instance, set forth language claims only. No help was forthcoming from Vienna or from the Czechs in Bohemia and Moravia, and Slovaks had to face the Budapest regime alone and almost unaided. Efforts to achieve cooperation with other national minorities met with some success in 1905 with the formation of a nationality party grouping together in the Hungarian parliament eight Rumanians, one Serb and one Slovak, Milan Hodža. In the elections of 1906 their number was increased to 25, including seven Slovaks. The Slovak political scene was amorphous and divided.7 The only political party before 1900 was the National Party, founded in 1872, which remained the main Slovak party down to the war. At first it rejected participation in elections, but after 1900 it became more politically active and scored some success in the 1901 voting. Other groups, such as the Hlasists, who favored cooperation of Czechs and Slovaks, and the Catholics, did not at first form political parties. Among the former, there were sharp differences of opinion; the movement eventually broke up into fractions which, however, continued to pursue a Czechoslovak policy. The Catholics, under Father Hlinka and others, with their organ Katolické noviny, acquired considerable influence among the common people. In 1905, two new parties were formed—the Social Democratic party, and the Slovak People’s party. The latter was founded by some Catholics and [pageend26]T. G. Masar yk an d t h e Sl o v ak s 23 leading Hlasists, to challenge both the National Party and the Catholic People’s Party. In 1906 the Party won six of the seven seats in parliament: two were Hlasists and four Catholics. The National Party obtained only one seat.8 In 1913, after controversies with the National Party, a new (Catholic) People’s Party was formed, under the leadership of Andrej Hlinka. Only in the final hours of the Monarchy, in May 1914, did the National Party, the Hlasists and the Social Democrats (but not the Catholics) agree to establish a common Slovak National Council.9 The Slovak political atmosphere in the eighties and nineties was dominated by the conservative and nationalistic attitudes of an old guard of leaders, of whom the most influential figure was the poet, Svetozar Hurban-Vajanský. An impassioned defender of Slovak national interests, he enjoyed widespread respect and was several times imprisoned for his polemical articles. The base of the movement was the small town of Turčiansky Svätý Martin, where its newspaper, Národne noviny, was published and the cultural organization, Matica Slovenská (1863) was located. During these years the Martin center, in the tradition of Ľudovít Štúr, stood for the distinctiveness of the Slovak language and nation but offered no concrete proposals for the attainment of national goals. Pessimistic about achieving any improvement by their own efforts, the Martin center was driven into a kind of fatalism and political passivity, including for some years non-participation in elections. The leaders, all intellectuals, had no close relations with the people, and were anti-Western and anti-modem in their thinking. Vajanský travelled often in Russia, admired Russian literature and was acquainted with Russian panslavists. Fascinated by the great Slav country, he believed that the only escape for Slovaks from a hopeless situation was some future catastrophic turn of events in which salvation would come from the East. Vajanský, however, also associated himself with Slav solidarity among journalists, and even with the idea of Austroslavism, and was personally acquainted with a number of Czech cultural figures; he was at first on friendly terms with Masaryk and his family. Later, however, he came to distrust him and the Czech national movement, fearful of what he thought was their objective of a linguistic merging of the two nations. Convinced of their own righteousness and fearful of national disunity, the Martin leadership condemned any criticism of their policies.They were characterized, according to Vávro Šrobár, by a “tyrannical authoritarianism,” and their paper became a kind of “court of inquisition” which condemned alternative views as treasonable and a threat to national unity. [pageend27]24 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al Although the Martin center enjoyed a kind of monopoly position to the end of the century, there were increasing signs of dissatisfaction with its policy, even among its own supporters such as Samuel Stanovič and his son, Milan. The Catholics for some years supported the aims of the Martin center and did not seek to be an open opposition to it but were highly critical of its pan-Slavism and of its tactics. They were deeply interested in the social question and were much closer to the village people through their local parishes. After 1900 the Slovak working class and the workers movement represented another challenge not only to the National movement but also to the Catholics. Slovak workers in Budapest and Vienna, and later in Bratislava and Hodonín, turned toward socialism, mainly within the Hungarian Social Democratic party, which, however, often refused to support their national claims. A greater challenge to Martin was offered in the late 1890s by a new generation, “a new type of Slovak intelligentsia,” who began to criticize the conservatism, provincialism and romantic Russophilism of the Martin center and to look to the Czechs for guidance and support. In Vienna Slovaks met with progressive, democratic, free-thinking, and even socialist, ideas. Masaryk introduced them to the Anglo-Saxon world and to an alternative conception of politics, involving morality, small-scale work, realism, and a critical attitude towards leadership and the established wisdom. Under his influence, they increasingly looked to the West for inspiration and sought salvation in their own efforts. As Šrobár put it, “In politics we shall go to the people and together with the people we shall acquire power and rights for the nation. We freed ourselves from passivity; we ceased to wait for salvation from abroad; we shall awaken the people with newspapers, meetings and books.”10 The Hlasists,11 as they came to be called, followed their “leader and teacher,” Masaryk, advocating activism, small-scale work of ordinary people, and democracy. This was, for Šrobár, the “justified demand of the times” and involved personal freedom and freedom of expression, freedom of the press, association and assembly, and religious and national tolerance.12 Alliance with the Czechs was the only way to realize their goal of the moral, political, economic and cultural revival of Slovak life. There was, however, some difference among them on the language question. Some, for instance, J. Smetanaj, favored a fusion of Czech and Slovak into one language (as did K. Salva, editor of Slovenské listy). Šrobár, on the other hand, emphatically rejected a single literary language or any fusion of the two nations in a political sense. [pageend28]T. G. Masar yk an d t h e Sl o v ak s 25 From the eighties on, there gradually developed among Czech cultural and professional persons a substantial concern for the Slovaks and a desire to promote Czech and Slovak cooperation. Their aim was to aid the Slovaks in cultural, and later in economic, fields, and did not involve political cooperation. The most important manifestation of this attitude was the founding, in 1895, of Ceskoslovanská jednota (Czechoslav Association), which sought to spread knowledge of the Slovaks among Czechs by lectures and a journal, and to support the former in their cultural strivings by sending books and periodicals, by supporting Slovak publications, by assisting Slovaks to study in Czech schools in Moravia, and by aiding Slovak banking institutions. This organization was limited in numbers, having, in 1912, 2,361 members, of whom 140 were Slovaks. After a meeting of Czechs and Slovaks in the Slovak spa Luhačovice in 1905, there followed annual meetings down to 1913 designed to promote better understanding of the two national groups. According to the historian, Bokeš, the Luhačovice meetings denied the goal of Czechizing Slovaks and recognized a dual literary language. From 1905 Jednota was more active in spreading knowledge about Slovakia, organizing, in that year, a conference of friends of Slovakia in Hodonín, sponsoring in 1907 a new periodical, Naše Slovensko, in Prague, and organizing lecture tours by Slovak leaders. The brutal repression in Čemová in 1907 stirred up great indignation among Czechs and led to many protests against Hungarian policy. This tragedy also awakened interest abroad—in Norway (the writer B. Bjömson), in England (R.W. Seton-Watson), in France (E. Denis), in Russia (Lamansky) and in other parts of the monarchy (Karl Renner in Austria, O. Jaszi in Hungary) and among American Slovaks.13 There were other efforts to bring Czechs and Slovak., together, e.g. among Catholics, especially in Moravia, and among industrial workers. In the Social Democratic movement there was frequent interaction and cooperation, and Czech Social Democratic leaders, such as F. Soukup and F. Němec, and the party itself, expressed sympathy for their Slovak comrades and gave support to their publications. Masaryk and the Hlasist Šrobár as well as Milan Hodža, were not unsympathetic to the Slovak socialists. Masaryk’s critical view of Marxism influenced their conception of socialism along evolutionary or reformist lines.14 Hodža was also an exponent of agrarian interests and later established contacts with the Czech agrarians. Czech Interest in the Slovaks [pageend29]26 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al Leading Czech politicians were on the whole indifferent to the Slovak question. Ladislav Rieger, the “grand old man” of Czech politics, blamed the Slovaks for separating linguistically from the Czechs and believed that they should Czechize their language use. He accepted the reality of the Dualist System and concentrated on Bohemian state right objectives within Austria. Young Czechs, such as Josef Kaizl and Karel Kramář, were also at first indifferent. The latter, in spite of his neo-Slav approach to politics and foreign affairs, did not sympathize with the Russophilism and pan-Slavism which was prevalent among Slovaks at the time.15 Most Czech political parties did not even touch on the Slovak question in their programs and were consumed with their goal of achieving Bohemian state right. The tragic events in Čemová in 1907, however, aroused greater interest, expressed by Czech deputies in parliament, and also in the programs of the Social Democratic and the National Socialist parties. The parties with which Masaryk was associated endorsed his view that the case for Czech independence within Austria should be based rather on natural than on historic state rights but did not openly argue for Czechoslovak unity in an Austrian federation. In fact, the programs paid meager attention to the Slovaks and the Slovak question. The People’s Party program of 1900, for instance, while recognizing the rights of the lands of the Hungarian Crown, merely noted that Slovaks, like other Hungarian nationalities, were suppressed in their linguistic, national, economic and cultural relations.16 There was a brief mention of Palacký’s idea in 1848 of joining the Slovaks to the Bohemian land.17 After the adoption of the program Jan Herben read a letter from Slovakia, which begged the congress not to forget the Czech nation under the Tatras. The task of the Czechoslav realists was to solve the practical results of the unity of the Czech nation for the Slovaks, too, and should not forget a program, if not at present political—then at least cultural and economic—for Slovakia. Although the Slovaks would have to carry it out themselves, there should be a single program.18 Progressive party programs in 1900 and 1906 were a little more emphatic. In both reference was made to the fact that a fourth of “our nation” lives in Hungary, and while recognizing the political position of the Hungarians, “we demand full nationality protection for the Slovaks and for all non-Magyar nations, especially the Slavic.”19 Czech Political Parties and the Slovaks [pageend30]T. G. Masar yk an d t h e Sl o v ak s 27 In 1912 the Progressive Party, repeating the reference to Slovak oppression from the 1900 Realist program, went on to declare: “We consider the Hungarian Slovaks a part of the Czech nation, but we recognize their special position, given by political conditions, and do not deny them the right to speak of a ‘Slovak nation.’ We accept the literary Slovak language as a fact but we deem it more suitable for Slovaks to use Czech for scholarly writings and Slovak for other literature and joumal- As early as 1895, in The Czech Question, Masaryk described the Slovak question as of the greatest importance for Czechs. From his days as a student in Vienna, he had developed a deep interest in Jan Kollár, the apostle of Slavic reciprocity, whose thinking represented in his view a synthesis of humanism and Slavism, and had a deep impact on the Czech awakening as well as on Slovak thought. In The Czech Question, Masaryk ascribed great significance to the fact that Kollár was himself a Slovak and that his idea of Slavic reciprocity was bom among Slovaks. It was time, he wrote, not only to sing Slovak songs, but to feel and to think as a Slovak. He shared Kollár’s admiration of the virtues of devoutness, hard work, innocent cheerfulness, love of language, and peace-loving tolerance which he attributed to all Slavs, and which, thought Masaryk, were possessed by the Slovaks. Although he recognized their faults, as those of other nations, this did not prevent “a natural love for one’s own people, language and nation.” Both Czechs and Slovaks, he felt, could find an escape from their tribal smallness by uniting with all Slavs.21 A year later, in his book on Havlíček, Masaryk summarized the latter’s views on the need to awaken the national consciousness not only of Bohemia, but also of Moravia, Silesia and Slovakia. Havlíček condemned the linguistic, national and cultural independence of what he called the individual Czechoslav (Českoslovanský) tribes and lands. He ascribed to the Slovaks a purer national consciousness and believed that they would become “the leader of the whole Czechoslav nation in political, literary and public affairs generally.” The Moravian Slovaks, occupying a transitional position between Czechs and Slovaks, should be considered the real center of the Czechoslav nation. Havlíček recognized the right of the Slovaks to their own culture, but was opposed to the establishment of a separate Slovak language which, in view of the struggle for Masaryk on the Slovaks [pageend31]28 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al life and death in which the Bohemians, Moravians and Slovaks were engaged, would be suicidal. Although Masaryk did not explicitly identify himself with Havlíček’s views, he did not criticize them and, except for Havlíček’s condemnation of a separate Slovak language, presumably agreed with them.22 In discussing the events of 1848 in this book, Masaryk referred to Palacký’s plan of an Austrian federation based on natural rights, a principle which would have grouped the Czech parts of Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia, together with the Hungarian Slovaks, in what he called the “Czechoslav group.” He noted that Palacký had wavered between this and a federation based on the historic rights of the kingdoms and lands (which would have left Slovaks in the Hungarian kingdom), and had ultimately given up the former plan. Havlíček had also wavered, according to Masaryk, but favored an ethnic federation, a position which seemed more to Masaryk’s liking.23 Masaryk was not himself a passionate defender of the Bohemian state rights concept which other parties regarded as central to their goal of freeing the Czech nation. In his essay on natural and historical rights, written in 1900, Masaryk severely criticized dependence on ancient historic rights which had been de facto interrupted by the constitutional merging of Bohemia with the rest of Austria after 1867. While not abandoning state rights as a supplementary support, he argued that the natural rights of a nation were a better basis for the goal of national self-determination and for an Austrian federation. Masaryk made no direct reference to the Slovaks in this essay, and did not explicitly use the two concepts as a basis for including Czechs and Slovaks together in a federated Austria.24 In a later lecture on the problem of a small nation, in 1905, Masaryk made explicit what was clearly implied in his earlier writings, namely that he regarded the Slovaks as part of the Czech nation.25 In a parliamentary speech in 1907, in which he condemned the inhuman treatment of the Slovaks by the Magyars, he again referred to the two million Slovaks as “belonging to our nationality” and as “co-nationals.” In a speech in Budapest in 1911 he again asserted that the existence of a separate Slovak language did not stand in the way of Czech-Slovak reciprocity. Recognizing the reality of the Hungarian state in which the Hungarian minority ruled, he urged that the best way for the Slovaks to resist Magyarization was to make themselves independent politically, culturally, nationally and socially.26 [pageend32]T. G. Masar yk an d t h e Sl o v ak s 29 Masaryk was apparently not associated with Czech-Slovak groupings such as the Jednota, but exerted his influence as an individual, and especially through his friendship with Slovak students at the University. The latter formed an organization, Detvan, as early as 1882, a tiny group which had only 268 active members during its thirty years of existence. For the first ten years it was supportive of the views of the National Party in Slovakia. Gradually, however, Slovak students came under Masaryk’s influence, attending his lectures, reading his writings, and visiting his home. Discussions with Masaryk in 1889 or 1890 did not lead to the publishing of ajournai, as he had recommended. It had a lasting effect on some of them, such as Vávro Šrobár, president of Detvan, who began to visit Masaryk often and to read Čas regularly. Other Slovak students studied Masaryk’s works, such as The Czech Question, The Social Question, and How to Work. They were attracted by his critical attitude and his emphasis on small-scale work and were thus gradually weaned away from their devotion to the National Party and from its Russophilism. After Šrobár’s departure from Prague, Detvan was often divided in its views and tended to revert to a pro-Martin orientation; later, under the influence of Milan Štefánik, an active member, and later its president, it swung back to a Czech orientation.28 Among other students who fell under the influence of Masaryk was Anton Štefánek who has described his visits to the Masaryk household and the impact of his ideas and of his methods of teaching. He, and others, were led, he said, to criticize the Martin leadership and to accept the idea of Czech and Slovak cooperation. Masaryk also gave them a new view on nationalism, religion, morality, socialism and the social question, and led Masaryk’s Influence on the Slovaks Unlike Havlíček, however, Masaryk did not seek to eliminate the separate Slovak language which had developed, and did not regard its existence as an obstacle to the conception of a single Czechoslovak nation. There were other active Slovakophiles, such as Karol Kálal and František Pastmek, who urged the Slovaks to abandon a separate language and adopt Czech. So did the Slovak scholar, Jaroslav Vlček, and the young Slovak doctor, J, Smetanaj. Masaryk, however, held to the view that the Czech and Slovak languages should continue to exist separately—a view which was shared by Hviezdoslav and other Slovaks, and that this linguistic difference was subordinate to common values and traditions.27 [pageend33]30 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al them to fight against Russophile messianism, anti-Czech separatism, and political passivity. At the same time Štefánek was of the belief that the two literary languages could coexist within a single nation.29 Another Slovak, who was befriended by Masaryk during his fifteen years as a poor student and who became a close personal friend, was Milan Štefánik. He was a bitter foe of the Martin leadership and an ardent Hlasist and Realist, passionately supporting Masaryk’s ideas of Czechoslovak unity and cooperation. He contributed many articles to Čas and during 1902-1903 was its Slovak correspondent. He was also active in Jednota and strove to promote closer relations between Czechs and Slovaks.30 Another convert to Masaryk’s point of view was Milan Hodža who had studied in Budapest. He was strongly favorable to his progressive and democratic approach and to his ideas of “small-scale work” (drobná práce) and like him, tried to subordinate the question of language to broader social and democratic objectives. Later, as editor of Slovenský týždenník, his was a strong voice for unity of action by Czechs and Slovaks, especially in the economic field. As a member of the Hungarian parliament from 1906 to 1910, he spoke up for Slovak interests and as a leading figure of the Nationality Party, developed close relations with the Romanians, Serbs and other national minorities. Hodža was a bitter critic of Hungarian feudal society which, together with the policy of Magyariza- tion, he believed, had led Slovak youth to turn towards the Czechs. He helped to organize a Slovak agrarian movement in 1910 and was in close contact with left-oriented Magyars, including the Social Democrats and agrarian spokesmen. In spite of these leanings, Hodža cooperated closely with Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne, in an effort to achieve a revision of the Dualist System which would destroy Magyar hegemony and enlarge the position of the non-Magyar nationalities. By 1914, according to Gogolák, Hodža foresaw the collapse of the Monarchy and envisaged a political union of Czechs and Slovaks.31 Among Catholics, the parish priest, Father Andrej Hlinka, was a harsh critic of Magyarism and of the Jews, and a fervent advocate of Slovak national interests. Initially he favored unity of Czechs and Slovaks and was well-known to the former through lectures in Bohemia and Moravia. The Černová events in 1907 and his imprisonment made him a popular hero among Slovaks and also among Czechs. After his return from prison, however, Hlinka began increasingly to oppose Czech influences, and rejected any cooperation with Masaryk and the Hlasists.32 Masaryk’s ideas also stirred up interest in other Slovak communities, [pageend34]T. G. Masar yk an d t h e Sl o v ak s 31 Masaryk had his first direct contact with Slovaks in their homeland during summer holidays spent in the village of Bystřička in western Slovakia, a practice which he began in 1887 and continued, with only a brief interruption during his three years in parliament, down to 1902. This enabled him to deepen his knowledge of Slovak conditions and to become acquainted with many young Slovaks. He developed close friendly relations with Hurban-Vajanský and his family. Masaryk was made aware of the reality of the Slovak situation in 1893, when, with his family, he went to Kollár’s birthplace but was barred from attending the ceremony in honor of his 100th birthday by the police.34 A decisive event was a meeting with several young Slovaks, including Šrobár, in Bystrička in 1897, to discuss the publication of a journal, eventually founded later that year as Hlas. Agreement was reached on the main points of a wide-ranging political program which Šrobár filled out in greater detail and which remained the basis of action by the Hlasists in ensuing years.35 As the most extensive summary of Masaryk’s thinking on the Slovak question and as the expression of a consensus between Masaryk and young Slovaks, this deserves to be summarized in some detail. The sketch included a severe criticism of Hungary as “a medieval feudal state,” and described its Magyarization policy as “moral violence.” The Slovak people were “overwhelmingly agrarian and were living almost in serf- Masaryk and the Hlasists e.g. in Vienna and in Budapest. In Vienna, at the end of the century, it was reported by Anton Štefánek, there were sharp quarrels between the supporters of Vajanský and Masaryk and the latter remained in the minority. Many students were strongly critical of Czechs in general, expressing what he called Czechophobia. In Budapest, Czechs and Slovaks had few contacts and seemed (in retrospect) to Štefánek to belong to two cultural worlds. Their organizations were dominated by conservative Slovak nationalism, and Masaryk’s ideas were known to only a few individuals. In 1911 Masaryk, in a lecture in Budapest, stirred up much discussion by his statements on the Slovak question. In America Masaryk gave his views during his visits and they were also presented by visiting Slovak and Czech organizations. In the years before the war, according to Štefánek, the idea of Czech and Slovak cooperation and unity prevailed over the views of the Slovak League.33 [pageend35]32 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al dom.” The Jews were instruments of the government and were usurers, so that anti-semitism was justified. The Church was a bureaucratic institution, but was struggling against Hungarian liberalism and the Hungarian state. The clergy must become nationally-minded, understand the suffering of the people and seek to raise them morally.36 The program also attacked the attitudes of the national leaders in Martin, arguing that polemics should not be avoided in the interest of unity and that criticism would strengthen the nation. Pan-Russianism and Slavic cosmopolitanism must be resisted, and replaced by the idea of Slavic reciprocity in the cultural sense of Kollár and Šafařík. Relations with the Czechs must also be based on common ideas. The language question was not the supreme goal of the nation, although it was “a beloved and precious medium in the family, in literature, and in communications.” But it was impossible at present, or even in the distant future, to use Slovak in scholarship and science. Kollár had called for “reciprocity of ideas and of people, not of language.” Language was not “an obstacle to Czechoslovak reciprocity.” Nor was it anti-state to cultivate Czechoslovak reciprocity.37 The political points in the program called for the recognition of dualism and the integrity of Hungary, and of Magyar as the state language and as a common medium of communications. But Slovak should be used in office, church and school in the nationality areas. Slovaks must seek parliamentary representation and develop a national program. Its aims should be universal suffrage, local autonomy, a progressive tax, reform of the judiciary and administration, free instruction, including Slovak high schools and a university, and freedom of the press and of assembly. The publication of Hlas, a “monthly for literature, politics and the social question,” which began in 1898, and lasted until 1904, was a turning point away from the Martin leadership and toward Masaryk and Czechophilism. Edited at first by Pavol Blaho, it grouped together a small group of young Slovaks, perhaps no more than thirty, including persons such as Šrobár, Hodža, Štefánek, and Štefánik. Among its collaborators were Catholic priests, including at first Father Andrej Hlinka, and some Protestant clergy. Although the majority of the Slovak intelligentsia remained pro-Martin, the paper served to awaken Slovak youth to a new attitude toward Hungary and the Czechs; according to Štefánek, “it revolutionized the hearts and minds of the young generation in particular. ” Although it perished for financial reasons in 1904, it was succeeded by other publications written in the same spirit.38 [pageend36]T. G. Masar yk an d t h e Sl o v ak s 33 Masaryk’s “interference” in Slovak affairs earned him bitter abuse in some Slovak circles and few accolades among Czechs. As the target of Masaryk’s sharp criticism, the Martin nationalists felt their position of leadership threatened and in the early nineties turned against Masaryk and his ideas. Vajanský came to regard Masaryk as the “poisoner” of the minds of young Slovaks and as “an evil spirit of foreign origin.” In 1901 he wrote a novel, Kotlín, which was a polemic against realism, Hlasism, and Masaryk. In another vitriolic diatribe against Masaryk, Vajanský wrote of him as “arid in spirit,” “a half-comic, half tragic figure,” “a moderate radical,” “a non-Czech Czech,” “a humanist with a rapacious and revengeful inhumanity,” “a man without past or present... who Masaryk’s Critics and Defenders The first issue contained an editorial by Šrobár which was written entirely in the spirit of the Bystrička program and of Masaryk’s thinking on politics. “We want first and foremost that the Slovak people should be reborn morally. ” He bitterly attacked the Slovak intelligentsia, who were shut off from the people and cared little for their interests. “They stood isolated among two and a half million people, bound by the power of the state, caught in the Jewish spider net, lacking civic consciousness and spiritually and materially uncultured.” Openly declaring war on Martin and Russophilism, Šrobár called for realism, criticism, work among the people, and economic policies. Above all he stood firm for Czechoslovak reciprocity; for “the cultural and national unity of the Czechoslovak nation.” As he wrote elsewhere, this did not mean the formation of a single literary and written language. The political and linguistic unity in which Czechs and Slovaks had once lived had been dissolved; “now we speak of two nations which ought, however, to cultivate the closest mutuality between themselves.”39 Even after Hlas ceased to publish in 1905, other Slovak newspapers appeared, for instance Slovenský týždenník (M. Hodža) and Prúdy (A. Štefánek, Pavol Blaho, and Vávro Šrobár) which, in spite of some changes, stuck in large measure to the original Hlas program and continued to work in the spirit of Masaryk. B. Pavlů, for instance, in an article in Prúdy in 1910, thanked Masaryk as “a teacher of young Slovaks who led them toward inner strength, culture and an eternal struggle for truth and justice.” Hodža and Štefánek cooperated with Masaryk in the struggle for universal suffrage.40 [pageend37]34 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al wished to destroy everything and to spit on himself. ”41 Although Masaryk played down the difference of the two languages as an obstacle to unity, he was regarded with suspicion as a symbol of “Pan-Czechism” or “Czechization.” The condemnation of Masaryk was also motivated by fear and dislike of his ideas in general—in particular his Westernism, progressivism, philo-semitism, as it was called, and above all his religious views. His strong criticism of the Catholic Church and his devotion to Hussitism earned him the reputation of being anti-religious, even an atheist, which particularly turned Hlinka against him. The clerical press mounted a vicious campaign against him as an “apostate” and “a religious renegade” (odroň) and as “a spiritual poisoner of Slovak youth.” His critique of Russophilism was regarded as anti-Slav, and his views on Czechoslovak unity were interpreted as anti-Slovak. Hungarian circles, while remaining strongly opposed to Slovak nationalism, were afraid of Masaryk as representing the even greater danger of Czech and Slovak unity and as typifying Western progressive thought, anathema to the Magyar ruling class. The Magyar government gave its full support to a book, originally written in Magyar, by a Samuel Czambel, a “patriotic Slovak,” who warned against Czech influence and Czech-Slovak solidarity, and defended a separate Slovak language. Another Slovak, František Jehlička, originally a Hlasist, later a professor at the University of Budapest, attacked Masaryk as “a materialist, a non-believer, a fornicator and liar, and a destructive element” and warned Slovak Catholics and Protestants against supporting him. There were others who protested against the conservative views of the Martin leaders and were sympathetic to Masaryk’s ideas.42 This was notably the case of the poet Pavol Országh-Hviezdoslav, whose work Masaryk had made known in the Slavic world. Although he was of noble origin, Hviezdoslav developed a close friendship with Masaryk by correspondence and by exchange of visits. A strong believer in the value of a separate Slovak language, he also accepted the idea of the necessity of Czech help for the benighted Slovaks. Under pressure from Vajanský, however, he wavered in his support of the Hlasists but did not fully approve Vajanský’s course.43 An anonymous author, writing under the pseudonym Mea Kulpinský, published in 1901 a brochure which expressed the belief that Slovak misery was due not only to Magyar repression but also to negative features of the Slovaks themselves. The only hope could come from Czechoslovak political and cultural unity; together Czechs and Slovaks formed a single nation of seven and a half million. The two [pageend38]T. G. Masar yk an d t h e Sl o v ak s 35 Although Masaryk did not visit Slovakia regularly after 1897, he retained his lively interest in the Slovaks and saw to it that the journals, Čas and Naše doba, provided information on the Slovak question for Czech and Slovak readers. From its founding in 1894 Naše doba published occasional articles and reports, some of them by Masaryk himself. For example in 1901 he severely condemned Vajanský’s novel Kotlín as a tendentious polemic against new currents of Slovak thought. In 1904, in a brief note, he lamented the fact that the Czechs had no program touching on “two millions of our own people” living under foreign rule. His articles on more general themes, such as Kollár, Czech history, Marxism, and religion, undoubtedly also influenced Slovak thinking.45 An important series of anonymous articles in 1901 were thought to have been written by Masaryk himself but were in fact the work of a close friend of his, the Moravian schoolteacher, Karel Kálal, a tireless protagonist of Slovakophilism. The article ruthlessly dissected the weaknesses of the Slovaks themselves, especially the intelligentsia, which was lazy and pleasure-seeking, and remote from the ordinary people. The author denounced the Martin leadership, including Vajanský, personally, and its newspaper, Narodnie noviny. The latter offered no program for national work or for the moral rebirth of the nation, writing, for instance, nothing about the disease of alcoholism. It cultivated political and Slavic romanticism, especially Russophilism; it neglected Czech affairs and made no mention of Czechoslovak reciprocity. According to the author, the paper descended to the lowest level of abuse, describing, for instance, an article in Čas as filled with “filthy passion, incessant poison, and devilish and sinister attacks,” which were said to be far worse than anything written by Magyarones, Jews or paid informers. The Hlasists were attacked as “hooligans, fools and traitors.” The author offered a working program for the future, which stressed moral regeneration (a fight against alcoholism, prostitution, etc.), cultural training of the people through books and lectures, economic associations, and electoral activity. He proposed a meeting of Slovaks and Czechs for discussion of a working Slovak program and a program of Czechoslovak cultural reciprocity (which led to the Luhačovice meeting mentioned Čas and Naše doba on Slovakia peoples spoke different dialects of the same language, and the latter should adopt the Czech language, culture and literature.44 [pageend39]36 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al Even among those most wedded to the idea of Czech-Slovak reciprocity the idea of a political union of the two nations was not regarded with favor. For instance, in 1902, Šrobár wrote: “There cannot be any question of a fusion in the political sense; we are citizens of the Crown of St. Stephen and have recognized this publicly; we are obliged to defend the integrity of our homeland (krajina) against anyone.” Such romanticism and utopianism could only bring about persecution from powerful enemies and make the struggle for the rights of the Slovak people more difficult. “Therefore we expressly reject a priori all debates on our fusion with the Czech nation in the political sense. ”47 On the Czech side there was almost no open discussion of Czech-Slovak political unification. Masaryk, for instance, although a strong protagonist of an Austrian federation, did not openly advocate the Palacký and Havlíček idea of a Czech-Slovak entity. However, in 1906 in reviewing a book by Aurel Popovici, Masaryk complained that his proposal for a federation of the Monarchy neglected the Bohemian state right and on the other hand, proposed the unacceptable idea that Czechs and Slovaks, as “members of one and the same nationality, would form two separate states.”48 However, on the initiative of Jednota, a meeting of representatives of all Czech political parties in Prague in April 1914 protested against the persecution of Slovaks and Romanians in Hungary and spoke in favor of a federation of the entire monarchy, with common state citizenship, on the basis of the equality of all nations in Hungary.49 As war drew nigh, Czechs and Slovaks began to turn their thoughts towards a unified Czech and Slovak state. In a questionnaire conducted by Prúdy in 1914 a number of prominent Slovaks declared themselves in favor of national unity, even at the eventual price of abdicating written Slovak, and pledged themselves to work for Czechoslovak unification.50 One year before the outbreak of war, a Czech, Rudolf Pilat, in a letter of September 1913 to a leading American Slovak, Milan Getting, wrote: “Confidentially we can inform you that on the Czech side there have been preparations that in the event of the defeat of Austria, Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia would be joined with Slovakia in one state.”51 In another letter in May 1914, Pilat admitted that although the Slovaks could not publicly demand more than a so-called Slovak region within the frame- Political Union of Czechs and Slovaks above).46 [pageend40]T. G. Masar yk an d t h e Sl o v ak s 37 work of Hungary, he also reported that Hodža and Štefánek thought it would be better if the Czechs themselves publicly proclaimed the program of Havlíček for a union of Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia and Slovakia as one organic part of our empire.52 The same idea was broached by A. Štefánek in a letter to Getting, on May 19, 1914: “Slovaks are striving for cultural, economic, social and political independence, in the sense of a Czechoslovak agreement; they are striving to unite the territories of the Bohemian crown, Moravia, Silesia and Slovakia in one autonomous entity.” This was the ideal, he said, which might be realized after the death of the Monarch and the succession of Franz Ferdinand. In what would appear to be another part of the letter, Štefánek advocated cooperation with the Czechs, not only in the cultural and economic, but also in the political field. A number of Czech politicians, including Kramář, he said, had broken off relations with Magyar politicians during the meeting of the Delegations in that year. On the other hand, Slovaks and Czechs were meeting daily, he reported; only the latter were defending us in the Delegations and in parliament. “They are our deputies.”53 The shift in Slovak thinking was indicated in the revised program of the Slovak National Party in 1914. Although it did not openly urge Czech and Slovak political union, it spoke of the centuries of a common literary language and common culture, and cooperation of Slovaks with “our brother Czechs,” including half a million Slovaks in Moravia. “We demand the closest cultural and economic union with them so that we would each have an irreversible conviction that what is Czech is also Slovak, and vice versa. Culturally we are one, we have one literature, written in two literary languages—that is our credo. The closest Czech- Slovak reciprocity is our program.”54 A climax was reached, on the eve of war, at a meeting of Czech and Slovak leaders in Vienna during the Delegation meetings in May, 1914. Slovaks agreed among themselves on the formation of a Slovak national council and also held talks with Czech leaders at which they agreed to act jointly against Hungary and to coordinate their policies with the Serbs, Croats and Romanians.55 Conclusion The role of Masaryk in Czech-Slovak relations before 1914 has been variously interpreted in accordance with party or ideological standpoints. [pageend41]38 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al Some extreme Slovak nationalists ignored Masaryk altogether or downgraded his influence. Marxists in the fifties treated him as a mere exponent of Czech bourgeois interests, but in the sixties and seventies, some of them dealt with his role with more objectivity. Slovakophiles among Czechs, or Czechophiles among Slovaks emphasized Masaryk’s impact; those writing after the establishment of a Czechoslovak state often tended to glorify his role. Scholars without party or ideological affiliation argued that Masaryk exerted a powerful influence on some Slovaks, but acknowledged that his Slovak followers remained a minority. Before 1914 one could distinguish at least four tendencies among Slovak political activists. There was, first, the declining but still influential conservative Nationalist group, representing the traditions of Štúr and typified by Vajanský, with his passionate faith in the Slovak nation. In his view the Slovaks were “an ethnical group...endowed with all the qualifications, all the criteria of an autochthonous nation, with its own territory, personality, language, customs, ethnographical boundaries, history, merits, and sacrifices, its loyalty tried and tested in war and peace.” The second was the powerful Catholic tendency, representing in some degree the tradition of Father Bemolák, and personified by Hlinka, which supported Slovak national rights but within a clerical framework and had a widespread influence among ordinary people. Third was the group which favored a Czechoslovak orientation, in the tradition of Kollár, Havlíček and Šafařík, as typified by Šrobár and Hodža, which, by their own admission, enjoyed more limited support among Slovaks, even among the younger intelligentsia, and no great support among Czechs. Finally there was the relatively marginal social democratic tendency which favored Czech and Slovak cooperation but within the framework of Marxist internationalism. Within each of these groups there were, of course, nuances of difference, and often sharp conflicts. The relative strength of the several tendencies is difficult to estimate in the absence of evidence of public opinion or even of electoral strength. Of the three deputies in the Hungarian parliament after 1910, for instance, two represented the Catholic tendency (Hlinka and F. Styčak) and one the Czechoslovak orientation (P. Blaho).55 Differences of opinion as to Masaryk’s views on the Slovak question are due in part to a certain ambiguity in his utterances and also to some changes in his attitude over time. There is no doubt that he was a strong advocate of Czech and Slovak cooperation, both to buttress the position of the Czechs in Austria-Hungary and to assist the Slovaks in their plight [pageend42]T. G. Masar yk an d t h e Sl o v ak s 39 in Hungary. Yet while recognizing a distinct Slovak identity, he believed that the Slovaks and Czechs formed a single nation, separated only by differences in language, history and culture. On the language question he acknowledged that the two languages were different and believed that no fusion was likely or desirable. But he also stressed the desirability, at least for the immediate future, of the use of the Czech literary language by the Slovaks. Nor did Masaryk advocate before 1914 the political unification of Czechs and Slovaks in an independent state or even within Austria- Hungary. In 1917 Masaryk enlarged on his view of the language question when, in retrospect, he wrote about the Bystrička meeting in 1897: [He had]...laid great stress that the language question should not be exalted. Let the Slovaks write as they wish. The main thing is that we are in fact one, for the Slovak understands the Czech, and the Czech understands the Slovak. From the 19th century Slovaks were cut off from us and did not have their own independent political growth, so that they held on to older forms of their language and their dialects. Now that their language has been accepted as a literary language, let it remain so, as far as they recognize it as necessary. I know that Kollár and Šafařík were against separation and even Hurban Vajanský was at one time in favour of linking them together. This linkage, however, can and must be achieved politically. Let us leave language development to future generations. Let us reckon with facts as they are and bring them into organic harmony. Slovak exists and may not and must not stand in our way.57 As one of his supporters, Karel Kálal, wrote in 1930, Masaryk was several decades ahead of the nation, the greater part of which did not understand him. But there can be no doubt that he awakened many Czechs to the importance of the Slovak question. Similarly among Slovaks, although again his appeal was limited to a part of the nation, his influence on younger Slovaks was great and he guided them away from national separatism towards Czechoslovak cooperation. As Šrobár wrote in 1910, as a result of his influence, the younger generation freed itself from the influence of the old guard and began to think and act in the spirit of his views. He was “the father of a movement which had a beneficial influence on the vitalization of the Slovak people”; his disciples regarded him as “their teacher,” and “loved him as the best friend of the Slovak people.58 Viewed in historical perspective, it is undoubtedly true that Masaryk unwittingly prepared the ground for the unification of Czechs and Slovaks in a single state in 1919. Another of his disciples, Anton Štefánek, writing in 1931, stated that the Masaryk school performed a significant historic task; “without the direct intervention of T.G. Masaryk, events in Slovakia [pageend43]40 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al before the war and during the war would hardly have moved in the direction in which they did.” Writing elsewhere in the same year, he expressed the view that although the Slovak Hlasists did not identify themselves entirely with Czech realism, and in many things worked differently, they did constitute a movement which was “purely Masarykian and prepared the ground, frequently unconsciously, for a fateful time.”59 1.

It seems quite inaccurate to describe Masaryk and the Hlasists as “Czechoslavists” who were bent on wiping out Slovak national identity and replacing the Slovak language by Czech, as was argued by Michal Gávrik, “Hlasizm, alebo scestnost jedného apriorizmu” (Tvorba 1 March 1991: 23-25). The only evidence offered concerning Masaryk was his comment in a letter of January 29, 1889 to Karel Kramář that “Slovak is nothing other than Czech and who wishes to make something else out of it, cannot manage it; ergo Russianism.” Masaryk’s many later statements differing from this earlier view are not noted. 58.

[pageend48]Masaryk’s Idea of European Unity Genesis and Significance Miloslav Bednář The point of departure for Tomáš G. Masaryk’s conception of Europe’s unification, formulated during World War I, was anticipated by his stance toward Europe’s spiritual and political crisis in the concrete context of the Central European territorial question. Masaryk viewed Europe’s spiritual and political crisis in the tradition of the most important European thinkers of the past century: as a by-product of the transitory period which followed the French Revolution. In his 1880 doctoral dissertation on suicide1 he blamed the crisis on the failure of the Christian view of life and the world to be a unifying factor for Europe. Masaryk regarded the absence of religion in the modem world as a consequence of the struggle between free thinking and positive religions. The result was an intellectual and moral anarchy which would end in death.2 In historical retrospective, Masaryk saw the contemporary crisis as a confirmation of the law of human evolution which proceeds in stages of espousal and rejection of religious beliefs.3 The political reflection of the modem world crisis is the crisis of democracy. The European democracies are still too young to have been able to rid themselves of their external aristocratic and centralists features, most of all, of their unequivocal reliance on institutions.4 According to Masaryk, the ultimate goal of political and, particularly, democratic, institutions is to guarantee a democracy which sustains the versatility of individual philosophies of life and the world. Masaryk is continuing here both Palacký’s and Havlíček’s spiritually and ethically based conception of politics on the one hand, and the Platonic understanding of it on the other. For Masaryk, the spiritually moral basis of democratic politics lies in the absolutely individual path every human being, nation and state must take towards truth and in the indispensability of respecting this path, which means fundamentally supporting the moral veracity of its direction. Thus, for Masaryk, politics is in the real sense of the word a moral endeavor. This is the authentic, unremitting, ultimate [pageend49]46 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al meaning of democratic political institutions which he defines as a religious democracy. In the spiritually centered area of territorial politics Masaryk concentrates on the territory of Austria-Hungary. Here, as before, Masaryk harks back to Palacký and his conception of Austria as the focus of Europe’s historical decision-making. Austria was for Palacký a microcosm of Europe itself; here, centuries before, demands for religious equality were dealt with, just as now, beginning with 1848, questions of the equality of states were being faced. As we know,5 the results of the decisions made about Central Europe had, in both cases, far-reaching effects on all of European history. The impetus both for long European religious wars and later for nationally motivated world wars was supplied by the territory between Germany and Russia. Both Palacký’s and Masaryk’s conceptions of this territory suggested instead of a military solution a conflict-free alternative which would offer a spiritually and morally based future. Masaryk developed and refined Palacký’s conception of national equality and its implied need for a democratic federalization of Central Europe. Masaryk’s and Palacký’s conception of national equality, which would have given Austria the potential to become a great, cultural, democratic world power,6 ran afoul of the Austro-Hungarian ruling circles, which retained materialistic and undemocratic notions about the role and purpose of this multinational state. Masaryk was speaking here about a utopian, unrealizable version of a centralists Austria, whose idea of state was being put into practice in a discriminatory way.7 During the period before World War I the abstract idea of an Austro-Hungarian state was being implemented more and more overtly, something which, naturally, heightened tensions between it and the Western democratic political idea, emphatically supported by Masaryk. Habsburg policy was becoming more and more dependent on German foreign policy, whose aggressive, obviously antidemocratic character was clearly based on materialistic motives. The conflict between the spiritual-moral premises of the Czech and Czecho-Slovak tradition of political philosophy and the philosophical-political premises of the political actions of Austro-Hungary was deepening. The initiation of World War I by Austria-Hungary ended long years of efforts and spelled the end of any hopes Czech political figures might have had for a democratic federalization of this state based on the combination of natural and historical right. This act, inspired to a significant extent by Germany, was consonant with the overall goal of the cultural and political liquidation of the monarchy’s Slavic and Romance [pageend50]Masar yk ’s Id e a o f Eu r o pe an Un it y 47 speaking peoples. Masaryk’s decision to back the Allies in their struggle against Austria-Hungary and Germany openly and with force was based on the moral and spiritual reasons. The initiation of the world war by the Habsburg monarchy meant that the prevailing anti-democratic direction of Austro- Hungarian policy, already a fundamental challenge to Czech political philosophy, had assumed an openly violent form. In entering the war on the anti-Austrian side, Masaryk was serving the constructive or, rather the reconstructive, goals of the overall European cause, in full conformity with the morally and spiritually based Czechoslovak tradition of political philosophy. The eventual defeat of the Central Powers would thus make it really possible to invoke the Czech conception of a democratic, federative system in Central Europe. The military situation, however, also made it clear that the question was an all-European one at the very least. The breakup of Austria-Hungary and the reconstitution, this time along democratic lines, of as much of the former territory between Germany and Russia as possible, now seemed a precondition for any authentic and just all-European peace. The territorial arrangement so far had failed to cope with the fact that here, to an incomparably greater degree than anywhere else in Europe, was a melange of nationalities, religions and states. In other words, all attempts at a reasonable political organization of this territory that might have had a chance of success had so far failed precisely because of the lack of respect for the quintessential multinational character of the area in the philosophy of power politics. It is important to recognize that, at the beginning of World War I, the Western democracies had no particular common political philosophy on which a positive program could be based. Here they differed basically from Germany and Austria-Hungary, whose materialistically centered war program had been thoroughly researched and painstakingly prepared. The basic goal was a German solution of the so-called Eastern question. The wax was to assure once and for all German hegemony in the area between Germany, Russia and Turkey. The strategic objective of this war begun by Austria-Hungary was the predominance of German influence in the Near East and, if possible, in Egypt; the expulsion of Great Britain from this area would enable Germany to rule the world. Austria-Hungary accepted and actively supported this aggressive and anti-democratic German design. Germany’s plans gave Austria a key role in the suppression of the democratic political aspirations of the non-German and non-Hungarian majority of nations in the Austro-Hungarian empire. Austro-Hunga- [pageend51]48 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al rian political philosophy thus clearly emerged as the direct opposite of the traditional approach of Czech political philosophy toward solving the Central European territorial question. The conflict between the Czechoslovak spiritually-based democratic political philosophy and the Austrian-Hungarian-German materialistic, liberalistic concept of politics acquired, through World War I, not only a European but a global historical significance. It was thus perfectly logical that for the Western democracies any suitable, positive war and post-war program had to be based on some understanding of Central Europe, the source of the conflict, and for this purpose a thorough knowledge of the attendant political philosophical problems was essential. The political philosophical tensions intrinsic to the territory of Central Europe emerged most clearly precisely in the dispute between the Czech and the Austro- Hungarian-German political philosophies and the corresponding political notions which were to be applied in the territory between Germany and Russia. In this area Tomáš G. Masaryk was a recognized authority of world stature. It was, therefore, entirely appropriate that during World War I he became both the inspirer and creator of the positive program adopted by the Western democracies for the war and post-war period. What marked the beginning of the gradual turn toward the adoption of a positive political program by the Allies was a speech Masaryk gave on October 19, 1915 at the formal opening of the newly organized London University’s School of Slavonic Studies. British Prime Minister Lord Asquith was announced as chair, but he was replaced, due to illness, by Lord Robert Cecil. The subject and title of Masaryk’s talk was “The Problem of Small Nations in the European Crisis.”8 Masaryk first focused on the question of the relationship between nations and states in Europe where, as he pointed out, the former were twice as numerous as the latter. The ruling nations usually comprised the majority of the population. An exception to this democratic rule, though, was Austria-Hungary, where a German minority tried to rule in what was called Austria and a Hungarian minority in what was called Hungary.9 The fundamental significance of this specific part of Central Europe for the organization of Europe as a whole Masaryk expressed as follows: If we speak about Eastern and Western Europe and if we say that the two halves are not strictly divided, this is because we can identify a special ethnographic zone running through so-called Central Europe. From Trieste-Saloniki-Istanbul north to Gdansk-St. Petersburg along a line which is not straight but curves in the direction of Berlin, near where the Lusatian Sorbians live, there are quite a large number of [pageend52]Masar yk ’s Id e a o f Eu r o pe an Un it y 49 small nations which have been and still are under the rule of Germany, Austria, Turkey and Russia. This zone, which is formed by East Prussia, Austria-Hungary, the Balkans and West Russia, is a veritable home for national antagonisms. Here the nationality question and the language question are a political Vis Motrix. In this zone the present war broke out, it is this zone that generates constant unrest and friction for all of Europe. This zone is the real heart of the so-called Eastern Question, this zone provides the most urgent and pressing reason for new adjustments in the political organization of Europe. In this zone small nations are constantly struggling and fighting for independence. This zone has shown Europe’s statesmen the problem of small nations; this war is forcing above all the Allies to devote themselves to its resolution.10 Masaryk sums up the historical meaning of mankind’s political actions in the present situations as follows; “... Mankind is fighting for unity, not for sameness; for world federation, not for world rule; for consensus gentium, not for enslavement of peoples and races; for organization, not the conquest of Europe. Not a Herrenvolk, but national equality and uniformity.”11 Masaryk’s analysis of the situation implied that the anti-European and anti-cultural tendency toward control of Central and Eastern Europe by Germany, which had caused the world conflict in the first place, could be effectively eliminated by dividing Austria-Hungary, and this emerged as the main goal of the world war. In conformity with Europe’s federalizing tendency,12 the world conflict was now to become the starting point of a great reconstruction of Central and Eastern Europe; indeed, of all of Europe.13 It was obviously to be a democratic reconstruction, to include also the humanization of Germany.14 Moving on from his initial London lecture and preceding speeches, Masaryk put together in November 1915 a memorandum for the British government in which he expressly demanded from the Allies the same type of far-ranging and practical plan for Central Europe that the Germans had for it. This plan for democracy was supposed to be one of the primary goals of the Allies. It was to begin with the restoration and liberation of Poland, the Czech lands and Slovakia, and the South Slavic peoples which would then facilitate the resolution of remaining questions. Masaryk’s memorandum demanded of the Allies first and foremost that they formulate the clearest possible plan for political and economic reshaping of the whole of future Europe. The plan would not only provide for defense but also assure moral and political progress in Europe and the rest of the world.15 Masaryk characterized the spiritual premises of the reorganization and [pageend53]50 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al reconstruction of Europe in a paper aptly named “Sub speciae aetemit- atis:” “The Allies have announced as their goal the restoration and regeneration of Europe, and it is obvious that this can not be achieved simply by changing the map. The whole mentality of Europe must change. Its renewal must be moral and spiritual as well as political. Politics sub speciae aetemitatis is not only possible, but indispensable, and it can be effected only on an absolutely democratic basis. Its ultimate requirement is true equality, internal as well as external, equality that extends to every citizen and nation.”16 In subsequent articles in the British press Masaryk specifically offers the principles of equality and justice as an alternative to the notion of the balance of power which has been hitherto our guide. He points out that it was precisely this balance of power which has plunged Europe and the whole world into war.17 Masaryk inveighs here against the concept of future independent Czechoslovakia and Poland as so-called “buffer states” (états tampons). The existence of such osteoid presupposes never-ending antagonism between its two neighbors, whereas the Allied program inspired by Masaryk would involve the reconstruction and regeneration of Europe as a whole.18 The unusually favorable situation at the beginning of 1917, brought about by the Allies’ answer to President Wilson’s acceptance of Masaryk’s war program and by the democratic revolution in Russia enabled Masaryk to express with relative openness his philosophical and historical political design for European unity: “Free Russia consolidates our Alliance; free Russia with England and France, and these world powers will solve the Eastern Question, the organic unification of Europe with Asia and Africa. The great Western republic [of the United States] will join this world-wide policy of the reconstruction of Europe and the organization of mankind.”19 What Masaryk aimed at here was the application throughout the world of the principles of Comenius’s and Herder’s philosophy of history. His intent was the realization of political guarantees and support for a spiritual approach toward the flow of history based on a moral and rational implementation of the individuality of every person and nation in public life. Masaryk’s demand for the democratic partitioning of Austria-Hungary, accepted by the Allies, was expressly based on his assumption that “the reconstruction of all Europe [should be] on a really democratic basis.”20 This meant in concrete terms that “all of Europe should be reorganized on a national basis, all nations, not only the large but also the small should be independent and free, and the interrelationships of these nations should be determined by democratic principles.”21 Masaryk ex- [pageend54]Masar yk ’s Id e a o f Eu r o pe an Un it y 51 plicitly aimed at a democratization of all of Europe through some kind of federation of independent nations, “achieved by whatever means.”22 Masaryk thus demanded the organization of a free Europe with free peoples as the basis of a democratic program for Czechoslovak politics. He did not view humanity as a supranational structure but as a “democratic organization of politically mature, cultured nations.”23. Masaryk expressly rejects here liberalist and Marxist views on the relationship between national and international character as incorrect and out of step with history, which proceeds in both national and international directions. The liberation of nations is at the same time a step toward the unification of mankind as a natural, living organism of separate nations and, hence, of living organisms.24 He labels this type of organization as the beginning of a new era, “an era in which the separate nations and all of mankind will proceed consciously along with their evolution.”25 The European free federation should be a voluntary association of free and liberated nations, gradually organizing into larger wholes which would consist also of federations of smaller states founded according to the real needs of the nations.26 National minorities as a typically European and, particularly, East European phenomenon would assume in the organization of Europe the key role of promoting the genesis of a true intemationality.27 The spiritual basis of such a European federative unity would be the honest effort of the nations to better themselves morally and intellectually as the basis for unity in diversity. States are thus, for Masaryk, a means for moving nations toward ever greater freedom and organic unity.28 The proclamation by American President Woodrow Wilson of the principles of democracy as a starting point for the international politics of the postwar world was, therefore, understood by Masaryk to be the beginning of a significant turn of world history toward a morally based world order, which corresponded to Czechoslovak political philosophy. Masaryk’s explicit parallel between Wilson and Lincoln with its emphasis on the struggle for democracy and unity demonstrates his concept of an all-European and, ultimately, a world-wide unity of democratic nations and states with equal rights.29 The major political significance and the model of American democratic unity was to play an important role here. Palacký’s and Masaryk’s conception of world history as moving in the direction of world centralization and at the same time polarity or (as appropriate) plurality, was obviously confirmed by the Allies and, first and foremost, the American postwar program. This in turn demonstrated [pageend55]52 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al the mutual compatibility of Masaryk’s and Wilson’s conceptions of political philosophy. The founding of the Czechoslovak Republic in 1918 was directly linked with the plan for European unity as conceived by Tomáš G. Masaryk. His original version of the “Declaration of Independence of the Czechoslovak Nation,” issued from Washington, contained a statement making this explicit: “In its foreign policy the Czechoslovak State will take an effective part in the reorganization of Eastern Europe and through that of the whole Europe and humanity; our nationalistic policy will promote the desirable internationalism.”30 Masaryk was aware of the fact that the plan for the democratic reconstruction and unification of Europe, conceived by him, accepted by the Allies, and whose point of departure was the organization of Eastern Europe, would be a difficult task. He therefore insisted that the postwar peace be concluded exclusively on the principles proclaimed by the Allies and the United States during the war. He was convinced that every departure from these principles would only bring new conflicts in the future.31 In the course of the Paris peace talks Masaryk attempted, together with Venizelos and Ionescu, to create within the framework of his program of all-European unification a United States of Eastern Europe as a federative union of states between Germany and Russia, stretching from Finland in the north to Greece in the south. This plan failed because of the negative nationalism of the states involved. Instead of the East European federation originally asked for, there emerged the Little Entente which, as Masaryk conceived of it, was to be extended north and south in order to be later the cornerstone of a United States of Europe.32 With his conception and support of European unity Masaryk emerged as one of the founders of the Pan-European movement and contributed in a decisive way to its establishment in the political thinking of Europe and the world between the two world wars.33 Masaryk’s conception of European unification did not come to fruition at that time mostly because the United States pulled out of Europe and British and French policies moved away from the original plan of postwar European reconstruction, retreating toward their own narrower interests. World War II was the logical outcome of this political shortsightedness. The collapse of the Communist totalitarian regimes in Central Europe in 1989 has once again created favorable conditions for the realization of Masaryk’s idea. Postwar Western European moves towards unification, directly inspired by the ideas and political acts of Robert Schuman, Jean [pageend56]Masar yk ’s Id e a o f Eu r o pe an Un it y 53 Monnet, Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer, were closely linked to the long-standing and systematic pan-European activity of Count Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi, whose lifelong efforts to build a United States of Europe were profoundly influenced by Masaryk’s ideas.34 The cornerstone of contemporary efforts toward a united Western Europe has been Coudenhove-Kalergi’s and Briand’s original plan for economic and political cooperation between Germany and France, a plan adopted and carried out by Jean Monnet, along with Robert Schuman and Adenauer as “community of coal and steel.”35 De Gaulle called the success of this plan the basis of the strength and prosperity of Western Europe from which, when the Communist domination of Eastern Europe would end, there could ensue a new European balance, with peace and a common evolution. Now it is turning out, though, that economic power alone is not a sufficient basis for European unity. We are still waiting for the fulfillment of Masaryk’s basic precondition for a European federative integration which includes Russia; that is, a successful democratic reconstruction of the zone between Germany and the Soviet Union. The reunification of Germany makes the solution of this task even more urgent. A reunited Germany, on the one hand, awakens old fears and reimposes the old conception of a Europe governed by balance of power. On the other hand, it brings to life elements of the old resentments of Germany, which threaten to take advantage of the present unstable situation. Masaryk’s plan for the gradual building of a free democratic federation and, with it, a solution of the Eastern Question seems no less indispensable today. The problems of the Middle East, emphasized by the recent war in the Persian Gulf, show clearly how vital it is to build ties and communication between Europe, Asia and Africa, along democratic lines. The present European situation calls for fulfilling the historic mission of Europe. The present moves toward the unification of Western Europe, including their impact on East Central and Eastern Europe, are not without their problems. Neither national hatreds and egotism nor lack of respect for the sovereignty of peoples and states supporting the formation of a centralist pan-European state are at all a thing of the past. These weak spots in the program for West-European integration, together with a view of human rights that is merely political and institutional, prove that present European scenarios of unity require a spiritually and morally elaborated foundations. In this sense the implementation of the Masaryk idea of European unity [pageend57]54 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al could provide an eminently practical and promising stimulation.

[pageend59]Masaryk’s Voyage to the New Europe Zdeněk Šolle Certain individuals, like Napoleon or Bismarck, would seem to represent a historical period or the spirit of a nation during that period. Two individuals in our recent history represent the main stages in our development as a nation between the years 1848 and 1948. They are Palacký and Masaryk. Both address the fundamental, immutable issues of our national development such as the character of the Czech nation (by which I mean its cultural, economic and political uniqueness), the relationship of Czechs to their German fellow-citizens, and the relationship of the Czech nation to Austria and its powerful neighbors Germany and Russia, to the small Central European nations, and to the other countries of Europe and the world in general. Further, they seek to resolve these issues in a spirit of democracy, social justice, civil and national equality, and humanity. To represent a period, an individual must speak for his contemporaries. Before I begin my discussion of Masaryk, for whom Palacký was the model, I shall present the views of a simple Czech who in 1848 addressed the fundamental issues of his time. When the revolution broke out in Vienna, on March 13, 1848, a 22-year-old student named Vojtěch Náprstek gave a speech at a meeting of the Lower Austrian Diet. Like the other speakers, he welcomed the benefits the events had brought to the people of France, Italy and Germany. Austria too, he felt, stood on the threshold of a new era, and he advocated the abolition of censorship and the establishment of freedom of the press and other civil rights. Yet as a Czech he added something no one else had mentioned: One wish has not been made from this platform. The German speaks of a united Germany, the Italian of a united Italy, the Slav of a united Slavia. But I say: Long live a united Austria, and may the sun of harmony warm all the nations of Austria to feelings of reciprocal respect and brotherly love! As for the greatly feared empire to the East, may it be happy and great in all but a struggle with us, which we shall never begin, yet to which we are firmly committed should the need arise to defend our Austrian fatherland. Let me repeat: Harmony! May a lively sense of community [pageend60]Masar yk ’s Vo yag e t o Ne w Eu r o pe 57 be kindled amongst all the nations of Austria. Discord would degrade us. One for all! All for one! Three cheers for harmony amongst the Austrian peoples in all their good and high-minded works. May it flourish and grow!1 Náprstek maintained his Austrian enthusiasm for only half a year. During his last days in Vienna—before leaving for America—he played an active part in organizing aid for the Slovaks in Upper Hungary, who were under pressure from a Hungarian state that was not only consolidating its own position at the time but still enjoyed the support of the Austrian government and the army in particular. His new position is clear from his diary entry for September 29: “Treachery is everywhere! We are such slaves that we wished to maintain the dynasty! Those charlatans! All over the world they proclaim us to be madmen! And then they will curse us, while we reap dishonor and disgrace from our contemporaries. Let us not dissipate our energy in childish demonstrations. Let us be still. Still waters run deep. Let us organize. Then we may easily, nay, must seize the day and cast off our burden. Slav republics! That is our goal! But first: flawless organization.”2 Náprstek was by no means a Czech chauvinist. In America he worked closely with the Germans, and democratic Germans remained among his most faithful friends. When in 1890 the Old Czech Party concluded an agreement with Germany, his wife expressed his opinions when she wrote to F.L. Rieger not to permit the secession of border territorities from Bohemia. As a solution to the Czech-German problem she cited the words of an acquaintance, a Prague German by the name of Dittrich: If the Germans in Bohemia learn Czech and the Czechs learn German, the problem will take care of itself. This extensive digression should help us to understand how common were the issues dealt with by Palacký in his The Idea of an Austrian State and later by Masaryk, and help us to understand how the development of their experience and opinions paralleled the experience and opinions of the broad spectrum of Czechs. Masaryk’s views on this issue are analyzed by Jaroslav Werstadt in From the Czech Question to the New Europe. Werstadt sees a fundamental discrepancy between Masaryk’s stance in the 1890s and during World War I: For the radicals a completely renovated Czech state remained the guiding political idea, whether it be within inside or outside the framework of the Danubian Monarchy and whether it be achieved by Ausgleich or irredentism. The main tactics of the Radical Party consisted of persistent anti-centralist opposition and the manipulation of growing internal strife and occasional external machinations of the Empire to underscore Czech demands. Its policy arose from the international [pageend61]58 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al situation: as time went on, it came to see violence—the war in Europe—as the only viable solution to the Austrian problem, one that would grant complete autonomy to the Czech state. Before the catastrophe of the war this policy was called “catastrophic” in a way that was by no means laudatory or complimentary. The author of the Czech Question, who eventually created and led the Realist—later Progressive-Party, was for a long time the principal opponent of this radicalism. He refused, above all, to share its passionate nationalism, the dominant position of and emotional basis for radical politics. He combined a growing Czech national awareness with more general ideas of humanity and religious and social reform, the narrower yet clear position of the former often yielding to the broader yet more nebulous interests of the latter. He often pitted his humanity and religious bent against nationalism.3 In conclusion, Werstadt characterizes the development of Masaryk’s political views as follows: “Basically he developed from a national philosopher and pedagogue, from a reformer of society and religious morals into a true politician and statesman.” Strange as it may sound, Werstadt reminds me of certain contemporary foreign historians. In a recent discussion, a West German colleague explained the development of Masaryk’s political views by stating that to succeed as a politician Masaryk had to abandon his original notion of humanity and accept the nationalistic concept of his radically nationalist opponents. Was this really the case? To establish the precise nature and extent of Masaryk’s political development, we must first understand the nature of Masaryk’s views in the 1890s. Let us look at Masaryk’s early, purely political speeches when he was first elected as a representative in 1891. In September of the same year he gave a speech to voters in Strakonice which was criticized by the Young Czech press as being sympathetic to Austria. Kamil Krofta cites an interesting addendum to the speech in which Masaryk candidly spoke of the Czech relationship to Austria: “It is clear to me that as a practical politician I cannot advocate a program based on what happens in the distant future. I am not saying we shouldn’t speculate about this rigorously and as objectively as possible... Havlíček and Palacký did so all their lives and concluded that the Czech nation had a vested interest in Austria. Thus its policies must aim at preserving Austria, which is possible only through a federation of all Austrian nations.” But, Masaryk immediately added, “Should Austria fail to survive despite our best efforts, we must be prepared for the future and, as Palacký points out, for a new trial by fire which would not be so easy as some of our Slav Utopians frivolously assume. ”4 If Masaryk was criticized as pro-Austrian by the Young Czech radicals [pageend62]Masar yk ’s Vo yag e t o Ne w Eu r o pe 59 for his speech in Strakonice, he was accused of treason by the liberal German representative Menger for a speech delivered to the Austrian Parliament in November 1892. Krofta writes: After harshly criticizing the Germans for being prejudiced, domineering, and intolerant, for oppressing the Slav nations, and for clinging to their principles, Masaryk declared with prophetic zeal that the Czech nation still prevailed in this struggle. In short, Masaryk said in an excited appeal to the Germans, “we want independence and the right to self-determination, we want to lead a complete life. According to the ruling circles in Austria, especially the Germans, we are a small nation which in the worst case can be tolerated and to which several small concessions can be made. But the Germans do not understand that we are not so small that we should not want to live a rich and full life like a great nation such as the Germans in Austria. It is shortsighted not to understand that our nation has its own culture, has achieved and still achieves a great deal for mankind, the Austrian state, and all nations, and that our nation, recalling its great past, desires to live autonomously and wants only to accomplish great things as before.” After emphatically declaring that the development of Austria in the last century was determined by the non-German, especially Slavic peoples, Masaryk continued, “We do not harbor any animosity toward the Germans... But we do want recognition of our legal status as a nation because it is our political right and, more important, because it has economic ramifications. We do not wish the lands of the Czech crown to be so greatly exploited by the other half of the empire... Austria arose mainly through the unification of the Czech and Hungarian state. Since history has reinstated the Hungarian state, it shall also, it must create a Czech state.” Thus Masaryk concluded that a positive resolution to the Czech problem was primarily in the interest of Austria herself.5 When Werstadt wanted to point out what differentiated Masaryk from the radical proponents of Czech nationhood, he would cite the following words of F.V. Krejčí: “The main difference between the Progressive and Realist parties is of a psychological nature. Whereas Progressivists shifted most of the blame onto our relationship with our government and our indecisiveness about it and therefore turned to radicalism, the Realists were inclined to shift the blame onto us (and lose sight of oppositional elements) to see the main evil in superficiality and refusal to face reality, and to regard self-awareness and sober analysis as a panacea. ”6 In the nineties Masaryk simply did not believe in the likelihood of an imminent catastrophe like war or revolution; on the contrary, he was convinced that Austria’s possibilities were not yet exhausted and that progress would come by means of a strong national and democratic movement with the power to reorganize and reform the structure of semi- feudal Austria. Yet he did not exclude the possibility that, should that [pageend63]60 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al beneficial evolution not take place, a catastrophe would ensue. “There comes a time when everyone must defend himself against violence by force rather than work and reason alone. The Czech nation would do the same if its life were in danger.”7 He writes along similar lines in his study of Karel Havlíček: There can be no doubt that from a moral standpoint both the individual and social groups may defend themselves against violence. A humanitarian program does not countenance violence, but it does countenance and even demands protection for itself and others against violence. Humanity is not political or ethical quietism... Defending oneself does not imply using violence against violence; all it implies is self-defense by force if there is no other way. Defending oneself by force is completely different from committing violence: actions are judged by their intentions, which makes it clear that a person who defends himself wants something completely different from one who initiates violence. An honest person is always aware of when he is defending himself and when he is committing an act of violence.8 For Masaryk a treaty with the Czech Germans represented the basis for a peaceful evolution toward the democratic federalization of the nations of Austria. The main precondition of success, he states in The Czech Question, is “to strive for autonomy within the Austrian Empire in harmony with our German compatriots and on the basis of a humanitarian program and the facts of history.”9 The following words, written in 1896 in reply to a questionnaire regarding the relationship between Czechs and Germans, characterize his position: “First of all let me state that by no means do I take the national view, not even regarding our relationship with the Germans. I advocate our Czech humanitarian program... A settlement between us and the Germans, an enduring one, is impossible given the current program of political nationalism. Today’s nationalism is superstition and fanaticism; anyone who makes an idol of language will annihilate people with another idol in the name of his own. A settlement between us or, rather, cultural and political cooperation is possible if we take freedom to be a ‘formal’ principle and social justice a ‘material’ principle... I do not believe that a permanent—or at least durable-settlement between Czechs and Germans is possible without rectification of the current constitution... The Czech question, or, rather, the Czecho-German question is, to my mind, a social question; the elimination of arguments about language and nationality should serve social progress.”10 Moreover, in the essay “Natural Right and Historical Right,” written [pageend64]Masar yk ’s Vo yag e t o Ne w Eu r o pe 61 in 1900, Masaryk states: “Political autonomy is clearly a great national weapon, but what matters here is whether that autonomy exists, to what extent it is possible and what political means will lead us to it! ” Here too he stresses that “the Germans must grant and wish for autonomy and will do so only when we come to a just and reasonable agreement. In other words, the Germans must be provided with political reasons for not interfering in our national autonomy. I speak of reasons because in my opinion a policy of violence, trickery and anticipation of notorious ‘foreign plots’ is out of the question. I base this assertion on my personal experience and my study of our historical development and of the world in general.”11 Masaryk criticized the Young Czechs and radicals who called for Czech nationhood as being utopian and bombastic. He believed that working for the people and their future meant strengthening them culturally, economically and ideologically. Hence his view of the Czechs’ historical right to nationhood or Staatsrecht. Concerning the 1902 Program of the Czech People’s Party which states that “the state is one of the remaining historical and social powers and it is thus incorrect to pin all political hopes and the future of the nation on the state and politics,” Bohuš Tomsa writes: “It is a reproach aimed at Czech policy, which paid too much attention to issues of nationhood and was consequently overly political. It neglected the fact that there are other factors equally or more important to a nation than whether or not it exists in an autonomous state, factors of a cultural, economic and social nature. Masaryk believed that a one-sided pro-nationhood policy distracted Czech political parties from these interests, that it was too politicized and lacked a suitable cultural, social and economic program, and when it did have such a program it ignored it.”12 In 1895 Masaryk wrote: We are in the center of Europe, a Europe that is beginning to organize on a continental and even worldwide scale. Can we really maintain that it would be beneficial for us, to speak in concrete terms, if Locum Tenens Thun had become the Czech Burggraf or perhaps Vizekönig? I ask anyone who has thought about the state of events to consider what is currently meant by the words “capital, worldwide profits, the political and cultural progress of the great states, nations, especially German, and literatures,” and what is meant by the emancipation of the fourth estate; in a word, I ask people to consider what Palacký called “global centralization,” and they will say that political autonomy can greatly benefit any nation but most of all a nation that is enlightened, educated and moral. The state will not save us; we must maintain it.13 [pageend65]62 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al In 1900 Masaryk gave a speech justifying his new party platform. “We have little historical right in a legal sense because our political leaders and representatives have interrupted and are still interrupting legal continuities. ” Nevertheless, he does not reject the historical right to nationhood but only “pro-nationhood utopianism,” and not only the utopianism of the pro-nationhood radicals which “is oriented exclusively toward the future though does not present a carefully considered plan for that future,” but also Old Czech-New Czech utopianism, which is based on the fallacy that pro-nationhood continuity was not disrupted. In place of this pronationhood utopianism, Masaryk posits “the people’s pro-nationhood consciousness,” for he knows that “a true right [to nationhood] originates not only from a previous one but also from the moral political efforts made by an enlightened people.”14 In the essay on natural and historical rights Masaryk also wrote: Historical right was and is reinforced by modem nationhood; the more we developed our language and sense of ourselves as a nation and the more progress we made in building our national culture, the stronger we were politically and the more valuable “old documents” became. In our time nationality, not historical right, is the driving force of politics. Thus I come back to Palacký and his political programs. Palacký understood the nature of our modem development and therefore placed more emphasis on a modem view of nationality than on historical rights. He also understood the economic and social significance of “global centralization,” that economic power is crucial on the political level... and that industry and modem means of communication are the driving force.15 Masaryk was a realist. Austria was not ideal, but in relative terms it was the best setting for securing national development of the Czechs: I asserted in The Czech Question, and I state once again, that Palacký’s program, that is, his nationhood program, as he formulated it in 1865 is still valid. I accept it with no far-reaching designs or reservations, not so much because I can’t draw maps but because I studied history quite diligently and thus learned the following: If Austria had succumbed to the European conflagration and was crushed, we would have had to face a Germany with which we have been in contact for a thousand years. We can only speculate what that would have meant...16 On this point Wertstadt disagrees with Masaryk. “Masaryk mainly referred to the resistance of the German Czechs and the vis major of the neighboring Hohenzollem Empire which was a direct result of the flawed, one-sided character of his international political orientation. Masaryk did not sufficiently consider all the European forces joined to defend and [pageend66]Masar yk ’s Vo yag e t o Ne w Eu r o pe 63 resist the German threat.”17 I do not know why Werstadt considered Masaryk’s international political orientation flawed and one-sided. I believe that Bedřich Hlaváč shows a better understanding of Masaryk’s position when he states: “Masaryk agreed with Havlíček and did not want a bloody revolution, at least not with gratuitous bloodshed: ’We say yes to revolution only if we prevail!’ He thus opposed both empty radicalism and anti-Austrian and revolutionary sentiments. Yet when he learned that it was time for a revolution and that it might succeed, Masaryk did not hesitate for a moment, bearing in mind Palacký’s maxim: we existed before Austria and would exist after it.”18 Tomsa argues along similar lines in his study of Masaryk’s campaign for natural rights. “Masaryk did not promote a policy based on war or revolution but kept them in mind as remote possibilities, which materialized earlier than he expected.”19 Hlaváč is correct in pointing to the difficulties faced by Masaryk and Beneš first in Switzerland, and later in Paris and London. It was not clear how things would develop, what course the war would take, or how it would end. At first they may have been interested in nothing more than informing the West about us, our circumstances, and in particular our relationship with Austria, of informing foreign countries that the relationship with the Monarchy should be substantially changed at any cost... Later, in Rome and in Paris and London Masaryk came to realize that Austria was beyond salvation, and immediately took advantage of the situation. It is clear that his task was not easy. In Paris, London and especially America, Austria enjoyed good standing, though it was based on a lack of familiarity with the country’s geographical, political and, above all, cultural reality. Yet by then Masaryk had a single goal: to destroy Austria. He decided the time had come to save the Czech nation outside of Austria, that we could (according to Palacký’s words) exist after Austria. Masaryk saw that the time had come for radicalism and revolution and thus decided in favor of the latter. He no longer took Austria into account, and when America entered the war, he saw how right he was.20 Only when the whole of Europe and the United States united to resist the Pangermanic threat in 1917 was it possible and, considering the Austrian and especially Czech Germans, even necessary to crush Habsburg Austria. In this connection it must be said that what brought Austria down was not Masaryk or the Czechs but the Germans’ Pangermanic orientation—that and the fact that Czechoslovakia was not and could not be Masaryk’s single goal as it was for the proponents of Czech nationhood. Masaryk would definitely have preferred to achieve his political aims on an Austrian scale. Czechoslovakia was a way out, a sort of [pageend67]64 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al microcosm of Austria. Therefore, while still in America, Masaryk sought to create a Mid-European Union from the newly emerging national states.21 In his essay The New Europe he argues that the defeat of the Habsburg Monarchy is not an act of nationalistic isolationism but, on the contrary, that it should facilitate cultural, economic, and political cooperation among all European states, especially the new small Central European nations liberated from Austro-Hungarian yoke and the Pangerm- anic threat. From the beginning Masaryk stressed, following Palacký, that the Czech question was to be understood as a European one, whereby Austria was regarded as a microcosm of humanity. He emphasized the significance of “global centralization” as a result of modem industrial progress and means of communication. Masaryk is most emphatic about world unity in his military program, the solution to the Czech question being possible only within the context of a New Europe, a united Europe of democracy, freedom and peace among nations. Today not only Austria is at stake. An entire zone of small nations stretching from the Baltic to the Aegean Sea is awaiting liberation from the hegemony of semi-feudal multinational powers. The existence of small sovereign democratic states in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe is a precondition for a fruitful, permanent, peaceful collaboration among the nations of that area and for an economic and cultural integration of Europe based on democracy and peace. This is the essential conflict between the Entente and the Central Powers and gives the Entente a moral right to bring the war to a victorious end. The liberation of small nations does not run counter to the increasing tendency to closer ties between states and nations. True, individuals and nations have a need to unite and history shows a trend toward the organization of all humanity; however, this historical development is a dual process: the individualization of all fields is concurrent with the organization of individuals.22 The political emancipation of the small nations of Central and Southeastern Europe was a necessary precondition for organization on a continental scale, toward which, as Masaryk states, Europe was gravitating. Masaryk expressed the idea that the interests of a nation and an international community are compatible rather than contradictory in greater detail and with greater urgency than any of the socialists. Masaryk’s military program, formulated in his The New Europe was not a manifestation of racist anti-German hysteria, of Czech chauvinism or Panslavism. For Masaryk the overthrow of Pangermanism was a necessity, and war—the lesser of two evils. After victory, the Germans, Austrians and Hungarians would secure their proper place in Europe. The [pageend68]Masar yk ’s Vo yag e t o Ne w Eu r o pe 65 point was not to take revenge and replace one form of oppression with another but to bring harmony to international affairs. Masaryk illustrates this with a parable in his Habilitationsschrift on suicide in 1881: “It is the hope and goal of democracy that there should be one sheep-pen and one shepherd.” But the shepherd can be only a person who represents brotherhood among nations and universal love, a person such as Jesus; it cannot be a Caesar, who represents aggression, expansion, and imperialism. “Jesus, not Caesar” is the conclusion and main point of the second version of the Czech program he formulated during the war and revolution in The New Europe. Masaryk the anti-Austrian revolutionary returned from the war to put into practice—at least within the narrow bounds of the republic of which he became president—his ideal of humanity, democracy, social justice, national equality and international cooperation, that is, the Palacký-based Czech program he could not implement in an Austrian framework. Thus we may say that the Czechoslovak Republic was neither the only nor final goal of Masaryk’s efforts; it was merely the first practical step on the road to the ideal of humanity Masaryk had laid out for himself and his nation in The Czech Question at the very beginning of his political career in the nineties. I therefore believe that one should not interpret the post-war rise of Czechoslovakia as the fulfillment of the tragic Panslavic vision Palacký discussed in the conclusion to his work. The splendid plan Masaryk espoused in The New Europe did not unfortunately materialize. Although Czechoslovakia quickly consolidated its domestic affairs in a democratic spirit, it did not—as Masaryk had hoped in his correspondence with Beneš during the 1919 Paris peace negotiations—become a center for the democratic forces of the small, newly liberated nations. Czechoslovakia quickly settled its relationship with democratic Germany and soon thereafter with Austria, but the hope Masaryk had expressed in the 1890s—that is, that Czechs and Germans would live in harmony within the historic borders of the Czech Lands—was not realized. Even after 1918 the Germans living in Bohemia and Moravia did not consider themselves German-speaking Czechoslovaks. Although the stabilization of Central European economic and political relations in the late twenties led the political representatives of the Czech Germans to cooperate with their Czech partners and participate in the Czechoslovak government, the rise of Hitler in neighboring Germany thwarted the slim chances for lasting Czechoslovak-German solidarity.23 Like Palacký, Masaryk felt the Czech question to be so significant [pageend69]66 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al because it concerned more than the Czech nation: it was an issue crucial to all of Europe, all enlightened peoples.24 In his humanitarian Czech program Austria was to be a “microcosm of humanity” and the model for a harmonious coexistence of European nations based on democratic principles and peaceful cooperation. The reigning forces in the Austrian Monarchy could not understand or accept his program, and the Austrian Monarchy disappeared into the annals of history. Masaryk’s gloomy prediction, made in his 1919 letters to Beneš, was soon confirmed: the peace established by the Entente was lamentable; the Allies had lost the peace. And indeed, what made the Versailles peacemakers any different from Aerenthal, Berchtold, Czemin, and other Austrian diplomats who had once so angered Masaryk? What was the victors’ view of the world? The world deteriorated drastically as a result of what one might call their unhealthy ideals. A policy that assumes war promotes war—hence, the second world conflagration of the century. Versailles was completed in September 1938 by Munich, when Czechoslovakia’s Western allies gave the country—the last bastion of democracy east of the Rhine and the last state where German democrats were still free—to Hitler, and at the war’s conclusion by Yalta, when they passed it on to their next partner, Stalin. Czechoslovakia’s tragedy thus inaugurated the tragedy of Europe and the world. Today, as we begin the last decade of the twentieth century, this tragedy has reached its end and new possibilities loom before us. In the words of Marcel Proust, “People do not learn their lessons because they cannot generalize their knowledge and because they keep imagining they will have experiences with no relation to the past. ” May the tragic experiences which have plagued our history since the beginning of the twentieth century help us to solve our problems prudently and wisely.

[pageend71]Science and Nationalism: The Career of Bohumil Němec Stanley B. Winters The lives and achievements of outstanding Czechs who were ignored or maligned during the past 50 years comprise “blank spots” that badly need filling in. One such case is the career of Bohumil Němec, Professor of the Anatomy and Physiology of Plants at Charles University and a member of the Czech Academy of Sciences and Arts in Habsburg Austria and the interwar Republic. Němec, who was extraordinarily versatile, was professionally active until his death at age 93 in 1966. He stood out even among his distinguished colleagues in the Natural Sciences section of the Czech Academy by virtue of his rapid rise to eminence, enterprising spirit, ceaseless scholarship, and vigorous advocacy of science education as crucial to the nation’s future.1 In public life he was a leading National Democrat and an ardent Czech patriot. Yet Němec is barely known in the English-language scholarly orbit except for passing mentions in textbooks on biology or in historical works that misjudge or downplay his importance.2 Inside Czechoslovakia, historians disparage him for becoming a candidate for president in 1935 to succeed T.G. Masaryk, in opposition to Foreign Minister Eduard Beneš, while they omit his scientific and civic accomplishments and any merit to his candidacy.3 In unpublished memoirs penned after World War II, Němec asserted: “The nation needs splendid examples; it needs heroes, whose memory would be a stimulus and a symbol.”4 Not noted for modesty, Němec may have had himself in mind, among others, when he wrote those words. This essay will attempt a balanced analysis of Nëmec’s significance by discussing his academic and scientific contributions, his efforts as propagator of science and learning, and his service to national and patriotic causes. Formative Years Němec was bom in 1873 and grew up in the Nový Bydžov district of [pageend72]Th e Car e e r o f Bo h u mil Ně me c 69 northeastern Bohemia. His schooling taught him disciplined work habits, fascination with natural science, and respect for supportive teachers. From his family he gained a deep love of the Bohemian homeland. He recalls that he was “a village day-dreamer” who saw the world only through the Národní listy and father’s “little library” of romantically patriotic and freethinking books in the popular series Matice lidu.5 At age 18, Němec joined the stream of rural youth who were migrating to Prague for higher education and the amenities of a cosmopolitan city. The year was 1891, and Prague throbbed with political activism and fresh cultural and artistic currents coming from Vienna and Paris. The newly elected deputies of the middle-class Young Czech party were taking their seats in parliament after defeating the Old Czech party. The anti-establishment “progressive movement” {pokrokové hnutí) was attracting militant working-class and student youths. Němec was recruited into the movement and baptized in political activity. He discovered European ideas: the novelists Zola and Dostoyevsky, the dramatists Büchner and Ibsen, the Darwinian Herbert Spencer. He desired “to embrace everything, to live through everything, to feel everything that was beautiful and good.”6 These dreams were shattered in the summer of 1893, when the crownland authorities crushed the progressives, charging them with an Omladina conspiracy and arresting their leaders. Němec fortunately was then home in his native village, else he too would have been arrested and his university studies terminated. Upon soberly appraising the situation, he saw that the era of romantic idealism was over; he determined to devote himself “passionately and tirelessly” to his scientific studies. He never regretted his student activism; he called it “the most beautiful time of my youth” and made lifelong friends, but he believed that science offered a better means of benefitting the nation and mankind.7 After completing his basic university studies, Němec made steady progress. In 1895 he was named assistant in biology at the Czech University; he published several dozen papers on plant physiology and studied at Jena and other German universities. In 1899 he habilitated, was named docent, and given responsibility for organizing a new Institute for Plant Physiology. The German Botanical Society named him a full (řádný) member and the Czech Academy an associate (mimořádný) member. He struggled to secure funds and equipment for the new Institute because the Austrian Ministry of Religion and Education allotted more money per student to the German University than to the Czech. Almost single-handedly, he built a highly reputed research center with dedicated students.8 He quickly learned that one means of relieving the intolerable [pageend73]70 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al Němec was able to fulfill his teaching and administrative duties and conduct pioneering research because of a supportive wife and a rigorous schedule that ranged from early morning until late at night. His fluency in foreign languages facilitated close relations with colleagues abroad.10 He travelled to Russia, Western Europe, and North America for scientific meetings and received job offers from Germany and the United States, but decided to stay in Prague. By the outbreak of World War I in 1914, he had published nearly 250 articles, monographs, and basic textbooks on the growth and movement of plants, the orientation of mushrooms, the development of forms in organisms and related topics; but his sweep was much broader than that. Jan Janko, the historian of Czech biology, describes it as follows: The significance of Nëmec’s experimental work is enormous and not limited to our own country, where he laid the basis for systematic work in experimental morphology and especially in experimental cytology. Indeed, the ultimate field of Nëmec’s research was not in the measurement of biological materials but in more developed experimental research that was done more or less accidentally... Němec did not evade the general problems; on the contrary, he consistently related his experimental work to the solution of important problems of biological theory... The development of the physiology of plants among us is unthinkable without the fundamental work of B. Němec.11 Along with the energy he infused in biology and botany at the university, Němec brought fresh ideas to Class II of the Czech Academy, the section to which the natural scientists belonged. Jiří Beran, who traces the Academy’s history, writes that Němec had perceived from his travels abroad that basic research was shifting from university departments to specialized institutes, and he believed that the creation of such institutes lay within the mission of the Czech Academy. Having benefited from work at the zoological station in Trieste, he proposed that the Academy set up its own seaside research stations and raise funds to support them, but the onset of war blocked his plans.12 In the 1920s, however, through Nëmec’s efforts, Czech and Slovak biologists were permitted to work at Scientific and Academic Achievements pedagogical conditions was through the intervention of prominent Czech politicians. This drew him to the leaders of the Young Czech party, from whom he sought help.9 [pageend74]Th e Car e e r o f Bo h u mil Ně me c 71 Yugoslav stations on the Adriatic and at the zoological center on the French Riviera, founded in the nineteenth century by the Russian scientist Alexander A. Korotnev. Recognition of Nëmec’s achievements was swift, indicating that under old Austria a talented Czech in an ideologically neutral field could gain just rewards. He was advanced to assistant (mimořádný) professor in 1903 and to full (řádný) professor in 1907. At age 34, he was the youngest faculty member to have achieved that high rank since the autonomous Czech University was founded in 1882, apart from a handful in medicine.13 One year later he was named a full member of the Czech Academy. Under the First Republic, Němec continued his research and writing on science, and his publications reached over 500. The organization and dissemination of science also preoccupied him. In 1923 he initiated the respected English-language series, Studies from the Plant Physiological Laboratory of Charles University. As the first postwar dean of the Philosophical Faculty in 1919 and then rector, he supported the separation of the Natural Sciences Faculty from that of Philosophy, which was implemented in 1920. As a teacher, Němec had a loyal following among students. In many celebratory articles they describe his lectures as well composed, logical, and clear. He refrained from using his authority so as not to rush the student into premature conclusions in laboratory work. He wrote: “According to my experience, a student who is above average in talent can be identified by his independence. After I had given someone a theme and the most important suggestions as to method, I left him to work for a time independently... I have never forced students to confirm my views or discoveries.”14 From 1920 onward, Professor Němec sponsored or co-sponsored 139 successful doctoral candidates, more than any other faculty member in the natural sciences.15 For his contributions to science and the university, he was awarded on March 11, 1939, the occasion of his retirement, the honorary degree of Doctor of Natural Sciences. The ceremony, in the phrase of Professor Sylvestr Prát, once Nëmec’s student, was “the last fine day before the (German) occupation and the closing of the university in November 1939 ”16 Public Service In addition to his academic and scientific work, Bohumil Němec gained distinction in public and national causes. One was his service on [pageend75]72 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al the Provincial School Council of the Bohemian Kingdom, to which he was named in 1912 through his affiliation with the Young Czech party. This was the only public body that dared discuss nationality questions after the war had begun and several Czech leaders had been indicted on charges of high treason. Němec was one of the few who spoke out to protect the interests of Czech students and teachers.17 Alarmed by government plans to delete the exploits of the Czech nation from textbooks, he and Cyril Merhout (1881-1955), writer and pedagogue, prepared an anthology of essays on the national culture and history that would be ready for publication at the war’s end. The timing was perfect; the result was the best-selling National Reader (Národní čítanka), a marvelous compendium, including pieces that were specially written for the book and expressed all shades of political and philosophical opinion.18 During the war, Němec worked discreetly with militants in the domestic “Maffie” resistance group to develop an alternative strategy to the accommodationist or supportive path pursued by pro-Austrian “activists” in parliament.19 He served on the editorial board of the weekly Národ, launched after the arrest of the Czech leaders.20 Perhaps his most notable wartime role was as secretary of the Society of the Museum of the Bohemian Kingdom (Společnost Musea království českého). He joined the Society in 1910 and was elected its secretary, or chief administrative officer, in January 1913. As the war dragged on, the Museum lost revenues and faced a crisis. By 1918, it had postponed repairs and maintenance, suspended acquisitions, and neglected its collections. It faced closing, even total collapse, in the centennial year of its founding. Alarmed by the prospect of such a calamity and national shame, Němec issued a stirring appeal for members and funds on March 1, 1918, in Národní listy. People responded in astounding fashion with 3,398 new memberships and over 117,000 crowns.21 The Museum was saved. After leaving the secretaryship, Němec served as vice-president of the Museum Society until 1945, culminating a relationship of 32 years. During the First Republic, Němec held such positions as chairman of the National Research Council (Národní rada badatelská) and its representative on international scientific organizations. As late as January 1939, he wrote to the Rockefeller Foundation in New York on behalf of the National Research Council to ask for financial aid for Czechoslovak science because of the “great sacrifice for preserving world peace,” made by the Republic in accepting the Munich Agreement at enormous cost to its economy and scientific institutions.22 For many years he was vice- [pageend76]Th e Car e e r o f Bo h u mil Ně me c 73 Perhaps Němec’s most substantial and enduring contribution in his public activity between the wars was as popularizer and propagator of science education and science as a vocation. He wanted science and its companion, technology, to benefit an evolving, harmonious world in the tradition of the venerated natural scientist and physiologist J.E. Purkyně (1787-1869), and not to destroy the fabric of civilization as it happened during World War I. But he was not a Saint-Simonian technocrat; he did not believe that scientists should run the political and economic systems. Rather, the political and industrial leaders should be enlightened to the benefits of science so they could shape national policy along lines that would maximize the benefits that modem science could bring. Němec’s broad social consciousness was not uncommon between the wars, when many scientists were liberally educated in the arts, humanities, and social sciences. A typical speech by Němec in 1927 on the role of science in human affairs identifies him as a scientific humanist in the Enlightenment tradition. In it he argues that the emergence of reasoning and inventive capacities in humans had changed their ancient fear of nature into confidence in natural law and the power of the mind. Science, the outgrowth of these developments, plays a constructive role in human advancement and offers an unlimited future. Citing the chemical revolution as an example, he claims that science will liberate people from the yoke of heavy manual labor, but, he cautions, not from manual labor altogether. Science means learning the cause of things; it brings the individual balance and satisfaction through the acquisition of knowledge for the benefit of mankind. Constant competition in science and other human endeavors will insure that the best ideas and innovations will survive and triumph. Further, science can prevent a nation from “straying off the path of healthy reason” in its policies. Nëmec’s optimistic faith that public policy could be guided by scientific methods and goals may seem naive in retrospect but was present in many such expressions at the time.23 He preached his message in newspaper articles, in speeches before civic and professional groups, and in radio lectures in the series Science as a Vocation president and then president of the Czechoslovak National Council (Národní rada československá), a group of fraternal and service organizations and political parties charged with suggesting acceptable solutions to the country’s problems. [pageend77]74 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al “Nature in Summer” (Príroda v létě) pioneered by his young colleague, Professor Otakar Matoušek.24 He revived the popular science journal Vesmír, also with Matoušek, and supported other similar ventures. Every year, he wrote a report on the progress of Czechoslovak science for the Czechoslovak Republic’s Year Book (Ročenka československé republiky.) He was a master at explaining complex phenomena in plain language and in demonstrating the uses of science, especially of the physiology of plants, in everyday life.25 One of his greatest achievements in the dissemination of knowledge was to organize and supervise the editing of the twelve-volume encyclopedia, Ottův Slovník naučný. Nové doby.26 Despite the barbaric destruction of the plates of its final two volumes after World War II, it remains the standard general reference work from the First Republic. Although formally retired from academe in the post-1945 era, Němec remained deeply involved in science education. He headed the Institute of Plant Physiology and Biology which was organized at the Comenius University in Bratislava in March 1946. With one of his students, Ľudovít Pastýrik (b. 1911), he wrote the acclaimed textbook General Botany (Všeobecná botanika) (1948-49). He was succeeded as director of the Institute by Pastýrik and returned to Prague in 1948. In November 1953 he was elected a full member of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, a year after it was founded under the communist regime. Thereafter he published steadily, especially on the history of science, with works on Purkyně, Darwin, Linnaeus, and Julius Sachs. He helped to establish the history of science as a scholarly discipline in modem Czechoslovakia.27 Of Němec’s persona, we have the laudatory observations of his students, colleagues, and associates in public and political life. Among somewhat critical opinions, one scholar who had observed him stated: “I still have a lively impression of his courteous disposition. He was not very modest—he knew perfectly how to behave like a lord. I would say that, in this way, he also commanded respect among all. He was one of the few people whom I encountered, who, upon entering the room, succeeded in arousing all present to rise.”28 Another, one of Nëmec’s long-time colleagues and co-workers, wrote: “He was a great man, but it would be of great value to see not only his ability but [also] to remain critical. In his later years his name was in the first line of post-1948 collaborators, even when he did not participate much—and this was not always pleasant to scientists who became important specialists in their field.”29 Němec was imbued with the patriotic spirit of the generation that [pageend78]Th e Car e e r o f Bo h u mil Ně me c 75 founded and built the Czechoslovak state. Their crown jewel was the state, and its security and survival their paramount concern. Under it, they flourished in their professions and family well-being. Academician Němec belonged to this intellectual and civic elite; he was at ease with its highest representatives. He avoided the extremes of judgment and expression that were out of keeping with the behavioral norms of his peers. This enabled him to survive the many changes in this turbulent century. In addition, Němec was extremely skillful in balancing the sometimes conflicting interests in his intensely active life. He kept up his international scientific activities until they were inhibited by the German occupation, the government of the Protectorate, and later the war, but he refused to abandon his scientific vocation. As he recounted in his memoirs, he was permitted (“to my surprise”) to travel to an international conference on comparative pathology in Rome in May 1939, where his many contacts and an ample wallet made for a pleasant experience despite the darkening political atmosphere. Soon after, he was able to attend a meeting on scientific cooperation in Geneva, but he exercised caution “because I wanted to return home, and some sharp critique of Hitlerism could have cost me my life.”30 Like other political and cultural figures under the Protectorate regime, Němec was personally at some risk, but as a member of the political Right the danger probably was not immediate. He stayed outside of Prague as much as possible so as to concentrate on his scientific writings. He advised on the editorial aspects of the remaining volumes of the encyclopedia, oversaw the publication of his magisterial The Life of Plants (Život rostlin) in 1941 and of a second edition a year after; wrote articles for scientific journals including Vesmír (which continued to appear during the occupation), and prepared, with S. Prát and J. Kořínek, the manuscript for Textbook of Anatomy and Physiology of Plants for Pharmacologists and Biologists (Učebnice anatomie a fysilogie rostlin pro farmacenty a přírodopisce) which appeared in 1945. Politics Another example of Nëmec’s multifarious activities was his involvement as a prominent member of the National Democratic party, a coalition formed from preexisting parties in the new republic as successor to the Young Czech party. He became a senator in parliament, a trustee of the party’s Národní listy and its publishing house, and a close acquaintance of bankers and businessmen allied with the party. He knew how to advance his personal prosperity in the free enterprise environment [pageend79]76 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al that prevailed between the wars, where connections and quickness to seize opportunities brought success. Besides a professor’s handsome salary, he earned fees from writing and editing. Politically, he steered a careful centrist path between National Democracy’s “pro-Hrad” (the Castle Group of officials around President Masaryk) moderates, on one hand, and its militant anti-Hrad chauvinists and quasi-fascists, on the other. He was not privy to the party’s inner organizational decisions but rather belonged to a group of intellectuals and academics who provided a much needed cachet to its public image. As president of the Czechoslovak National Council, a position that allowed him an official standing above partisan strife, he prudently resigned his political party membership early in April 1935, several weeks before the National Democrats merged into the National Union, an extreme rightist anti-Hrad electoral coalition.31 Nëmec’s commitment to public service dovetailed with a continuing quest for recognition. For years he may have harbored thoughts of attaining high governmental or institutional office. Along with others with such ambitions, he followed the rumors of President Masaryk’s possible abdication, an act that materialized on November 14, 1935. There followed one of the most exciting yet draining experiences of his life. He was approached by conservative and right-wing political leaders, whose spokesman was Rudolf Beran, head of the Agrarian Party, to become a candidate for president to succeed Masaryk, in opposition to the until then unopposed candidacy of Foreign Minister Eduard Beneš (1884-1948). Němec accepted their promises of support and on December 7 announced his candidacy.32 It was a moment for which he may have been preparing in prior months and years. For example, in 1934 he had discussed national issues in a statement made in his capacity as president of the Czechoslovak National Council, in part as follows: The success of the state and nation depends on its leadership. Leaders must be capable but also conscious of their great responsibility. The goal must not be popularity, glory, or the power of a political party but the good of the whole. The highest virtue of a politician is to take responsibility. Too often we blame failure on certain political parties—not on ourselves. This means the state is not yet fully constructed. It suffers from a crisis of moral and economic disruption caused by the World War. A coalition government is necessary. This means compromise in the interests of the whole. This means sacrifice. The organism is the more perfect, the more purposefully the functions within it are divided. The same in the state. This was a version of a conservatively oriented pluralist democracy generally compatible with the system of parliamentary politics as practiced [pageend80]Th e Car e e r o f Bo h u mil Ně me c il in interwar Czechoslovakia. Němec then asserted his nationalistic credo on power sharing in the state: Our state (of Czechs and Slovaks) arose on the basis of the self-determination of nations... It follows that always and everywhere our fateful coexistence with other nationalities and citizens of our state requires gaining them for reconciliation within the existence of our state in which they are the minority—no less valuable or without rights, but a minority that cannot demand priority in the state.33 As part of his decision to run, Němec agreed not to withdraw to make way for Beneš so long as a majority of the státotvorný (state-creating, those who had shaped the unitary Czechoslovak state after independence) political parties remained behind him. His decision created consternation bordering on panic in the Beneš camp. This was understandable for several reasons: First, Beneš had the benefit of Masaryk’s endorsement, but also the onus of having the President, in some views, exceed his constitutional and moral authority in designating his successor. Second, Beneš had long been the target of attacks in parliament, the press, and the pubs for serving continuously as foreign minister despite changes in other ministries due to varying election results and governing coalitions. And third, among other, he had built a press and personal machine, allied with the Hrad group of bureaucrats, intellectuals, and journalists around Masaryk, that was a target for jealous outsiders, thoughtful analysts, and scandalmongers alike on grounds of corruption and abuse of office. When the potential votes for Beneš and Němec in parliament, on the basis of preliminary calculations, were tabulated, Beneš had 205 (including those of the Communist party) and Němec had 178, but if Konrad Henlein’s Sudeten German party were to cast its 67 votes for Němec, his total would reach 245.34 A three-fifths majority was necessary for election, but while neither would have it on the first ballot, the blow to Beneš’s prestige and that of the center-liberal and Left forces behind him would have been immense. It is ironic that both Beneš and Němec were dependent upon extremist parties whose allegiance to the republic’s pluralist liberal democracy was dubious if not outrightly subversive, as later events in 1938 and 1948 were to prove. There followed days of frantic negotiations, appeals, deals, and slanderous press reports on the two candidates and their backers, at the end of which Nèmec’s support dwindled. Late on December 17 he withdrew his candidacy in the face of this reality and to avoid a divisive and embarrassing vote in parliament.35 This act earned him a measure of approbation from some detractors. Whether Bohumil Němec would have [pageend81]78 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al Němec himself was profoundly affected by his experience and his exposure to political intricacies and intrigues of a harsh and murky sort. A step that he had taken in part to serve his country and fulfill his ambitions, and that incidentally would assure his place in the nation’s pantheon, had been trumpeted by the Hrad grouping, the hostile press, and the Left as a betrayal of the state’s democratic foundation, and, had Henlein’s support been enlisted, of its national heritage. In one of the very few instances where Němec wrote about his candidacy, he reflected: ...I made a mistake. At that time I learned that I still did not have enough experience. All those who had then sworn allegiance to the existing regime, many from conviction, many as sycophants and climbers, hardened against me. Only the Prager Tagblatt wrote that I behaved honorably. Others had not been accused of wrongdoing when they ran as candidates against Masaryk, not even the rector of the German University, August Naegle, a narrow fanatical Nazi. I was never forgiven when I spontaneously accepted the candidacy against Beneš. I was very glad that I Lessons of Experience been an effective president, and perhaps performed better in the crises to come than Eduard Beneš, is a hypothetical issue beyond the historian’s mission, strictly speaking, but one is tempted to look at certain givens in light of subsequent developments. Nëmec’s admirers and advocates pointed to similarities in his career and Masaryk’s (the academic path, extensive scholarship, international reputation, long devotion to the national cause). In addition, he was in excellent health, cut a fine figure in public compared to the diminutive Beneš, and was an accomplished public speaker. He had traveled widely, had legislative and administrative experience, and held credentials as a patriot since student days. But he had no experience in state diplomacy, and his foreign contacts were scientists, not politicians and statesmen. His total reliance upon the conservative and right-wing party chiefs for his election meant that his presidency would inevitably have been weaker than Masaryk’s, and less domineering than Beneš’s was to become as heir to Masaryk’s mystique. This might not have been a bad thing, because while the republic would have turned for a while away from welfare statism, it might have emphasized national defense, permitted new leaders to emerge from the presidential shadow, and stood firmer at the time of the Munich crisis, with what outcome one can only speculate.36 The overall consequences for the country, from the perspective of sixty years, could hardly have been worse than they turned out to be in actuality. [pageend82]Th e Car e e r o f Bo h u mil Ně me c 79 could give up the candidacy with honor, because I knew from my own experience what Germany, at that time already Hitler’s, was preparing against us.37 Along with having to bear the burden of his embarrassing withdrawal from the presidential election, Němec later became the target of a charge voiced by a Nazi official during the German occupation that his last minute candidacy and withdrawal were part of a plot by Jews, high ranking Freemasons, and special interests allied with the Hrad to engineer Beneš’s election.38 But Němec outlived his foes just as he did everyone else from the prime of his career. Surely he would have savored the report published in the Communist party organ Rudé právo after his death. Citing his instrumental role in the recently held centennial observances of Gregor Mendel’s discoveries in genetics and lauding Nëmec’s more than 650 scientific publications as having enduring value, it dismissed his political activities as long faded from public awareness.39 But Němec seems not to have believed that his political and civic involvements were in vain, despite the collapse of his worlds in September 1938, March 1939, and February 1948. Taking his cue from Cervantes’s noble knight, he saw the impact of idealistic, outwardly futile endeavors as transcending catastrophes in space and time. In his memoirs, he wrote: We understand that he [Don Quixote] died when everything he believed in and for which he had fought and suffered disappeared into nothingness. But the idea remained, the idea of enthusiasm, heroism, sacrifice, and selfless love that would inspire the best personalities to great deeds for mankind. These are the true knights, and many of them would experience the fate of the unlucky Knight of the Sad Figure.”40 Whether Němec really belongs among the “true knights” and “heroes” of the Czech nation, only historians who retrace his career and their readers will judge.

Iam by conviction a National Democrat and do not want to be transferred like a mute chattel into another grouping. I look into the future with fear.

Němec and Beneš had previously clashed in the “Olič affair” of 1925, when the foreign minister recommended awarding the Czechoslovak Revolutionary Medal to former Prague Police Chief Václav Olič (1847-1932). Němec co-signed and probably launched a protest sent to President Masaryk and the Ministry of National Defense by member of the Omladina club, who had suffered from the police under Olič’s command in 1892-93. See “Jednatelská zpráva,” O slovanském sjednocení (Praha: Nákl. Polit, klubu Omladinářů-devadesátmků, 1926) 41-42. The members may also have resented Beneš’s action because he and his wife, a close friend of Olič’s daughter, lived in Olič’s house after their marriage in 1909, conducted “Maffie” resistance activities there, and received money from Olič that enabled Beneš to join Masaryk abroad in 1915. 33.

Němec, “Vzpomínky” 604. [pageend87]Václav Havel’s “Temptation Cycle” Paul I. Trensky Václav Havel’s career as a playwright has now lasted for over three decades. The worldwide interest in his plays has been remarkable, especially in view of their fairly limited thematic scope. No doubt, the interest in Havel’s work both in Czechoslovakia and abroad has been to some degree generated by his extra-literary activities. However, these extrinsic factors would hardly have been so compelling if his work itself did not reflect the political and moral conflicts of Havel’s native country and his personal destiny. Aside from his early “light” pieces which he co-authored with Vyskočil, Macourek, and others around 1960, his dramatic work can be divided into two basic periods: the first includes The Garden party (Zahradní slavnost, 1962), The Memorandum (Vyrozumění, 1965) and Increased Difficulty of Concentration (Ztížená možnost soustředění, 1968), all three full-length dramas whose main objective is a satirical portrayal of the degenerative mechanisms of the communist state. In varying degrees, all these plays are structured upon the techniques of the so-called theater of the absurd (the Parisian avant-garde of the 1950s). His post-intervention plays of the early 1970s, Conspirators (Spiklenci, 1971) and The Beggars’ Opera (Žebrácká opera, 1972), are written in a similar mold. The Mountain Hotel (Horský hotel, 1976), stands somewhat aside of this trend. It is basically an experimental work, leading the techniques of the Ionescoan stagecraft to its outer limits. None of these plays were performed publicly in Czechoslovakia until after the Velvet Revolution. Two one-acters, An Audience (Audience, 1975) and Preview to an Exhibit (Vernisáž, 1975), mark the beginning of a new period in Havel’s work, one that continues through the 1980s. This period includes a third one-acter, Protest (Protest, 1978), and two full-length dramas, Largo Desolato (1984) and Temptation (Pokoušení, 1985). The difference between these plays and the earlier ones lies in Havel’s structuring the action around a central character who, moreover, has distinct autobiographical traits. In addition, these plays contain a more clearly articulated [pageend88]Hav e l ’s “Te mpt at io n Cyc l e 85 message, the author not being merely satisfied with the portrayal of the grotesqueries of the disintegrating social system. Indeed, all these plays can be viewed as modem moralities exploring the dangers facing an individual in the totalitarian society of the post-intervention period. Shrouded deceptively in grotesque comedy, the plays set forth messages concerning proper and improper moral and civic conduct. The devil of “normalization” (the euphemistic term coined by the Communist ideologists after the 1968 Soviet intervention) is everywhere, waiting for the unprepared and the unwary to strike at his moment of weakness. While only one, the last of them, suggests the theme by its title, the theme of temptation is present in all five plays. From this point of view they may be regarded as part of a series or a cycle, which I chose, for the purpose of this study, to call the “temptation cycle.” In the Judeo-Christian tradition, temptation is a salient device for testing man’s loyalty to the divine principle, starting with the very Book of Genesis. It is an outgrowth of the dualistic concept of the universe, positing the metaphysical existence of good and evil, with mankind being the battleground of the conflicting forces. In religious literature temptation has been a dominant dramatic device for the demonstration of the devil’s allure, and this tradition survived even the decline of the religious worldview itself, moving the theme from the metaphysical to the ethical sphere. I intend to show how the tradition of moralities found its way into Havel’s work of the past decade and a half. I shall not try to explore in any detail the issue of whether the use of morality patterns was conscious or accidental on Havel’s part, as this issue is of limited relevance for this study. Yet it should be noted at least in passing that there is a compelling prima facie evidence for the former alternative. Havel’s first- and second-hand acquaintance with this genre is very probable not just from textual analysis, but also from biographical data. Links between Ionesco, Havel’s most important model, and the medieval tradition of mysteries and moralities have been noted by critics in Czechoslovakia as well as abroad, and were without doubt known to Havel from early stages of his career.1 Other contemporary Czech playwrights used the patterns of mysteries and moralities. Most prominently, they have inspired Milan Kundera’s Keepers of the Keys (Majitelé klíčů, 1961), that appeared simultaneously with Havel’s own first works, and which was one of the most widely discussed dramas of the postwar era. Havel, who had been a drama critic before he became a playwright, possesses an impressive, albeit perhaps somewhat imbalanced familiarity with literary traditions and styles, as evidenced in [pageend89]86 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al his essays, interviews, and letters. This knowledge is positively reflected in his own dramatic work as well. Thus The Garden Party and The Memorandum are not merely adroit applications of the method of the Parisian avant-garde of the 1950s, but also literary parodies of a special kind, the former of the Bildungsroman, and the latter of utopian literature. On one level The Mountain Hotel may be regarded as a parody of the grand-hotel pop-genre. Briefly, what are moralities? The most famous of them are religious dramas of the late Middle Ages (but also dramatic poems and narratives), presenting a sharply defined image of the world as a showplace for the struggle between right and wrong. On one side there is God, and the renunciation of worldly pleasures, temporal glory, riches, pride and other vices. On the other side there is the devil, whose influence asserts itself in making man pursue transitory and sinful goals. Renunciation leads to salvation and eternal bliss. Providing short-term gratification, the life of sin leads to eternal damnation. The characters of moralities are two-dimensional, abstract, frequently they are allegories. Typically, moralities feature various forms of the Everyman, facing the devil, or personified vices such as pride, avarice, greed, and lust. The scenes are sharply confrontational, consisting of a pointed dialogue. The dualism is clearly defined: body vs. soul, asceticism vs. indulgence, probity vs. gluttony, moderation vs. incontinance, and so forth. There are morality plays that feature not just one character surrounded by personified forces of negation, but also positive forces, such as good angels or personified virtues, or even two contrasting individuals, one virtuous and the other sinful, and sometimes even more complex sets of characters. The modem author, while using the patterns of moralities as an inspirational source, does not mechanically duplicate the situations, characters and themes, but rather creates new-fashioned parallels to them. They may or may not conform with Christian ideology, but generally they are structured on a dualistic concept of life. Thus Kundera—who was still subscribing to Marxist ideology when he wrote The Keepers of the Keys—structured his play on the contrast between the spiritual and the materialistic ideal, but identified the former with the Communist worldview, and the latter with bourgeois decadence.2 In his play, damnation or salvation is not a religious matter, but that a of philosophy of history. Salvation is tantamount to an individual’s meaningful participation in the struggle for a classless society in accordance with Marx’s [pageend90]Hav e l ’s “Te mpt at io n Cyc l e 87 prophecies. In modem dramas the pattem of morality is only seldom evidenced at first sight. Modem authors conceal their inspirational source by secondary motifs, by ironic inversions, by comedy, or by the idiom of the grotesque. Of the five Havel’s plays belonging to the “temptation cycle,” Preview to an Exhibit bears the strongest resemblance to a classical morality. Let us recall its plot. The writer Vaněk (Havel’s autobiographical alter ego) is invited to the home of his friends, the married couple Michal and Věra. They call him their best friend and want him to be the first to see their lavishly redesigned apartment. Vaněk is the regime’s outcast and his hosts once shared his opposition to totalitarianism. Recently, however, they recanted and accepted the spirit of normalization. For their change in attitude they were richly rewarded by a superior income and other privileges, such as access to hard-to-get luxury items and trips abroad. Their new apartment is a showplace of their superior living standard, boasting all kinds of luxuries. But Michal and Věra are not satisfied with just exhibiting their riches to their destitute friend. They make during his visit a determined effort to convince him to give up his futile resistance to the regime so that he too may become prosperous. Vaněk does not argue against their reasoning, but he does not accept it either. As he is not swept off his feet by the conspicuous consumption, socialist style, they get gradually more irritated and abusive. However, at the end it is quite clear that in spite of their rhetoric, deep in their hearts they envy Vaněk’s inner peace and moral superiority. The story is a morality in its most rudimentary form. Vaněk is the quintessential man of spirit, a modem ascetic, while the two spokesmen for normalization are easily identifiable “lost souls” who succumbed to the temptation of the devil Mammon, and thus became his servants. Their names are based on an ironic inversion of their original meaning. Michal is just the opposite of the archangel leading the troops loyal to the Lord in the Biblical war of the angels, and Věra is just the opposite of “truth.” Their lavish apartment is a vanity fair whose seductive powers Vaněk must resist in order to escape damnation. (It is significant that the apartment is devoid of the ethical dimension of a true home, being rather, as the title suggests, a mere exhibition hall.) Damnation is here to be understood in ethical, rather than religious terms, as a betrayal of one’s ideal that leads to the psychological hell of self-contempt. Because the conflict is easily identified as between spirit and flesh, idealism and [pageend91]88 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al materialism, the most common moral antinomies, the play is understood without any difficulty even by societies who entirely lack familiarity with the socio-political realities of the country of the play’s origin. As in all classical moralities, there is also no doubt on whose side the author stands, nor who is the victor and who is the loser in the contest. The devil in this play is unequivocally compromised, and his temptation is a dismal failure. However, what separates the play from its medieval antecedents is the structure of the dialogue. As long as the Michal-Věra duo has the word, the language is strikingly similar to that of the evil forces of the genre. However, the norms of the genre require an eloquent rebuttal on the part of the prevailing “good” character, which is conspicuously lacking here. Just the opposite: Vaněk is withdrawn, reticent, monosyllabic. His passivity, his quiet reserve, his “shyness” has been noticed by just about every commentator on this as well as the other Vaněks in the “Vaněk plays” cycle. It should be noted, however, that a rebuttal through silence, although absent in medieval moralities—they rely generally on explicit articulation—is not atypical in their modem counterparts. For example, Dostoyevsky in his “Legend of the Grand Inquisitor,” perhaps the greatest modem temptation morality ever written, uses it with calculated effect, by confronting the silent Christ with the prolix Inquisitor, the devil incarnate. The target victim’s silence, his passivity has its dramatic as well as ideational consequences, forcing the attacking party into increasingly more heated, but also more strained, and ultimately absurd, arguments. That Vaněk’s friends as well as his other antagonists in the “temptation cycle” actually mean well, is of little significance. After all, the Grand Inquisitor, too, is a self-proclaimed, and undoubtedly convinced, lover of humanity, aiming merely at the correction of Christ’s teaching. The devil with a heart in the right place and with a tear in his eye is more typical since the romantic period than his unsentimental, primitive predecessor, and also more successful. An Audience is the second front of Vaněk’s struggle against the totalitarian environment, and his second temptation. The setting is a brewery—let us not forget, alcohol is a traditional devil’s tool, and a brewery or pub his lair—and the play consists entirely of a conversation between Vaněk and his boss, the brewmaster. (The authorities sent Vaněk to the brewery as a common laborer as a punishment.) During the conversation the half-drunk brewmaster asks Vaněk to perform for him various favors. The climax of the play is the brewmaster’s plea that Vaněk [pageend92]Hav e l 's "Te mpt at io n Cyc l e 89 utilize his writing skills to compose secret reports to the police about himself, thus relieving the brewmaster from an unpleasant obligation. Vaněk refuses. In contrast to The Preview, Vaněk’s reasons for his refusal are at first sight unclear. While in The Preview the issue is readily understood as a betrayal of ideals for the sake of material advantage, the brewmaster’s request does not appear to threaten Vaněk’s convictions. The personal advantage he might gain is negligible, if any. An Audience puts greater demands upon the spectator, forcing him to “discover” Vanëk’s motives. The task is made easier by the fact that the play, like all moralities, is structured upon a thesis. As we know from extrinsic sources, the play is based on personal experience, and its idea is derived from the saying “If you give the devil a finger, he will take your entire arm.” Of course, the spectator does not have to be acquainted with either the biographical background or with the saying. However, in order for the play to function as a morality, it must lead to the understanding that the conflict is against the background of fundamental moral antinomies. This point becomes clear at the end when the spectator realizes that Vanëk’s concern was for an important principle hidden behind the innocuous request, and that the play is about the struggle between spiritual and material values, after all. However, in comparison with the previous play, the ethos of the story is moved into a more abstract, and therefore more controversial, plane. Havel’s personal friend, an erstwhile dissident and amateur playwright, Jiří Dienstbier (the post-revolutionary Minister of Foreign Affairs), wrote his own samizdat drama with Vaněk as a central character, Reception (Příjem, 1983). A good-natured polemic against Havel, the play makes Vaněk accept the brewmaster’s request, albeit under somewhat different circumstances. The polemical inversion was seemingly in the name of Dienstbier’s more pragmatic, in opposition to Havel’s essentially dogmatic, ethics.3 The issue as to whether Havel’s stand is ethically correct or incorrect goes beyond the play itself and beyond this discussion. Rather, the issue is whether the author’s subjective stand (his personal experience, and the play’s thesis) is translated into an effective dramatic experience. Here I believe that the rejection of the moral message is possible only if we separate it from the dramatic context. In spite of the play’s greater complexity, the average viewer understands it as a story of Vanëk’s temptation, and accepts its logic, unless its production is intentionally [pageend93]90 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al aimed against it. Vaněk’s trial is of course more intricate, and its understanding is blurred by the fact that the spectator is to a large measure dependent upon the central character’s own perspective. Before the brewmaster surprises his “victim” with the last request, he asks him at first for a number of other, innocuous favors, such as introducing him to a famous actress. Vaněk’s inability to oblige is a cause of pity for the man. In addition, Vaněk suffers from a feeling of inadequacy, typical for an intellectual, confronted by a member of the working class. The brewmaster is fully aware of Vaněk’s feelings and intentionally plays on them. Moreover, the temptation itself is to bring an advantage to the brewmaster rather than Vaněk: paradoxically, in order to escape temptation, Vaněk must refuse to perform what appears at first sight as good deed. To make things yet more complicated, the brewmaster appears as a Falstaffian, good-natured hedonist. However, the conduct of the man gradually devalues his moral stature to such a degree that it becomes unacceptable to the viewer. Like The Preview, An Audience ends in a hysterical outburst of Vaněk’s tempter. It is one of the constants of the genre to show the defeated devil as a pathetically comical figure. Protest is Vanëk’s third front and his third temptation. (Triplicity is fully in the Biblical tradition, e.g. temptation of Christ in Matthew.) The situation is somewhat different from those in the previous two Vaněk plays. The central character becomes endangered only indirectly, as the author uses him rather as an observer of the moral disintegration of the normalized society. The opening scene repeats the situation in The Preview. Vaněk is visiting an ex-friend, the writer Staněk. Like Michal and Věra, Staněk has given up his struggle against the regime, and has become a prosperous member of the normalized society. The conflict between the two different worlds quickly unfolds. Vanëk’s purpose for his visit is to have Staněk sign a petition for the release of an innocently arrested person. While Staněk initially agrees, during the course of the visit he changes his mind. His turnaround is accompanied by a speech in defense of his position which is an awesome mixture of abuse, flattery, sophistry, and non-sequiturs. It is a sort of a “doublethink,” but of a new kind: it is not an instrument of power as it is in Nineteen Eighty-four, but a defensive device. In Havel’s totalitarian jungle the instinct of the prey has lead to the acceptance of the tactics of the predator. In fact, it has become difficult to tell them apart. It is precisely this creeping relativiza- tion of values which is the devil’s newest tactic: it is aimed at confusing [pageend94]Hav e l ’s “Te mpt at io n Cyc l e ” 91 his target’s distinction between right and wrong. In spite of that the moral antinomies of the play remain intact, as the ploy is too transparent to affect the protagonist. Although the central autobiographical character of the Vaněk triptych is from the dramatic viewpoint understated, his ethical preeminence over his environment is so controlling that it is difficult not to escape the impression of narcissistic self-indulgence on the part of the author. Especially with the knowledge of the background of its origin, one can interpret the triptych as a poetic vengeance against the author’s decadent milieu, as his special—ethically rather than aesthetically motivated—odi profanum vulgus. Such interpretation leads to the question as to whether Havel’s autobiographical surrogate did not succumb to the devil’s plot after all, by being seduced to the sin of pride. It is hard to imagine that Havel, who had frequently stated his identification with the Kafkaesque sentiment of existential guilt, was not aware of possible implication of the three plays. His next play, Largo desolato, features a different, substantially deglamorized and humbled political hero. Because the autobiographical element in this play is even more in evidence than in the preceding ones, we can regard this drama as a sort of existential contrition by means of self-parody. Largo starts once again from the encirclement of the central character. The political dissident, Professor Kopřiva, faces not one or two antagonists, but nine, although seven of them claim, and undoubtedly believe, to be his friends. Friend or foe, each of them deals the hapless professor some kind of mental blow. The secret police plague him with threats of imminent arrest which are that much more effective since they are not followed through: Kopřiva is thus kept in a state of constant anticipation and uncertainty. His admirers, old and young, intellectuals as well as working class people, plague him by constantly reminding him of his leadership role in the dissident movement. On the comical level there are three women around Kopřiva that plague him with exaggerated maternal care, exaggerated platonic fervor as well as with exaggerated sexual demands. Kopřiva is in the eyes of his admirers an ideal revolutionary and statesman, philosopher, husband, and lover. Under this pressure Kopřiva retreats more and more into an intellectual inertia and an ethical no man’s land. Kopriva’s situation is much more difficult than that of his predecessor, Vaněk, who had his moral dilemmas clearly demarcated. The dissolution of moral boundaries is the dominant feature of the play, but [pageend95]92 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al unlike in the Protest, the protagonist is under an immediate threat. Kopřiva is capable of resistance, but not of purposeless waiting. Lacking a viable objective to turn his energies to, Kopřiva might lose faith in himself, since it is impossible to bridge the image others have created of him and of his capabilities. This is the real reason why he longs for his arrest. Jail would insulate him from the possible betrayal of his beliefs, while guaranteeing him the fame of martyrdom. Kopřiva understands that he can remain an idol only when he disappears from the sight of his admirers. Unlike Vaněk, Kopřiva has a private life and an audience. In Largo the situation is ironically inverted: what the forces of evil were incapable of achieving, the good forces might yet achieve. Although Largo presents complex issues, it is not developed psychologically but ritualistically through the repetition of basic situations, doubling of characters, and schematization of the dialogue. Had the play been written with Diirenmattesque logic, it would probably end with Kopřiva being turned into a scapegoat, hunted down by his disappointed admirers, acting out their own frustrations and failings. Havel’s poetics of the absurd is not so extreme, although his “ecce homo” cuts distinctly through the grotesque curtain of the play. Its moral message, however, goes counter to the instinctive sympathy of the audience. It calls for the rejection of self-pity as well as for the escape into the comfort of martyrdom. The play reflects the growing spiritual fatigue after a decade and a half of normalized life. The devil of Largo is more cunning than in the preceding plays. He is a nihilist, the spirit of negation, who does not snare souls by promising material riches, but by undermining their resistance through the loss of trust in life’s general meaning. Temptation is an undisguised morality not only because of its title, but because of its use of the Faustian theme. While the story of Faust has found complex interpretations during the past two centuries, it was an outgrowth of medieval moralities. Even Christopher Marlowe’s later dramatization, Doctor Faustus (1593), is essentially still a “lost soul” morality, developed with the familiar melodramatic paraphernalia of the genre. Temptation is tied to a different paradigm of moralities than the above discussed plays. These types of moralities did not celebrate victory over the devil, but rather demonstrated man’s vulnerability to his allure. Their effect was based on the horror they portrayed as the consequence of man’s weakness. The shift from the two-dimensional, somewhat complacent central [pageend96]Hav e l ’s “Te mpt at io n Cyc l e ” 93 character of the Vaněk one-acters towards the more complex protagonist of Largo, goes here a step further. The protagonist is no longer outside the normalized society, battling against its infiltration into his ethical self, but its cogweel. Temptation blends the structure of Havel’s system plays of the 1960s with that of his plays of the 1970s and 1980s, featuring an autobiographical central character. According to the author, this change was designed to probe the much more typical situation of an average citizen. The hero of the play, Foustka, is not a dissident, but a scientist, standing in the very center of the normalized society. He is progressively moved to its fringe, but just when he is pushed over it, the play ends. Ever since its appearance, critics have had difficulties with the play’s meaning. Opinions have been voiced that it differs from Havel’s earlier works by being intentionally open to conflicting interpretations. While somewhat more complex, the basic idea of Temptation can be nevertheless quite clearly elucidated, especially through confrontation with its literary models, in particular with Goethe’s Faust. According to the author, it was Goethe, whom he read avidly while in prison, that inspired him to write this play. In most versions of the legend, Faust sells his soul for pleasure, power and knowledge. While pleasure (lust) and power (glory) are conventional sins of moralities, drive for knowledge gives the legend a special character, because it complicates the traditional antinomy body- soul. It is not by accident that the legend caught people’s imagination on the threshold of the New Age. It is especially this aspect of the legend which plays a dominant role in later versions. Goethe could have hardly saved his hero, were his drive for knowledge and experience not an inseparable part of his personality. This trait is the main argument for Goethe’s famous: “Wer immer strebend sich bemüht, den können wir erlösen.” If we compare Goethe’s, and other well-known Fausts of world literature with Havel’s protagonist, it becomes evident that he differs from them in some most essential points. Not only is Foustka’s drive for power and knowledge quite limited, but even his sensuality is of a rather common kind. He feels, for example, quite comfortable with his run-of- the-mill mistress Vilma, and the younger, more sensitive Margaret is to him not a challenge, but rather a bothersome intrusion into the routine of his life. Once we separate external parallels, it becomes evident that the sum total of Foustka’s character traits is in direct contrast to that of Faust of the legend. Temptation is structured upon the principle of literary [pageend97]94 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al parodies whose effect lies in the tension between the model and its copy. However, while parodies are generally designed to compromise the model, Temptation aims at the opposite. The play is a literary gambol of a sort, but one with serious ethical implications. It is precisely Foustka’s inability to “emulate” his Goethean prototype that becomes the cause for his damnation. Instead of searching for truth by himself in himself, he shuffles erratically back and forth between the two authorities, that of the establishment, represented by the powerful Departmental Head, and that of the opposition, represented by Fistula (Mephistopheles). The difference between them is of course illusory, since Fistula turns out to be the Departmental Head’s snitch, and Foustka’s revolt against the system was therefore doomed to fail before it started. But because Foustka tried to play both sides against the middle, he deprived himself of the chance of self-fulfillment and self-realization through choice. Dedication to a cause occupies on Havel’s list of values a higher place than formal success. In the context of the drama, salvation is to be understood in terms of existential ethics as personal commitment, a principle that ranks high in Havel’s moral philosophy. In the dehumanized jungle of decadent totalitarianism, it is difficult to tell apart a hero from a scoundrel, let alone absolute right from absolute wrong. In this environment an uncompromising moral commitment acquires a special meaning. For a complete understanding of Temptation, we have to go outside the text. In Letters to Olga, Havel describes an incident which led him later to write this play.4 In 1977, while in jail, he wrote what he believed was a routine petition for pardon, in whose success he did not for a moment believe, and which was actually intended to make fun of the authorities. To his astonishment, however, the pardon was granted, but his release was accompanied by extensive out-of-context quotes from the petition by the news media, casting serious doubts on his personal integrity. This incident was felt by Havel as dark spot on his honor. In the letters as well is in other places the playwright gives to this incident an almost morbid attention. The episode is synthesized into two messages of the play. The first: “Truth is not just what one says, but also to whom, when, why, and under what circumstances one says it.” And the second: “You cannot fool the devil.” Only when we know that these two messages, which are put into the mouth of the play’s leading characters, were four years earlier stated verbatim in Havel’s private communications, do we come to fully realize the play’s self-educational and self-purifying [pageend98]Hav e l ’s “Te mpt at io n Cyc l e 95 purpose. Moralities are sometimes written not just for the public, but for the authors themselves, and the “temptation cycle” is an outstanding example of this fact.

NOTES [pageend99]The Destruction of a Myth: The Novel as a Possibility For the Exploration of Human Existence Manfred Jähnichen In his essay “Cervantes’s Unappreciated Heritage,” Milan Kundera writes: “The novel as a model of this world, a world that rests on the relativity and ambiguity of human concerns, is incompatible with the total universe.”1 We can regard this sentence as one of the key sentences for understanding Kundera’s conception of the novel, for it sums up precisely his intellectual point of departure, from which all other criteria of his fictional creation follow. We have here, first of all, the following considerations: a) the concept of the novel as of a model, which depicts the “living world” of a person who is acquiring consciousness of his own existential condition; b) the relativity of all human phenomena and of human consciousness in this world, since we cannot reduce all this to a single truth; and c) the incompatibility of a pretension of any kind of totality from the standpoint of a given or dogmatic (or dogmatized) truth with the cognitive function of a writer—Kundera formulated this in another context as “an investigator of existence” (53). From these three postulates—which quite naturally form a unity and each of which contains in turn a series of conclusions and consequences for Kundera’s actual novelistic creation—the most significant for our investigation is the final one. We can consider it to be the overreaching principle, one which in relation to his novelistic creation contains Kundera’s philosophic—or as he himself would wish it to be viewed—his ontological conception of the world. Kundera has no doubt that the unity of the world can no longer be conceived with the aid of narrow scientific and technical specialization: still the possibility of knowing it remains a burning problem, a challenge to our epoch. Philosophy can make a contribution to this only in the form [pageend100]Th e De st r u c t io n o f a Myt h 97 of universal theorems; a concrete picture of the investigation of the human existential condition it cannot give (168). According to Kundera this is possible only for the novel, viewed as a “meditation on existence which uses the perspective of imaginary figures” (93), and the omnipresent author as director and commentator. Just like Hermann Broch, Kundera also emphasizes that the novel’s sole “right to existence” rests in the fact that it “brings out an unknown side of life, a side which only the novel can reveal.” Kundera regards this cognitive function of the novel, one which from his point of view is essential, as its “only moral quality” (13). In this connection there is for Kundera—the literary theoretician and novelist—one thing that is not ephemeral: this is the longing for a cognition that cannot be constrained by any previously given truth, or, in other words, by dogma. Should this aspect be neglected, the real function of the novel is threatened or even unrealizable. Every previously given dogma complicates or vitiates “the radical autonomy of the novel,” which for Kundera, as for the heir of Kafka, is absolutely essential (127). From his knowledge of world literature, and especially of Kafka, but also from his own life story he knows that everywhere where “power becomes a god,” it automatically creates its own theology (112). This means that it will create dogmas, perhaps even a myth of its historical mission, a myth that limits or totally destroys the novelist’s independent longing for knowledge. In place of that it demands permanent agreement. For Kundera it is the Kafkaesque that is realized in a large-scale social frame in modem history. With the Kafkaesque Kundera himself became familiar through the events that took place in his homeland: as he wrote in another context, in relation to Kafka’s work, “the creeping concentration of power that worships itself,” as “the bureaucratization of social activities, a bureaucratization which transforms all institutions into enormous labyrinths and the end result is the depersonalization of the individual” (116). Ensuing from these philosophical positions which are basic for Kundera and on their bases he defines the—for him significant—cognitive function of the novel, his responsibility towards his country’s fate and to the European tradition of free thought and the struggle against every dogma and every myth. The history of his homeland, especially since 1948, has helped him depict concretely the “existential condition” (46) of today’s human being, a condition which is obviously determined always by history, in the perspective of imaginary figures and the visible presence of the author and his appraisal of events. The pathos of 1948 is in the [pageend101]98 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al novel Life is Elsewhere; the dogmatism of the early 1950s in The Joke. The suppression of the Czechoslovak reform movement by Soviet tanks—all leads to emigration or to apathy and to the stigmatization of the entire society, as set forth in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting and The Incredible Lightness of Being. It is the historical milestones which document the existential condition of the humankind of our century: like hope for the creation of a social utopia which will bring freedom to all, in spite of the disturbing and bitter realization that it is with the Stalinist- ically organized and disciplined Party which claims its own infallibility. With its dogmas, this is impossible and, therefore, disillusionment will inescapably follow. It is, then, expressed more generally, an escalating loss of values, one which Kundera already, on the basis of Broch’s novel, designated as the basic characteristic of our century. It is no coincidence that in another context, in his Unbearable Lightness, Kundera meditates about the novel as follows: “The novel is not the author’s confession, but an investigation of a life that has fallen into a trap, that trap which the world has turned into.”2 This formulation is important here, for it contains both the author’s philosophical and social conception. Kundera, in the final analysis, knows well, from his experience in his pre-Paris period, to just what pressures the individual is exposed in a totalitarian society. I can quote from his comments on Kafka’s novels: “Especially in its extreme forms in which [society] aims to remove the boundaries between ‘private’ and ‘public, ’ the power which ever becomes less and less transparent, and demands from the citizen that his life should become as transparent as possible” (120). But these are requirements which Kundera on principle opposes, and this both from the philosophical as well as the novelistic point of view. Hence he builds his novels as constant and meditative inquiries which become a permanent refutation or unveiling of the dogmatically postulated claim for truth. Intellectual skepticism or irony which thus leads to the relativization of all formulated subjective truths is for him one of the viable means. He speaks, for instance, of “the fascinating imaginary space in which no one is a possessor of truth and every one has the right to be understood.”3 We can understand this as a manifestation of tolerance as, for example, in French culture, to which Kundera belonged since the mid-1970s; this theme is distinctly emphasized by him in the subject of his latest novel, Immortality (1990). One method of documenting this truth artistically is that Kundera, as the author, with his provocative, ironic, or even merely with his testing, [pageend102]Th e De st r u c t io n o f a Myt h 99 questioning accent, deprives his characters of the halo they otherwise might wear. The “laughable” character of his loves, loves founded rather on declarations more than on actual feelings, thus predetermined vision from a private point of view and through situational comedy. From The Joke on, this emphasis became the basic formative situation in Kundera’s novels, in which both the political and social milieu of the totalitarian state appears as a world in which “determination” from without “has become so powerful that it can destroy the subject’s inner incentives or at least cripple them” (34). Kundera’s principle of representation follows logically from this. It is modem “polyphonic meditation,” which is first of all built on the plane of the theme. Kundera does not normally work, as is well known, with a closed plot— The Farewell Party is the chief exception to this—but often in accordance with a principle of musical composition; the method of variation on a given theme can be seen most obviously in The Book of Laughter. This activates the narrative content as a dream, an essay, and the author’s reactions, imagination as well as philosophy. He then weaves them, in the meaning of where postmodern novelistic principles into a unity where they find their application as ironic doubt, playing with facts, the destruction of relations of space and time, intertextuality or depsychologization of characters. In the novel, then, he will create, as he emphasized in his speech in Jerusalem, “an imaginary paradise for his figures” (34). From the point of view of our inquiry, one thing is especially important in this “paradise”: The viewpoints of his characters crisscross and thus become relative, he himself as author-narrator functions as a witness and as the initiator of the narrative, but at the same time as an ironic and critical glossier who will emphasize that his personages (characters) “are bom from a single situation, a single sentence, a single metaphor.”4 Thus he is able to realize that “fourfold mission of the novel” (167) which is so important for him: this is the “mission of play” (as in The Joke)\ the “mission of the dream” (Tamina in The Book of Laughter), the “mission of thinking” (this is found in all his philosophy); and the “mission of time” (the Czech lands in the second half of the twentieth century, the world and existence). In his novels this fourfold mission is linked to such a degree that we can speak of his demand for “the spirit of the novel” as for a spirit of complexity in relation to the European novelistic tradition (from Cervantes and Richardson down to Kafka, Musil and Broch) by which he swears, for a spirit of continuity as the determin- [pageend103]100 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al ing sign of his novelistic work. This all means, however, that the universal existential placing of the human being is usually played out against a very concrete historical milieu, even though, beginning with the middle of the 1970s, Kundera only mentions this milieu in general terms. This milieu is generally derived from an alternation of a concrete situation, e.g., life in “normalized” Prague or in emigration. Such an alternation gives him, a remote novelist, greater possibilities in capturing human existence with the aid of his imaginary characters in their diverse, often controversial situations, and first of all in emphasizing the element of chance; we may compare, for instance, the explicitly developed theory of chance in Chapter 5 (“Chance”) of Immortality. At the same time there exists for him a significant paradox of action and character, so that he is also able to emphasize the relativity of being. Whether he personifies Jaromil, Ludvík, Tamina, Tomáš, Tereza or Rubens, paradox is for him an expression of the basic laws of human existence. Paradox furnishes him constantly, however, with the possibility of ridiculing the erroneous claim (demand, right) to authority, or the dogmatic, absolute claim (demand) for truth. The cutting edge of his criticism is thus aimed at the totalitarian society, which is an expression of the total destruction of human individuality (the individuality of the human being). Using the thematic level as a point of departure, the level which Kundera considers “an existential matter” (94), he conducts his polemic with the help of irony and stylistic refinement. Often these are situations which he experienced in life, on the basis of which he can reflect and demolish the myth of the absolute justice and historical necessity of the revolutionary change-over of the world. He is well able to construct and relativize such situations, especially with his valid main theme, and he represents them with the help of complex, semantically similar motifs. In his novel Life Is Elsewhere, there is first of all the axis lyricism—the revolution—youth, i.e. the time of February 1948, which Kundera strips bare as one of the myths. Later, in an interview with Christian Salomon, he was to say that for him this was a novel about the European revolution in “concentrated form,” the revolution which he, with his detachment, could feel as a putsch “with all its rhetoric, illusions, reflexes, gestures, criminal acts, as a paradoxical distillation of Europe’s revolutionary traditions, as the prolongation and grotesque completion of the time of European revolutions” (48). Kundera’s portrayal of Jaromil, the egocentric poet, reflects that “grotesque completion” as a parallel to the exaltation [pageend104]Th e De st r u c t io n o f a Myt h 101 of the romantico-pathetic gesture and/or poetry, both of which contain a denunciation. This parallelism helps him to achieve the most effective unmasking of the danger, a danger which rhetoric can conceal within itself. It is just this demolition of false or faked pathos or myth with which Kundera began already in The Joke treating the Czech reality of the early 1950s. But in that novel the grotesque character of the subject and hence the situation imposed by that subject was all the more relevant from the social standpoint. Here, with the help of the paradoxes of the novel’s plot, the dogmatism of the early 1950s was analyzed. Kundera’s refutation is without any attempt to mask matters. It is the representation of the situation and its consequences, in which, in the name of “a loftier revolutionary justice,” any sort of feeling for laughter and for play is mercilessly demolished; for Kundera this is one of the significant aims of novel writing. In this way is demystified that illusion of the younger generation which supposed that it held “the helm of history” in its hands. In The Joke Kundera writes: “The intoxication which we experienced is generally described as an intoxication with power, but (with a bit of good will) I could as well choose less austere terms: We are put under the spell of the evil eye by history, we were intoxicated with the fact that we had leaped onto the spine of history and felt it beneath ourselves...”5 For one’s own ego this of course meant dissolving in the pseudo-collective, which Kundera had, from the very first, held in contempt. In The Book of Laughter and in The Unbearable Lightness, Kundera deepened still more his fundamental refutation, and this as a consequence of the Warsaw Pact intervention of Czechoslovakia in August 1968 and its aftermath. This plays the role of a manifold, varied novelistic reworking of the situation in which a person, whether he is in an enforced emigration or in “normalized” Czechoslovakia, undergoes the crisis and experiences it. Kundera’s criticism belongs first of all to a social conception which, under the banner of a dogmatized claim to infallibility, leads to apathy and stigmatization. He places this criticism—like its counter-arguments—in relation to a world as into a counterweight to provincialism, a counterweight which his characters, just like the author himself, have undergone and reacted to. Kundera expresses his criticism more and more directly to the reader, on the basis of commentary as digressive reaction, and thus he expresses absolute emphasis on the meditative and philosophical moment as opposed to the plot itself, as we can see from the ever-present question of forgetting as conscious erasure from our memory. Linguistic criticism, [pageend105]102 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al which in his prose is present from the very first (see for instance his “Eleven Words” (131), which are key words in his novelistic esthetics, as well as Chvatik’s counter-judgments)6 here becomes an important principle: I call to mind here Kundera’s continually cited example of the word lítost (sorrow, regret, pity) as well as his no less indicative analysis of the concept of kitsch in everyday socialist life. Just through the help of clearly intensified esthetic structures he creates possibilities for himself in these novels. In the sense of these and a series of other themes, such as Kundera’s favorite topic of sex, which in Kundera becomes one of the existential situations that the human being finds himself in, he consciously strengthens the “philosophy” of his novels and widens out “the map of existence for man” in our century. Polished discussion with the dogmatics of a pretension of infallibility claimed by the Stalinist constituted Party and its operation in society which becomes a picture of the universal position of the human being “in the trap which our world has turned into.” This is the position of the individual in history, and the author broadens his subjective experiences to make of them a universal experience. Kundera explores the destruction of the myth as a possibility for studying human existence more precisely than could have been done before as the behavior of man in totalitarian systems. This of course is one of the chief contributions in the development of the European philosophical novel. His novelistic characters are not, as he meditates in The Unbearable Lightness, living people bom “from a mother’s body, but from a situation, a sentence, a metaphor..., in whose core there rests one of man’s possibilities,” a possibility concerning which the author thinks that it has still not been discovered or that the essential thing has not yet been said about it.7 From this point of view his novels are works which model the basic experiences of our century, experiences which are not exclusive to the citizens of his country: a grappling with dogmatism and the social phenomenon which results from it. The phenomenon which we came to call Stalinism or neo-Stalinism and in which mankind’s hopes for the realization of social justice and individual liberty have been abused. Kundera’s fiction is one of the great artistic works of Europe in which there is depicted, starting with the 1960s, the destruction of a false myth and in which human existence is studied in the conditions of an unlimited and uncontrollable power. In this sense his novels belong to the significant works of the Middle European cultural sphere, among which there belong [pageend106]Th e De st r u c t io n o f a Myt h 103 Kafka and Musil, Broch, Thomas Mann and others.

[pageend107]Kundera’s Fiction and the Czech Critics The 1970s and 1980s Marie Bednar Milan Kundera is without a doubt the Czech writer best known internationally. Since 1970, all of his fiction has appeared in translation in the English-speaking countries; each work elicits the intense attention of reviewers. His popularity with general readers has also increased steadily, culminating with the best-selling novel, The Unbearable Lightness of Being (Nesnesitelná lehkost bytí, 1984). He has received several prestigious literary awards and his works have been subjected to frequent scrutiny by literary scholars. In the late eighties, two important literary magazines devoted special issues to Kundera’s work and a book-length annotated bibliography of works by and about him was published.1 He has been ranked with other truly original world novelists, such as Günter Grass and Gabriel García Márquez. Critics call him one of the finest and most consistently interesting contemporary novelists whose insights into the human condition have universal appeal. Kundera’s literary reputation in his own country, on the other hand, has been volatile and very much affected by the changing political climate there. A literary star in the fifties and sixties, Kundera became a proscribed author in 1969. Following The Joke (Žert, 1967), all his novels in the next twenty years were published in Czech only by the émigré publishing house in Toronto, Sixty-Eight Publishers,2 and had to be brought into Czechoslovakia illegally. Thus, after 1969 Kundera’s works received much less attention (and in some cases, less enthusiastic attention) from the Czechs than from his Western critics. In fact, some of the harshest criticism of Kundera came from his compatriots. Among Kundera’s denouncers, ironically, were not only the official Czech critics, as might well be expected, but also some from the dissident circles. The reactions to Kundera by the Czechs—the good, the bad and the ugly—published in the seventies and the eighties, will be the focus of this article. Material in Czech and English from three types of publications [pageend108]Ku n d e r a ’s Fic t io n an d t h e Cz e c h Cr it ic s 105 The seventies were the years of a nearly complete paralysis of Czech culture since the government, installed after the Soviet-led intervention, reasserted total control of the country’s cultural life and punished those who took part in the liberalization efforts and refused to recant. Numerous cultural journals were closed. Over one hundred writers and poets were silenced; many critics, journalists, scholars and other intellectuals lost their jobs and generally had to support themselves by manual labor. Emigration, followed by a struggle to establish themselves in the West, was the way out for a large number of them. Meanwhile, inside Czechoslovakia, it took many years for the opposition to the official, censored culture to organize its own underground vehicles for self-expression—the samizdat.3 Thus, it is not surprising that during the seventies, when The Seventies In the 1950s Kundera was one of the most promising and much-discussed writers in Czechoslovakia. In the 1960s he took an active part in the intellectuals’ push for greater freedom of expression and for political reforms that eventually culminated in the very short period of “socialism with a human face,” the 1968 Prague Spring. Throughout the fifties and sixties, his works were issued in huge printings, argued about and copiously analyzed in literary and cultural journals, and widely read by the general public. The 1968 Warsaw Pact intervention and the following period of repression and reprisals against the reform movement participants changed all that. Because of Kundera’s involvement in the liberalization efforts, his books were banned from publishing houses and from libraries in 1969. He lost his job as professor of literature at the Prague Film School and in 1975 he emigrated to France. The Early Years will be covered: the émigré publications; the unofficial, underground publications (samizdat); and the official Czechoslovak press. Besides assessing the contribution by the Czechs to Kunderian scholarship, the article will also complement Brand’s bibliography of Kundera. Generally fairly complete, the bibliography has gaps in its coverage of the émigré reactions; the samizdat material and the official reactions are completely missing. [pageend109]106 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al Kundera started to gain recognition in the West, only three studies of Kundera’s fiction came from his compatriots. Two of them appeared in the West and one in an early samizdat journal. The first reaction to Kundera’s work appearing in the 1970s was Lubomír Doležel’s detailed, formalistic analysis of the use of “multiperspective” narrative technique in The Joke. By a close examination of how the four narrators involved rendered the same events, Doležel shows Kundera’s interesting and highly original use of the “multiperspective” technique in the novel.4 The second article on Kundera, by Luboš Dobrovský, appeared in 1978 in one of the first Czech samizdat journals, Spektrum. Dobrovský discusses The Farewell Party (Valčík na rozloučenou)5 as an example of Kundera’s artistic method of a game with characters, a game in which only the first move is free and in which good and evil are interchangeable and cancel one another. Dobrovský finds Kundera’s game with the characters ironic, sardonic, cruel, and without pity, a game in which everything is allowed, in which no right or wrong exists. In the character of Bertlef, however, Dobrovský sees a glimmer of hope that something in Kundera’s world gives life a meaning, that something exists beyond the accidental events and jokes. Dobrovský concludes that only if Kundera goes beyond frivolous games with his characters will he have an important place in the context of Czech literature.6 The last of the three articles on Kundera published by the Czechs in the entire 1970s is, ironically, an overview of the reactions to Kundera by the Anglo-American critics, written by Darina Vašková. And these certainly were much more numerous than the reactions of the Czechs; Vašková herself discusses over forty of them.7 Emigré Reactions in the Eighties In the eighties, after the Czech émigré critics became acclimatized in the West and the samizdat publications started to flourish in Czechoslovakia, Kundera’s fiction attracted more attention by the Czechs both abroad and at home. I will first discuss the émigré reactions to Kundera, then reactions to Kundera appearing in samizdat, and finally the huge “Kundera dispute,” which drew comments from Czechs on both sides of the Iron Curtain. The émigré assessment of Kundera’s fiction published in the eighties consists both of shorter critical reviews and more substantial analyses. Marie Němcová Baneijee has reviewed all Kundera’s works in the journal [pageend110]Ku n d e r a ’s Fic t io n an d t h e Cz e c h Cr it ic s 107 World Literature Today. Her comments in 1980 on Life is Elsewhere which she called Kundera’s masterpiece, are very perceptive, although necessarily brief. Her main point is that the novel is a “a cynical, post-Freudian revision of the nineteenth-century theme of the education of the artist and also a bitter political lampoon.”8 In her 1986 review of The Unbearable Lightness, Banerjee makes an interesting point on reading Kundera in translation versus the original Czech. She observes that Michael H. Heim’s easy and elegant translation creates the illusion of being the only possible original. “Indeed,” she writes, “it was something of a shock to rediscover the same passages in Czech, with its startlingly raw, more concrete quality.”9 Her comment coincides with complaints some Czech readers have made about the change of Kundera’s style in his later novels written in the West. I will discuss this change later. Antonin Liehm’s gushingly enthusiastic 1980 essay, “Milan Kundera: Czech Writer,” asserts that Kundera took the tradition of Czech masters of irony (Hašek, Čapek and Vančura) to new heights and became one of the greatest contemporary ironists. Liehm emphasizes the importance of the unique experience of Kundera’s generation with communism as a major formative force of Kundera’s art. Devoting most of his attention to The Farewell Party and heavily quoting from other commentators on Kundera, Liehm calls it Kundera’s magnum opus, his most mature work at that time.10 Sylvie Richterová’s substantial study (published in Italian in 1981 and later in French and Czech) is one of the most important and original contributions to the analyses of Kundera’s art. Examining three novels, The Joke, Life is Elsewhere and The Farewell Party, she suggests that the author is mainly interested in problems of the relationship between man and language, as a historical and social phenomenon. Richterová offers a reading of Kundera’s novels as a semiotic metaphor, as a critique of language expressed in epical terms, as part of epic conflicts, actions and events. It is precisely in these characteristics that she sees Kundera’s uniqueness.11 The relationship between man and language, particularly the theme of misuse of language in order to obfuscate reality in service of the revolution, is also the main thrust of Karel Hvížďala’s 1986 comments on Life is Elsewhere. Hvižďala views this novel as Kundera’s attempt to expiate his own communist past, his personal involvement in misuse of language for the sake of revolutionary change.12 The philosophical underpinnings of The Unbearable Lightness are the [pageend111]108 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al focus of Jan Čulík’s comments on Kundera. Čulík asserts that the novel does not depict life but is “first and foremost a work of rational, philosophical speculation.” He analyzes Kundera’s ideas on life and concludes that Kundera persistently destroys all the myths enveloping human existence until nothing remains except total negation. And although he considers the novel an impressive intellectual achievement, he maintains that “one’s instinct rebels against the proposal that life is a total negation.”13 In another 1986 article in the émigré journal Proměny, the Czech structuralist critic Květoslav Chvatík, like Richterová, advances the idea that Kundera’s novels examine above all the crisis of human communication through language. His analysis of Kundera’s major themes includes all five novels which, according to Chvatík, create a coherent cycle. Chvatík sees the unity of the cycle in the clarity, logic and intellectual precision of the language and in the central role of the epic element in Kundera’s narrative. Kundera’s novelistic cycle, according to him, refutes the cliché about the crisis of the novel, and he proceeds to discuss the levels of meaning that result from the inner thematic unity and formal diversity of the cycle. Rich in thematic and narrative variations, the final novel of the group, The Unbearable Lightness, is considered by Chvatík to be the culmination of Kundera’s novelistic achievement.14 Taking a different approach to Kundera’s work, in his lengthy 1986 article Petr Hrubý follows Kundera’s entire literary career as a poet, literary historian, journalist, playwright, short story writer, translator, spokesman, and novelist. He combines elements of biography and politics with assessments of Kundera’s literary output and with discussions of recurring themes in the novels. While little is new in Hrubý’s literary analyses, the article contains many interesting biographical tidbits, especially about Kundera’s early years.15 Another name that needs to be mentioned in a discussion of the contributions of Czech émigrés to Kunderian scholarship is Helena Kosková. Kosková regularly reviewed Kundera’s books in the most important Czech émigré journal, Svědectví, and later expanded her views in a chapter devoted to Kundera in her 1987 book Hledání ztracené generace,16 Kosková presents a balanced assessment of all Kundera’s fiction, paying attention to formal aspects of Kundera’s art and to the interpretation of the important motifs and themes, as well as Kundera’s own statements about his work. Kosková’s study sparkles with many interesting observations and insights and is the most comprehensive and [pageend112]Ku n d e r a ’s Fic t io n an d t h e Cz e c h Cr it ic s 109 Unofficial cultural journals flourished in Czechoslovakia by the mideighties. And although at that time smuggled copies of all Kundera’s novels were circulating in dissident circles, only one reaction to Kundera appeared in the samizdat during that period—a review of Life Is Elsewhere. According to the author, Josef Vohryzek, this review was regrettably the novel’s first in the country, some five years after the novel’s appearance in Czech. Writing for an audience that might not have read the book, Vohryzek interprets in detail the actions of the principal characters and analyzes Kundera’s attitude towards them. He notes that while all the characters are presented with biting irony, only the redhead’s older, libertine lover is spared the irony and even presented with some pathos. Vohryzek also discusses the cruel paradox of Jaromil’s betrayal—a betrayal not only of his girlfriend but also of himself and he further suggests a reading of the novel as that of a revolutionary poet, a revolutionary not in the sense of revolt but in his desire for self-denial and service to a cause. Vohryzek characterizes the technique of the novel as that of a novel-essay, which allows the author to take on the role of narrator, analytical judge, and essayist—all sometimes within the space of one sentence. According to him, this method’s pitfall is that it results in a transposition of the known rather than in an involvement of the reader in an adventurous search for the unknown. Vohryzek concludes that Kundera’s art, though practiced with great ingenuity, as is the case with Life Is Elsewhere, still belongs only to the art of the possible, rather than to the art of the impossible, as true art does.18 The relatively quiet waters of Czech Kunderian scholarship—the émigré critics busy commenting on various aspects of Kundera’s art and the critics at home being mainly silent—were stirred up in 1986 by Milan Jungmann’s huge, provocative and controversial study, in Svědectví. Jungmann, a dissident literary scholar and prolific samizdat critic, set out Samizdat Reactions in the Eighties informative general study of Kundera written by a fellow Czech during the seventies and eighties. The last contribution to Kunderian scholarship by his compatriots in the eighties is an erudite exploration by Baneijee of the Don Juan myth in Kundera’s book of short stories, Laughable Loves. Drawing on numerous versions of the myth in literature and music, Baneijee analyzes in detail Kundera’s ironic and playful use of the myth.17 [pageend113]110 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al to define why Kundera’s works, particularly those written in France, were received in his native country much less enthusiastically than in the West. Jungmann traces the development of Kundera’s fictional technique from The Joke to The Unbearable Lightness. He emphasizes Kundera’s epic talent and observes the growing tendency of narrators in Kundera’s fiction to philosophize and comment on the action. He also analyzes Kundera’s use and treatment of characters and comments on the author’s increasing preoccupation with sex in his later novels. Jungmann asserts that in the first three novels, Kundera’s considerable narrative talent, stylistic brilliance, and philosophical approach resulted in engrossing and satisfying literature. The following two novels written in the West, The Book of Laughter and Forgetting and The Unbearable Lightness of Being, however, elicit Jungmann’s numerous reservations. He observes a noticeable shift in Kundera’s technique, particularly in The Unbearable Lightness, evident in Kundera’s simplifying the complexities of life by breaking them down into neat categories, paradoxes and bon mots to dazzle the unsophisticated reader. Kundera’s stylistically brilliant philosophical meditations, in Jungmann’s opinion, are superficial and pretentious. Jungmann stresses that, while the presentation of ideas in Kundera’s novels gains in brilliance since The Joke, the depth and seriousness of the ideas diminish. He further charges that Kundera’s characters are not “made of flesh and blood” and have no life of their own; they are just functions of a problem or a presented theme. Another disturbing aspect of the two later novels, according to the critic, is Kundera’s increasing preoccupation with sex. What makes matters worse, according to Jungma- nn, is that the kind of sex Kundera often explores borders on the perverse. Finally, he chastises Kundera for his simplification of Czech reality and gross distortion, mainly of the lives and efforts of dissidents. According to Jungmann, these weaknesses in Kundera’s two later novels are all related to his attempt to achieve wide success with readers outside of Czechoslovakia and to do that at all costs.19 Emigré Responses to Jungmann Jungmann’s study opened a floodgate of responses, both from the Czech émigré community and from the dissidents inside Czechoslovakia. Interestingly, while the dissidents tended to agree at least with some of Jungmann’s points, the émigrés came to Kundera’s defense. Only one émigré voice, that of Jan Kresadlo, expressed reservations about Kunde- [pageend114]Ku n d e r a ’s Fic t io n an d t h e Cz e c h Cr it ic s in ra’s art, while at the same time uncharitably ridiculing Jungmann’s critical method. According to Kresadlo, Kundera’s success derives from his subtle and clever combination of pornography and saccharine romance, skillfully camouflaged with tidbits of philosophy, politics, general culture, and esthetics. In other words, Kundera’s talent is limited to that of a clever craftsman. He speculates further about why Kundera’s books offend some readers, particularly those in Czechoslovakia. Kresadlo concludes that “Kundera’s works and philosophy disturb the archetypal principles of moral law and justice embedded in us.”20 Most of the other émigré responses to Jungmann appeared in the same journal, Svědectví. They included a vitriolic outburst of Petr Král, carefully argued opinions by Květoslav Chvatík and Ivo Bock, and a balanced, immensely readable contribution by Josef Škvorecký.21 Since the four respondents’ main points of disagreement with Jungmann overlap, I will discuss them together.22 Critics of Jungmann’s approach to Kundera, first of all, agree that he totally misses Kundera’s modernity and his uniqueness. They stress that Jungmann judges Kundera’s later works according to the norms and standards of a realistic novel when he complains that Kundera’s characters are not made of flesh and blood, but are functions of a problem or an idea. Secondly, the respondents to Jungmann refute his argument that Kundera’s philosophical reflections are shallow and that the two novels in question are just superficial games of paradoxes and bon mots, cleverly presented to dazzle the Western reader. Their point is that while not all of Kundera’s ideas are profound, some of them clearly are. Further, the aim of a novelist’s philosophical reflections is not to give definite answers to existential issues but to provoke and inspire the reader to formulate his own opinions. And Kundera certainly does that. Jungmann’s critics also agree that he is moralizing when he accuses Kundera of increased preoccupation with sex in his later novels in order to win Western readers. The authors prove that sex has always been a major theme in Kundera’s works, but not a frivolous one. The final point of the four opponents of Jungmann is that he is out of line when he chastises Kundera for misrepresenting Czechoslovak reality. While he may be doing that, he is, after all, not writing a documentary but a work of fiction. Similarly, all four agree that Kundera should not be taken to task for his ironic picture of dissidents and their activities (both in The Book of Laughter and The Unbearable Lightness), since nonconformism and a tendency to destroy all myths have always been Kundera’s trademarks. [pageend115]112 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al As mentioned earlier, Jungmann’s opinions of Kundera found more sympathizers inside Czechoslovakia. Vladimir Pistorius, in his samizdat book on contemporary Czech literature, basically agrees with Jungmann’s assessment of Kundera. He also maintains that Kundera’s philosophical reflections are little more than flashy witticisms posing as profound truths. In addition, Pistorius comments on the changes in Kundera’s style in the last two novels, which mainly involve simplification of vocabulary and syntax in order to facilitate translation. Kundera himself has written about these changes. Pistorius calls these stylistic differences a betrayal of the Czech reader and a bending over backwards on Kundera’s part to win the Western public.23 Pistorius closes with Bedřich Fučík’s ironic dismissal of writers like Kundera, who “skillfully mix cocktails of provocative plots, laced with sentimentality, sensationalism and pornography, catering to the present-day bourgeois.”24 Karel Pecka, a fiction writer himself, in his 1987 essay “Věk cynismu,” alludes to the astuteness of Jungmann’s article on Kundera and goes on with his own harsh dismissal of Kundera. He asserts that Kundera, like an entomologist, displays and studies his characters like pinned-up insects in the sparkling glass cases of his fictions. According to Pecka, however, Kundera overestimates his ability to manipulate his characters to suit his designs. Consequently, his novels suffer ruptures which cannot be repaired, although Pecka provides no examples. He also comments on the superficiality and inauthenticity of Kundera’s later novels, attributing their commercial success in the West to declining standards of the reading public.25 Other samizdat writers, such as Eva Kantůrkové, use Jungmann’s article as a point of departure for their own, considerably more temperate reservations about Kundera. In her long essay on the generation of Czech writers bom in the twenties, Kantůrkové also discusses authenticity in Kundera’s The Unbearable Lightness. She observes that, instead of subjecting himself to scrutiny as other writers of his generation have done, Samizdat Responses to Jungmann Both are more worthy of respect than condemnation. What the four critics are saying is that Jungmann is not only judging Kundera by standards appropriate to a different type of literature but also bringing in extra-literary factors, rather than focusing on the intrinsic artistic qualities of Kundera’s work. [pageend116]Ku n d e r a ’s Fic t io n an d t h e Cz e c h Cr it ic s 113 Kundera, almost as a god, brilliantly creates from his own experience a whole new artificial world. This world is independent of all “heavy” ethical issues and in it the supreme measure of everything is sexuality. Kantůrková concludes that only time will tell if The Unbearable Lightness is just kitsch turned inside out or something more. But she takes Kundera to task for borrowing selected provocative details from the Czechoslovak reality. According to her, this “false authenticity” is the saddest form of defeat of authenticity she has come across in all the works of her generation.26 Some of the samizdat writers, however, expressed their dismay at Jungmann’s opinions of Kundera and came to Kundera’s defense. Using arguments similar to those of the émigré critics, Jan Trefulka, for example, eloquently defends Kundera from several charges, such as overemphasizing sex in his later novels in order to appeal to the Western reader, and simplifying Czechoslovak reality for the same reason. According to Trefulka, Jungmann totally missed the point that “Kundera is elsewhere, ” that he is working on a totally different plane: an authentic depiction of Czechoslovak reality and struggles of dissidents with the system is not his aim. Kundera is exorcising his own private demons, as he always has.27 Another samizdat critic, Zdeněk Ábel, summarizes and embellishes with his own perceptions all points of the Kundera debate. He expresses disappointment about the low quality of some of the attacks on Kundera’s later novels. These attacks often are mere personal opinions rather than results of a serious analysis of his works, Ábel argues. And to do as he preaches, Ábel continues by tracing the development of Kundera’s philosophical outlook from The Joke to The Unbearable Lightness as it is expressed in the principal motifs and characters of his novels.28 Jin Kratochvíl also distances himself from Kundera bashers among the dissidents and proceeds to comment on the figure of the narrator and the play with the narrative in Kundera’s novels, both of which, according to Kratochvíl, are crucial to understanding of Kundera’s work. He concludes that because the play with the narrative is not common in the Czech literary tradition and because Kundera’s authorial narrators have been misunderstood, Kundera has not been given his due by the Czech critics at home.29 A similar view is expressed in a review of Pistorius’s samizdat book on Czech literature. According to the reviewer, “the angry reaction to Kundera’s later novels is a sign of cultural decline of the isolated Czech intellectual.”30 [pageend117]114 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al During the seventies and most of the eighties the official Czech literary journals, of course, ignored Kundera. Only in the late eighties, when Kundera’s international stature made it impossible to ignore him completely, two comments on him appeared. Not surprisingly, both writers heap heavy abuse on Kundera, but interestingly, they use some of the same criticisms the samizdat critics have leveled against Kundera, as if the official writers were incapable of formulating their own attack on Kundera. Disagreeing in every other regard, the samizdat and the official writers found a common cause in denigrating Kundera. Jaroslav Čejka, the editor-in-chief of Tvorba, the Communist Party weekly, discusses The Unbearable Lightness in his 1988 essay in Tvorba. He calls the novel “third generation kitsch,” calculated to appeal to the “so-called” sophisticated reader, while using half-truths about Czechoslovak reality, pseudo-intellectual meditations, and erotic scenes reduced to intellectualized obscenity.32 Karel Sýs was even less able to formulate Official responses The numerous reactions to Jungmann’s assessment of Kundera elicited a response from Jungmann himself. Jungmann stresses that he has been misunderstood when his attempt to differentiate Kundera’s artistic method in the later novels from that of a classical realist was taken as an unfair criticism of Kundera. Leaving many other points of the debate aside, Jungmann addresses first of all the issue of one-dimensionality of Kundera’s characters, their not being “made of flesh and blood.” He defends his previously stated opinion that Kundera’s characters increasingly have no life of their own, no possibility of inner development; they are just functions of the theme under investigation. Jungmann emphasizes, though, that he is not criticizing Kundera for the characters’ one-sided- ness. Rather, he sees it as a device that allows Kundera to explore themes he is obsessed with, such as sexual pursuit; paradoxes of love and sex, of body and soul. He further elaborates on the issue of “false authenticity” in Kundera’s later novels. He maintains that the way Kundera uses certain isolated, sensational details from Czechoslovak reality bothers not only him but many others in Czechoslovakia; Kundera simplifies, does not tell the whole story, and thus he antagonizes the native Czechs and misleads the uninformed Western readers. Jungmann allows, though, that in time this “false authenticity” will not matter, whereas other aspects of Kundera’s novels might still be interesting.31 [pageend118]Ku n d e r a ’s Fic t io n an d t h e Cz e c h Cr it ic s 115 The lucidity and precision of Kundera’s writing and the intellectual rather than poetic elegance of his art have been generally well served by his translators. Thus the Czech émigré critics’ advantage of being able to read Kundera in the original was not of major importance in interpreting and appreciation of Kundera’s art. However, the Czech critics, when writing about Kundera, generally did capitalize on their unique perspective of being formed by similar experiences with the communist state as Kundera was. This is true particularly about Liehm, Hvižďala, Hrubý, and Kosková, and to a lesser degree about other critics, such as Richterová, Chvatík, Baneijee, and Doležel, since the latter critics were primarily interested in a close textual analysis of Kundera’s works. With the exception of Jan Kresadlo, the émigré critics acknowledged Kundera’s stature as a major writer and went on to examine various aspects of his work. By their perceptive comments on themes and levels of meanings in Kundera’s art, on his philosophy and literary technique, as well as on his place in the Czech literature, the émigré critics made an important contribution to Kunderian scholarship of the last two decades. Critics at home, on the other hand, have not paid sufficient attention to Kundera’s work during the same period and generally have not given him his due. Kundera’s status as a proscribed author was certainly a partial reason for that, since only dissident critics publishing in samizdat could write about him and only very few intellectuals took the risks of becoming dissidents. When these critics did write about Kundera’s work, they often found it wanting. While they generally acknowledged the brilliance of Kundera’s literary technique, the dissidents found his play with his characters often lacking in depth. The absence of a moral dimension in Kundera’s fiction, his obsession with sexual conquest, and particularly the misrepresentation of the Czech reality in his later novels, also did not sit well with some of these critics. They charged Kundera with turning his back on Czech culture and concentrating on writing for the West instead. The roots of such harsh, extra-literary judgments of Kundera by the dissidents could be traced to the Czech literary tradition and its model of a writer as a voice of conscience of the people and a Conclusion his opinion of Kundera and so he quotes at length from Pecka’s article “Věk cynismu,” mentioned earlier.33 Fortunately, critics like these no longer have a monopoly on influencing the Czech reading public.

In addition, the dissidents were perhaps too preoccupied with their own, truly heroic struggle against the communist state, to appreciate what Kundera does well and to forgive him for not directly joining them or helping them in that struggle. The 1989 demise of communism in Czechoslovakia began a brand new chapter in Kundera’s literary fortunes in his native country. The political climate is once again favorable to writers like Kundera and publication of all his works in large printings is on the way. When Kundera’s work becomes accessible to all potential Czech readers and critics, it will be extremely interesting to see if his reputation in his native land will approximate the respect and popularity he has been enjoying in the West.

[pageend121]Ivan Klima’s Other First Loves Robert Porter The publication in March 1990 of the English translation of Klima’s Love and Garbage (Láska a smetí)1 coincided with an article in Tvorba, the leading weekly on Czech literature abroad that commented on Klima’s recent prose. One English reviewer spoke of the novel’s “somewhat uncontrolled and self-indulgent lyrical effusions” and suggested that “some of the loving superfluity” on display in the English translation “could surely have gone in the waste-paper bin.”2 The Tvorba commentator wrote: In Klima’s new novel there are excellently written passages, a series of truthful reflections on our recent past and on the situation of culture in present-day Prague, and we are given in allusive outline an agonizing love relationship, but about halfway through the book we realize that we are to expect nothing more than a new version of the old love triangle, emotion drowning in quarrels and mutual bitterness, and we are really rather disappointed. I perceive the weakness of the novel in its lack of a supporting conflict, the monotony of a single theme....3 Another English reviewer without the advantage, one suspects, of knowing the Czech original wrote: “It is rare that one meets a new literary voice of such originality and mastery in both structure and content. This, indubitably, is one.”4 My own first impressions of a lot of Klima’s prose might be as disparaging as the remarks by the first two reviewers I have quoted, though my reservations would be rather different. On a superficial level Klíma can seem sentimental, introspective and whimsical. He appears repetitive—there is frequent allusion to his childhood spent in Terezín, to his period of teaching in America and his voluntary return to Czechoslovakia in the spring of 1970, to his circumstances as a proscribed writer, a stoic witness to violations of human rights. The age-old theme of a man caught between love for his wife and love for his mistress is not confined just to Love and Garbage. It is central to A Summer Affair (Milostné léto),5 Judge of Mercy (English [pageend122]Kl íma ’s Ot h e r Fir st Lo v e s 119 translation Judge on Trial, London 1991; original Soudce z milosti)6 and plays a significant part in the short story collection My Merry Mornings {Má veselá jitra)1 and My First Loves {Moje první lásky f. Yet these criticisms have to be weighed against the comedy, the irony and the persistent sense of reality that are clearly ubiquitous in Klíma. One way of accommodating the sentimentality to the realism is to allude to the author’s unquestionable moral stance, to fall back on the simplistic attitude of the well-meaning outside observer and assume that because the author is a good man he must be a good writer. However, I think that Klíma deserves more than the benefit of the doubt, and what follows is an attempt to give him that. One of the puzzles about Klíma’s career as a prose writer is that it seems to have gone in reverse. From the grotesque fantasy of A Ship named Hope {Loď jménem Naděje)9 with its doubts and uncertainties, we come to the relatively familiar territory of love triangles and persecuted Czech intellectuals. Yet the author’s abiding interest in Kafka has grown more insistent, while his characters and situations have become more everyday. Very near the end of Love and Garbage the hero-narrator tells us: What used to fascinate me most about literature at one time was that fantasy knows no frontiers, that it is as infinite as the universe into which we may fall. I used to think that this was what fascinated and attracted me in Kafka. For him a human would be transformed into an animal and an animal into a human, dream seemed to be reality for him and, simultaneously, reality was a dream. From his books there spoke a mystery which excited me. Later I was to understand that there is nothing more mysterious, nothing more fantastic, than life itself (212-13; 248-49). For the time being, let us set aside the emotional turmoil that the hero of Love and Garbage experiences in his tortured relationship with his wife Lida and his mistress Daria, and concentrate on his other passions. Firstly, there is his regard for Kafka. For the hero, Kafka’s chief quality is his honesty {opravdovost, “truthfulness” might be a more precise, though pedantic, English rendition): Kafka endeavoured to be honest in his writing, in his profession and in his love. At the same time he realised, or at least suspected, that a person who wants to live honestly chooses torture and renunciation, a monastic life devoted to a single God, and sacrifices everything for it. He could not, at the same time, be an honest writer and an honest lover, let alone husband, though he longed to be both (182; 214). [pageend123]120 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al The Judaic tradition, which is at the back of a good deal of Kafka’s writing, is also, in muted form, to be found in Klíma. The Trial can be read in terms of the Day of Atonement, Yom Kippur, when man is expected to recognize his guilt. On that day, according to Jewish law, a man must desist from work, eating, drinking, anointing his body, indulging in sexual intercourse or wearing leather shoes. Love and Garbage is, of course, about cleaning. The hero is a disaffected intellecu- tual who takes on a temporary job sweeping the streets of Prague. However, it soon becomes apparent that the real cleaning is going on in his conscience and in his soul, as he interlaces his account of his menial occupation and his colorful workmates with reflections on God, history, language and the anguished tale of his triangular love affair. The novel’s opening paragragh talks of the people who “were supposed to look after our cleanliness. The cleanliness of our streets, of course, not the purity of our souls” (1; omitted from Czech text). The English text concludes: But Paradise cannot be fixed in an image, for paradise is the state of meeting. With God, and also with humans. What matters, of course, is that the meeting should take place in cleanliness. Paradise is, above all else, the state in which the soul feels clean (217; 253). To this extent the spirit of the novel accords well with themes that one encounters in Kafka. Yet the fabric of the novel is made up of the very things which are, by Judaic law, forbidden on the Day of Atonement; if we accept the wearing of leather shoes and anointing oneself, all the other prohibitions are infringed. The hero elects to work; the street-cleaning gang, the somewhat abstemious hero included, punctuates its shift with sessions in the pub; and the hero, without going into too much detail, candidly reports to us the extent of his sexual activities. The hero is also attracted by Kafka’s shyness (plachost) (141; 168). Though the term is used only rarely—in stark contrast to the numerous references to “honesty”—we can use it here as a shorthand for the fixation that Kafka had with his self, with his personal world. As the hero reflects, after a meeting with a rather naive foreign journalist (in the Czech text she is American (60), in the English translation French (42), who has questioned him as to why Kafka is more or less banned in Czechoslovakia: I think it would be difficult to find, in our century, many writers who were less interested in politics or public affairs than Kafka. There is no mention in his work of war or revolution, or of the ideas which may have helped to bring them about, [pageend124]Kl íma ’s Ot h e r Fir st Lo v e s 121 In his questioning Kafka stopped at the very first step, at himself, because even here he’d entered an impenetrable depth. In a world in which the intellect predominates more and more, the intellect which believes that it knows everything about the world and even more about itself, Kafka rediscovered the mysterious (111; 135-36). Klíma’s, or at least the hero’s, perception of Kafka here is important, for it suggests a clear distinction between arguably the most influential prose writer of the twentieth century and a great deal of literature in the same period which has concerned itself with mystification. Klima’s hero asserts that Kafka presents his paradoxes, enigmas and incongruities in good faith; they are to be taken at face value; there is no attempt to tease or mislead the reader. Another unusual slant on Kafka emerges shortly after the passage just quoted: I still believe that literature has something in common with hope, with a free life outside the fortress walls which, often unnoticed by us, surround us, with which moreover we surround ourselves. I am not greatly attracted to books whose authors merely portray the hopelessness of our existence, despairing of man, of our conditions, despairing over poverty and riches, over the finiteness of life and the transience of feelings. A writer who doesn’t know anything else had better keep silent. Kafka was desperate in nearly every situation of his life, and yet he was always looking for hope. When it seemed out of reach he’d put his manuscript aside and not return to it again (117; 141)." On another occasion the hero views Kafka in an utterly conventional way, “as a sacrificial victim, by his own decision... In this respect Kafka certainly anticipated the fate of the Jews in our age of upheaval” (130; 155). However, the hero feels a close affinity with Kafka in a very personal way, in the way that the two writers create images: “What tied me most firmly to life was my writing: anything I experienced would become images for me” (47; 65). Of Kafka, the hero tells us: “Although he mostly speaks of himself and although his heroes are, even in their names, avowedly himself, he yet concealed the true nature of his struggles. He was not only shy, he was so much an artist that he expressed everything he experienced in images” (133; 159). Thus it would be unseemly to consider Love and Garbage an autobiograhical work, even Later we read: just as there is nothing in his work which directly points to his Jewishness (43).10 [pageend125]122 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al though there may well be, in the minutiae, a strong autobiographical element. (However, a cautionary note: in an interview in the Slovak weekly Literárny týždenník,12 Klíma recalls how people, having read his “conspiratorial story” from My Merry Mornings, refused to believe that he in fact had not sold carp at Christmas—and that when they did believe him, they were disappointed!) There is of course nothing new in the spectacle of Czech writers claiming inspiration from Kafka, but in Klíma’s case there is perhaps more justification, since in broad outline, as opposed to the minutiae, there are biographical affinities. Kafka was a Czech Jew, writing in German, under the hegenomy of an alien Austro-Hungarian Empire. His sympathy for Czech nationalism is well attested, as are his shyness, decorum, politeness and sense of social responsibility. This last quality was most notable in his nine years of work at the Workers’ Accident Insurance Institute for the Kingdom of Bohemia, where he was well liked by superiors and subordinates, not least for his efficiency and conscientiousness. Klíma has displayed similar urbanity and decorum, despite all the harrassment during the years of “normalization.” (On one occasion in Love and Garbage the hero is thanked for his good work as a street- cleaner.) Klima’s patriotism has been unswerving yet unostentatious, and his regard for civil rights unquestionable. He has been writing in Czech in a country which has permitted, to use his hero’s term, only “Jerkish,” a language of 225 words “developed in Atlanta for mutual communication between humans and chimpanzees” (42; 61). Another of Klima’s passions, much on display in Love and Garbage, is religion. In his recent prose this feature has become increasingly salient, and it presents something of a puzzle. On one level it could be taken as straightforward conviction on the author’s part. It is not unusual for rationalists—even left-wing rationalists—to develop quasi-religious tendencies when revolutions turn sour, or, as in Klima’s case, when all intelligent thought, commmon decency and even common sense are rebuffed by the powers that be. If rational argument gets you at best nowhere, and at worst a prison sentence, religious conviction can become a very attractive alternative, even if that too invites persecution. Yet it would be difficult to square Klima’s sense of irony and skepticism, or his earlier interest in the fantastic and grotesque with any unqualified attachment to an established religion. The lengthy novel, Judge of Mercy, written between 1972 and 1985, examines many of the personal and public considerations that have [pageend126]Kl íma ’s Ot h e r Fir st Lo v e s 123 confronted the population of Czechoslovakia in the decades since the war. The hero, Adam Kindi, a high court judge, after many years in the legal profession, finds himself trapped by all manner of conflicting loyalties—not least, and perhaps somewhat surprisingly, by the pressure exerted by his own conscience. The narrative is broken up by a number of flashbacks, all entitled “When we drink from the Lethe,” and in these we see that in the past Kindi, though able to distinguish truth and lies, was able to suppress his own urges towards human decency in order to survive. He and his family suffered under the Nazi occupation. Then under communist rule his father was unjustly imprisoned for two years. The son is now supposed to make things better, but this proves impossible when he is given his first “political” case. He sentences a shopkeeper to three and a half years for hoarding his stock—his own stock. He acts according to directives and not as a result of his own investigations and judgement. The inhabitants of the provincial town where this occurs are more aware of the true situation and stone his car as he leaves. Yet years later, when the novel opens, the hero is confronted with a very different kind of case. Karel Kozlík is being tried for murder. He has a proven record of violence and crime. He is uneducated and has had medical problems. He has made a full confession (which he later retracts) that he gassed his landlady after a row with her, accidently killing her granddaughter as well. In addition to being a perfect husband and family man—at least at the start of the story—Kindi is keen to see the abolition of capital punishment. His unpublished article on the subject eventually costs him his job. Kozlík is eventually sentenced to death. Kindi’s professional problems are compounded by the fact that his brother lives in Britain, though he does return to Czechoslovakia towards the end of the novel. This very brief outline of part of the plot demonstrates that moral considerations are persistently overidden by the prevailing political climate and there is no scope for personal conscience. Of course, to a large extent there is nothing new in the portrayal of this all-pervasive corruption of the individual. Yet Klima’s treatment of the theme is all the more poignant for its analysis of a man whose profession should damn him from the start in the eyes of the outside observer, gains him the reader’s sympathy. His professional problems go hand in hand with complications in his personal life, and all this leads into considerations of emigration, patriotism and—especially for the hero’s wife—religion. The religious dimension frequently insinuates itself into Klima’s prose, [pageend127]124 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al and it is an open question as to whether we should accept it purely for what it is, or whether we should attach a subtle element of irony to it. There may well be authorial support and compassion for Alena Kindlová as she “prays every evening, for herself that she may find the strength to be humble and learn how to be good... for Adam... for her children., for her ex-lover, for her long-standing friend Maruš... and for that murderer [Kozlík] whom she had never set eyes on” (672). However, Klima’s business is as much with self-deception as it is with establishing a spiritual and morally coherent dimension. Three hundred years before, the hero’s family had been evangelical, but had converted to the Jewish faith in the wake of Bílá Hora, in the hope of securing their future. Consequently, the family is sent to Terezín during the war. As a young man he is approached by the church and he reads the Bible. However, he has a special predilection for Rita Hayworth’s bust, and only when he falls desperately in love does he read the Bible with avid enthusiasm (138-141). A number of the other characters in Judge of Mercy also have firm convictions of one kind or another, not least the hero’s father who is a communist. His “only friend” (200) defects after the war to West Germany, leaving behind an edition of Plato in which he has left a slip of paper. It reads: “What does the good and happiness of man depend on? According to Socrates on rational activity, on remembering, on correct thinking and on true judgements” (201). Adam’s father’s left-wing views prove tragically naive, and his friend’s admiration of Greek philosophers would appear to beg a number of questions. “Correct thinking” (správné myšlení) has a whiff of the central committee about it. His brother’s letters and phone calls from abroad are presented to the reader as frivolous and misplaced, given the pressures that the hero finds himself under, but ultimately the brother returns to his homeland, despite all manner of warnings not to. However, when Adam writes to his brother, he highlights what he sees as the two kinds of exile: “You can find yourself away from home and lose the possibilty of returning. But you can also desert yourself and not manage to return” (562). Ivan Klima’s career has shown that he is not an exile in either of these senses. Towards the end of the novel Adam, his brother Hanuš and friend Matěj bike to a church reputed to have been built by one man in just two and a half years. Such is the emphasis on this achievement that it can only be taken to stand as a summary of the repeated hints throughout the work that the only real key to life is within oneself, not within a given system. [pageend128]Kl íma ’s Ot h e r Fir st Lo v e s 125 Undoubtedly the author’s preferences are for religious and cultural values—retelling the stories of Tom Sawyer and The Pickwick Papers, or listening to others talking about books while he was in Terezín as a boy are experiences that stay with the hero more vividly than do the horrors of the war period. Yet the muted ironies running throughout the novel militate against the advocacy of any prescribed value system, and rather point to the integrity of the self, with all its contradictions. In Judge of Mercy there is a good deal of evil, but there are precious few villains. The religious question is similarly pronounced in Love and Garbage, but a close examination of it reveals that, once again, it should not necessarily be taken at face value. One of the hero’s workmates is Rada, a man who has had a variety of jobs over the years, but who in fact trained as a priest. At one point he shows the hero a book concerned with the cult of personality; he quotes from it briefly and attention is drawn to the cover design. The implication of the passage is clearly that man is nothing more than garbage, and the book is a reminder of how “we used to deify ourselves and physical matter” (71; 92). Later on Rada confides to the hero that he attended a religious festival at Svatá Hora that attracted some 30,000 people, mainly youngsters (102-03; 126-27).13 Though this strikes a chord with the hero, his attention is momentarily switched to an exhibit in an artist’s window—there is a figure which at first he takes to be Don Quixote and then realizes it is the fourth horseman of the Apocalypse, and he reflects: ... man can behave arrogantly not only by deifying his own ego and proclaiming himself as the finest flower of matter and life, but equally when he proudly believes that he has correctly comprehended the incomprehensible or uttered the unutterable, or when he thinks up infallible dogmas and with his intellect, which wants to believe, reaches out into regions before which he should lower his eyes and stand in silence (105; 129). Thus, for all his sincerity and sensitivity, Rada is found wanting. Earlier in the novel, just before the hero’s encounter with the irritatingly naive and self-confident foreign jounalist he quotes at some length from Revelation (41; 60). The passage is from Chapter XX, and is primarily concerned with the defeat of Satan who “shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth.” Obviously the “fire and brimstone” tone of this passage can serve as a mockery of the journalist, who has little chance of even understanding the truth, let alone passing it on to the world at large, but it is no less a piece of self-mockery [pageend129]126 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al on the narrator’s part. His own attempts to ensure the victory of truth are, like Kafka’s, grounded in reflective self-analysis and self-effacement, not in fire and brimstone. This passage, together with several other references to the Apocalypse, takes on even more significance, when one recalls the circumstances under which the last Book of the New Testament was written. Though Revelation purports to have been written by John, the “beloved disciple” of Christ, Biblical scholars generally agree that the work is a compilation by several unknown authors, and was produced during the last quarter of the first century A.D. This was a time of extreme persecution of the early Christians by the Romans, and the Book of Revelation was designed to reinforce the true faith. The relevance of such “morale-boosting” for a beleaguered intelligentsia, or indeed for anyone trying to cling to a set of personal principles, in a society “normalized” by Brezhnev’s tanks, needs no exegesis. Another aspect of the religious question in the novel occurs in the discourses on Paradise. When the hero first becomes emotionally involved with Daria, he recalls his family tree. His maternal grandfather believed in the Messiah, but purely in terms of the coming socialist revolution, and urged the hero to work for a paradise on earth and for social justice. However, one night the hero hears his grandfather praying to God in a language the boy does not understand (presumable Hebrew), and then he realizes that “the depth of the human soul is unfathomable” (14; 29). Later, after a quarrel with Daria, we are treated to a disquisition on Paradise in a passage that has strong overtones of Judaic mystical literature (possibly the Zohar?) (172-73; 203-04). Given the context that this account of the Garden of Eden finds itself in—a row between a man and his mistress—the emphasis on specifics (wine, honey, balsam, milk, five hundred thousand kinds of fruit, the three ages of man, the seven categories into which the just and faithful are divided), is nothing short of comic. In general then, the religious passages in Love and Garbage and Judge of Mercy are offered to the reader in a spirit of affectionate skepticism. The author is only too aware of the spiritual dimension in man, but sees the dangers inherent in any attempt to deify man’s spiritual yearnings. Rada’s Catholicism, grandfather’s admixture of judaism and socialism—we may even include here father’s communist ideals, which bring so much persecution from the communist rulers—Christ’s ultimate victory, as recounted in Revelation, or the innumerable delights of Paradise, as [pageend130]Kl íma ’s Ot h e r Fir st Lo v e s 127 detailed in the Zohar, all these undoubtedly appeal to the hero, but he knows too much of the street, or more particularly of the gutter, to be taken in by them. Towards the end of Love and Garbage the hero essays a more positive appraisal of the paradise concept: Man dreamed of returning, after his death, to God’s garden or of fusing with the universe or of returning to the creator in a different shape. He surmised that at least his soul would get close to God. But over the years as the human race grew older and memories became confused, man exchanged the idea of blissful innocence for that of happiness through pleasure. Ageing man confused the soul with the body and believed he could enter paradise in his lifetime. As soon as he succumbed to the old man’s error of believing he could return to the state of childlike innocence he actually entered the age of foolishness and totally succumbed to it in his senile childishness. Man thinks he’s building paradise by inventing motor-cars, aircraft, plastics, nuclear power stations or underwater tunnels, whereas in reality he invents and brings about the Apocalypse (207). In the Czech edition the second paragraph of the extract quoted above runs roughly as follows in my translation: But over the centuries memories became dimmer—mankind now resembles an old man who has confused his soul with his body, and has foolishly come to believe that he can enter paradise while still alive, and can build it on Earth. So he builds magnificent things, subdues nature, destroys matter, produces and uses drugs, permits and excuses himself every act, forgives himself every perfidy, jumps into every bed in lustful expectation, rushes from experience to experience, from pleasure to pleasure, he doesn’t even have time to stop and ask himself what it’s all for, what kind of paradise he is actually heading for. In fact he is not bringing paradise nearer, but the apocalypse (245). While the gist of each version remains the same, one might detect in the former a slightly more pointed attack on the economic policies of the great powers, and in the latter a note of censure at once more general and more self-castigating—the hero’s guilt feelings at his marital infidelity will never desert him. It would be simplistic to attribute such discrepancies between the two texts to the different target audiences. A more likely explanation is, as James Naughton has suggested, the author’s unease.14 Klíma, like his beloved Kafka, strives to be honest and not to go beyond his self. At the same time he admits all manner of influences in his quest. (In Love and Garbage we find allusions to Budha and Kierkegaard, along with the other points of reference discussed here in more detail.) Klíma is only too aware that he is an intellectual and a realist, not [pageend131]128 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al a saint. It is therefore fitting that we should address another first love of his: the incongruous, all those things that are not, despite the best efforts, amenable to rational explanation. Klíma, like Kafka, insists on the mysterious not for its own sake, but in the belief that in the baffling world of today it is the only honest thing one can do. Hence we have a streetcleaning gang comprising an intellectual who takes on the job for no real reason; a coarse, wrinkled woman with a good figure, always telling the most lurid stories, but also possessing some genuine sensitivity, whom the hero nicknames “Venus”; a “sea captain” who goes in for the most outlandish scientific experiments and ends up in a psychiatric unit; a foreman full of the most engaging war reminiscences; Rada, a religious man, who has been to prison for his beliefs but whose brother has become a Party member; and a young man who can no longer play jazz because of a liver disorder and who disappears before the hero can pass on to him a drug that may help him. Moreover, if incongruity is the very stuff of everyday life, it will certainly find a place in Klíma’s world of art. As the street-cleaning gang makes its way through Prague, it regularly passes an artist’s studio, where a constantly changing exhibition is to be seen in the window. The first time the hero sees it, he is shocked at the depiction of a hanged man. Towards the end of the novel, the artist makes a personal appearance wearing a fool’s cap and bells, a sackcloth, a laurel wreath and carrying a bunch of what the hero takes to be deadly nightshade. The hero “in his fool’s orange vest” identifies with him (192; 225). The final exhibition is of the street-cleaning gang itself, and this time the hero is convinced that the resident artist has ceded his place to a sculptress (Daria, no doubt): I realised that all these faces were, in their likeness, both real and unreal. They seemed younger and more attractive, as though nothing of the working of time or life had marked them... I was still looking for myself among the sculptures, but I didn’t see my own face; there was only a tall pillar, as if hewn from stone, but I couldn’t see its top through the window (208-09; 242-43). Thus the self remains a mystery, but a closer knowledge of it can be acquired through the interaction of the artist’s sensibilities and the apparent banality and sordidness of life—love and garbage are mutually dependent. In February 1990 Philip Roth visited Klíma in Prague, and wrote a lengthy report of his encounter with his old friend for The New York Review of Books.15 In Roth’s view, Love and Garbage is “a wonderful [pageend132]Kl íma ’s Ot h e r Fir st Lo v e s 129 book... a nice antidote to all that magic in magic realism... The book is permeated by an intelligence whose tenderness colors everything and is unchecked and unguarded by irony. Klíma is, in this regard, Milan Kundera’s antithesis.” It may well be the case that the irony in Klíma is not as cutting as in Kundera, but our discussion has shown that it is most certainly there. It bears witness to the writer’s special relationship to reality and it transforms Klíma’s lyricism—which some have found so uncomfortable—into the very tenderness that Roth so accurately identifies.

[pageend134]The Historical Prose of Vladimír Neff Peter Drews Vladimir Neff has been one of the most successful prose writers with the Czech reading public during the last thirty years. By 1989 his pentalogy Marriages of Convenience (Sňatky z rozumu, 1957-1963)1 had been published in five complete editions totalling almost 1.1 million copies, and his Kukaň trilogy (1973-1980)2 had achieved by 1984 three editions with approximately half a million copies sold.3 Yet literary critics and historians did not take too much interest in his works. One of the few positive exceptions is the monograph of Bohuslav Hoffmann written in close collaboration with Neff himself.4 This might indicate a certain dislike of his novels on the part of the critics, not only due to the fact that Neff in his works rarely comments directly on current political and cultural problems (still less in favor of the positions of the Communist party), but perhaps more because he purposely includes in his novels elements of so-called “light reading,” thus seemingly stressing their entertaining character to the detriment of “higher” moral and esthetic aims. The following study will try to examine to what extent such an attitude may be regarded as justified. At first glance, Marriages of Convenience presents itself as a family-chronicle which, in the manner of Zola’s Rougon-Macquart or Galsworthy’s Forsyte Saga (with which it has been, though very superficially, compared)5 describes the history of two Czech bourgeois families (the Boms and the Nedobyls) against the background of the political, economic and cultural development of Bohemia between roughly 1848 and 1945. It thereby follows a scheme hinted at by Neff already in his partly autobiographical sketches, In Front of the Counter and behind the Counter (Před pultem a za pultem, 1940), according to which each family history is marked by the succession of three different generations: those of the founders, the preservers and the undertakers.6 Hence he concentrates on depicting the rise and fall of representatives of the Czech upper middle class, contrasted with the slow but steady rise of the [pageend135]132 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al working class (exemplified in the fortunes of the Pecold and Vaculík families). Neff thus seems to comply with one of the postulates of Socialist Realism, i.e. that fiction should demonstrate the role of positive historical forces. Moreover, in presenting history as the pre-history of the present, his pentalogy even appears as an illustration of the views Lukács developed in 1955 in his lengthy study on the historical novel, Der historische Roman. Finally, Neff stresses aspects of patriotism and the building of a new society, at least as far as his image of Czech society during the sixties and seventies of the 19th century is concerned, so that we might label his pentalogy as a good example of the “construction novel” of Czech socialist fiction. Contemporary critics indeed often pointed out these features as belonging amongst Neffs outstanding achievements, though they sometimes regretted that he did not show the growing importance of the workers’ movement clearly enough. The reading public, on the other hand, took much more delight in other aspects of the novels, mainly the lively presentations of love-affairs and crime, set within the charming atmosphere of old-time Prague. The protagonists, generally well- contrasted characters, are easily understandable. From this point of view the pentalogy is similar to those novels of light reading which may be without great difficulty adapted to the screen, as is manifested by the successful television version of the first three parts, produced in 1968 by František Filip. Nevertheless, the work does not wholly fit into either kind of fiction, because the narrator intentionally discloses the basic principles of both forms of literature in a very ironical way and thus at times even ridicules them. This applies not only to his often sarcastic comments on historical developments or his treatment of minor events as much more important than others, but also to his interventions in the course of the action, all of which emphasizes how everything going on in the novels depends on his own auctorial will and not on some inner causality. He often brings actions to an abrupt end, his protagonists falling victim to a sudden accident or committing suicide, and he closes episodes by telling the reader “but that is another story, which does not belong to this part of our narrative.”7 Sometimes he purposely contradicts himself: “Here we have touched upon a dark point which is in apparent contradiction to what was said initially.”8 These examples hint at intentions of the author which can be perhaps best discerned by a closer examination of historical facts and their function [pageend136]Th e Hist o r ic al Pr o se o f Ne f f 133 in the pentalogy. As is generally known, Neff based his story to a large extent on the biographies of members of his own family, at least as far as the basic figures are concerned.9 For instance, the main events in the life of Jan Bom correspond to those of Neffs grandfather Jan who, like him, was bom in 1832, and lived for a long time in Vienna as a (later well-paid) shop-assistant. In 1863 he opened in Prague a shop, selling fancy-goods which soon prospered,10 became known as a financial patron of cultural and educational institutions,11 and died in 1906. Likewise, Neffs grandmother on his father’s side, Marie Halová, was, like Hana Bomová, bom in Hradec Králové, the eldest daughter of a provincial court councillor who in 1866 retired on failing to achieve promotion and went to live in Prague. Her sister Hana (re-named Bětuše) actually worked in Neffs shop as a bookkeeper and brought about Marie’s acquaintance with Jan Neff, whom she married in 1873, after his first wife, Isabella Doležalová, had died. Moreover, his grandmother on his mother’s side, Amelie Stuchlíková, is partly portrayed in the person of the “merry widow” Marie Nedobylová, and the life of Theodore Nedobyl to a large degree resembles the biography of Neffs uncle Alexis Stuchlík (even including his marriage to a Jewess). Finally, the relations between Ladislav Bom, Babila Bomová and their son Cyril appear as a sometimes sarcastic, but not too unreal caricature of the atmosphere in which Vladimir Neff himself grew up, not to mention the autobiographical traits in Cyril Bom’s life as well. This factual basis has been mostly drawn from information of non-scholarly sources, family oral tradition, Neff’s own recollections, and personal memoirs, as for instance the diary of his great-aunt Louisa Hálová. On the other hand, scholarly sources like the longer article written by Táborský, are mentioned in a way which indicates that the narrator has certain doubts about their reliability: thus he tells the reader that his own presentation of Jan Bom’s salon of the 1860s purposely differs from its treatment in Taborský’s study.12 However, even the facts themselves have been very often substantially changed without any apparent necessity. Thus, Martin Nedobyl (of whose counterpart, Alois Stuchlík, Neff knew practically nothing, except the basic dates of his life) is shown as a greedy entrepreneur, which in reality he surely was not, and in the end he falls victim to a fatal accident, whereas Stuchlík himself died of cancer. Neffs presentation of the character of the councillor Hácha also largely differs from his portrayal in his daughter’s diary, as the author himself admitted: she “wrote down [pageend137]134 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al her narrative on two pages of the manuscript, and she in no way suspected the tragedy of disappointed human ambition which is hidden behind this occurrence ... I tried to decipher the truth of the event.”13 Besides, Neff displays a predilection for rendering at length details which to our normal experience appear grotesque or even quite unreal. This applies for example to the sign-board above Bom’s shop written (with some inaccuracy) in several languages, which characterizes him as a Slavophile.14 It applies also to Theodore Nedobyl’s door-plate “Maestro zpěvu,”15 or the then famous “Morrison’s pills” which in the Stuchlík family were used to cure every kind of disease.16 Likewise, the role of Antonín Dvořák giving piano-lessons to Hana Bomová strikes one as rather improbable,17 as does Cyril Bom’s attempt to continue the translation of a work of light fiction without having to deal with the original.18 Facts are thus at times transformed into seemingly fictitious elements, whose ambiguous status between reality and fiction is in some cases even underlined by the author himself, who for example only slightly changes the names of actual persons, such as Isabella Doležalová (Liza Tolarová) or Hala (Hácha). In the same way, “Morrison’s pills” turn up as “Harrison’s pills.” Similar devices can be discerned in Neff’s treatment of familiar historical persons or events. He likes to make use of non-scholarly informal material, such as political pamphlets or newspaper articles which betray an openly subjective point of view. Detailed descriptions of fashions and furniture are for instance taken directly from the catalog of a well-known department store,19 and the Austrian emperor Franz Joseph I is presented in the memoirs of his last valet, which the editor in her foreword explicitly describes as based on mere facts, unlike those accounts which disguise their partiality by an ostensibly scholarly approach.20 As to political events and their effect on the course of the fictional action, the narrator unambiguously asserts that history has always been dominated by war, with at best only a change in the theaters of war.21 Accordingly, the historical background to the family history is mostly represented by wars—those of 1859, 1866, 1870-1871, 1914-1918, 1936-1939, and 1939-1945. Yet these events are normally perceived by the protagonists from a considerable distance, so that life in Prague does not seem to be too much affected by them. Besides, the narrator himself does not portray them directly, preferring to present them by means of fictitious letters (in the case of the Spanish Civil war),22 or mention them [pageend138]Th e Hist o r ic al Pr o se o f Ne f f 135 in only half a sentence (the battle of Königgratz),23 or even omit them altogether (World War I). Hence, the most important political events appear at times virtually non-existent, a paradox which is matched by the contrast between the leaders of nations, who either do not turn up on the scene at all or are ridiculed as losers (such as the emperors Franz Joseph I and Napoleon III), and persons of the Bom and Nedobyl families who in an equally ridiculous way profit from these events (like Jan Bom in speculating on the stock-market). Likewise, political events in Bohemia turn into mere—though at times tragic—farces, as for example the Omladina case of 1894, which was regarded by the authorities as a serious conspiracy against the government, although in reality it existed only in the minds of certain agents of the secret police. The same is true of the “revolution” of 1918, where the “conspirators” try to obtain assurances from Vienna that they are indeed allowed to revolt. Similarly, the atmosphere in Prague of October 1918 is partly presented from the point of view of the juvenile novel Smashed chains (Rozdrčené okovy, 1918) written by Neff at the age of 9!, so implausible a fact that Neff himself on several occasions emphasized that the manuscript really existed.24 The cultural atmosphere of Bohemia often appears in the same way as a kind of farce, in which the narrator seems mainly preoccupied with grotesque details, discussions of items of a very dubious value, or the trashy phenomena of ephemeral “light art.” Thus Náprstek is presented as comparing the ideas of Goethe to the operating principles of a steam- engine, which he views as a work of poetry.25 And Náprstek’s “American Club for Ladies” is portrayed as an institution where people indiscriminately debate topics ranging from political events in Mexico to Darwin, Brahmanism and mycology.26 Still more ridiculed is the Ruch literary movement with its poet Sládek, which—transplanted from 1868 to 1864—is here headed by a mediocre fictitious poet and follower of Schopenhauer called Dynbir (dünn bier, “weak beer,” sládek, “brewmast- er”). The 1883 controversy about the famous forged manuscripts of early Czech literature is turned into a debate on virtually non-existent phenomena, and the artistic scene of the turn of the century up to around 1930 is shown as dominated by amateurs and producers of frivolous light entertainment. This applies also to the protagonists of the Bom and Nedobyl families, whose lives are guided by principles derived from their reading of second-rate fiction or pseudo-philosophical literature. Hana Bomová, for [pageend139]136 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al instance, indulges in reading light French novels, and Liza Tolarová improves her knowledge of foreign words by reading the Unterhaltungsblatt für die feine Damenwelt.27 Jan Bom on numerous occasions even tries to behave according to the rules set up by Franz Ebhardt’s Der gute Ton in Allen Lebenslagen, a once very successful compendium of good manners which first appeared in Vienna in 1881 (and which in the context of the fictitious action constitutes a deliberate anachronism). In purposely presenting a mixture of facts and fiction, the narrator thus creates a world of his own, which nevertheless claims to be as real as the world of our normal experience, the only difference being that the narrated world indeed is a closed one, whilst “normal” reality is open to further development.28 This corresponds to Neffs own ideas regarding literature, especially as he expressed them in his Philosophical Dictionary. In rejecting the Platonic point of view which subordinates poetry to philosophy, Neff insists on the right of the author not to imitate nature, but to create in accordance with nature. The work of art therefore does not present ideas, but appears as an “autonomous expression of the supersensual in the sensual world.” It thus depends only on the will of the author who is not bound by any rules of esthetics or logic, all the more so because our human world itself is not based on rules (and still less on ideas) which can be discerned.29 The result is a very pessimistic view of society and history,30 whose negative aspects can only be overcome by ridicule (in a way not unlike Gogol), and by creating a free world of fantasy according to the individual nature of the author. This is best shown in the ironical presentation of the image of the “Royal charioteer,” taken from Plato’s dialogue Phaedrus, where it designates the soul as a charioteer who—spurred by sensual excitement and spiritual desire—tries to direct two horses running in different directions.31 This image is further developed by the fictitious amateur-philosopher Schonfeld as follows: the charioteer, holding the reins of causality, directs the pair of horses by means of his reason between the two poles of sensual excitement and spiritual desire, having in his hand the word-term as his sceptre, wearing an ermine-coat of smiles and a crown made of dreams.32 For Cyril Bom, this is nothing but ridiculous: “But according to what the world looks nowadays, the charioteer let slip the reins out of his hands, he fell from the chariot, and his pair of horses rushes on like Gogol’s famous and dreadful troika, nobody knows where and why and into which abyss.”33 He concludes that in our times terms have lost their contents, men have forgotten how to smile and to dream, [pageend140]Th e Hist o r ic al Pr o se o f Ne f f 137 and are thus helpless like the charioteer, unable to live freely in their own world. This criticism of Plato’s ideas might appear as a plea for the Sophist teaching, which is based on the gift of speech as a means of persuasion, regardless of any kind of ideas.34 And indeed, Neff very often makes use of sophistry to question any given reality. The only (and fundamental) difference, however, is that he does not do it just for the sake of entertaining (and thus earning himself a living), but because he seems convinced that entertainment in itself may serve the higher purpose of making this world of ours more bearable. Entertainment in this sense is also the aim of the Kukaň trilogy, which describes the adventures of Petr Kukaň z Kukaně (Peter the Hatching- Basket of Hatching-Basket) during the first third of the 17th century. While mostly serving important historical personalities, including Pope Paul V, the French king Louis XIII and the Turkish sultan Mustapha I, Kukaň tries to further justice and truth, but always fails because he falls victim to intrigues, and consequently he does not cause anything more than actually happened in history. Neff chose in this particular case the genre of the picaresque novel, as his hero is a “servant of many masters” who, all over central Europe and the Mediterranean, gets into affairs of love and crime, which remind the reader of other similar works, such as (especially as far as the third volume is concerned) Grimmelshausen’s Der abenteuerliche Simplicis- simus and his Lebensbeschreibung der Landstortzerin Courage. From the latter novel Neff borrowed the name of the “beautiful sorceress” Libuše Kuráž,35 and the episode of the “Order of the Veritarians” resembles Grimmelshausen’s tale of the “fraternity of the Merodes.”36 Moreover, the stylistic elements of the author’s ironical and often exaggerated speech are much the same as Grimmelshausen’s. Another important model was provided by the novels of Alexandre Dumas père. Thus, the name of the French officer Tréville has been borrowed from Dumas’ Three Musketeers, whereas Kukaň’s imprisonment in the Chateau d’lf and his temporary pseudonym, Count of Monte Chiara, remind us of Dumas’ The Count of Monte Christo. In addition, components like the motif of the double or scenes of sorcery place the trilogy in the vicinity of the Gothic novel, and the piratical adventures resemble light reading matter (and even films) of more recent times.37 Nevertheless, Neff borrowed all these elements as mere signals to indicate a certain relationship to these works, which at the same time are [pageend141]138 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al parodied by exaggerating their stylistic and thematic approach. In fact, none of these persons, events or places appear in Neffs trilogy under the same or similar circumstances as in the original works. The same is true as far as historical personalities are concerned, because all of them too have been taken out of their historical context. For instance, the narrator does not present any of the historically attested activities of Pope Paul V; he even affirms that his only merit was to wrongly prevent St. Peter’s in Rome from being built according to the plans of Michelangelo.38 Likewise, Sultan Mustapha I of Turkey is shown as a crypto-catholic who writes a subservient letter to the Pope39; the real Wallenstein allegedly died in 1633, while it was his double who fell victim to murder in 1634. This purposely non-scholarly approach is underlined by the utilization of non-scholarly, but nevertheless authentic literature such as passages taken from books on alchemy40 or contemporary descriptions of Wallenstein’s retinue.41 Neff indeed did not want to present historical reality, which he at times even regards as being of no importance in the course of the fictional events.42 He instead concentrates on showing that everything depends upon the narrator, who handles persons and events like puppets, who wholly disregards temporal relations in making actions take place allegedly within one year, while contradicting himself by telling the reader that between certain events there elapsed several years,43 and who intermingles past and present in his speech by mixing archaisms of the implied period with modem Czech colloquialisms, including fashionable English words of today. The narrator again creates a world of his own, which is as fragile as the surrounding world, being based on speech forms serving more to conceal problems in the manner of sophistry than to solve them. This is already indicated in the title of the first volume Queens Don’t Have Legs which simply means: there are things we are not allowed to mention. In the same way, Kukaň often tries to evade problems by speaking of them at length without getting to the point, as he does for instance in discussing the question of the identity of words and meanings, when the Pope in fact simply asked him who he was.44 But he is nonetheless aware of what he is doing, and so he tells Wallenstein (not without self-irony): “Speech is for us indispensable to conceal unpleasant realities caused by our own speech, we make use of our speech wrongly in order to appease people who are justly disquieted... Direct, just and natural relations between men can do without speech. Speech is in no way an instrument of truth, [pageend142]Th e Hist o r ic al Pr o se o f Ne f f 139 because nobody wants to hear the truth, but of lying and pretending, not an instrument for the challenge of a hero, but for the shouting of catchpoles, not an instrument of consolation, but of derision... By means of speech we first of all chatter, tattle, gossip and talk too much, which, as I am becoming aware of with disgust, is what I am doing just now ”45 From this point of view, Neffs novels serve two different aims. First of all, they facilitate escapism by helping the reader to reach a world of fantasy where he at least for a time can feel himself free. In this regard, Neff has a great predilection for light reading, which is easier to understand by a larger segment of the public, and which better complies with the function of escaping the problems of the reality of the world around us. Neff even has openly admitted that he enjoys reading not only the novels of Victor Hugo, André Maurois, Romain Rolland, Emile Zola, Alois Jirásek or Henryk Sienkiewicz, but also those of Alexandre Dumas père, Jules Verne, H.G. Wells or Karl May, as well as tales about Arsene Lupin, Buffalo Bill and Nick Carter.46 On the other hand, serious light reading should not just stop at the point of entertainment. It can also serve to identify the real problems of our world, especially those concerning the uncertainty of human existence. Consequently, the narrator of Neffs novels always aims at destroying (though in a most entertaining way, by means of irony) the world he has just built up with his words. Neff thus follows a line already indicated in his short novel People in Togas (Lidé v tógách, 1937), a line which to a large extent corresponds with Karel Čapek’s mode of skepticism, especially as displayed in his short stories and novels from the late 1920s onwards. And though they are not openly concerned with political problems, Neff’s novels still contain much indirect social and political criticism, especially in the area of political language.

Th e Pr ag u e Spr in g : A Mix e d Le g ac y. Ed. by Jiří Pehe. (New York: Freedom House, 1988). 223 p. (ISBN 0-9320-8827-9). The two books under review deal with the Prague Spring of 1968. Neither book is a systematic historical account of that stirring event, however. Pithart’s book ranges over the whole story of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ) since World War II—the party’s ruthless seizure of power in 1948, consolidation of power, progressive internal decay, the attempt to reform itself cut short by the Soviet-led intervention in 1968, and “normalization,” that is return to Community orthodoxy. The book ends in 1978, ten years after the Prague Spring and eleven years before the Gentle Revolution. Pithart, who at present is the prime minister of the Czech Republic of Czechoslovakia, was born in “Red” Kladno in 1941 into a family of dedicated Communists. His good Communist pedigree opened the gates for him to a career under the Communist regime. Until 1968, he pursued an academic career, then worked as a journalist, and finally (after Charter ’77) as a manual laborer. He published this book in 1980, first in a samizdat edition under the pseudonym Sládeček. It has been re-issued several times since then under his own name. It is still well-worth reading. Pithart is a brilliant analyst of Czech politics (he does not concern himself with Slovak politics, except when it intersects with the Czech, since he regards the Slovaks as a distinct people, with a history, culture and worldview of its own). Although he was originally a convinced Marxist, he began to doubt the dogma and eventually discarded it altogether. His book is free of stereotypes, shibboleths and taboos of any kind. He is critical, not only of orthodox Communists (e.g., Novotny, Bil’ak) but also of the Communist reformists (e.g., Dubček, Černík), who, he felt, wanted only to reform and save the party but were not concerned with the Czech people or the Czechoslovak Republic as a whole. By its polemical nature, the book created quite a stir at home as well as among exiles. It would be interesting to know whether now, when Pithart holds a high responsible government position, he still upholds the same views as in the book. The Prague Spring: A Mixed Legacy is not as provocative and interesting a book as Osmašedesátý. It is a collection of fourteen articles mostly by witnesses of the Prague Spring, who subsequently went into exile. Their views are, consequently, affected by foreign influences. The articles are unrelated. Some are [pageend146]Bo o k Re v ie w s 143 documented, but mostly they are not. The book contains short biographies of the authors and an index (unlike Pithart’s book). Although the articles are individually valuable, they do not offer a rounded picture of the Prague Spring. To gather that, one must still go to H. Gordon Skilling’s massive Czechoslovakia’s Interrupted Revolution. Vic t o r Ma ma t e v University of Georgia Athens Cz e c h o sl o v ak ia: An v il o f t h e Co l d War . By John O. Crane and Sylvia Crane. (New York: Praeger, 1991). 352 p. (ISBN 0-275-93577-9). This is a remarkable book that combines history with recollections and personal observations, implanting at the same time the sense of immediacy and relevance for contemporary events. The authors of the book are members of the distinguished American family whose relationship with Czechoslovakia commenced in 1896 when Charles R. Crane, president of the Chicago-based Crane Company and a connoisseur of Russia, stopped off in Prague to call on a university professor known for his interest in Slavic studies, Tomáš G. Masaryk. The two men became instant friends, and destiny forged unbreakable ties between the two families. Before the First World War, by courtesy of the Cranes, Masaryk’s eldest daughter Alice completed her studies in Chicago. In 1906, Masaryk’s second son, Jan, came to America and was offered work at the Crane Valve Company in Bridgeport, Connecticut. During the war, Charles R. Crane and his son Richard, who both became avid supporters of the Czechoslovak cause, introduced Tomáš G. Masaryk to President Wilson. After the war, Richard Crane was appointed the first diplomatic representative of the United States in Prague. His brother John, the co-author of the present book, served as a press secretary to President Masaryk in the early twenties. And his sister Frances married (and later divorced) Jan Masaryk. Frances was Jan Masaryk’s wife during his diplomatic assignment in London: the social events offered by the Czechoslovak Legation at that time were frequented by the biggies of London’s political, financial and cultural universe. The credentials of John 0. Crane (1899-1982) and his wife Sylvia, who lives in Princeton, New Jersey, to narrate the story of Czechoslovakia in the twentieth century, are impeccable. Both can be credited with intimate knowledge of events and people. John and Sylvia were close to Jan Masaryk, and Sylvia was involved in the chapter of the Czechoslovak history preceding the “velvet revolution:” she actively supported the Charter ’77 movement and communicated with its principal actors. [pageend147]144 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al Their book is a story of Czechoslovak statehood and its fortunes and misfortunes. It traces the independence movement and rightly places its genuine origins in the trenches of the Czechoslovak Legion in Russia. It narrates the story of Masaryk’s struggle to obtain recognition of Czechoslovak independence in the country which really mattered—the United States of America. And it shows rare understanding for Eduard Beneš’s predicament at the time of Munich. The wartime period is recorded briefly. The focus is on the reconstitution of Czechoslovak statehood after 1945. In the authors’ view, the plight of Czechoslovakia began in 1946 when the Cold War started. The post-World War II period is almost exclusively centered on the fate of Jan Masaryk. Jan Masaryk will be remembered as a politician who, through regular broadcasts from London, reaching millions of enslaved people, challenged the inhuman ideology of the Third Reich, keeping hope alive. His principal weapon was the argument of humanism, expressed in simple words that were filled so overwhelmingly with significance that they became the source of strength for those who had to bear the brunt of the suffering. During the war, Jan Masaryk combined with Eduard Beneš in proposing a postwar world based on a decentralized and disarmed German confederation, with regional federations throughout Europe which would eventually merge into a federation of Europe, including Russia. His main concern was to build a structure of postwar relationships that would bring together the two worlds on whose crossroads his own country was unhappily situated: Germany and Russia. He increasingly saw Central Europe as the democratic go-between capable of providing conciliatory assistance, should the need arise. (His message was not missed in Moscow: in May 1968, during the confrontation between Andrey Gromyko, the Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Jiří Hájek, his Czechoslovak counterpart, Gromyko arrogantly declared that “Czechoslovakia is no bridge between Europe and the Soviet Union, as Jan Masaryk wanted to see her, but an inseparable part of the socialist commonwealth” obliged to follow the Soviet Union’s lead.) The Soviet Union was Jan Masaryk’s chief predicament. He had to suffer many indignities from the Soviets’ hands. At the conference in San Francisco in 1945, where the United Nations was founded, Molotov forced Jan Masaryk to make a public statement against the recognition of the Polish government in exile, with whom Masaryk had maintained cordial relations during his exile years. In the summer of 1947 Jan Masaryk went to Moscow only to surrender when confronted with Stalin’s imperious demand that Czechoslovakia rescind its acceptance of the Marshall Plan. (As a witness of the ignominious event remembered, Jan Masaryk, upon return from the Kremlin to the Czechoslovak ambassador’s residence, retired to his room and there he played in solitude on the piano Chopin’s Marche Funèbre.) A friend of Jan Masaryk, the first United Nations Secretary General Trygve Lie, In the Cause of Peace (1954), remembers that Jan Masaryk was most bitter about the way in which he and other members of his delegation had been forced [pageend148]Bo o k Re v ie w s 145 to bow to the Russians. Trygve Lie also witnesses that Jan Masaryk felt that London and Washington had more or less written Czechoslovakia off as early as 1946. On March 10, 1948, at six o’clock in the morning, three floors below an open bathroom window in the courtyard of the ornate Czernin Palace, the seat of Czechoslovakia’s Foreign Ministry, an employee discovered the lifeless body of Jan Masaryk. The Communist government of Klement Gottwald, which had seized power only two weeks before, promptly issued a statement that Masaryk was depressed over Western criticism of his decision to join the new government. Masaryk’s friends, however, were unconvinced of the suggestion of suicide and wondered about the possibility that he had been murdered. Looming large behind their skepticism was the Communist hatred of the Masaryks—the father and the son—whom the Communists had portrayed as bourgeois politicians conspiring against the working class and the fatherland of socialism, the Soviet Union. The skeptics pointed out that the Kremlin’s towers cast a long shadow and that Stalin did not forgive those who dared to challenge him. It was known that Jan Masaryk was no admirer of the Soviet dictator and that he had the courage of saying no when postwar Soviet diplomacy attempted to drive Czechoslovakia into an anti-Western camp. The Cranes, who had known Jan Masaryk for many years, then concluded and now maintain that in all probability Jan had committed suicide. They have had reasons to believe so. They knew that Jan had a longstanding history of emotional instability, which had surfaced with Jan’s mother, Charlotte Garrigue. The Crane’s family experience with Jan’s history of emotional problems dated back to 1912, when Jan worked at the Bridgeport plant of the Crane Company. At that time, Jan spent almost two years at a special institution in Vineland, New Jersey, to recover from a breakdown. Another episode that supports the suicide version is Jan’s unsuccessful marriage with John Crane’s sister Frances. Frances witnessed Jan’s second breakdown at close range in 1930, when Jan staggered into her room one evening inebriated, threatening to kill her and himself. These threats, according to the Cranes, were frequent after Frances’ miscarriage in 1925. The principal source of the murder theory is Marcia Davenport, Jan’s last companion. She saw Jan on March 7, three days before his death. In 1967, she published her memoirs, Too Strong for Fantasy (1967), in which she attributed her conviction that Jan Masaryk had been murdered to Jan’s plans after the February coup d’état to escape to London for the purpose of joining her in marriage. The authors of the present book quote Ambassador Jan Papánek, the pre-February Czechoslovak permanent representative to the United Nations, as stating in 1970 that “Marcia... informed me that on leaving Prague the previous Sunday, Jan had told her that if he failed to keep his promise to join her, he would only be prevented by the Communists, who might kill him.” The authors refute the genuineness of Jan’s commitment to Marcia Davenport. They recall [pageend149]146 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al their last talk with Jan in New York in December 1947 in which Jan said that the relationship was not at all as it appeared: Marcia was simply an attractive and interesting woman in whom he found companionship. He emphasized that he was not emotionally committed to her and had no intention to marry her. However, we should not forget that he was making this statement to the brother and to the sister-in-law of his divorced wife. There are some, both in Czechoslovakia and the United States, who disagree with the Cranes’ interpretation. They argue that both medical and circumstantial evidence led to the conclusion that the communists murdered Masaryk out of fear that he would expose their illegal takeover of Czechoslovakia in February 1948. Dr. Václav Teplý, who examined Masaryk’s body in the courtyard of Prague’s Czernin Palace on the morning of March 9, 1948, reportedly found a bullet wound in the foreign minister’s neck, casting doubt on the communist story that Masaryk killed himself by jumping out a window. When Teplý arrived to examine the body, he saw numerous government officials standing nearby. He recognized State Secretary of Foreign Affairs Vladimir dementis and Interior Minister Nosek, both communists. Also in the group was Otto Katz who had escaped from German-occupied France to Hollywood where his attempts to establish communist cells among producers and actors aroused suspicion. Katz fled to Mexico and then to the Soviet Union. In February 1945 Katz appeared in Czechoslovakia as a colonel in the Russian secret police (then called the NKVD). At the time of Masaryk’s death, Katz was chief of the Czechoslovak Information Service; in this capacity, he issued the official announcement that Masaryk committed suicide. Teplý was killed three months later, allegedly the victim of communist agents who wanted to silence him (George J. Švejda in Book World, May 12, 1991). Of course, all this is circumstantial evidence. We will perhaps never learn the true story. The tragedy of Jan Masaryk is no less difficult to release from a pen than the mystery of John F. Kennedy’s assassination in Dallas on November 22, 1963. I can only reiterate what I said at the beginning: this is a remarkable book. I wish to add only one thing: the authors deserve a special praise for their graceful style and the breadth of their knowledge. Vr a t is l a v Pě c h o t a Columbia Law School Žal u j i. By Antonín Kratochvil. (Praha: Dolmen, 1990-1991). 3 vols. (ISBN 80-85281-007). Czechoslovakia was the only successful democracy in Central and Eastern Europe [pageend150]Bo o k Re v ie w s 147 that in the interwar years was not destroyed from within. It was also the only country in the region where the Communists in 1946 won in a genuinely free electoral contest. Once in power, they ruled with exemplary Stalinist harshness, filling altogether 422 jails and concentration camps with enemies real and imaginary. The toll of those executed, beaten to death, shot at random exceeds 8,000. More victims of political purges were hanged than in all the countries of the then-Soviet bloc combined. This was also the regime that made memory a crime. “The rulers of forgetting” decreed an amnesia so that events be dissolved into non-events. The short-lived Prague Spring of 1968 lifted somewhat the veil of secrecy: memoirs of some former Communist survivors (notably Eugen Loebl and Artur London) were published, as was the rather copious contribution by the general press of that period, unearthing the regime’s manifold misdeeds. The author, publicist Antonín Kratochvil who went into exile after the Communist takeover in 1948, deserves thanks for his effort of having collected these testimonies and providing them with explanatory summary commentaries. Borrowing Emil Zola’s title J’accuse (1898), in the West the trilogy reached the market in 1973-1977. “The idea behind this book is a protest against manipulation with truth.” With these first words the author starts his effort against that state-decreed amnesia. The copious evidence presents not only an indictment of the regime’s gruesome record but also of the indifference of the society’s intimidated majority, and indeed, a complicity of some intellectuals, noted men of arts and science. The dramatis personae were not only individuals such as the sinister Bedřich Reičín, from a sergeant promoted to a general within five years, but also Jan Mukařovský, the president of the venerable Charles University in Prague. Though the book opens with the indictment against Rudolf Slánský et al., it does not further elaborate on this best known and documented of trials. Instead, Kratochvil most appropriately demolishes the myth created by the “socialists with a human face” anno 1968 that the Communists—the monopolists of all power and the engineers of cruelty that it produced—were somehow also its prime victims. The overwhelming majority were never believers in Marxism-Leninism, class struggle and hatred. Kratochvil offers several telling examples of such distorted vision: e.g., the well-known plight of Eduard Goldstiicker, the ardent Communist, sentenced to life imprisonment, yet after two years released and permitted to represent Czechoslovakia in Western forums, in contrast to the fate of two courageous non-communist women, the university professor Růžena Vacková and the novelist Nina Svobodová who both spent sixteen years in jail for alleged crimes they did not commit, and after their release they languished in poverty and obscurity. Kratochvil offers ample examples of absurdities made real in this land of Franz Kafka. In the trial of the alleged anti-state conspirators (Milada Horáková [pageend151]148 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al et al.), the conspirators did not know each other. Professor Josef Kepka was executed as the head of alleged, yet nonexistent Green International, and as a head of the Agrarian Party to which he never belonged. Secret police officers entered an apartment of a citizen, turned on his radio set, tuned in to a foreign broadcasting station and arrested him for the felony of the listening to a hostile propaganda. A woman was arrested and called nightly for interrogation where she was forced to face the wall and substitute for a clock, repeating “tick- tack,” until she was about to lose her sanity. Women prisoners were forced to engage in forced labor (custom jewelry, a successful export item to Western democracies) and failing to fulfill the unfulfillable production quota they had to pay a pecuniary penalty long after their release. The barbarians were assisting to Franz Kafka: in the cloister Teplá, the second largest depository of literary treasures in the country, the place was turned over to the military, the premises used as stables, the library contents being disposed of, loaded and unloaded with hayforks. The first volume, subtitled “Stalinist Justice in Czechoslovakia,” covers various trials, jails, and concentration camps. The Horáková et al. trial is included, as is the persecution of the members of the military. The second volume (“Returning the Voice to the Silenced Ones”) focuses on the persecution of the writers and the resulting cultural wasteland—Biafra of the soul: a regime’s attack on culture as such. The final volume (“Road to Zion”) covers the damage done to the educational system, the persecution of students and the churches. Even the most sympathetic reviewer cannot overlook the lack of coherent structure of this work. The treatment of various subjects is substantially uneven. The author was fully dependent on the volume of published sources in 1968. This did to a considerable extent determine his attention being paid to a particular subject. Moreover, the author very much focused on the plight of persecuted Catholic writers: his thoroughness contrasts with the rather cursory attention to other actors in this painful drama. For example, more pages are devoted to the poet Jan Zahradníček (Vol. II, pp. 72-108) than to the hundreds of members of the military, the brave men who fought with the RAF as well on the Eastern front. The most uneven, least integrated, is the third volume which was published with the assistance of the Christian Academy in Rome. Half of this volume (pp. 107-230) is devoted to the plight of the clergy. Why to put the report on penal military battalions and the forced labor camps before the report on judicial rehabilitation and follow this with the account of the situation in agriculture? The introductory essay (p. 14ff.) seems to me much too elementary to be rendered superfluous—such as a reference to Zdeněk Nejedlý and his ambition to create a socialist intelligentsia (p. 14). This information may be of some use to an outsider but not to a Czech reader of this Czech language work. Kratochvil presents some valuable data: the number of various victims, [pageend152]Bo o k Re v ie w s 149 students expelled after 1948, the names of the writers, poets, intellectuals arrested and jailed, the names of those sentenced in secret trials, etc. In the epilogue, Jaromír Hořec, the editor of the Prague edition, states that he decided to change nothing of substance and merely eliminated some of the repetitive material. He decided not to include any new information that came to light after November 1989—the fall of the Communist regime—and he cites two reasons. For one, the book would have to be expanded to an unmanageable length, and secondly, “The authenticity and the documentary value of Kratochviľs testimony from the sixties would thus have been damaged.” This line of reasoning leaves me unpersuaded. It would then mean that the intent behind this re-edition was not to assemble the evidence of the crimes of the old regime but just to present the result of a diligent exile, struggling to put together the pieces over the past ten, twenty years. The concluding chapter of the trilogy covers the Babice case that resulted in seven death sentences. Lately, evidence was discovered (by the weekly Respekt) that the alleged American agent Malý was in fact a secret police provocateur who was well alive after the affair and identified in a distant town of Litoměřice by one of the witnesses. Unnecessary gap thus to be left opened. The editor eliminated 16 entries in Volume II but he failed to do a careful job. For example, Kratochvil states (I, p. 15) that the case of Babice will be analyzed in Volume II. Yet, it appears in Volume III. Redundancies were left intact (II, pp. 208, 111, 104, data on 27.5 million books destroyed; III, p. 186 footnote containing an explanatory information and reference to a source, already stated on p. 173; ibid. pp. 265-6). The editor did not dispose of some irritating inconsistencies in Kratochviľs work. For instance, in Volume III, the author is identified along with the heading of the source (p. 50), whereas at the next opportunity (p. 54) the name of the author pops up at the end of the article, or the article starts with the name of the author without indication where it was published (p. 56) or the entry lacks the identification of both the author and the source (p. 59). The editor states: “Where no source is identified, it means that the contribution was written directly for the compendium Žaluji (for example by S. Volný, R. Strobinger, Fr. Vohryzka and others).” This is not the kind of scholarly care appreciated by Western standards. In the original exile publication, Volume II included both the Table of Contents and an Index. In the Czech edition, Volume II has neither and the Index appears in Volume III. One further oddity comes to mind: Kratochviľs work, though published in exile by different publishers, retained a uniform appearance, shape, and print. The Prague version, however, produced by a single source, resulted in three volumes of different print and quality of paper. I was unable to detect whether the trilogy was published in 1990 or 1991. Total of 50,000 copies of Volume I were printed but only 45,000 copies of Volume II and 43,000 copies of Volume III without furnishing an explanation of this discrepancy.

Ope n Le t t e r s: Se l e c t e d Wr it in g s, 1965-1990. By Václav Havel; selected and edited by Paul Wilson. (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1991). xiv, 415 pp. (ISBN 0-679-40027-3). The rise of Václav Havel from the station of a relatively little known playwright, dissenter and victim of persecution by the Communist regime of his native Czechoslovakia, to that of the Czechoslovak president and an eloquent intellectual, much admired at home and abroad, has created a demand for a greater knowledge of him and his work. This book is one of the responses to this demand. It is a collection of selected, mostly short writings of varied kind, not just what is usually called “open letters,” produced, often at long intervals, between 1965 and 1990. They were selected, edited, and to a large degree translated by Paul Wilson, editor of the Idler magazine in Toronto, who had lived in Czechoslovakia between 1967-1977 as English teacher, and has earned well-deserved accolades for his translations of Havel as well as other Czech writers. The goal of this collection was to round out the picture of Havel that we have gained from his plays, essays, letters and pieces of autobiography, which had been published in English earlier, although some of these translations were available previously. Despite the large size of this volume, only a limited number of such writings could be included and they fulfill this goal only partially. But there will certainly be opportunities for future sequels. However, the diverse interests and needs of readers could be served better if the autobiographical materials were published separately from the philosophical essays. From the autobiographical pieces included in this collection—mostly reports to his friends, letters and interviews—we do learn more than what we have known before. Václav Havel was born (1936) and raised in a family of substantial means and got the opportunity to see the world “from below” and lose many of his illusions about it only through his experiences with the Communist regime in the 1950s (pp. 4-5, 90). He was brought up in the tradition of Tomáš G. Masaryk’s humanism, but intimates that he also gained something from Marxism and defined himself (in 1965) as a Socialist. But he never became a member of the Community Party because the world appeared to him to be a more complex structure than the Communists had presented it (97-98). It was the Ot t o Ul č SUNY at Binghamton [pageend154]Bo o k Re v ie w s 151 experiences with social conditions around him that attracted him to the world of theater, the most social among all arts. He credits his growth in that world to his association with the Theater on the Balustrade (Na zábradlí) under the guidance of Jan Grossman in the freer period of the 1960s, which allowed deeper probes into the working of the society and more experimentation with the new forms of theatrical expression (5-7). The more catastrophic appeared to him the collapse of it all due to the Soviet-led intervention of Czechoslovakia in 1968; it was “the end of an era,” a “profound mental dislocation,” when “the whole world crumbled.” Suddenly everything was too difficult, too serious, too dramatic and tragic to be dealt with in his previous manner of a “distant, amused observer.” Suddenly he had to catch a “second breath”; “instead laughing one felt like shouting” (8-9). He had instantly become one of the most prohibited authors and one of the most eloquent spokesmen of the “unofficial,” or “second,” “parallel culture” of dissent and opposition, terms that Havel accepts reluctantly, because he feels that they do not describe precisely the nature and meaning of this life and activity. He continued to work on his plays, which could only be produced abroad, and increasingly began producing essays and commentaries on public affairs, especially appeals and protests against violations of citizens’ rights, all of course in the samizdat fashion. In 1977 and 1978 he became co-founder of the Charter ’77 and of the Committee for the Defense of Unjustly Persecuted (VONS), which assumed the obligation to speak out on these issues collectively. He was soon placed under a strict police surveillance, which amounted in the fall of 1978 to a virtual house arrest in his Prague apartment, enforced by policemen stationed outside his door. Near his country house Hradecek, the police even erected an elevated guardhouse resembling the Soviet moon vehicle and surveyed the grounds from the windows (215-36). In May 1979 he was arrested and tried, along with several other dissidents, for anti-state activity, and spent over four years in prison. He saw the prison cells again for additional but shorter periods, the last time in October 1989, only a month before the collapse of Communism in Czechoslovakia, and two months before his election to the office of the President of the Republic. Among the philosophical essays included in this book we find his letters to the Communist Party Secretary Alexander Dubček (1969), and his successor Gustav Husák (1975), his address to the faculty of the University of Toulouse upon receiving an honorary doctorate from it (1984), two letters from prison, several significant interviews, notes on the mission of Charter ’77, plus several other types of materials, most particularly the lengthiest of them, “Power of the Powerless,” an essay originally composed for a joint publication of Czechoslovak and Polish dissidents (1978). The collection ends with his address to the Czechoslovak people on the New Year’s Day of 1990 upon accepting his election to the presidency. [pageend155]152 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al Havel is, of course, no philosopher, and he would certainly be the first to admit it. He rather strikes the reader as a distant cousin of the French philosophies of the 18th century Enlightenment, who had focused their attention on what could be called philosophy of human existence and of human relations. He shares with them “the tendency to theorize,” the obsession to analyze the ills of human society in the most rational way “to the point of absurdity” (5, 93), a ponderous prose, a wanting sense of reality, but also a lacking knowledge of wider aspects of philosophy, of history and other human sciences, although he excels over most of them in sincerity. His direct lineage, however, is of a more recent date: aside of Masaryk it includes Jan Patočka, the leading mind of the Czech dissent, and mostly through him also Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger and several pillars of Western existentialism. The philosophical values and tools of thinking he had learned from them Havel applies to the analysis and critique of Communist society around him, which he chose to label the “post-totalitarian” system, a rather confusing term. It is “post-totalitarian” because it had appeared in human experience after the more traditional, “classical” totalitarian systems, but it is totalitarian all the same. He suggests that it is even more totalitarian than they had been (127-31), which could be true for its Stalinist form, but not its meeker forms of the 1920s, or of the decades which followed the 1950s, and these again do not compare with the totality and brutality of Nazi or Fascist dictatorship; indeed, one cannot imagine the dissent activities of the 1980s in Hitler’s empire. Havel identifies the chief architects and enforcers of the post-totalitarian system with the dictators of the Soviet Union and their regional agents, but he also seems to add to them every individual who succumbs to it too easily or unnecessarily. A grocer who puts into his shop window the slogan “Proletarians of the world unite!” without believing it, just because it is required of him, cooperates in his subjugation, indeed co-creates the system; he practices “autototality” (132-45ff). Indeed, the whole nation is co-responsible for the system. “We are all... responsible for the operation of the totalitarian machinery... we also are its co-creators.” Havel insists on one of the concluding pages of this book (392), thus imputing to his people (unwittingly, perhaps) the sin of collective guilt, from which he had absolved other collectives, including the Germans in World War II. If the same grocer had refused to put up the slogan in which he does not believe, he would be punished by the authorities, Havel admits, but he would terminate his auto-totality and reduce the totality of the government control over him. He would cease to live with the lie and start living with the truth. This is the “power of the powerless” that eventually may help erode the totalitarian system that envelopes them. Havel indeed believes that such acts of self-liberation are possible and can have effect on the whole society. As examples he cites the positions and actions of individual dissidents, or groups of them (the so-called [pageend156]Bo o k Re v ie w s 153 “independent initiatives”), as they write protest letters, refuse to vote, produce and disseminate samizdat publications, strike, participate in unauthorized lectures and seminars, or artistic performances and exhibitions, or support the unjustly persecuted and their families. None of these positions and deeds constitute or postulate a revolution, especially a violent revolution, none of them are even political in nature. Rather than a political revolution they presuppose an existential revolution whose goal is a moral reconstitution of the individual’s identity and of the society (146-96, 272-84). Most of this is expressed by Havel more elaborately and subtly than it is possible in this brief summary. Much of it has the air of the unreal and reflects the unreal world of the dissent (Havel objects to the notion of ghetto), but it is all noble and worthy to study and remember, as we study and remember the heritage of the Enlightenment. Long before the collapse of Communism in Europe in 1989, Havel was confident that it would happen, more or less as it did, under its own weight, although he also counted on a favorable international climate and fundamental personnel changes in the power center of the post-totalitarian system, in the Soviet Union. He even counted on its disintegration under the pressure of reawakening nationalism. Havel also foresaw the return of democracy to his nation and region, and pondered about its possible nature. In these thoughts he appears to be unimpressed by western parliamentary democracy. He is particularly suspicious of mass political parties that administer their countries through powerful apparatuses, not unlike those of the dictatorships. In their fierce struggle for power they appear to him likely to neglect their primary role, which should be to protect and expand the rights of the individual. They also appear to him to weaken rather than strengthen the defense parameters of modern society against the ravishes of the rapacious hunt for material goods and its most destructive tool—modern technology (25, 206-09, 249-71). In fact, he defined the birth of the post-totalitarian system as the juncture of traditional dictatorship with extreme consumerism, reflected in the “unwillingness of consumption-oriented people to sacrifice some material certainties for the sake of their own spiritual and moral integrity” (145). Václav Havel would rather like to see human society guided by model personalities who would act independently from any party structure, inspired only by their moral conscience and their deep sense of civic responsibility. He would allow for groups of such personalities to act on the public scene too, but he envisions them as small ad hoc groups (initiatives) that would appear spontaneously just for the resolution of a particular problem, but disappear once the task would be completed to make room for other initiatives that would confront other problems (209-14). There is much of Rousseau in this picture of this “post- democratic” society, although Havel cites Alexander Solzhenitsyn and Martin Heidegger as his inspirators, not being aware, perhaps, that the anti-parliamentarisms of the first was rooted in the mystical and reactionary concepts of 19th [pageend157]154 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al century Russia, and of the second in his flirtations with Nazism. One cannot help but respond to such contemplations with a paraphrase of Winston Churchill’s musing on this topic: Democracy is the most nonsensical system of government one could think of, but nobody has so far found a better one. Most recent news from Havel’s Czechoslovakia (January 1992) indicates that traditional parliamentary democracy is back in action there and is doing rather well in the face of the unprecedented devastation that the failure and collapse of Communism bequeathed to it. It is partly doing so well due to President Havel, who is apparently modifying at least some views and positions of dissident Havel. These are the main lines of thought of the philosophical materials included in this book. Several smaller pieces elaborate on them and on their derivatives and add reflections on a few more, but less central concerns. If the autobiographical materials read well, the style of the philosophical essays presents the reader with a formidable task. It is heavy, labored and ponderous. It employs long sentences that meander through many lines (seventeen on p. 263 e.g.). They carry not only the principal statement assigned to them, but also all sorts of qualifications, enumerations and matters of secondary nature that overload the sentence structure to its utmost capacity. Havel is aware of it and tries to help the reader by employing parentheses, that separate such material from the main flow of the sentence, and it helps, but not too much. It partly derives from the heavy mental labor Havel had to apply to his contemplations. He was driven by a passion to theorize, to write theoretical tracts, but often found the task difficult and painful. “I do not belong to that fortunate class of authors,” he wrote in 1977, “who write constantly, quickly, easily and always well, whose imagination never tire and who—unhampered by doubts and inhibitions—are by nature open to the world... That... bothers me... even upsets me... and I am angry with myself for having so few ideas, for finding it difficult to write ... for thinking so much about everything that I often feel crippled by it” (3). It all presented also his translators with a formidable task. But a few checks against the original texts proved that they did rather well. All in all, this book offers important documents on the nature and trend of human thought in a closed society. It was hampered by strict limits, but it struggled incessantly to overcome these limits, enter and remain in contact with the freer thought beyond these limits and contribute to the common heritage of our civilization whatever it could under its incredibly difficult circumstances. Marked with the pain of isolation, desertion and repeated defeat, it continued to struggle and ultimately witnessed its liberation, for which there seemed to be no hope.

Edited by Walter Schmaschula. (West Slavic Contributions, no. 1) Frankfurt am Main; New York: P. Lang, 1989. 550 p. (ISBN 3-820481397). Among the most important literary problems that can be raised concerning Hašek and his Švejk are: 1) literary influences on Švejk (the gap here is particularly reprehensible and in view of the fact that certain names, such as Rabelais and Cervantes, keep getting repeated, but without any analysis; at the same time the number of likely sources in Czech, and even in German, is not very great; 2) the literary influence of Švejk', and 3) the style of Švejk, especially of Švejk’s own speeches—here something has been done by Parrott and, in a more structuralist vein, by Doležel. Other significant types of research on Hašek and Švejk are, of course, possible: the role of Švejk in Czech literature, society, etc., even the role of Švejk in world literature (e.g., Švejk as an original comic figure in world literature, though this has largely been done). Too much has probably been written on the question of whether Švejk is a real idiot or is only simulating, and the related question as to whether Švejk is pro-Czech and anti-Austrian, or only for himself; still, these are intriguing questions and may stimulate further fruitful investigation. Unfortunately, the present volume does not do very much to deal with these troubling questions. The most solid attempt is Hannah Aria Gaifman’s lengthy, rambling, but quite sound article largely devoted (in spite of its unindicative title) to characterizing and defining Švejk’s own rhetorical style. But too many of the contributors here have found it convenient to evade the major, vexed questions of Švejkology and deal only with odds and ends. This is not bad, of course, and in the present volume we probably possess as solid a total contribution to Hašek studies as we have in the world of literary criticism outside the present volume. We may notice other gaps: in spite of the Symposium’s announced topic, there is almost nothing in the volume on Hašek’s life, and almost nothing on his stories; the whole volume is in fact devoted to Švejk. This will ultimately prove an advantage, of course, for the stories hardly challenge the student of literature to the extent Švejk does. Hašek’s life is another question: it is full of problems and enigmas, but some of these are probably insoluble, and probably the major questions of Švejk studies have a higher priority. Our whole view of Hašek’s Švejk, unfortunately, is hampered by our inability to distinguish literary virtues from weaknesses, and many of the articles show this confusion, without intending to. Thus, Veronika Ambros writes that, “the figure of Švejk is actually a mask behind which a whole repertoire of different kinds of narrators are hidden...” But this may either be a platitude or the description of inept narration on the author’s part, and there is a need to [pageend159]156 Cz e c h o sl o v ak an d Ce n t r al Eu r o pe an Jo u r n al show that it is not that. Antonín Mešťan upholds the view that Hašek used reference books for the creation of Švejk, and thus helped to blur the line between reality and (hyperbolized) fiction. But all novels blur the line between reality and hyperbolized fiction more or less and in some way or another; it is important, of course, to show how, but the wonder perhaps is not that Hašek used so many reference books, but rather that he got away with using so few! In spite of what I have said above, several articles do deal with the possible influence of Švejk. The best of these, no doubt, is Květoslav Chvatfk’s article comparing Švejk and Josef Škvorecký’s hero Danny Smiřický. The impulse to compare Hašek (the stories, too, of course, as well as Švejk) with Škvorecký was a sound one, but I fear that Chvatik has chosen the wrong part of Škvorecký: Danny, as an intellectual, is not very close to Švejk. On the other hand, if the question is cut more broadly, concerning, for instance, the matter of the anecdotal structure employed by both writers, then Tankový prapor, a comic novel on military service in the Czech Communist army, is no doubt the work by Škvorecký that is closest to Švejk. I come back to the long article which strikes me as the central piece of the collection: Hannah Aria Gaifman’s “Problems and Issues in Hašek’s Adventures of the Good Soldier Švejk. ” Gaifman begins her article well by including Hašek’s novel in Bakhtin’s category of “quotation oriented literature.” She introduces a number of terms to characterize Švejk’s monologues, too many to list them all, but I will attempt to give the most incisive: “reversal of roles,” e.g., jester instead of king; “piling up,” with the coterminal displacement of “central” details by ever new and equally “central” details that seem irrelevant; “raising the accidental and the marginal to a central role,” etc. This procedure of naming and attempting to generalize strikes me to be at the heart of what we know as literary criticism. There is a good contribution by Walter Schamschula on the psychology of Švejk, attempting a resolution of the vexed question of whether Švejk is an idiot or only a deliberate stimulant. Finally, there is a series of articles, including a fine one by the late American Slavist František Galan, on Hašek in translation and in different national traditions; these in some part treat the question of Hašek’s influence I have mentioned above, as well as the question of Hašek’s style. The articles are written in Czech, German and English (predominantly German), with brief summaries in Czech. Wil l ia m E.
