We call then the Fantastic Four from San Francisco even though we ended up with only three because one of our Fantastics hurt his ankle before the event, and was unable to attend. Why do we call our four the Fantastics? Let us tell you! All four worked very hard to learn the exercises required to compete, AND, for the first tine in fourteen years, Sokol San Francisco had competitors participate in any type of District or National Sokol, competition. Did we do well? Let's talk about that! Fantastic Boy - Favian Avelar placed second in the boys competition. Fantastic Girls - Andria Elousek placed third in the girls petition and Tami Avelar placed fourth. com- Where can the awards be admired? Here's the word! They are on display at Sokol Eall. From, there we are sure they will be on prominent display in their hones. Sister Jarmila Vrana and I drove the Fantastics to and from Los Angeles, and it is with a warm and delightful heart that I relate to you - their success, and to report that their total behavior was above reproach. They were Sokol Fantasti Falcons we can all be proud of. Zarcel Hloušek worked hard to be able to participate also, and we were sorry he injured his foot. Also performing in the Verejne Cvičeni participated in the Calisthenic Drill: and Jarnila Vrana. were three adults who David K.urka, Katie Frossr '.ary Frances Neier Visto Náčelnice [pageend1]SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO VĚSTNÍK MAY - JUNE, 1988 PAGE - 2 WHAT IS SOKOL? PART 2 As I mentioned in my previous article, the first Sokol unit was formed in Prague in 1862. Dr. M. Tyrš was its founder and its first director of lien. His father-in-law,Jindřich Fflgner,became the first President, and it was due mainly to his efforts that this unit acquired right at the onset a beautiful gymnastic hall.Those two men, one an idealist, a visionary,a philosopher, the other prominent businessman, a banker, and humanitarian, soon gathered ar^nd them a group of dedicated workers, who gave the organization .an intensely nationalistic and patriotic character. Dr, tyrŠ evolved a whole new gymnastic system, and the necessary terminology to describe it, 'The Sokol movement caught on rapidly, and spread into rural areas, 2y the end of 1862 there were already 8 new units in existence outside the capital. As early as 1864 the first unit outside the boundaries of the country was formed in Ljubljana,Yugoslavia.The untimely death of Fdgner in I865 could not stop the growth, nor could the movement be supressed by the adverse attitude of the Austrian government. The first Sokol periodical, edited by Tyrš, made its appearance in 1871. In 1882 an event took place, which was destined to become a tradition within the movement?the first Sokol "Slet" was organized. "Slet" is a general meet of all Sokols, both from home and abroad,meant to show the general public the strength, and achievements of the movement. The first Slet was attended by 1600 members in their colorful costumes; 700 gymnasts participated in the exhibition. ( In contrast, at the X Slet in 1938 the gymnasts numbered some 32.000, and there were several hundred thousands of costumed participants). lyré died in 1884, but by then his ideas were so deeply embedded in the heart of the nation, that not even his demise could slow down the continual growth of the movement.In fact, the Increasing number of units necessitated the organization of so called"Districts" each comprising several units. Soon afterwards, in 1889,followed the creation of central organ C.O.S.(Czech Organization of Sokols). All this was happening against continuous opposition of the Austrian government. The second Slet, for example, planned for 1887,was forbidded by a governmental edict. The .American Sokols, however, ignored this, came over in force, and held their own "Slet" in the town of Cesky Brod, with the enthusiastic support of countless Czech Sokols, With the passing years, the Slets grew in size and importance.The second one took place in I89I, the third in 1895• On that one, the junior men (between 14-18 years) made their first Slet appearance. Women were admitted into Sokol in 1898, and took part in the following Slet, in 1902. Another one followed in 1907, featuring a competition of the members of the European Federation of the Qymnastic Associations. The Sokol team won the first place. This was a beginning of a long list of successes for Sokols in international gymnaste meets: Luxemburg in 1909-second place, Turin 1911 - first place, Paris in 1913 - first place, etc, ate... In those years, before World War I, Sokol spread to other Slavonic nations, and soon a "Federation of Slavonic Sokols" was formed, comprising Czechs, Poles, Russians, and the lands now united in Yugoslavia, First Warld War slowed down the progress - the organization was disbanded, and many members lost their lives in the war - but as soon, as peace prevailed, Sokol was back, stronger than before. In fact, the period between the two wars was the time of its biggest growth. The membership reached 1 million, a figure unheard of in the history of gym^nas- tics.lt must be said, though,that the function of Sokol transcended the confines of a purelygymnastic club, and the movement became an important educational and social factor. It was the most important educational and national organization in the first Republic. [pageend2]SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO VĚSTNÍK MAY - JUNE, 1988 PAGE - 3 ■ pro m “ The German occupation during the second World War, dealt a death blow to Sokol.The movement has survived disbandment before,but this time the Nazis systematically killed off some 5.509 leaders of Sokol ----the cream of the organization,This loss was rather hard to make up. After the German occupation and Worl War II were over, Sokol began again and would have undoubtedly succeeded in regaining its former strength, but the end of democratic Gze- choslovakia meant as well the end of Sokols The Communistic leaders could hardly tolerate an organization in which the ideals of democracy and freedom were so deeply ingrained. Today,Sokol exists only in the free Western world, and in the hearts of the former members of the country in which it was born, SOKOL MEETING RESUME - April 11, 1988 Roll call of officers indicated John Macalik, Editor was absent. An application for reinstatement of a member who was dropped because of nonpayment of dues was discussed. According to by-laws payment of all past dues are required before reinstatement can occur.

Motion passed. Sis. Meier reported that 68 copies of our Good Neighbor Cookbook were available for sale. Motion was made that we sell them for $5 each.

Ne snad, ze by mezitím v USA nebyl a nevystupoval - ku příkladu před třemi roky byl v Los Angeles a všude jinde, s výjimkou San Franciska - ale tehdy tot i ž. . . "Kry 1 ? " opáčil mi na dotaz, proč jako Kryl ne sem k. nám, tehdejší funkcionář Sokola - jinak velice hodný a aktivní pán - "Kryl? Toho já neznám!" A basta/ Bohudíky časy se měni a s nimi 1 lide, stojící v cele a tak 22. dubna byl Karel přivítán zcela zaplněným sálem San Mateovské sokolovny - prý nás tam bylo asi ke dvěma stům. Přišli jsme my, Karlovi nadšení obdivovatele, kteří ho známe jeste z vlasti a kteří si neseme v sobe jeho písně, jez byly zrale a svěží tehdy, před těmi dvaceti lety, jsou zrale a svěží ted* a zůstanou takové na^porád. Spolu s námi tam byli i naši "osmačty- řicátníci" alt i narozeni později, pro které je skutečnost roku 1S68 jen abstraktním pojmem —ti byli přivedeni zvídavosti a ti se Karlovými obdivovateli teprve stali. Ten nabitý sal byl přijemnym překvapením: Zjednodušené lze říci, ze zase jednou byl podán důkaz, že do emigrace odešli kromě jiných take lide, pro něz platí, ze "nejenom chlebem..." a jejichž odchodem vlast ztratila a jej'ichz počet není nepodstatný. Karlovo uměni není totiž pro každého. Jeho kumšt si vyžaduje diváka určité úrovně — asi tak, jako si to vyžadovalo Osvobozené ci později Suchého Semafor, anebo Rokoko ci Divadlo Y - diváka, který pochopi a absorbuje hloubku jeho veršů. Karlovy verše a písně — vlastně zpívané básně - nejsou jednoduché; na rozdíl od ostatních, bohužel i tzv. zakázaných autorů (tedy v CSSR zakázaných) mají obsah. Hluboký obsah, vetknutý do básnicky vytříbené formy, ukrytý ve vei— ších dokonalých vazbou a rytmem — u kolika autoru dneška toto můžeme nalézt? Karlovy básně jsou prostoupeny metaforami a podobenstvími na straně jedne a slovními hrickam.i na straně druhé a proto porozuměni jim není dáno každému. Jsou Macharovsky nesmlouvavé - bez obalu a tvrdě nazývají věci pravými jmény - Karel Kryl není básníkem pro salonní chameleonstvo. Která* z jeho písní byla nejuspěš— nejsi? Ta kterou zahájil - gladiátorská. "Cesta je prach a štěrk < pouliční špína..." A Hrál a klaun. A Bratříčku - ta bude vždy- zelena, vyvolávající mrazeni v zadech. A přenadherna Lásko, Karavana mraku a všechny další, které jsou známe* více ci méně - ty všechny byly pro nás nové a nej krásnější. Z těch opravdu neznámých - alespoň pro mne - se zaskvěla píseň, jejíž pravý název neznám. Snad /Jopis Martině, či Martině v sedmi pádech. V pádech, které si většina z nás skloňuje ve svém nitru. Skvost mezi skvosty. Kdyby se Kryl nejmenoval Kryl ale Crill ci Piaf ci Aznavour — ale to uz je naše zlata česka staletími utvrzená povaha... Dále není možno se nezmínit o Písni ve třech verZich, Ireně - kolik ze jich vlastně bylo? Co bylo záporem? Ze jsme neslyšeli Pušky a děla, Srdce a kriz, Pietu, Hrob neznámého vojína, Baladu o nevidomé dívce, Vánoční a desítky dalších - Karle, přijed* opět a co nejdříve! Byl to tedy večer, na který se nezapomíná. Večer, jaký bychom potřebovali a chtěli mít každý měsíc. Vychutnat krásu češtiny - jazyka, kterým lze vyjádřit to, co nelze jazykem jiným. Názor nedouka? Vzpomínáte, co tu před třemi roky říkal o češtině Vladimír Skutina? Literát ovládající více, než jeden cizí jazyk? Ale ja' chci vzpomenout Skutiny z jiného důvodu: Nevím, kdo zorganisoval [pageend6]SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO VĚSTNÍK MAY - JUNE, 1988 PAGE - 7 Krylův kulturní zájezd. Rie zde v San Františku vděčíme za uskutečnění tohoto večera nynějšímu presidentovi Sokola Davidu Kůrkoví. David se národ i 1 zde, v USR, ale na rozdíl od mnoha našich tzv. politických emigranti je hrdý na svou starou vlast a mluví česky, protože - a tady bych vzpoměl slov pana Skutiny, kdy vyprávěl, jak v Kapském Městě k němu přišla rodina našich krajanu a omlouvala se, že již mluví spatně česky a po ubezpečení, že naopak, ze jejich čeština je výborná', se otazali: "Hádejte, jak dlouho je už naše rodina venku?" "40 let" hadal pan Skutina - "ba ne" odpověděli - "třista třicet. My jsme totiž Komenští!" "To byli totiž potomci Jana Rmose Komenského - Figul iusovi", pokračoval pan Skutina, "kteří sém přišli s prvními Bury a v té rodině se po všechny ty časy mluví česky! - a ja chtěl před nimi pokleknout a políbit jim ruce." R toto díkuvzdaní budiž dáno všem těm našim krajanům, kteří jsou jako tito Komenští - a v tomto specielním případ^ rodičům Davida. Za to, že žijíce 40 let mimo vlast, zůstali Cechy - oni i lejich deti. Toz poděkujme Karlu Krylovi jeste jednou. R doufejme, ze v příštím roce - alespoň tak to pan Kemr ve své reci téměř slíbil - opět nashledanou. Nakonec informace pro ty, kterým se ten rok zda' příliš dlouhý a kteri to nevědí: Karel vydal několik desek.

Here are several area which ought to be included in such a policy: FUEL. While most mothers will run indefinitely on hot coffee, pizza, and hamburgers, an occasional gourmet meal for two in elegant surroundings will immeasurably increase efficiency. MOTOR. A mother’s motor is probably one of the most dependable anywhere; a mother can start and reach a top speed from a prone position at a single cry from a sleeping child. To keep that motor at peak efficiency, regular breaks are recommended. A leisurely bath and nap every 1,000 miles, a babysitter every 10,000 miles, and a two-week, live-in sitter every 100,000 miles will do wonders. BATTERY. Batteries should be recharged regularly. Roses, candy, or other thoughtful and unexpected gifts often do the trick. CARBURETOR. When a mother’s carburetor floods, it should be treated with Kleenex and a soft shoulder. CHASSIS. A mother operates best when her chassis is properly maintained. Her wardrobe should be changed as needed, every fall and spring. Regular exercise should be encouraged and allowed for. A complete change of hairdo and make-up should be part of the regular maintenance. When the chasis begins to sag, there are a number of possible remedies, including racquet ball and Weight Watchers. TUNE-UPS. Mothers need regular tune- ups. Compliments are both the least expensive and most appreciated. By following these simple instructions, the average mother should last a lifetime, providing love and care to those who need her most. FURIANT! TAKES ITS SHOW ON THE ROAD Months of diligent practice have finally paid offj as Furiant! has been invited to perform at the State-wide Folk Dance Festival to be held at Cubberly Pavillion in Palo Alto. Thii even is sponsored by the International Folk Dance Federation, which limits participation to folk dance groups of proven artistic and technical merit. Furiant! is pleased to have been one of the groups selected to perform, and hopes to introduce new audiences to the beauty of Czechoslovak music and dance. And if this wasn 't excitement enough — there's more! Furiant! has also been invited to perform at the VIII Sokol Canada Slet in Montreal on June 25, 1988. The five dancers who will be representing the Sokol folk dance group in Canada will be performing a fifteen minute program of dances from different regions of Czechoslovakia, in national costume. Understandably, the excitement level at Furiant! rehearsals is reaching fever pitch, and will no doubt continue to do so until the final curtain call in Montreal. Needless to say, Furiant! sincerely thanks its many supporters and well-wishers, who, by their support, play such a large part in preserving a small piece of our Czechoslovak heritage.

[pageend12]SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO VĚSTNÍK MAY - JUNE, 1988 PAGE - 13 The Rewards of Making a Contribution to Society S haring SOKOL with someone you care about adds to the quality of his or her life, just as the quality of your life was enhanced when someone shared SOKOL with you. Those who assist others in this way know how it gives them an unparalleled sense of worth. They realize they've done something of service for someone else, and nothing can replace that feeling. Many prominent scientists recently have begun confirming that assisting others can be an effective antidote to stress, unhappiness, and disease. Assisting people can make us more connected to life, and thus healthier and happier. When you assist other people, your selfconcept improves. Moreover, explains Dr. James Lynch, people with high self-esteem take better care of themselves. Dr. Lynch is a leading specialist in psychosomatic medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. “Really caring for yourself includes caring for your body and your mind," he says, "and that becomes the foundation of caring for others." WARNING! To gain the benefits of assisting people, your motives must be completely unselfish—not just to "get something" in return. If the person you've assisted doesn't say, "thank you," and that makes you angry, then you have to take a closer look at your original motives. As it is said in Zen: "You will find the rewards only as long as you're not looking for them." Most important, we must realize that our survival depends not only on our own happiness, but on the survival and happiness of others. Activities that promote service to others strengthen the integrity of the group and the individuals within it. The good of the individual is intrinsically tied to the good of the group: serving the good of the whole serves all the individuals within it, meeting their real needs. The group's power to give to everyone is thus enhanced, and the illusion of separateness disappears. This is the basis of successful survival: individuals not only doing what's good for themselves, but also what's needed for the good of others. As individuals, we must realize that we are dependent upon cooperation with others for survival. We cannot neglect other people's well-being, thinking that only the "self" is important. The success of The SOKOL Organization is based on the unselfish dedication of its members to the group, and the group's unselfish dedication to the well-being of its members. An organization that provides maximum support for its individual members requires individual members who provide maximum support for the group. The more an individual assists others in getting what they want, the more he or she moves toward his or her own personal goals. When you make a contribution to society, everybody wins, including yourself. When was the last time you made a contribution to the quality of someone's life? J,M.-Summit.
