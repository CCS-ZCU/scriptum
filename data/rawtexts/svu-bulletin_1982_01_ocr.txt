ZEF ★ ★ ★ Ružena Bunza - SVU Press Administrator Ružena Bunza was born in Rousinov near Brno and graduated from the Business Academy. When her husband, Dr. Bohumir Bunza, former judge and member of the Czechoslovak Parliament, was suddenly forced to leave the country after February 1948, she remained behind with their two small children. She suffered considerable political persecution, especially after her husband was sentenced to death in absentia. Not until nineteen years later, in 1967, did she and her daughter manage to escape. Her son was detained, imprisoned, and finally — during the Dubček era — released. The reunited family first settled in Rome, where Dr. Bunza worked as a librarian at the International Christian Democratic Center of Studies and Documentation. Ms. Bunza was active in the Czech religious center. Velehrad and the editorial department of the Christian Academy. In 1977 Dr. and Mrs. Bunza moved to New York, where they both are active and dedicated members of SVU and other Czechoslovak exile organizations. Ms. Bunza administers the SVU Press, taking care of the distribution -and in some cases the printing - of Zprávy (SVU News), this Bulletin, Proměny (Metamorphoses) and SVU books. Her labor may sometimes be onerous and less than rewarding, but it fulfills a most vital need. *** ZEF Jiri Nehnevajsa - SVU Vice-President Jiri Nehnevajsa was born in Dyjakovice in Southern Moravia. After serving in the Royal Air Force during World War II, he studied sociology at Masaryk University in Brno (1945-48) and worked as an editor of Svobodné noviny. He left Czechoslovakia in 1948 and continued his studies at the Universite de Lausanne, earning his doctorate magna cum laude in Zurich (1953). Since 1961 he has been Professor of Sociology, Chairman of the Sociology Department, and Directory of the University Center for Urban Research at the University of Pittsburgh. He has also been a Visiting Professor of Sociology in Heidelberg and Mannheim (1967-68) and the Dean of the Faculty of Social and Commercial Sciences at the University of Hong Kong (1970-71). In 1980 he worked with the National Science Foundation, analyzing problems of technology and social relations. He has published extensively in the fields of his expertise. ZEF ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ 5 [pageend5]What’s Your Thing? Here is the continuation of “our things’’ for your interest. We plan to enlarge this section in terms of both categories, and information. The Secretary, all officers of the Society and the editors of this Bulletin (all of whose addresses appear on the first page) will be glad to serve as liaisons between SVU members and interested readers. Communication is one of our main aims. HUMAN RIGHTS Dr. Pechota Honored by the American Jewish Committee On Sunday, May 17, 1981 Dr. Vratislav Pechota, a distinguished legal scholar at Columbia University and former Czechoslovak diplomat was awarded the first annual Andrei Sakharov Fellowship. Presented by the American Jewish Comittee (AJC), the award honors those who further “the right of the individual to know and act upon his rights and duties” and was granted to Dr. Pechota in recognition of his activities as Chief Legal Advisor to the Czechoslovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs during the Dubček regime. The AJC citation expresses the “belief that this award, and Dr. Pechota’s study, will contribute to the realization of Dr. Sakharov’s dream that nations the world over would indeed honor the fundamental commitments to human rights.” The award thus serves as a “symbol for men and women the world over of the repressive actions and harsh measures facing those who petition for their human rights. The fellowship also reaffirms the commitments of millions of Americans who see these violations as affecting us all.” Dr. Sakharov who celebrated his sixtieth birthday on May 21 was banished from Moscow by Soviet authorities last year for the human rights activities that led to his being awarded the Nobel Peace prize. Frank Meissner 8323 Still Spring Court Bethesda, MD 20817 ★ ★ ★ A Special Study on Czechoslovakia The Canadian Council of Captive European Nations ran a special study on Czechoslovakia in the August 1981 Newsletter on the occasion of the thirteenth anniversary of the Soviet invasion. The study is divided into chapters on various aspects of Czechoslovakia’s connections with Western culture. The study begins with a brief sketch of the history of the Czechs and Slovaks. We should underline the situation in the nineteenth century when increasing pressure by Germans and Hungarians created an atmosphere of Pan-Slav hopes centering on Russia. The Czechoslovak Republic and its development during the twenty years between its founding and Munich resulted in a modern state with an honorable place among Europe’s most progressive countries. Although the Soviet Union gave the impression of supporting Czechoslovakia, it never actually did anything for the country. 6 [pageend6]It was Pan-Slav illusions that formed the basis of Czechoslovakia’s trust in Russia in the following years, and that trust resulted in the alliance between Czechoslovakia and the USSR which, as early as December 1943, gave the Soviet Union a formal foothold in post-war Czechoslovakia. Next the study provides a comprehensive analysis of the development of economic and moral conditions in Czechoslovakia after the country was fully incorporated into the Soviet sphere of influence. The Prague Spring of 1968 remains a permanent monument to a failed experiment: “socialism with a human face.” When five-hundred-thousand troops of the Warsaw Pact nations invaded on August 20, 1968 they both quashed Czechoslovak hopes and served as a warning for other Soviet satellites. The study also includes basic information on human rights in Czechoslovakia, as formulated in Charter 77 and by VONS. We would like to pose two main questions. 1) Was Czechoslovakia’s lack of armed resistance in 1938, 1948 and 1968 right or wrong? 2) Is socialism with a human face possible or impossible? Although the study does not answer these questions, it provides much food for thought. The author of the study remains anonymous, but we are probably not far from wrong when we suggest it is the work of SVU member Dr. Jaroslav Bouček from Ottawa. LAK ★ ★ ★ LAK, Ladislav A. Krátky, is one of the original members of SVU. He has always had the growth of the Society at heart. He was early appointed West Coast Regional Representative and in that capacity greatly contributed to the establishment, in 1966, of the Los Angeles local chapter on whose board he has served ever since. Among his activities has been the co-editorship of the Los Angeles Bulletin, now entering its fourteenth year. His current function on the National SVU board is that of Auditor. Mr. Krátky has an engineering degree and is an expert in business and industrial administration and economics. Both he and his wife Olga live in retirement in Southern California, pursuing their multiple interests. One of Ladislav Kratky’s pet ideas has been the conviction that there is an enormous amount of direct, valuable knowledge among SVU members that should be recorded in some way for future historians of the First Czechoslovak Republic. He has himself written a memoir in Czech, entitled C12H22O11, which is the chemical formula for sucrose. The memoir deals with all aspects of the Czechoslovak sugar industry. Mr. Krátky characteristically never uses the first person singular, though we glimpse him here and there as an active and very observant participant. If legend has it that old Bohemia was a land of milk and honey, LAK’s memoir makes it clear that beets too helped to sweeten life for many countries of the pre-war world. See a short excerpt in Reminiscences. ZEF ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ 7 [pageend7]FINE ARTS Art Exhibition in Montreal Forty-one exhibits by fourteen Czechoslovak artists from the provinces of Montreal and Quebec were showcased during the Annual Meeting of SVU which took place last October in Montreal. They were acrylic paintings by Milan Lapka and Jana Jeniček; water-color paintings by George Kayser, Frantisek Mokrusa, and Anna Vojtechova; oil paintings by Ivan Dobroruka and George Bohdal; ceramics by Eva Lapka; Milos Reindl’s work in enamel, Helena Schmaus-Shooner’s sculptures in faience and Rose Raba-Reichman’s wood and soapstone creations. Pastels and ink were the media of Brano Kloco, while Olga Ulman created her “Golden Prague” on paper. Jaroslav Belik contributed three kinetic sculptures to the exhibition. The artists have exhibited at the Montreal Expo, in New York, Washington, D.C., Italy, Norway, Germany, etc. Comparing this roster with those from exhibitions organized for past SVU Congresses, we are struck by the number of new names and the variety of media. Liba Puchmajer (Westchester, New York) who is coordinating the new Fine Arts section, has excellent material to begin with. We hope to hear more about her section’s activities. ZEF ★ ★ ★ Contemporary Posters from Czechoslovakia The public is aware of the decorative genius of Alphonse Mucha, the Czech whose turn-of-the-century posters of actress Sarah Bernhardt and of The Seasons have been widely exhibited and reproduced as supreme examples of art nouveau. Since Mucha’s time poster design has changed enormously. This is as true in Czechoslovakia as in other countries where the poster survives as a medium of communication and culture. In fact, among the Czechs and Slovaks the poster does more than survive; it flourishes, it commands a loyal audience that finds its amalgam of words and forms to be more satisfying that fleeting, stereotyped television images. In Czechoslovakia posters are plastered on walls and bulletin boards, placed in windows, and purchased at galleries and museums. The posters on display announce art shows, movies, pantomime, plays, and other literary, artistic, and theatrical events. Many of these events occurred in the major cities of Prague, Brno, and Bratislava, but others were held in lesser towns with their own thriving museums and exhibition halls. Sometimes these are old castles and aristocratic palaces converted for cultural purposes. Most of the posters date from the 1970’s, a few from the 1960’s. Some are classics reprinted for new occasions. Persons familiar with Mucha’s work and the style of Parisian art nouveau (in Vienna and Berlin the parallel movements were called The Secession and Jugendstil) will recognize the vast distance the poster has traveled since that time. Yet despite all the differences one still observes certain enduring elements. For one thing, posters with cultural themes are seen as works of art, not merely as advertising or information: the finest artists in Czechoslovakia have tried their hands at posters at some time in their careers. For another, today’s posters retain two characteristic Central European qualities: wit, and a sense of history. Wit is a subjective attribute which one comes to appreciate by living in a country and among its people. The historical sense is more concrete. We see it represented graphically in persistent memories of 8 [pageend8]the past, in respect for landmarks in the country’s history, in the celebration of outstanding personalities and monuments of civilization. Those unfamiliar with Czech and Slovak traditions may not readily perceive these qualities in the posters on display, and some posters may lack them altogether; but all viewers can admire their composition, their use of color and typography, their pleasing visual effects. Under the old Austro-Hungarian empire the poster, as a specific art form aimed at a mass audience, developed slightly later in the lands that now comprise Czechoslovakia than it did in Western Europe and the United States. Shortly before World War I, a group of artists in Prague’s Manes Artists’ Union - among them Jan Preisler, Arnošt Hofbauer, and Max Svabinsky - began to use the poster as a vehicle for expressing nationality through popular culture. They combined ornamental with geometric motifs in their designs. Another group, called Artel, looked more to the late Secession by emphasizing geometric forms girded with bold typography. These artists, including Vratislav H. Brunner, Jaroslav Benda, and Frantisek Kysela, created an avant-garde constructivist style that foreshadowed advertising later in the 1920’s. The posters of the Great War, with their stark, simplified designs in the service of patriotic propaganda, signaled a clear break with the past and accelerated the new trends. In the 1920’s a new generation of Prague artists, the Devetsil group, introduced elements of left-oriented caricature, cabaret humor, circus themes, political satire, and photomontage. Devetsil exerted a lasting influence that extended beyond the poster into Czech film and architecture. The institution which has most profoundly shaped the graphic arts in Czechoslovakia is the Higher School of Industrial Art, established in Prague in 1885..From the outset it attracted faculty members from among the leading innovative artists. The School successfully transmitted the national heritage while adapting it to changing conditions. The State School of Graphic Arts in Prague also contributed to poster design and production. Similar schools in the applied arts, later founded in Brno, Zilina, Uherske Hradiště, and elsewhere, spread the new currents to other towns and cities. After World War II, and especially after 1948, the poster, like all media in Czechoslovakia, became subject to a central ideology advanced to promote a new social and political order. That many contemporary posters still embody older national traditions and demonstrate individual talents and original designs speaks eloquently for the abiding creativity of Czechoslovak graphic artists. * 2 w and S B W Zdenka Winters is associate director of the Sprague Library at Montclair State College.

Behal, first President of the Vienna chapter, recently has published Moebel des Jugendstils (Munich: Prestel-Verlag, 360 p., 444 illustrations, 11 plates in color: DM 120.-), a description of the art nouveau (or Viennese style) furniture collection at the Austrian Museum for Applied Arts. It is a thorough study of all 277 items in the collection and also gives the background of the style and information on the museum, individual cabinetmakers, their schooling and guilds, terminology, bibliography and related fields. Dr. Behal studied art history in Prague, Perugia and Vienna, and specialized in architecture and interior decoration. She has been connected with the museum for several years. ZEF ★ ★ ★ Czech Baroque in Paris The Grand Palais in Paris recently mounted an exhibition of Czech baroque art. Commenting on the collection in the French weekly L’Express, French art critic Otto Hahn shows a fair knowledge of Czech history during the Baroque period (the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries) and demonstrates how such famous Czech artists as painter Karel Skřeta, sculptors Ferdinand Brokof, Jan Jiri Bendi, Ignác Rohrback, and Matias Braun, and the graphic genius Vaclav Hollar created an art whose formal devices could be put to use in the fight against protestantism. What he does not seem to realize is that Prague was a major cultural center of Europe at the time. LAK ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ MASARYK STUDIES T. G. Masaryk in Perspective, Comments and Criticism, ed. Milic Čapek and Karel Hruby (SVU Press, 1981; 282 p.) Karel Hruby from Basel introduces the fifteen essays and explains the editorial plan. He also contributes the article “The Philosophical Roots of Masaryk’s Political Outlook” in the second section: The Meaning of History. The other editor, Milic Čapek, retired Professor of Philosophy at Boston University, offers “Concluding Remarks,” in addition to the essay “The Presence of Masaryk’s Thought” in the first section: Philosophical and Religious Views. The first essay of the book, “An Attempt at a Czech National Philosophy and Its Failure,” is by the important Czech philosopher and signatory of Charter 77, Jan Patočka (1907 - 1977). Another contribution, “The Essence of Masaryk’s Personality and What TGM Means to Us Today” by Vaclav Cerny, centers on the fate of Masaryk’s writings and influence in contemporary Czechoslovakia. io [pageend10]In the first section we also find Erazim Kohak’s “To Live in Truth: Reflections on the Moral Sense of Masaryk’s Humanism;” Roman Jakobson’s “Problems of Language in Masaryk’s Writings;” and Jan Milic Lochman’s“Emanuel Radi: In Masaryk’s Footsteps.” George J. Kovtun’s “Thomas G. Masaryk’s Road to Revolution” and Rene Wellek’s “T. G. Masaryk on the Meaning of Czech History” complement the second section. The third section, Sociological and Political Problems, includes: Jaroslav Krejci, “Masaryk and Revolution: A Humanist, His Sociology and Politics in the Light of History;” Antonie van den Beld, “Masaryk’s Morality of Humanity and the Problem of Political Violence;” Branislav Stefanek, “Masaryk and Slovakia;” Roman Szporluk, “Masaryk’s Republic; Nationalism with a Human Face;” Miroslav Novak, “Some Thoughts on Masaryk’s Critique of Marxism” and Jiri Voskovec, “TGM and Culture in the First Republic.” Very interesting is the appendix “On the Periodization of Czech History,” a text that first appeared in 1932 under the intials C.P. which reportedly stood for Czechoslovak President, i.e., TGM. Masaryk liked to use pseudonyms for the occasional articles of his post-academic era. Quotes from Masaryk’s writings are interspersed throughout, and the well-known portrait of T.G.M. by Oscar Kokoschka adorns the cover. The bibliography is extensive and up-to-date, and all that is missing is a section of brief notes on each author (most are SVU members) and an index. Those who read Czech will want to read Patocka’s study, “Kolem Masarykovy filosofie náboženství” (On Masaryk’s Philosophy of Religion) in Dve studie o Masarykovi (Two Studies on Masaryk) published last year by Sixty-Eight Publishers of Toronto with an introduction by Erazim Kohák. ZEF ★ ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★it POETRY Jaroslav Seifert - 80 We commented last May on the SVU publication of Jaroslav Seifert’s long poem The Plague Monument. The eightieth birthday of this dean of Czech poets was also remembered in Western Europe. Antonin Brousek published a lengthy article in Die Zeit (No. 45, November 6, 1981) giving a good overview of Seifert’s career. He discusses the political changes in Czechoslovakia during World War II and after 1948 when the poet could not publish freely. The article includes a German translation of three of Seifert’s poems from 1965. Seifert’s memoirs, All the Beauties of the World have recently been published in Czech in Canada. 11 [pageend11]"'Ne have just received from Sweden an announcement, which we reprint in full, of another tribute to Seifert, a book entitled: Jaroslav Seifert. Dve basn'e. Two Poems. Tva dikter. “Jaroslav Seifert, born 23 September 1901, is one of the founders of modern Czech poetry, having in the 1920s and 1930s written a large body of work in the modern idiom which at the same time showed a strong social conscience; he opposed fascism when his country was first threatened and then subjugated by it, and throughout his life has championed the dignity of man and freedom of expression. Seifert was the last elected President of the Czechoslovak Writers Union. Today his most recent collections of verse are banned in Czechoslovakia. On the occasion of the eightieth birthday of the greatest living Czech poet Jaroslav Seifert, who is also a Charta ’ll signatory, the Charta 77 Foundation in Stockholm has published a small bibliophile edition in 999 numbered copies. The book contains two of the master’s latest poems and a number of photographs. The texts are in Czech, English, Swedish and Latin. The book is not for sale. It will, however, be sent to those friends who contribute at least $35 to the Charta 77 Foundation for the support of persecuted people in Czechoslovakia.” If you are interested in the book, write to: The Charta 77 Foundation Box 50041 S-10405 Stockholm Sweden ZEF ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ Ethnic Studies Stephan Thernstrom, ed. Harvard Encylopedia of American Ethnic Groups. (Cambridge, MA and London, England: The Bellknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1980; XXV + 1076 p.; $60.00; oversize) The idea for this volume first arose in the mind of Louis Adamic, the well-known Slovene immigrant writer, during the 1930’s. He dreamed of an ethnic encyclopedia that would reflect the “sort of human stuff” this country was made of. He believed that it would be invaluable to school teachers, librarians and social workers, as well as appeal to the still basically immigrant public. One can only wish that the work had been carried out as a Works Progress Administration project at a time when both old time immigrants and sources related to them (not to mention federal subsidies) were more abundant. Unfortunately the much awaited volume is disappointing to all who wish to see more than just the top of the iceberg that is our ethnic heritage. Most entries are based on the few sources listed at the end. These bibliographies are cruelly brief and at times omit scholarly sources altogether. The attention devoted to some groups is out of proportion: six pages on the Basques, two on the Spaniards (those who arrived after 1820), followed by three more pages on the Spanish (earlier settlers who arrived in the footsteps of the conquistadors in the present southwest.) The next item is “Spanish-Surname,” as if there were no Germans named Lopez or Mexicans named Himmelfarb. There are seven pages on the West Indians, but all of Central plus South America is lumped together in eight. The Manx, 60,000 of whom inhabit the small Isle of Man, rate one and a half pages, Brazil with over 100 million people none. This utter neglect of half the hemisphere is offensive and unfortunately not atypical. All the Arab nations are squeezed into eight and a half pages, but the Albanians are spread over six. 12 [pageend12]Several small groups are subsumed in larger entries, which is understandable, yet the people of neither Monaco or San Marino figure at all. Southerners and Yankees are the newest additions, an innovation which has some merit, for instead of factionization these two groups offer a unifying balance in these days when pluralism is “in.” Canadians are listed under “Canadian, British,” but also under “French Canadians.” For Volga Tatars you have to look under Tatars, which is well and good, but why are the Bosnian Muslims under a separate entry rather than under Muslims? The locator maps are helpful, but over-all maps of the continents would have been even more so. Ironically, only Central and South America are featured in this respect. Most of the twenty thematic essays are interesting, but should have been set off from the body of the encyclopedia either at the end or in a sister volume. And why there is no index I cannot fathom. Adamic had faith that “eventually.. .this job will have to be done - somehow.” Well, it has been done, “somehow,” as even the editors admit. It must have been a frustrating job at times to piece together this opus, but it is equally frustrating for the scholar seeking documented knowledge to find a conglomeration of second-hand generalities, with no documentation and very little new material. Perhaps the book would have been saved by an extensive bibliography, but alas, there is none. Indeed, the encyclopedia may still be invaluable to teachers, librarians, and social workers, may still appeal to immigrants or their descendants, but scholars for the most part must proceed with their own excavations into the deeper strata of ethnic history. Vera Laska Regis College Weston, Mass. ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ Economics Samli, A. Coskun, Marketing and Distribution Systems in Eastern Europe. (New York: Praeger, 1978; XXIV + 129 p.) This book bridges some gaps in our knowledge of East European marketing and distribution systems. There is a special chapter dedicated to Czechoslovakia. The author asserts that the degree of advancement and marketing sophistication in East Europe depends on: (1) the stage of economic development; (2) the degree of economic centralization; and (3) the priority attributed to marketing. Most of the book deals specifically with marketing and distribution structures, functions and market research. The author maintains that there is evidence of growing convergence of the Eastern and Western marketing systems, and suggests that these countries still have an option in their marketing development; they can combine both equity and efficiency, desirable goals which seem to be beyond the reach of highly industrialized Western countries.

Send your remembrances and keep them alive. An Appreciation of a Real Friendship The sugar mills in Thornaby-on-Tees in Middlesborough in England are owned by the prestigious family Pumphrey. To manufacture their products according to time-honored British tradition, they needed a specific sugar, for many years supplied by the Czechoslovak sugar refinery at Melnik. On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the Czechoslovak Republic young Bevan Pumphrey visited Prague and Melnik. The author of these lines, a young secretary at the time, accompanied Mr. Pumphrey on his first visit. The encounter created the basis for a wonderful mutual friendship, nurtured by Mr. Pumphrey’s subsequent visits to Czechoslovakia. The last time he came to visit, he had to leave at night, on March 18, 1939, to escape the advancing Nazi Army. Both England and Czechoslovakia had a hard and heroic time of it during the Second World War. In 1945 Mr. Pumphrey published The Years of Endurance, a book devoted entirely to the Czechoslovak struggle for freedom. Old friends met again when Mr. Pumphrey’s companion was appointed to the Czechoslovak Embassy in London. Then came 1948, and the Czech left England for South America. But Mr. Pumphrey has always maintained his concern for the fate of Czechoslovakia, remaining in contact with his friend mostly by correspondence. This short reminiscence is a modest tribute to a Czecho-British friendship of more than fifty years.
