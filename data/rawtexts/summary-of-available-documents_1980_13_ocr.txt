Dr. Trevor Roberts D.Phil.M.A. JM.David. Registered Office 48 Hillbrook Road London SW17. Registered No. 2002047 [pageend1]SUMMARY OF AVAILABLE DOCUMENTS approx. 2, 900 words 1. Charter 77 Statement 9/80 We are issuing an analysis of the role and implementation of Article 109 of the Penal Code, which deals with one of the basic civil rights, that of freedom of movement and traveL This analysis is a follow-up of Charter 77 Document No. 24, On Freedom to Travel Abroad: it refers specifically to its Section II (Guarding the State Frontiers) and m A (Criminal Sanctions Against Unauthorised Emigrants). This analysis puts forward fresh viewpoints on criminal law practice, not contained in Document 24. 30 March 1980 Signed: Rudolf Battek, Marie Hromadkova, Milos Rejchrt, Charter 77 spokesmen. Analysis of Article 109 of the Penal Code. 1) Whoever leaves the territory of the Republic without permission shall be punished by imprisonment for a term of six months to five years, by reformatory measure or by forfeiture of property. 2) The same punishment shall be imposed upon a Czechoslovak citizen who stays abroad without permission. 3) The penalties of imprisonment for a term of three to ten years or forfeiture of property shall be imposed on whoever organises the acts defined in paragraphs 1 or 2, or takes across the frontier a group of persons, or repeatedly takes accross the frontier persons who are leaving the Republic without permission.' — Article 109 of the Penal Code. 'Everyone shall be free to leave any country, including his own.' — The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 12. Section I The new document has 9 sections. Section I sets out basic standpoints. The authors reiterate that the principles on which this document is based are the same as those announced in the introduction to Document 24. 'Men are born free and remain free. Freedom means to be able to do everything that does not harm another.' 'Twentieth-century man shall not be held in slavery or serfdom. Neither shall states restrict their citizens' freedom of movement and create in certain ways a situation similar to that of slavery or serfdom with the excuse that they have unlimited rights over their citizens.' IL Permission to Emigrate. Difficulties connected with legal emigration. The authors list the numerous documents which must be presented with an application for legal emigration, and describe the harassment and humiliation which the applicant is subjected to in the process. They stress that many citizens are deterred from applying because they know that if their application is turned down (as happens in the majority of cases), they will thence be classified as 'untrustworthy' and will be denied the right to a responsible 1. [pageend2]position, to education, to travel abroad even for a short stay and so on. Their nearest relatives will nrobablv suffer the same kind of discrimination. III. Unauthorised Ways of Leaving the Country. There are three ways of emigrating illegally: a) To travel to the West on a permitted short visit and to remain there. This constitutes a criminal act under Article 109 of the Penal Code. Offenders are usually sentenced in absentia. b) To travel to another Warsaw Pact country, especially Hungary or Poland, but also to Bulgaria, Rumania and the German Democratic Republic, where it is popularly believed that crossing the border will be easier. This is done either at checkpoints or airports, using forged documents, or an attempt is made at a place other than a checkpoint. c) To attempt to cross the Czechoslovak frontier in an unauthorised manner, mainly into the German Federal Republic or Austria. The document lists a few examples of this dangerous procedure. Plane hijacking, which is dangerous and, the authors claim, condemned by the majority of the population, comes under this category. This is described as the most tragic consequence of restriction on freedom to travel. Attention is drawn to proposals made in this connection in Charter Document 24. IV. Hundreds imprisoned under Article 109. Article 109 is one of the many articles of the Czechoslovak Penal Code which is in contradiction to the Czechoslovak Constitution and international covenants and agreements ratified by Czechoslovakia. Under this article Czechoslovaks who return to Czechoslovakia from unauthorised emigration or are caught trying to cross the frontier out of Czechoslovakia are imprisoned. Persons sentenced under this article are sent to fortress-type prisons, not to prison camps. They are subjected to a special regime and stricter surveillance, and are frequently interrogated by the Secret Service. V. Conviction of a 'completed criminal act under Article 109. Fewer people are imprisoned for 'completed criminal acts' than for prepared or attempted criminal acts. Such 'offenders' include unauthorised emigrants who return to Czechoslovakia or are arrested in transit through Czechoslovakia or in another Warsaw Pact country to which they have travelled from the West, either as a tourist or to visit a relative or even to attend the funeral of a close relative. Czechoslovaks apprehended in a Warsaw Pact country without a valid travel document are also convicted under Article 109, because the authorities automatically assume that such persons intend to emigrate to the West. Emigration in the opposite direction is never presumed. The sentences are frequently higher than a year and are never suspended. VI. Preparation and Attempt to Leave the Republic. The term 'preparation of a criminal act' is taken to mean an activity which is harmful to society and creates conditions for the commitment of a criminal act, in cases where the criminal act is neither attempted nor brought to completion. The term 'attempted criminal act' is taken to mean an activity harmful to society which leads directly to a criminal act even if the act is not actually committed. In some cases the Penal Code allows a lower sentence for the preparation of a criminal act but never in convictions under Article 109. This document repeats the hazards - set out in Document 24 - facing Czechs who try to leave their country without permission, noting that the risk of 2. [pageend3]imprisonment, or even death, does not act as a deterrent, and it describes fully the circumstances under which they may be arrested and charged. The authors stress that the vagueness of the instructions relating to Article 109 and the established practice frequently lead to instances of Czechoslovak citizens with valid passports being arrested in a Warsaw Pact country and charged, without any evidence, with intent to cross the frontier — for example, from Hungary to Yugoslavia — even if at the time of arrest they are 20 kilometres or more from the border, at a railway station or elsewhere. Czechs may also be arrested on the basis of verbal statements which the judiciary interprets as constituting either preparation or attempt to commit a criminal act. Frequently the only evidence are witnesses' testimonies which often conflict. Czechs are often imprisoned merely for being present at a discussion where the subject of emigration may have been alluded to only marginally. A biassed witness has the chance to take harsh revenge on a defendant. This leads to many unjust convictions. The authors of this analysis are of the opinion that an activity expressed in the form of words, written or oral, or in visual images cannot, in principle, endanger society. Therefore none such activity should be used as grounds for criminal prosecution unless it is directly linked with criminal activity. VII. Criminal Prosecution of Foreign Nationals under Article 109. In this section the authors set forth the circumstances under which foreign state nationals may be arrested under Article 109. They note that citizens of the German Democratic Republic returning home after serving a sentence in Czechoslovakia may be sentenced anew for the same criminal act and are usually given a higher sentence. VIII. The Purpose of Punishment. The authors quote Article 23/1 of the Penal Code which defines punishment as a means of protecting society from criminal activity, to prevent criminals from committing further criminal activity and to educate them for a decent life in society. They ask in what way a Czech wishing to depart the Republic is endangering the said republic, why he should be imprisoned, and why foreigners who enter Czechoslovakia illegally are punished more leniently than Czechoslovak citizens convicted under Article 109. The only explanation they can offer is that the legal position of the Czechoslovak citizen in this respect is akin to serfdom, and that he may not travel according to his will. They suggest ironically that a person imprisoned under Article 109 should be re-educated so that in future he will travel only with an authorisation and will return in time to Czechoslovakia. As it is most unlikely that he will be given the chance to travel after serving his sentence, the situation, the authors point out, is patently absurd. IX. Conclusion Among other things the authors suggest the abolition of Article 109, an immediate halt to criminal proceedings under this article, and they propose that all activities coming under this article should be treated merely as transgressions and not as criminal acts or misdemeanours. 3. [pageend4]Charter 77 Document 26, 'Theses on Consumption': Supplement No. 1. approx. 800 words 2. 'The Charter 77 spokesmen have received a contribution to discussion on Charter 77 Document 26, "Theses on Consumption". This is an analysis of the consumption of a four-person family before and after the price rises of this year. It was compiled by a group of non-signatories of the Charter who have asked Charter 77 to publish it.' Signed: Jiri Hajek, Zdena Tominova, Ladislav Hejdanek. 12 November 1979 The report examines the monthly expenditure of a four-person family and analyses the effect on its standard of living price increases, announced on 20 July 1979, had . The authors of the report have produced two sets of figures: one for what they term a family 'fully-equipped' according to contemporary standards, but not luxuriously so, and one for an 'average family'. They warn the reader that some of their figures are bas ed on only partial research and that others only constitute estimates.. They challenge the trade unions and the mass media to produce a more accurate picture of the rise in the cost of living. According to their analysis, the monthly expenditure of an average family before the price rises came to 5, 172 crowns. The average gross wage is 2, 517 crowns. This means that even a family with two wage-earners and an average monthly income of 5, 034 crowns is unable to cover all necessary expenditure. After the price increases, the cost of living for the average family increased by 604 crowns per month. The report suggests that the highest proportion of family expenditure goes on food — 37.5% this is followed by consumer durables —24.6%: clothing — 18.7%: rent and fuel — 10.4%: recreation, transport and information — 8.8%. The authors estimate that the average expenditure of a fully-equipped family increased by 756 crowns — i. e. 13.1% — as a result of the price increases. The report contains a thorough statistical analysis of the price increases for individual items. 3. Report on conditions in Bory prison. approx. 1, 800 words On 19 March 1980 the three Charter 77 spokesmen issued Charter 77 Statement 8/80 in which they announced that they had received a report on conditions in the prison at Bory near Pilsen. (For the full text, see Bulletin No. 13.) The following is a summary of the report. There are 2000 prisoners in Bory prison, divided into five sectors. The fifth sector is a special one, isolated from the others and designed mainly for psychopaths and some political prisoners. The first section of the report describes the prominent role played by ten prisoners appointed to the Prisoners' Administration of each sector. These prisoners are mainly people convicted of murder, rape, or robbery. 4. [pageend5]The report then discusses solitary confinement and discusses the reasons for which a prisoner may be sentenced to solitary confinement. It gives the examples of Jiri Chmel who received twenty days in solitary because he requested a visit from someone who was not related to him and Frantisek Pitor who got thirty days for having more tobacco than was allowed. The solitary confinement cell measures four by two metres: it has three wooden slats, a shelf, a tap, and a toilet bowl. Prisoners are forbidden to read, smoke or lie down. The report then goes on to discuss the inadequacy and arbitrariness of the medical care which prisoners receive and it describes the case of convict Vavra who, as a result of inadequate medical attention, had to have a toe amputated and is now threatened with the loss of a whole leg. There then follows a section which gives a detailed description of an average week's 'menu', showing a clear shortage of vitamins and protein. The next section deals with visits and parcels and discusses the frequent so-called 'isolated visits'. These take place in a separate room with only the prisoners, their visitors, and one warder who listens to everything. The detailed bodysearch of visitors and examination of the three-kilogram parcel which they are allowed to bring are mainly carried out in the case of political prisoners. In a section dealing with the special position of political prisoners, the report discusses the various ways in which political prisoners are discriminated against. For example, they are not allowed to take part in hobby circles, and they receive harsher punishment for failing to fulfil their work norm. Petr Cibulka, for example, got 15 days' solitary confinement while others from his work team only received 5 days' of confinement to their cells after work. The last section deals with work conditions which, according to the report, are worst in the third sector where glass jewellry is cut and polished. The norms are extremely tough. For example, in 1979 only one out of fifty teams was able to fulfil the norms. Since whole teams are responsible for norm fulfilment, those who are unable to maintain the pace get beaten up by the others, as happened to Petr Cibulka. There are frequent injuries, mainly burns, cuts, and gas poisoning. The report gives concrete examples of prisoners forced to work even when injured. The report concludes that conditions in the prison violate the law on prison conditions and that they result in permanent physical and psychological harm to the convicted. According to the report, these conditions continue to deteriorate. 4. Report on appeal trial of the six VONS members. approx. 12, 000 words. This is a detailed report on the appeal trial of Vaclav Havel, Jiri Dienstbier, Vaclav Benda, Petr Uhl, Otta Bednářová, and Dana Nemcova before the Czech Supreme Court on 20 December 1979. The Chairman of the court was Dr Maria Dojcarova and the Public Prosecutor — Dr Jan Balas. Eight relatives of the defendants and 30 unknown people were present at the proceedings. Immediately after the trial opened, Vaclav Benda and Petr Uhl protested against the bias of the court and Uhl also argued that Dr Balas violated the law since he had authorised both the detention of the defendants 5. [pageend6]on 29 May and its subsequent extension. Dojcarova warned right at the beginning that no notes could be taken since this would be regarded as an intul to the court. She then spent two-and-a-half hours reconstructing the case, quoting from the Municipal Court’s verdict and the protocol of the proceedings but at no point allowing even the smallest doubt regarding e correctness of the arguments used during the trial. Just the contrary when reading out the names of other people associated wife VONS, she commented on them in such a way as to betray her bias. All the defence lawvers lodged a formal complaint concerning the bias of the court stressing that Dojcarova and others judges present had been involved in many of the cases taken up by VONS and thus had to be biased. The court then adjourned for an hour at midday and Dojcarova subsequently announced that the judges had made a written statement to the effect that they did no consider themselves biased and that the Chairman of the Supreme Court had analysed these statements and the court materials and had rejected the complaint. (In fact, the court materials never left the courtroom.) In the afternoon, Benda's and Dienstbier's defence lawyers asked, among other things for the relevant VONS statements to be read in full and for the full justification of their clients' appeals to be read out also. This was rejected on the grounds that the Supreme Court did not exist 'to prove anything • Public Prosecutor, Dr Balas, justified his own appeal in which he asked for all written materials and typewriters found in the homes of the defendants be confiscated because 'they were used to commit criminal acts . He also demande the confiscation of money found on the grounds that it had been given to support criminal acts. All the defence lawyers argued against the Public Prosecutor's appeal and pointed out the shortcomings of the evidence against their respective clients. All of the m were equally courageous in their defence. (Benda's lawyer from the previous trial, Dr Benka, had resigned and been replaced by Dr Radvan.) The Prosecutor final speech was extremely hostile, consisted almost entirely of political terminology, and argued that international law allows every state to protec itself against enemies. Later Dojcarova allowed the appellants (six relatives of the accused — Anna Sabatova, Olga and Ivan Havel, Jan and Jiri Bednar, and Kami a Bendova - who have appealed against the sentences) to speak. They were totally unprepared for this and so their speeches were short and improvised. They were, though, a e to convey to the defendants the international response and solidarity and the protest actions within the country on their behalf. The report then gives t e final speeches of all the defendants. In contrast to their earlier trial, they were allowed to speak without interruption. 5. Vaclav Havel's trial speeches. Palach Press can now make available the full text of Vaclav Havel's final speech at his trial in October before the Prague Municipal Court. (Approx. 3, 300 words) 6. [pageend7]Extracts were earlier available in the transcript of the trial proceedings (Palach Press Bulletin No. 12, Document No. 2) but this is the first time that the full text is available. Also available is the full text of Havel's speech at his appeal trial in December 1979. (Approx. 1, 100 words) Havel begins his October speech by explaining why he joined VONS. He recounts his experience of January 1978 when he spent six weeks in prison as a result of an unjust accusation and realised how easy it is to be unjustly prosecuted in Czechoslovakia. He then attempts to give a thorough answer to the question of why VONS now finds itself on trial. Havel starts from the premise that the authorities identify themselves with truth and therefore reject the notion that someone can be prosecuted unjustly in this society. He explains the implications of this dangerous and false notion which he believes to be the main assumption underlying the indictment against him and his friends. Havel then goes on to discuss what the 115 VONS statements have been about and how they came to be written. He then analyses the position of the prosecution and shows why it is impossible for it to allow an objective analysis of the VONS statements as this would destroy its case. He spends some time showing how words with emotional connotations are used in the indictment and how, without such words, there is absolutely no evidence against VONS. He then analyses the arguments put forward in the indictment to justify the assertion that VONS is hostile to socialism. Hg> shows how the authorities identify every individual unit of the system with the state and social system as a whole and how absurd it is to perceive any criticism of the security service, prosecution, or judge as an expression of hostility towards the whole system. Havel then destroys the indictment's claim that VONS is a political organisation and refutes the arguments regarding the illegality of its activity. He demonstrates the total absence of any evidence which would show that VONS ever distributed its statements within the country or abroad and he again describes the attitudes of both the defence and the prosecution. In conclusion, he gives his opinion as to what motivated him and his friends to work for VONS and reminds the court that two months earlier, while in detention, he was offered the possibility of going to the United States. Havel argues that the fact that he did not take up this offer indicates that he is not hostile to socialism, that he does not feel himself to be guilty, and that he has not lost faith in justice. In his December speech, Havel shows bow the verdict of the Prague Municipal Court was based on no evidence whatsoever. He compares the relevant passages from the verdict with both the evidence presented and with reality. He shows that all the accusations against VONS are politically motivated and are groundless. Havel then analyses the available evidence concerning his own personal involvement and comes to the conclusion this consists solely of the fact that he was a member of VONS and that all the other accusations are groundless, hi conclusion, he summarises the proceedings of the Municipal Court which, in his view, violate the law, and asks the Supreme Court to quash the verdict and in this way remedy an injustice which shames the Czechoslovak judicial system. Special issue of 'Information on Charter 77', covering December 1979. 6. Contents: Charter 77 letter of 9 January 1980 to the Federal Assembly: - Situation report on the appeal trial of the 6 VONS members, 21 December 1979^ 7. [pageend8]- Full text of VONS Statement 158 on the appeal trial, 28 December 1979; - Written testimony of Jean-Jacques Marie, editor of the French edition of Listy, 19 December 1979; - Open letter to the Supreme Court of Czechoslovakia, 18 December 1979: signed by 774 people; - Translation of Le Monde's report on the dramatisation of the trial, staged in Paris. The Charter letter to the Federal Assembly constitutes a lengthy analysis of the violation of justice committed by the Supreme Court in confirming the sentence on the six VONS members passed by the Municipal Court in Prague in October. The Charter spokesmen refer to Article 29 of the Constitution which gives them the right to turn to the highest organ of state power and draw attention to facts which, in their view, constitute a violation of socialist legality and harm the interests of the Republic abroad. They quote from both Article 17 of the Constitution and the Federal Assembly's decision of 1977 concerning the strengthening of socialist legality to show that the activity of VONS members is perfectly in harmony with the law. They then list the various ways in which the judicial authorities have violated the law, and express their belief that the harassment of members of the public and foreign observers who wanted to attend the trial was also such a violation. The Charter spokesmen criticise the one-sided interpretation of Article 98 on subversion and, in order to prevent any such interpretation in the future, they recommend that the Federal Assembly take steps to eliminate certain contradictions between the Penal Code on the one hand and the Constitution and the International Covenant on Political and Civil Rights, on the other. They also ask the Federal Assembly to investigate this particular case. In conclusion, they refer to certain articles of the Constitution and the International Covenant on Political and Civil Rights which give them the right to inform the public of the contents of their letter. The situation report on the appeal trial of the six VONS members describes the court proceedings and the harassment of the public, journalists, and lawyers outside the courtroom. For the open letter and VONS Statement 158, see Palach Press Bulletin No. 12. 7. Jiri Hajek, former Charter 77 spokesman and former Czechoslovak Foreign Minister, 'On Charter 77's Third Anniversary'. approx. 1, 500 woi Hajek summarises the three-year history of the Charter. He asserts that the government's repressive campaign against the Charter early in 1977 helped to popularise the Charter and drew attention — even more convincingly than the Charter declaration — to the discrepancy between the Government's declared principles, laws and obligations, and its daily practice. Hajek claims that now, in 1980, Charter 77 has become an integral part of the life of Czechoslovak society and is firmly established in the awareness of hundreds of thousands of people. He points out that a lot of people who are not signatories support and cooperate with the Charter, distributing its material or writing about their own problems even when they know that such help as may be given can only be of a moral nature. 8. [pageend9]Hajek sees the Charter as an appeal for consistent implementation of socialist legality in the spirit of the Czechoslovak Constitution (Article 17): an appeal addressed not only to the authorities but to every single citizen. He describes the state-blessed 'social contract', under which those who pretend to obey orders are permitted to acquire consumer goods by all means possible. Charter 77, says Hajek, is fighting such a concept of the life of society. He underlines the pluralist character of the Charter and asserts that true democracy is essential for its continued development and effectiveness, and also to ensure that the Charter does not enclose itself in a ghetto. In conclusion, Hajek maintains that the Charter is at the moment only an appeal, and admits that it still lacks a response in the form of a broad initiative and action by those social forces whose interests the Charter expresses, or in the form of wise, positive steps by at least a section of the power elite, going halfway toward meeting those interests. Therefore there is a need to repeat the appeal with even greater emphasis and conviction in the broadest context as well as in concrete situations. Milos Rejchrt, a Charter 77 spokesman, 'What Charter 77 has accomplished in three years'. approx. 900 words 8. Re-stating the aims of Charter 77, Rejchrt says that one of them was to establish a dialogue on human and civil rights with the state power. He admits that no dialogue has been accomplished^ instead the Charter has been treated to a monologue by the secret police. Rejchrt admits too that prognostications of intensified repression have proved correct, but asserts that this itself has confirmed the truth of Charter 77's founding declaration and the genuineness of its raison d'etre. Quoting J. S. Mill's axiom that whoever persuades the public of the need for reform has taken a decisive step toward its realisation, Rejchrt stresses that the Charter has definitely strengthened the public's conviction that something must change. Rejchrt himself believes the idea of a dialogue need not be relinquished: three years, after all, only spans infancy. Rejchrt asserts that the Charter's most valuable achievement — albeit unplanned — is the creation of a community based on mutual solidarity. Among activities connected with Charter 77 he describes the growing samizdat publishing activity, as well as lectures and discussions held in private flats. He observes that these not only underline the abnormal state of official culture but also indicate that intellectual life in Charter circles is not a form of luxury easily exchangeable for any other form. To write poems, novels and essays, to sing and paint, preach and teach, to read poems and novels, to listen to music, sermons and lectures — all this does not amount to something that can, but need not, be: it must be even if there is no daily bread. Rejchrt maintains that the Charter's programme is the minimal one outlined in its founding declaration. Therefore it is not, and doesn't intend to be, an opposition of the conscience of the nation. He would like to see a thousand 9. [pageend10]flowers bloom outside the framework of the Charter. He maintains that the Charter should continue to work on the lines of its constitution, that is, to draw attention to cases of violations of human rights and prepare relevant documentation, to suggest solutions, propose guarantees of these rights, and act as intermediary in conflicts, etc. He appeals to the Chartists to tolerate differences of opinion among themselves, and suggests they try to dispel the impression that they are dissidents and factionists. He says that their struggle — which is aimed not against anything but for justice and freedom to live in truth and love — is rooted in good, solid spiritual traditions 'which, like us, are at home in the heart of Europe’. Letter from Otta Bednarova to the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly, 11 November 1979. approx. 500 words plus a supplement of 400 words 9. Otta Bednářová writes from prison and draws the Assembly's attention to the case of five people, including herself, sentenced to a total of 19j years' imprisonment. She argues that their only crime was that they fulfilled their duty as citizens in turning to the competent authorities in open letters concerning cases where they believed the law to have been violated. None of these letters was ever answered, despite the fact that these cases should not have been left without an investigation and despite the fact that all official bodies are supposed to at least react to any letter which is signed with a full name and address. Bednářová states that it is absurd that the citizens' initiative, the Committee to Defend the Unjustly Prosecuted (VONS), which based itself on the citizen's right, guaranteed by the Constitution, to react or comment on the work of government organs, either individually or collectively, found themselves in the dock and were sentenced precisely for these legal activities. She sees a certain analogy between this trial and those of the 1950s, particularly in the sense that the indictment and proceedings were entirely fabricated. She also states that the authorities only added to the 'pathetic farce' by the humiliating march of the defendants through a maze of corridors cleared of people and guarded by armed policemen, which she believes was intended to exert psychological pressure on the defendants. Bednářová complains that she does not receive her letters in the proper order: sometimes they are delayed for a month and sometimes they are confiscated. She believes this cannot be in harmony with the regulations. Tn conclusion she asks the Federal Assembly to investigate and remedy the situation. She adds that if the Federal Assembly decides to do nothing, a copy of her letter is to be sent to the participants of the Madrid Conference which will review the implementation of the Helsinki Agreement, Bednářová considers that the supplement which accompanies her letter constitutes important evidence for the commission which will be dealing with the observation of human rights. It consists of her reaction to the indictment, which she was prevented from reading out to the court at her trial ón 22 October. 10. [pageend11]Bednářová's speech begins with the categorical rejection of the entire indictment. She explains that she rejects it not only because she does not consider herself guilty of anything but also because of important moral considerations which make it impossible for her to take any part in the proceedings. She then briefly explains the motivation behind her decision. She recalls how, in 1962, she was present during the public rehabilitations of victims of the trials of the 1950s. She describes how she 'wanted to know the truth and received a cruel lesson about how the defendants, witnesses, and the whole court had been manipulated'. Bednářová says that she discovered how 'indictments are drawn up, fabricated, and used and also how such indictments and their authors subsequently collapse'. She was interested to find out why some witnesses testified during the 1950s and in the 1960s withdrew their testimony: why judges sentenced people and ten years later regretted their verdicts and apologise to those they had prosecuted or to their widows and children. She explains that during the 1950s she was silent and that she feels guilty about this: 'I know nothing which, in my eyes, can justify me, not even my youth — I was then 23 years old — and not even the fact that everyone else, the whole public, was silent.' She stresses that at that time she promised herself never again to be indifferent and that by her present activity she is fulfilling that promise. She explains that she signed the Charter and worked in VONS so that the tragic events of the 1950s could never be repeated. Bednářová has added a short introduction to both the letter and the supplement, addressed to the commission on human rights at the Madrid Conference. She explains that because the Federal Assembly showed an unwillingness to deal with her letter, she is turning to them for help and gives her address in prison. She asks them to deal with the whole case of all the VONS members. Letter from Otta Bednarová to Dr Evzen Erban, Chairman of the Czech National Council. 10. Bednarova begins with a reference to Erban's article in the Communist Party daily, Rude Pravo, on 10 December 1979 in which he states that human rights are respected in Czechoslovakia in all fields. She says that she is making use of the right, specified in the Constitution, to draw Erban's attention to cases which contradict his claim. She lists five such cases, beginning with the persecution of children who are not allowed to study, as described in Charter 77 Document 4 which listed 20 concrete cases. Secondly, she refers to Charter 77 Letter to the Federal Assembly of May 1977 (see Palach Press Summary No. 7, Document No. 1) which drew attention to the fact that people were losing their jobs just because they had signed the Charter. This document gives 40 concrete examples and Bednářová says that she could add at least anoiher twenty names herself. Thirdly, she states that a number of writers are banned from publishing and musicians from performing, and she refers to Charter 77 Document 12 which published the names of 130 people banned in this way. Fourthly, Bednářová quotes from Charter Document 24 on freedom of travel and notes that she belongs among those who have been deprived of their passport and banned even from travelling to the socialist countries. Finally, she gives the example of ten members of VONS, including herself, arrested in May 1979, and she recalls the 11. [pageend12]ceaseless persecution of Charter spokesmen. She also recalls her own sentence and stresses that she rejects the verdict and regards the sentence as totally unjust and she demands that Erban investigate the case personally. Again, she asks that, if he is not prepared to do anything, he pass on her letter to the Madrid Conference since she believes that everything which she has described is in clear violation of the Final Act of the Helsinki Agreement and should therefore be discussed at Madrid. The Trial of Dr Josef Danisz. 11. Palach Press can supply the full text of the indictment and the verdict of the Hradec Králové District Court which, on 24 January 1980, sentenced Dr Josef Danisz to ten months' imprisonment. On 7 February, the Regional Court heard Dr Danisz's appeal against the sentence. The text of the appeal, together with Dr Danisz's objection concerning the bias of both the District and Regional Courts, was submitted to the Supreme Court and copies sent to the General Public Prosecutor's office, the Ministry of Justice, and the President of the Republic. In his appeal, Danisz asks for the verdict of the District Court to be quashed on the basis of the arguments which he sets out. He offers a detailed, legalistic analysis of the whole judicial procedure, quoting from the Penal Code, the Constitution, and regulations governing court procedures to show the way in which the District Court has violated the law. However, the majority of Danisz's argument applies to all legal cases and not just to his own. Particularly relevant is his discussion of the way in which the principle of public access to trials is violated, the manifestation of bias on the part of judges, the inequality of the two parties, the judges' dependence on the police, and the treatment of witnesses. Danisz's submission is thus of great value to all those who wish to understand the workings of the Czechoslovak judiciary. (approx. 9,000 words) 'The Defence of the Unjustly Prosecuted — the Notion and the Reality'. 12. approx. 4,450 words This article, written by three pseudonymous authors and published in Information on Charter 77, No. 5/1980, discusses the term 'the defence of the unjustly prosecuted' — a term which has become very well known since April 1978 when the Committee to Defend the Unjustly Prosecuted was launched. The authors set out to explain in detail why such wording was used, in order to avoid misinterpretation of the term and, therefore, of VONS' purpose. They argue that the name of the Committee has a very clear-cut internal logic. They explain that the term 'defence' includes the publicising of topical cases of prosecution which is in itself a form of assistance to the victims of their families. They acknowledge that concrete help — financial, legal, and so on — is important but consider that moral help is the most important. The word 12. [pageend13]’defence’ also includes the documentation of cases, past and present, from which society can draw information about its own state. In this sense, the defence of individual cases is not only important for the people concerned but also for all those who may be affected in this way in the future and for the whole society. The term 'prosecuted' is used in police and judicial practice in particular and it is therefore clear that the defence concerns people affected by persecution in this particular way. The authors then go on to explain at length the term 'unjustly'o They reject the view that it is only political prisoners who are unjustly prosecuted on the grounds that this would be elitist and contrary to the spirit of Charter 77. They state that at this moment there are thousands of prisoners in Czechoslovakia and that every one of them has been, in one way or another, prosecuted unjustly. They explain the shortcomings of the judicial process: interrogations are frequently lacking in thoroughness, psychological and physical pressure is generally applied, the principle of presumption of innocence is frequently violated, detention before trial is much too long, conditions in prison often harm the health of prisoners, there is no genuine re-education of prisoners, and so on. They explain that, of course, it is not possible to defend all prisoners 100 per cent in everything that they may have done but it is necessary to struggle for a change which would make Czechoslovak prisons into institutions where those among the convicted who were in need of help and re-education would receive it. The authors then describe in detail the way in which VONS takes up individual cases, beginning with ascertaining the objective side of the matter and then going on to the subjective side. VONS tries to find out whether the alleged crime actually took place and under what circumstances and then evaluates whether it merits prosecution and whether the prosecution and sentence accord with the gravity of the offence. They conclude that in cases of unjust prosecution one can detect certain stereotypes, given by the nature of the law, its vague formulations which permit its misuse. They then summarise the individual forms of unjust prosecution which have so far preoccupied VONS. They have classified these articles of the law which are most frequently misused into eight sections. The first of these are verbal acts of a political nature. This group of offences accounts for the largest number of prosecutions and consists of attitudes and actions associated with political and religious convictions. The authors of the report list the articles of the Penal Code most often used in such cases and explain with the aid of a number of examples how each of them is used to prosecute people for their political convictions, sometimes leading to prosecution for completely trivial acts. The relevant articles are: 98 — subversion of the republic-, 99 — damaging a state belonging to the world socialist system; 100 — incitement; 101 — abuse of religious office; 102 & 103 — defamation of the republic, its leading state organs, or leading representatives; 104 — defamation of a state belonging to the world socialist system; 105 — espionage; 112 — damaging the interests of the republic abroad; 13. [pageend14]178 — obstructing supervision over churches and religious societies; 198 — defamation of a nation, race, and conviction; 199 — spreading alarming news; 260 — support and propagation of fascism and similar movements; 268 — evasion of military service. 2) Verbal acts of a non-politic al nature. Here the relevant articles are: 153, 154, 156, 157 — assault upon a state organ and organ of a public organisation; 3) Freedom of travel. The relevant articles are: 109 — leaving the republic; 110 — penetration onto the territory of the republic. 4) Disturbance of the peace. Article 202 on rowdyism. 5) Parasitism — article 203. 6) Obstructing the implementation of an official decision — article 171. 7) A number of articles dealing with general criminal acts have been misused, including — article 155 (assault on a public agent), 118 (unauthorised business enterprise) and 132 (pilferage of property in socialist ownership). 8) Refusal to carry out military service or to serve in armed units has been dealt with under articles 266 (frustrating fitness for military service), 267 & 268 (evading the draft and military service), and other articles dealing with evasion of military service. In conclusion, the authors mention that VONS should criticise the existence of the death sentence more effectively. They also note that the defence of the unjustly prosecuted can be carried out by drawing attention to criminal acts committed by the police, judicial authorities, and other organs of state power. In this connection, they point to criminal acts against freedom and human dignity. They stress that the defence of the unjustly prosecuted demands consistent activity and constant attention to cases — not only present but also past — accuracy and objectiviiy, a clear perception of the course the defence will take and of what is just and what is unjst, and a relatively clear view of future possibilities. The authors invite people to join in a thorough discussion of all these themes and to participate in the work outlined. Rudolf Slansky, 'Will the "Series of Measures to improve the planned national economy" solve the crisis situation?' approx. 1, 700 words 13. Rudolf Slansky is the son of Rudolf Slansky, the Party First Secretary who was executed in 1952. In the years 1968-9 Slansky wrote a number of interesting articles on the problems facing enterprise and workers' councils. He has worked as a technician in a factory for many years. Slansky asserts that the economic situation in Czechoslovakia is extremely serious. For this reason the public is showing greater than usual interest in the implications of a Series of Measures to Improve the Planned National Economy, recently issued by the government. Slansky discusses these measures. They are divided thematically into two basic sections. The first comprises measures to strengthen the authority of the power of the central organs, in particular the State Planning Commission and the respective ministries; in other words to increase the degree of centralisation of economic planning and management. The centre will determine the volume of production, down to the smallest details, and will control the amount of raw materials, fuel and energy allocated to the individual 14. [pageend15]industries and enterprises. The centre will impose stricter limits on imports and ministries will be authorised to conclude contracts for deliveries of products in the name of the enterprises. The new measures will preserve the division between production and export trade and world markets. The second section introduces new economic instruments or indicators aimed at strengthening the enterprises' interest in fulfilment of targets set by the centre, and at the same time ensuring that they do not ignore such criteria as efficiency, technological innovation and so on. The main yardstick for the evaluation of enterprise activity will be its own performance. This means that the gross output indicator, which includes the value of purchased materials, will no longer be used. Thus the enterprise will not be able to use more expensive materials in order to fulfil their plam Nevertheless, the indicator evaluates the quantity rather than quality of manufactured products^ so enterprises will be able to improve their fulfilment of the plan by squandering labour instead of materials. Awards and premiums will be tightly dependent on fulfilment of the production plam Enterprises will have to finance their needs from their profits. However, Slansky stresses, the central organs reserve the right to intervene, for example, to redistribute profits and limit investments. In Slansky's view the measures do not affect some important aspects of the national economy, such as the content of the main production programmes, the volume and direction of investments, the share of consumption in the national income, the influence of foreign trade, obligations stemming from integration with the Comecon countries, military expenditure, the scale of aid to countries like Vietnam, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Angola, Afghanistan and others. Slansky argues that the two basic tendencies of the proposed measures, that is strengthening the authority of the central organs and reinforcing the role of economic instruments, are in direct contradiction to each other. Economic instruments can be effective only if it is their influence on choice of production plans, investment decisions, size of work force, prices, direction of technological development, which is decisive. Slansky sees a similarity between these measures and those agreed upon in 1958, which failed then to improve the economic situation or to prevent the economic cr isis of 1961-64. Economic instruments are effective, only if the economy is decentralised, he claims. He describes the impact decentralisation would have and shows why the government is afraid of it. In his conclusion Slansky stresses that prices of raw materials and methods of management have less effect on the state of the economy than the overall state of society which today does not offer citizens adequate social-political motivation for good work. He therefore believes that the economic problems which are the consequence of the crisis of society as a whole cannot be solved without positive steps to reduce tension and overcome this crisis. 15. [pageend16]14. Open letter from Julius Tomin to the President of the Republic, Dr Gustav Husak. On 7 April 1980 Dr Julius Tomin wrote to Dr Husak complaining of the harassment to which he and students attending his philosophy seminars had been subjected. He recounts how he visited Dr Husak's office on 14 March to inform him of how the Security Service had disrupted two lectures — one by William Newton-Smith of Oxford on the rationality of science and one by Radim Palous on the phenomenology of meaning. Tomin also visited the Philosophy Faculty branch of the Socialist Youth Movement at Charles University and asked that two students attend the coming lecture by Radim Palous on 19 March in order to see what was really going on. He made similar requests to the Faculty of Law branch of the Youth Movement, the City office of the Prague Academy, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party. Tomin then recounts how, on 19 March, Radim Palous' lecture, which was to have taken place in Ivan Dejmal's flat, was disrupted by Security officials. Tomm was dragged off and detained with seven other people present. He describes similar incident which took place on 2 March when he had intended to begin a series of lectures on Aristotle's Metaphysics. Tomin then asks why all this should happen to someone who simply wants to discuss what Aristotle thought two thousand years ago and why Security officials should want to stop people from educating themselves. He reminds Husak of how he sent him his first studies of Aristotle nearly ten years ago. These had been written while Tomin was working as an engineer at the Holešovicky electrical plant. One theme of these studies was the difference between manual and mental labour and Aristotle's view of the relationship between the slave and his master. 'Aristotle defined the man whose nature made him a slave as one who participated in intellectual activities to a certain degree ... but lacked the capacity for active reasoning and creative thought, qualities which fit a man for action, make it possible for him to participate fully in human society and license him for such participation.' Society no longer has any need of slaves, argues Tomin: 'Marx recognised this new historical reality and devoted his whole life to a study of the conditions on which the growth of man's opportunities for full self-development depend.' Tomin concludes by asking, '... is it possible for our society to change to such an extent that there may be a place for a few young people who want to ask in company whether personal educational development makes it possible to lead a good, strong, fair human life? A few young people, who either do manual work or hunt in vain for employment — and, moreover, were expelled from the universities only because they heard a lecture by a visiting philosopher from Oxford?' Finally, he invites Husak to attend the next lecture on 9 April: 'It is not impossible that your presence may suffice to deter officials of the Ministry of the Interior from further action, which they have otherwise "promised".' approx. 1,350 words 16. [pageend17]Jindrich Andrs, ’A trap or a battle-ground?' approx. 1, 900 words 15. Under the pseudonym Jindřich Andrs the author discusses at length the Socialist Union of Youth - the SSM. Quoting from its Constitution, he shows that the SSM's'activity is rooted in the programme of the KSC (Communist Party of Czechoslovakia) and is the Party's active collaborator'. In another document the SSM states: 'We have witnesses attempts to overthrow the socialist order ... right-wing and anti-socialist forces wanted to misuse our youth ... They destroyed our unified organisation. The outcome was in the balance: the scales were tipped in favour of socialism by Soviet aid.' This leads to the conclusion that the SSM is an organisation whose purpose is to strengthen the ruling dictatorship and which actively supports the occupation of Czechoslovakia., Despite this, the majority of young people between 15 and 30 are members, says Andrs, and he seeks an explanation. As he sees it, the SSM is divided into two distinct parts: the controlling apparatus and the basic organisations at schools and workplaces. The controlling apparatus symbolises what the SSM sets out to be, that is, an anti-democratic, collaborationist organisation. Union officials strive to indoctrinate young people with dognatic Stalinism and teach them hypocrisy and deception. They encourage people to inform on colleagues and supericrs and recruit members by threatening those who refuse with a poor political testimonial (which among other things would rule out acceptance at a university). Andrs argues that most of the ordinary members joined solely for this reason and that once admitted, they show no interest in the SSM's political activity. Logically there is a clash between the apathetic members and the apparatus. However, the apparatus lacks the means to control the complex situation and the rank-and-file member wishes to avoid a confrontation, so a compromise acceptable to both sides is reached: no activity is, in fact, performed but plenty is recorded. Many a time a fictitious action is recorded in factories three times: by the SSM, the Communist Party and the trade union. However, says Andrs, the rank and file have gradually compelled the SSM to cater for special interests, like sport and culture, particularly in country districts. Summarising SSM's history, Andrs recalls that when it was founded, in November 1970, it consisted of a small group of young people who were universally hated. It took more than two years to set up an organisation, and a long time after its inauguration it was still an elitist organisation of fanatical believers in simplified Stalinist dogmas. But the regime needed a mass organisation. It needed from every man an admission that he feared the regime and was subjugated by it. As regards young people, the SSM provided the vehicle. Whereas in 1970 and 1971 membership was an honour, today youngsters, who were children in 1968, find the SSM boring and banal. Andrs points out that young people are not without means to express their opinions and influence conditions, and is convinced that Charter 77, Padlock Press samizdat, the unofficial universities, and the Living Room Theatre, with their open standpoints, are likely to impress young people the most. He asks whether it is possible to confront power within its own structure. He quotes those who think that to try to influence events from inside the official structure is a waste of time, almost collaboration, and retorts that they mistakenly presume that the principles of dictatorship operate equally 17. [pageend18]effectively throughout the structure. He asserts that where the slightest deviation from what is allowed has far-reaching significance, society realises its political development through those very deviations. Andrs argues in favour of the art of the possible and considers it the duty of every youngster to defend his basic organisation against the controlling apparatus. He believes that those who are elected to leading positions in these organisations can use them to promote positive interests. For instance, they can exert pressure for the realisation of such of the new economic measures as can lead to technological progress and improved quality - which will almost certainly be opposed by a section of the controlling apparatus. Andrs recalls that in the cultural field the basic organisations have had some influence. For instance, it was their sponsorship which enabled the underground rock group Plastic People of the Universe to perform outside Prague for some time. He urges members to bear in mind that stage performances by amateur groups and showings of films that would otherwise be inaccessible can be arranged by the special interest groups of the SSM and he suggests that activities can always be suitably entered in the records, for example, the reading of authors f rowned upon by the regime can be entered as 'acquaintance with progressive world literature'. In conclusion Andrs says the individual shouldn't have to choose between an open challenge to the power structure, and conformity and collaboration. He suggests as a guiding principle not to withdraw where no one is forcing a retreat and to advance swiftly where the resistance of the power structure is weakening. Andrs sees the basic SSM organisations as one of the places where the younger generation confronts official power and where the forces are evenly matched. 16. Open letter from Vlasta Chramostova. In this letter, written to the editors of Information on Charter 77 and published in No. 3/1980, Vlasta Chramostova describes the police action against the Living Room Theatre in January 1980. Chramostova begins by acknowledging that there are many measures which are much harsher than those she is about to describe. Nevertheless, even prisoners in the Terezin concentration camp under the Nazi occupation were allowed to engage in theatrical performances. Her account concerns police measures to prevent two performances of the Living Room Theatre from taking place in her flat in Prague on 25 and 26 January. She describes the action of uniformed and plainclothes police, the harassment of those who came to see the performance, and the detention of Ivan Kyncl and Rudolf Battek. The performance on 25 January was intended to welcome Jiri Lederer on his release after three years' imprisonment. The play in question received its premiere in December 1979 and was subsequently performed in six different places and seen by about 140 people. She recalls that this was not the first measure against unofficial theatre and she mentions the harassment of Havel and those who acted in his play, the Beggar's Opera, in Horni Počernice some years ago and the way that political events put an end to a series of performances of Macbeth in which she herself played Lady Macbeth. 18. [pageend19]Chramostova then describes how the present play came to be written and performed. The playwright, Frantisek Pavliček, who received a suspended sentence together with Vaclav Havel and Jiri Lederer in 1977, wrote a Monodrama on the life and work of Božena Nemcova, a well-known Czech literary figure of the nineteenth century,, Chramostova notes the coincidence that the performance was disrupted at a time when there were official celebrations of the 160th anniversary of Nemcova's birth. The play is one of the first monodramas to be introduced into Czech culture. Chramostova -concludes that it is shameful that a banned actress should not be allowed to perform a play by a banned playwright about Božena Nemcova who was allowed to publish even under the infamous rule of Pach (the most repressive Minister of the Interior of the Austro-Hungarian empire). Interview with Jiri Nemec. 17. approx. 520 words Jiri Nemec is a Catholic with left-wing affinities. He was arrested on 29 May 1979, together with nine other VONS members, and charged with subversion of the Republic, under Article 98. Six of the defendants were sentenced on October 29 to up to five years' imprisonment: four of them, including Nemec, were released on 22 December. Criminal proceedings against them have not been quashed however, and may be resumed at any time. Nemec was interviewed by Petruska Sustrova, also a VONS member, who was imprisoned herself, after 1969, for being a member of the Revolutionary Socialist Party, led by Petr Uhl. In the interview Nemec describes the situation as better now than before their arrests in May 1979. He stresses, in particular, the activity of young Charter signatories and good contacts forged with people in the West who have similar aims. Nemec explains why, in his view, the authorities' plan to smash the VONS committee and Charter 77 failed. It appears from the interview that Nemec's conditions in prison, unlike many others, were tolerable. In any case they confirmed his philosophy that the only worthwhile thing is to live and love without hatred. He advocates that Chartists should eliminate entirely the spirit of revenge. Palach Press can also make this interview available on film. 18. Jiri Otava, 'Don't leave, one can live here'. approx. 2, 400 words This article, written under the pseudonym in Prague in March 1980, is addressed specifically to Czechs who are weighing the pros and cons of emigration to the West. The author respects the work of Czech emigres through whom Czechoslovak books and periodicals are published in the West and sent back to Czechoslovakia. Otava regards this cooperative fostering of contemporary Czech culture as a valuable activity that should continue and be broadened, not least because it constitutes a 'threat to the present regime'. Nevertheless, Otava thinks that there is no need for more emigres, or rather that there is a greater need for courageous, critically thinking people inside Czechoslovakia. The author carefully analyses the different, understandable, 19. [pageend20]reasons for emigration but doubts whether a Czech who is motivated at home to join a struggle against injustice and for a life rich in spiritual values, rather than consumer goods, will achieve full satisfaction abroad. Otava describes the achievements in Czechoslovakia during the last three years, showing the number of positive things that can be done even under the present repressive regime. He does not believe that the regime will be changed by an internal transformation of the ruling establishment. A change — a regeneration of society — can be brought about only by people outside the power apparatus. That is why Otava attaches such importance to the existence of an opposition, particularly among the younger generation 19. Martin Palous: Who is Vaclav Benda? approx. 2,500 words Palous recounts how, on 1 March 1980, he drove Vaclav Benda's wife, Kamila, and their five children to Hermanice prison near the Moravian town of Ostrava. On 2 March Benda was allowed a one-hour visit from his family. Palous then describes the discussion which he had with Kamila Bendova during the journey. This centred on the implications of a recent lecture on phenomenology, given at the unofficial Patočka University. The article then turns into an erudite commentary on phenomenology and its relevance to everyday life, especially for those living under repression. It is within the context of phenomenology that Palous comments on the character of Vaclav Benda, his attitude to life, and his concept of the 'parallel polis' — a space in society for independent activity. 20. Ladislav Hejdanek's letters to a friend. approx. 4,000 words 1) Letter No. 16 (56), 19 December 1979. Hejdanek takes as his starting point an interview with the Deputy Minister of Education, Josef Podrouzek, published in Rude Pravo on 17 December 1979. Podrouzek states that there has been a marked fall in the educational standards of Czechoslovak citizens and that, on many criteria, the country lages behind its neighbours in Comecon. Hejdanek considers that, given the fact that Czechoslovakia has traditionally been at the forefront of European countries in relation to education, such an admission by a high-level official provokes the question as to what has led to this change. Podrouzek himself does not really answer this question and Hejdanek analyses all the various factors which have c ontributed to this situation. He sets the problem in its historical and social context, analysing university and secondary education, the problems of accommodation for students, the availability of teaching staff, the standard of literary and art journals, problems of admission criteria, attitudes towards specially gifted children on the one hand and mass education on the other and a number of other issues. Hejdanek quotes frequently from official statistics and Podrouzek's interview. This is a balanced essay which recognises some of the achievements of post-war education in Czechoslovakia and the difficulties which any regime would encounter in this field. 20. [pageend21]2) Letter No. 17 (57), 27 December 1979. approx. 5, 000 words In this letter, Hejdanek analyses the situation within the Charter 77 movement following the appeal trial of the six VONS members and the release of the remaining four from custody. He compares the wave of repression against the opposition at the end of 1971 with that of 1979 and discusses the reasons for the difference in impact on both the opposition itself and the population as a whole. Hejdanek explains why he thinks that, despite all repression, the Charter movement has had a very successful year, leading to a new quality in its work. At the same time, he carefully points out certain weaknesses and shortcomings of the movement, and acknowledges and tries to explain differences of opinion, particularly between former Communist Party members and Christians. Hejdanek also outlines what he considers to be the most optimal development in the future and explains why he believes that unofficial, parallel activity conducted outside the Charter movement is bound to increase in the future. 21. Open Letter from Radomir Hubalek to Gustav Husak. approx. 8,000 words Radomir Hubalek, a 38-year-old worker in a rubber factory in Zubri and a Catholic, explains why he has offered to go to prison in place of one of the six VONS members, preferably Otta Bednářová. He discusses his attitude towards the most important of human values — truth and justice — which have motivated his offer. 22. Interview with Professor Vaclav Cerny. approx. 2, 000 words Professor Vaclav Cerny is probably the most well-known intellectual in the opposition movement and one of Czechoslovakia's leading scholars. In this interview, conducted by Eva Kantůrkova on the occasion of his 75th birthday, Cerny begins by discussing his attitude to the fact that, because of his convictions, the communist authorities have never allowed him to make full use of his knowledge. For several years he was not allowed to publish or lecture at all and at other times he has been allowed to do so only with very great restrictions. This allows Cerny to explain his perception of the relationship between culture and society, the role of unofficial culture, and its future development. He also discusses the situation inside the Charter movement and the existence of two separate tendencies within it. Cerny then formulates his attitude towards the substantial group of former Communist Party members within the Charter movement. He discusses what he perceives as the legacy of the founder of the Czechoslovak Republic, T. G. Masaryk, and also talks at length about the role of small nations and the problem of emigration. Cerny believes that his own life mirrors the typical fate of C zech intellectuals in the twentieth century. 26 March 1980 21. [pageend22]23. Milan Simečka; To be in prison. approx. 1,100 words Simecka describes how his attitude towards prison has changed and developed since he was ten years old and discusses the attitude towards imprisonment of the man in the street. He also highlights the shift in attitudes towards imprisonment since the beginning of the war. Simecka sees the main hope for the future in the attitudes of those who come out of prison without having become embittered. November 1979. 24. Miroslav Kusy: Civic courage. approx. 3,500 words This essay is dedicated to Milan Simecka on his fiftieth birthday. Kusy is a Slovak philosopher and a former member of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. The essay is a philosophical treatise on the problems of courage, fear, and attitudes towards risks and confrontations with the authorities. 25. Miroslav Kusy: Criminal Acts against the Republic. approx. 1, 300 words Kusy analyses his own attitude towards the law. Like the majority of people, he says, he has always respected it but has known rather little about it. He explains how the trial of the VONS members forced him to read the Penal Code for the first time. He then realised that the VONS members had been sentenced in accordance with the law but that the law itself was at fault. The constitutes a weapon in the hands of the rulers. Kusy analyses two groups of laws: those dealing with slander of the Republic or its leading representatives and those dealing with hostility to socialism, subversion, incitement. He shows how anyone can in fact be sentenced for infringements of the laws because the majority of the population break them every day; whether or not they will be prosecuted depends entirely on the political decision of the rulers. 26. Jiri Hajek: Human Rights, Socialism and Detentes approx. 31,500 words Palach Press can make available this manuscript by Jiri Hajek, former Foreign Minister, Education Minister, and Czechoslovakia's representative at the United Nations. The book, which was finished in December 1978, contains the following chapters: L Human Rights and Socialist Revolution IL From the Atlantic Charter to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 22. [pageend23]III. The International Codification of Human Rights IV. Respect for Human Rights — the Basic Precondit ion for Detente and International Cooperation V. Human Rights and the Attempt to Revive Socialism VI. Endeavours to Implement Human Rights as a Factor of Social Progress. approx. 530 words 27. A letter from Prague referring to the Olympic Games This letter, written under the pseudonym J. Glebner, compares the recently concluded Soviet-Afghan agreement on the temporary stationing of Soviet troops in Afghanistan with the agreement of October 1968 legalising the temporary stationing of Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia. The writer observes that in both cases the Soviet leaders promised to remove the troops from the occupied countries as soon as the situation had calmed down. Czechoslovakia today is regarded as a calm, consolidated, and prosperous part of the socialist bloc. Nevertheless, Soviet troops are still there. Instead of camping in temporary barracks, they are now accomodated in new houses. The word temporary has been dropped. The author supports the idea of an Olympic boycott and draws attention to the Olympic poster which won first prize in the international competition in which 45 countries submitted 5, 000 designs. The poster, he points out, is composed of three sections: on the left are the international communist symbols — the hammer, sickle, and five-pointed star, on the right is the slogan 'The Olympic Games express humanity's unwavering striving for peace and progress', signed Leonid Brezhnev, and in the centre is a large picture of the author of the slogan, Leonid Brezhnev, with right hand raised. Glebner suggests that the poster answers the question of whether the Olympic Games are misused for political purposes. 28. Complaint from Zdena Tominova to the Prague 4 District Military Prosecutor concerning police violation of the Penal Code. approx. 2,000 words Zdena Tominova describes in detail the events of 12 April 1980 when Dr Anthony Kenny's lecture on Aristotelian ethics was disrupted by ten armed policemen and six Security Service officials. She lodges a complaint that they committed at least three serious criminal acts — misuse of the powers of a public official (Article 158), violation of the principle d the inviolability of abode (Article 238), and restricting the freedom of the individual (Article 231). Tominova then describes the brutal behaviour of the police. They had no search warrant or any other legal justification for entering her flat and harassing the 20 people present. By quoting the policemen involved she illustrates their ignorance of Law No. 40 on the police, which they referred to as something which legalises any actions on their part. Tominova claims that she can rely on 17 witnesses and that she is prepared to testify under oath. She points out that this is the sixth 23. [pageend24]such incident since the beginning of March. She is convinced that the lectures do not in any way violate the law and points out that they have been taking place regularly, every Wednesday, for the past three years and that her husband has never been prosecuted because of them. She also illustrates that none of the participants can be accused of disturbing the peace. Tominova asks the Military Prosecutor to investigate the incident, prosecute the guilty party, and ensure that someone explains to the police the content of Law No. 40, their legal rights and duties, and the fact that, even in a socialist society, there is a distinction between law and class consciousness and that the police explanation that they were acting out of political conviction thus has no legal validity. Tominova expresses her doubt, based on past experience, that her complaint will be properly investigated by an object judicial authority. She even states that she cannot exclude the possibility that it will be used against her in the future. For these reasons, she has decided to make the substance of her complaint known to all those who might be interested. approx. 2,000 words 16 April 1980 approx. 1, 200 words 29. 'Prague winter' This article accompanies a series of twelve photographs taken at the time of the VONS trials in the autumn of 1979. It discusses the problems facing a Chartist involved in photo journalism who wants to depict the political realities around him and the courage he must have, given that, simply by taking photographs, he risks arrest and imprisonment. Together with the photographs, the article illustrates the atmosphere surrounding the trials. The contents of the Summary are copyrighted by Palach Press.
