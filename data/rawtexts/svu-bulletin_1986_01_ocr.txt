Fischmann Box 134 Corona, CA 91718 SVU Activities PREPARATIONS FOR THE THIRTEENTH WORLD CONGRESS September 18-21, 1986 Northeastern University, CIHED Boston, Massachusetts The letters of invitation to participate in the academic program have been sent out by Anton Novačky (University of Missouri), and enough of them have been returned to make possible the organization of a number of sessions. However, some disciplines have so far been underrepresented and additional lecturers had to be identified. Even though some last minute changes are usually unavoidable in congresses of this kind, it is very important to have the basic program designed now to be available for early printing, with the Abstracts. Very often potential visitors (i.e., “the public”) decide to attend the congress on the basis of the impressi®» the publicity package makes, especially how attractive and substantial the program is. And it is the participants’ interest to have their papers, symposia, chairmanships and Abstracts documented in print. The arrangments for a stamp exhibit are finalized and the layout for the art exhibition has been inspected by Emil Purgina (University of Ottawa) who is in charge of that part of the congress. The exhibitors will be soon advised about a possibility of insuring their, art work by a local insurance company. The organizing committee (Dolansky, Kalina, Surka, Vogelova and coopted consultants) are also making final decisions about the registration fees, a film program, a concert, the banquet, invited guest speakers, and housing. Patronage request letters have been sent and contributions are deposited weekly in a special account. The members of the committee are working hard and have our preliminary thanks for this necessary and not always sufficiently recognized task.

More specifically, I will be in China, Australia and New Zealand. Professor Igor Nabelek (University of Tennessee), executive via president of the Society has kindly consented to become acting president during this period. Please, do not expect answers to your correspondence from me in this timeframe. Letters and suchlike that you may wish to have directed to the Society’s President should, of course, be sent to Prof. Nabelek in the interim. I suggest that after February 10, you direct all correspondence of this type to Prof. Nabelek, that is Prof. Igor Vojtech Nabelek 701 Chateaugay Road, N.W. Knoxville, Tennessee 37923 Jiri Nehnevajsa, President Pittsburgh, January 30, 1986 SVU FINANCIAL STATUS Jiri Nehnevajsa, President, sent the following summary about the finances of the Society, basing the round sums on the more detailed report presented by Josef Stasa, SVU Treasurer. About 27.8% of the receipts came from dues; 29.9% from subscriptions to Proměny and Kosmas, and other SVU publication activities; 15.9% is interest from SVU accounts; 4.5% miscellanea; and 21.9% came from donations, made either for specific purposes or designated for the general fund. The biggest part of the expenses (61.4%) refers to the publication of Zprávy and the Bulletin which are sent gratis to members, payment for Proměny and Kosmas which are not completely covered by subscription, and the subvention of some books. In the category of office expenses (18.7%), postage is the biggest amount; besides stationery, copying and similar items. Administrative expenses (13.3%) include the expedition of SVU publications, upkeep of membership registers, and those connected with the mandated treasurer’s activities. Expenses for conferences and occasional loans to local chapters form 5.9%; at this moment, the initial expenses for the preparation of the 13th Congress are included. Miscellaneous represents 0.7%. Dr. Nehnevajsa again stresses that the officers of the Executive Boara, members of the Council and those who do some specific task for the Society typically do not ask for any reimbursements but pay themselves whatever the expense is. An exception, perhaps, are some of the expensive phone calls 3 [pageend3]they have to make on behalf of the Society. These indirect contributions as well as all “donations” of time and effort, of course are the intangibles, not showing in the treasurer’s report, that help the non-profit Society go forward. In dollars, the total balance at the end of 1985 was: Credits $61,220 Debits $49,440 + $11,780 Estimated Budget for 1986 All budget estimates are based on past years experience and are calculated very conservatively. Expenses for several anticipatea activities, that are in advanced planning stage, have not been included.

JOURNAL OF CZECHOSLOVAK AND CENTRAL EUROPEAN STUDIES Volumes 3/2 and 4/1 - Winter 1984/Summer 1985 This double Kosmas is the first specialized issue, entirely dedicated to only one intellectual discipline. This time it is history. Moreover, the unusual feature in this case concerns the selected essays which are all from the pens of the “dissident” Czechoslovak historians who are not published in their country. They represent the “independent” historiography, unaffected bv the ideology prevailing among the officially approved historians. 4 [pageend4]The included authors, at some point of their career were deprived of their academic positions and were assigned to mostly menial work, or were arrested and convicted to some years in jail or prison. Their “crimes?” Petr Pithart, Miroslav Kusy, Vaclav Havel, Milan Otahal and Jiri S. Hajek signed the so-called Charter ‘77 and have participated in its program of human rights. Milan Simecka, Jaroslav Meznik and Jozef Jablonicky were punished for “subversion.” Only one of these essays is published under a pen name, F. Cermak. The section “About Our Authors” offers additional data about their lives and activities. As the articles were written in Czech, Zdenek Suda, editor of Kosmas, and Erazim Kohák from the Boston University did most of the translations. Linda Vlasak and -ar- translated one essay each. The contents had been planned and the texts selected and edited by H. Gordon Skilling, Professor Emeritus of Political Science at the University of Toronto. His co-editor was Vilem Precan, Czechoslovak Historian now living in Hannover, West Germany. Together they wrote the introduction, “Real Socialism in Czechoslovakia and the Search for Historical Truth,” explaining the reasons why they considered this type of historical writing of interest for their Western colleagues and of great importance for the country where it had originated. The represented writers complement and rectify the official “‘pseudo-history’ and a general state of ‘a-historicalness,’ especially among the youth,” by publishing the results of their research in samizdat or abroad, without regard to their precarious personal situation and without any material advantages. However, their work provides some continuity of Czechoslovak historiography and is a sample of the professionalism that adheres to international scientific standards. After all, the First Czechoslovak Republic was guided — perhaps not in vain -by the motto “The Truth Prevails,” not any expedient, temporary “our truth.” The eight texts and one lengthy review essay bring forth a variety of facts, important questions and theoretical concerns. Petr Pithart’s essay is titled “Let Us Be Gentle to Our History” and the subtitles indicate to some extent how he developed his theses. They are: The Truth of the Vanquished, History as Fatal Necessity, A Highway to the Future, Respect and Self-Respect, Antilegends, A Fragile Continuity, and Have the Czechs a Mission? The author summarizes the principal “breaks” in Czech history and warns against the tendency of mainly concentrating on the tragic events and failures, with concurrent blaming and useless settling of old accounts. He sees Central Europe (of which Czechoslovakia is an essential part) as a synthetizing entity — “sober, skeptical,” and “tolerant” of historical paradoxes — capable of overcoming past mistakes. “Black Holes: Concerning the Metamorphoses of Historical Memory” is Milan Simecka’s in part personal explanation of how he became aware of the danger of historical distortions caused by political changes in Czechoslovakia over the past several decades. He exhorts the current and future historians to regain intellectual courage and to make efforts of filling out the “black holes” that “swallow” such phenomena as the history of the non-communist political parties, “the history of our first independent 5 [pageend5]state,” the role of the West in the victory over Nazism, and so on. Otherwise, ‘‘human thought will be reduced only to its present dimension and an entire moral category, that of historical responsibility will be erased from consciousness.” In such a case, the lack of any written history would not matter, but as long as it exists, the black holes must be reworked. Miroslav Kusy — as Simecka also from Slovakia — writes “On the Purity of the Historical Craft.” He specifies how difficult professional historiography becomes when archives, literature and other sources are as a rule accessible only to the “court historians.” But an “independent,” non-official historian also has such worries as how to hide his notes, manuscripts, books from police search and possible confiscation. A historian of our days in Czechoslovakia may manage to work on inocuous popularization or on “dead subjects” that are so abstruse that they are safe. Otherwise he must be willing to do propaganda or produce biased, party-oriented “truth.” Kusy’s conclusion is that there “is total decay of the real craft in all our official historical institutions as well as in all court historians.” The playwright and well-known dissident Vaclav Havel wrote his “Six Asides About Culture” in 1983. His basic ideas are that it is impossible to predict the future development of any culture; that there are several possibilities for the Czechoslovak culture; that martyrdom is not a too ingrained modality of “realistic” Czechs; that the “parallel culture” is not any ideologically unified movement; that artistically powerful works are an expression of life and autonomous, free humanity. In “Czech Liberals in the Year 1848” Milan Otahal presents a detailed history of the factions and personalities representing Bohemia during the revolution of 1848. Especially interesting is the exposition of the ideas of federalization, the Frankfurt Parliament, the Austroslavism and Bohemia’s loyalty to the Austrian monarchy. Extensive notes offer pertinent Czech bibliography. This is a long essay (pp. 49-107), complex in its reasoning and documentation of various policitical positions the leaders assumed. An implied thought seems to be that the history could have taken a different course, had the Czech liberals acted differently in 1848. Compared with Bohemia, Moravia did not persecute the Czech Brethren and remained a refuge also for the Anabaptists and other religious sects. How such an unusual situation of religious freedom developed is explained by Jaroslav Meznik in his essay “Religious Toleration in Moravia in the 16th Century.” Thorough footnotes are illuminating. The historian Jozef Jablonicky, whom Kusy calls “the enfant terrible of Slovak official history,” documents “Nazi Ultimatum in the Trial of Vavro Srobar” which took place in December 1944. The history of the frustrated Slovak uprising of August 1944 is one of the special topics of Jozef Jablonicky’s expertise. “Social Democrats Defending Czechoslovak Democracy and Independence” is a chapter from Jiri S. Hajek’s longer work which appeared in samizdat. It briefly describes the history of the social democratic party from 1918 to 1938. In the last years of the First Republic social democrats played an important role in the struggle against fascism. In the Sudeten borderlands the position of the German Social Democratic 6 [pageend6]party was pro-Masaryk-and-Benes-Czechoslovakia and against Henlein. Social democracy in general, and any positive evaluation of its German branch in the pre-WWII Czechoslovakia, is today a rather taboo subject. The documentation in the notes is very welcome. F. Cermak reviews Jaroslav Meznik’s monograph Praha pred husitskou revoluci (Prague Before the Hussite Revolution). This work was set in print (1972) but was not published. It concerns the Old City of Prague and its governing institutions, as well as the changes occurring at the beginning of the 15 th century when the municipal power passed into the hands, of the Czech burghers. Meznik analyzes old documents as to the class, ethnicity, religious and political preferences of the councilmen of the Old and the New City, with many novel results. Interested readers can order a copy of Meznik’s study in full from Kosmas. ★ KOSMAS Journal of Czechoslovak and Central European Studies Vol. IV., No. 2, Winter 1985 CONTENTS Czech Literature “Graduated” Jaroslav Seifert: Czech Nobel Laureate The Editor William E.

Jaroslav Seifert was unable to travel to Sweden in 1984 to accept the award in person and has enjoyed the status of a world-celebrity for less than two years. In a way, to accept the Prize and also to accept the honorary membership of this Society had been an act of personal courage. Elsewhere in this issue we mention two articles in Cross Currents that describe the uneasy reaction of Czechoslovak authorities when the news about the Nobel Committee’s decision arrived. As Seifert had been very little known abroad, there also was an uneasy reaction in the world literary circles when his name hit the media, and almost no data on him were at first available. Paradoxically, his compatriots dispersed in exile were the group that was able to celebrate freely the distinction and appreciation paid by the Nobel Prize to the poet and his nation. Czechoslovakian born members of the academia and of cultural organizations such as SVU became resources for knowledge about Seifert for the western press. Consequently the obituaries are now written with more understanding of what Seifert’s poetry signified for his country. During the past two years more translations of Seifert’s work have been attempted and gradually published, in a rather unsystematic manner, often in the form of single poems or even quotes of shorter segments as samples of his art. The linguistic differences between Czech and English are enormous, and any translation is made even more difficult by all subtly suggested between-the-lines-associations that create a strong cultural barrier. Anybody trying to have a clear picture of Seifert’s communication style must not forget that he had lived through two dictatorships, as his lines say: “ ... the poet is sentenced to silence/ and the square palm of the barred window/ stuffs with its claws his singing mouth./ But he shouts his verses through the bars/ while the tearers of books/ are busily at work.” (Josef Skvorecky’s translation of a longer segment from the banned The Song of Viktorka; Cross Currents, 1985, p. 289). One recent addition to his work published outside Czechoslovakia is of interest even though the text is in Czech. Bohem Press in Switzerland just produced Seifert’s verses for children with folk-like illustrations by Josef Paleček. It is the coffee-table top type of book, with more artwork than text, and can serve as an example of the rich visual stimulation his lean verses promote. The book is titled Koulelo se, koulelo (Zurich: Bohem Press, 1985; distributed by Richmond Bay Publishers, 5902 San Jose Ave., Richmond, CA 94805; $8.80). The title is one half of a saying refering to the rolling away of a red apple; the poem narrates the stages of the apple tree and its fruit, through the four seasons. The relationship between Seifert’s poetry and artistic expression is also exemplified by the bilingual edition of his The Plague Monument (SVU Press, 1980), translated by Lyn Coffin and illustrated by Jiri Kolar’s sophisticated black and white “crumplages.” 10 [pageend10]One aspect of Seifert’s poetry was the preoccupation with death which he accepted without despair. He will not buy “A Recreational River-Boat” suggested by Ludvik Vaculík. Charon’s boat waited for him, but the river Lethe cannot erase his memory. In the poem “The Weight of the Earth”, translated by Vera Borkovec in 1984 (Kosmas, 3/1) he said in the penultimate strophe: “When I shall go, give me a cane And nothing more. Maybe a white one. Down there is darkness everywhere, Which only blind men know. And I will try To tell you through the grass, What death is like, That second For which we wait a lifetime.” ★ ★ ★ Josef Josten, M.B.E. (1913-1985) In December 1985 sad news was received about the sudden passing away in London of Josef Josten, M.B.E., one of the original SVU members, journalist, broadcaster and expert on psychological warfare. The Czechoslovak exile has lost in him one of the most energetic and relentless activists. Within a short time after the communist coup in Czechoslovakia in February 1948, Josef Josten published his book Oh, My Country (1949), a testimony of what really transpired there. His Free Czechoslovakia Press News started immediately thereafter. His background in the Western Armed Forces during WWII and as an official of the Czechoslovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs contributed to his success in establishing relations with the authorities and individuals in Great Britain and elsewhere. His highest achievement was the creation of the “U.K. Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted” in London, in which he served as a member of its Executive Committee and Hon. Founder Secretary. Last November 21 he was officially honored by the prestigious title of “Member of British Empire,” the M.B.E. That award was the climax of his life. His collapse and death, ten days after the solemn ceremony and his speech in the House of Lords, came as a shock to his numerous friends. An expression of sympathy goes to his wife, Mrs. Patricia Josten and his son Martin Josten. L.A. Krátky ★ 11 [pageend11]Addendum: More data come from the obituary published in The Times (London, Dec. 3, 1985). Mr. Joseph Josten died on November 29 at the age of 72. He was born in Prague on March 25, 1913. In his late teens he supported his widowed, chairbound mother. He started his newspaperman career as a part-time sports reporter, later joined the prestigious Lidové Noviny and turned to political journalism in the 1930’s. He escaped from occupied Czechoslovakia in December 1939 and joined the Czechoslovak Brigade in France, which was then evacuated to Britain after Dunkirk. He took part in the Allied invasion of Europe in 1944 and was eventually assigned to the Luxemburg radio to broadcast news and messages to the displaced persons. He married his British bride, Patricia, and in 1947 they moved to Prague where he worked in the Press Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After February ‘48 the Jostens managed to get back to England again. His Free Czech Information (F.C.I.) service earned Mr. Josten the sobriquet of the “Czech Scarlet Pimpernel.” There even were two attempts on his life for his concerns about human rights, democracy and freedom. His Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted came into existence in 1980. The obituary concludes: “JosteÄ’s efforts on behalf of humanitarian causes in journalism, were recognized in his appointment as MBE.” ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ What’s Your Thing? Here is the continuation of “our things” for your interest. We plan to enlarge this section in terms of both categories and information. The Secretary, all officers of the Society and the editor of this Bulletin (all of whose addresses appear on the first page) will be glad to serve as liasons between SVU members and interested readers. Communication is one of our main aims. PUBLICATIONS OF INTEREST Jan Novak, The Willys Dream Kit (San Diego - New York - London: Hartcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1985; 311 pp., $19.95) To make the acquaintance of a Czech writer through his first English novel which has been well accepted by the American book critics, is a pleasure. The discovery of Jan Novak as a prosaist, however, belongs to the Toronto ‘68 Publishers who produced his short stories written in Czech under the intriguing title Striptease Chicago. In addition to various other jobs, Jan Novak has been a journalist and a playwright. His theatrical works are Czechs, The Wrong Way Out, and Bohemian Heaven, but it is not clearly stated on the dust cover whether these plays had come out in print and under what conditions they were performed. 12 [pageend12]In any case The Willys Dream Kit is his first full size novel. The blurb says that “this first novel delights in rollicking prose and revels in the extravagances of the human spirit.” One critic feels that “there is something Czech in the way this novel swings between the gross and the comic ...” Each reader will have to find his/hers interpretation, for the novel can be perceived on many levels. It skillfully combines facts pertaining to the life in the Protectorate when the generation of the protagonist’s progenitors had various brushes with the Gestapo. It continues with their post-war lives when historical events like nationalization and collectivization transformed many individuals and whole social classes into marginal non-persons. But people married, conceived next generations, hassled for their daily sustenance, reminisced about the “good” and “bad” old days, depending on their ideology - and survived as well and as long as possible. Their kids were fed the family stories, went through their teenage rebellions, got their education, discovered sex, some made careers, others were assigned to menial work despite their academic titles, and they married and became parents in their turn. All these accurate and meaningful background fragments are woven into a “hinterland” which the protagonist carries with himself as his ethnic heritage/burden wherever he goes. Who is then the hero of the novel? He emerges gradually from the narratives of the initial chapters. His name is Svoboda, a family name common enough but also having the meaning of Freedom, suggesting that he will be the free spirit of the story. Had the author wanted the “most common name” he could have used Jan Novak, statistically equivalent to John Smith. However, the hero is usually talked about by the name of the role he plays at that point of his life. Thus the failed violinist, soccer player, poet, husband, father of a boy and a girl, an indoor bureaucrat made into a member of the outdoor loading platoon when he refuses to sign the party application, are one anil the same person. He also develops a sideline of a lottery winner, leader of a strike, banker and millionaire (read: an undiscovered embezzler), and for a while becomes the owner of a WWI1 reconstructed Willvs Jeep, painted bridal white. All that comes to an end when Czechoslovakia is invaded in August *68, which leads to a confiscation of the jeep and starts our hero in the career of “the American” as a refugee in the Vienna camp and eventually a Chicagoan with various jobs and the avocation of a gambler in Las Vegas, a phony philanthropist and arsonist. Again, the details of this geographical and cultural transplantation are very realistic. One cannot but wonder how much of it is autobiographical material, combining sharp observation and imaginative exaggeration with at least some personal experiences. The author reportedly came to this country when he was seventeen which means that the husband and wife in the book could represent his real parents to whom the book is dedicated. As the protagonist never achieves his dreams of riches and happiness in this country of unlimited opportunities, and there is no happy end to the novel, while the story gradually turns into a rather serious case story, we sincerely hope Mr. Svoboda of the book is mostly a product of the author’s fantasy, even though immigrants are living under so many stresses that some may break. 13 [pageend13]The vividness of the contents and of the language belie the underlying seriousness and well thought-out construction of the action. The personages are real people, concisely delineated. That some are dishonest, cranky and eccentric makes them even more human in their struggle of living in this crazy world—and the author obviously sympathizes with them and treats them with affection. The book is not recommended for persons who cannot tolerate and appreciate the genuine, tough macho slang, utilized in some portions of the novel, e.g., in the conversations of the loading platoon. The author has a good command of the vernacular and uses it appropriately for characterization of his personae. This aspect may make the book more acceptable to American readers than any translation could. Whether it exactly reflects the language used by the Czech socialist workers in the 1950’s and 1960’s does not matter, except perhaps to a professional linguist. The Willys Dream Kit is a joy to read and there is a lot to it that can be especially appreciated by persons of Czechoslovak descent but might elude a reader without that background. ★ ★ ★ Novina, Volume 37 (October 1985; 112 pp.) Seldom had the Czech nation been so united as in 1918, the year of the formal establishment of the Czechoslovak Republic. As direct participants of that famous year and the following period of the First Republic are gradually becoming scarce, the documentation and conservation of the historical evidence is getting more and more important. Here the ethnic publications such as Novina step in. Novina (News), an exile continuation of the pre-WWII agrarian press is currently published in Cleveland, Ohio, by SVU member Martin Hrabik and his coworkers, Přemek Kocian among them. It is written in Czech, with a few exceptions, and each issue concentrates on a specific topic. This volume of Novina is filled with accurate and explicit information about Czechoslovak politicians known as the “Men of the 28th October” and also about those who became responsible as leaders in the years 1918-1938. Reprints from the press of those years and of direct reports by the eyewitnesses of the events are the main sources. The selection of the individuals under review is in the spirit of the Czechoslovak Republican — formerly Agrarian — Party, now in exile. We learn about the members of the Revolutionary National Assembly: Frantisek Udržal, the first Minister of National Defense and later Prime Minister; Jan Malypeter, Minister of the Interior, Speaker of the House and Prime Minister; Josef Cerny, later Minister of the Interior. The “Men of the First Republic” are represented by Rudolf Beran and Milan Hodza. The tragic fate of Rudolf Beran, the last Prime Minister before the Nazi occupation is also a vivid indictment of the so-called “justice” of the communist regime. Equally interesting are the comments about the activities of Milan Hodza, Czechoslovak Prime Minister during the pre-Munich era and an outstanding Slovak statesman. There are two specific lines in this issue which deserve particular attention and evaluation. Political and cultural relations between the Czechs and Slovaks is one of them, including the role of the Slovak State during the time of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The other line is dealing 14 [pageend14]with President Eduard Benes, beginning with his election in 1935, his abdication after the Munich crisis, and his inscrutable policy making during his exile in London, mainly in relation with Russia. It would go beyond the scope of these comments to give here an account of other prominent names reviewed in this issue. Martin Hrabik, born in Southern Bohemia, celebrated his eightieth birthday in October 1984. He became the Secretary General of the Republican Party in the 1930’s, was imprisoned for anti-Nazi activities during WWII and went into exile in 1948. He eventually settled with his family in Cleveland and worked for twenty years for Republic Steel. He has been very active in several Czechoslovak exile organizations. He has to be commended for producing a publication of cultural and historical value, a permanent contribution to understanding the history of the political parties in the Czechoslovak First Republic. L.A. Krátky ★ ★ ★ Amost Lustig’s Books We briefly reported on Arnost Lustig’s life and work in Bulletin 1/2 (1980). New editions of his Darkness Casts No Shadow and Night and Hope which had come out as Avon paperbacks in 1978 have now been published by the Northwestern University Press (Evanston, IL 60201; $6.95 and $7.95). The original translators into English were Jeanne Nemcova and George Theiner. The Northwestern editions reportedly have new introductions. Another book by Mr. Lustig had been published in Czech by the Sixty- Eight Publishers from Toronto in 1979. Z deniku sedmnáctileté Perly Sch. now has appeared as The Unloved. From the Diary of Perla S. (Arbor House; $14.95). The new title seems to be very appropriate, as it is another story about the life of an adolescent,.this time a girl, confined in the Terezin ghetto during WWII. She temporarily survives but, as all the other inmates, alternately acknowledges and denies the ever present threat of the “transport to the East” - into an undefined and unconceivable “nothing.” Perla lives day by day, trick by trick, keeps up her diary writing into it concrete facts of her daily existence, as well as her dreams and nightmares, at times wondering about what life really could mean if she were elsewhere, free. She does not find the answers to her vague longings, except the awareness that death is waiting for her. One of the reviewers, Richard Eder from the Los Angeles Times calls the book an “elusive and compelling novel” whose author “has deliberately created a mist around” his unfortunate protagonist. The “sublunar” existence in the ghetto, the apparently unprotesting adjustment of an unformed youngster thrown into a catastrophic situation, and the meaninglessness of it all, make Perla into an unloved victim who never got a chance to live somewhat normally. In all respects it is a very sad and tragic document of the twentieth century’s destructiveness and of the banality of evil, a thought still oppressive forty years after the end of the Nazi regime. ★ ★ ★ 15 [pageend15]ENGLISH BOOKS FROM SWEDEN The Charta 77 Foundation came into existence in Stockholm, in 1978. It is a cultural-humanitarian institution with the principal goal to support the persecuted people in Czechoslovakia, no matter if for political, religious or cultural reasons. The Foundation has published books in Swedish, Czech and some in English. We mentioned Jaroslav Seifert’s Two Poems in Bulletin III/l; a limited number of copies is still available ($15.00). The following newest publications have been highly recommended: A Besieged Culture (300 pp.; $10.00) offers contributions of a number of well-known writers, not only the Czech ones, who commented on the European Cultural Forum in Budapest, in fall 1985. Vaclav Havel wrote The Anatomy of a Reticence (32 pp.; $2.00) for the Amsterdam Peace congress in July 1985. A father-son team, Karel and Ivan Kyncl, prepared the text and numerous photographs for After the Spring Came Winter (105 pp.; $7.00) dedicated to the representatives of the Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia.

Palic was born in Kochanovce, Czechoslovakia, Feb. 7, 1906, son of Jan Palic, an Evangelical Lutheran pastor. After completing his secondary education in Czechoslovakia and Dijon, France, he received the degree of Bachelier-es-lettres from the University of Dijon in 1925 and the degree of Juris Doctor from the Comenius University in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, in 1931. He joined the Czechoslovak foreign service in 1932, after concluding graduate study in international relations at the University of Freiburg-in-Breisgau, Germany. As an assistant to the Czechoslovak representative at the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague (Netherlands), he participated in two sessions dealing with a case concerning university estates in Slovakia (Pazmany University (Budapest] v. Czechoslovakia, 1933). Later, as a specialist in Hungarian minority problems in the Press and Information department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he submitted periodic reports on the Hungarian minority to President T.G. Masaryk. These were often discussed at working lunches with the president in Prague, or at his country residence in Lany. During this period he published a series of articles on the Hungarian minority in Národnostní Obzor (Ethnographic Review). 16 [pageend16]He served at the Czechoslovak embassies in Paris and in Washington (1936-46), and as Deputy Chief for Administration in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Prague (1946-49). He returned to Washington in 1949, and became an American citizen in 1956. A specialist in government documents and serial bibliography, Dr. Palic enjoyed a 20-year career (1956-76) at the Library of Congress, the world’s largest depository. Among his major achievements as a staff member of the Serial Division of the Library of Congress, mention is made of the following: From 1963-64 he arranged for permanent retention, a collection of Swedish official documents covering the years 1646-1824, acquired from the Univeritetsbiblioteket, Uppsala, Sweden. The documents, Kongl. Placater, Resolutioner, Forordningar och Pabud, samt andre allmanne Handlingar, represent 131 bound volumes now in the custody of the Law Library. From 1968-75 he prepared two bibliographies which were published by the Library of Congress, Government Publications: A Guide to Bibliographic Tools (Washington, 1975, 441 pgs.), an updated, considerably enlarged edition of James B. Childs’s Government Document Bibliography in the United States and Elsewhere (3d ed., Washington, 1942, 78 pgs.); and Government Organization Manuals: A Bibliography (Washington, 1975, 105 pgs.), a listing of official manuals of government organizations in most countries, as well as many secondary sources which describe the organization of governments and government agencies in the United States and foreign countries. (These two bibliographies were reprinted in 1976 in England by Pergammon Press in one volume, as the first volume in their new series, “Guides to Official Publications.” ★ ★ ★ CULTURAL TRENDS Cross Currents 4. A Yearbook of Central European Culture Ladislav Matějka and Benjamin Stolz, Eds. (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, Michigan Slavic Materials, No. 25, 1985; 452 pp., illustrations; $15.00) By now the appearance of Cross Currents is an awaited yearly event. What is new this time is the information about some changes in publishing conditions. The publisher still is the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures, with the assistance of the Center for Russian and East European Studies, but the volume is again counted as one of the series of Michigan Slavic Materials. For the first time it seems to have special financial support (a grant from the Alfred Jurzykowski Foundation, Inc.). Also, the articles appearing in this journal are abstracted and indexed in Historical Abstracts and America: History and Life. The yearbook was advertised in The New York Review of Books, and it is hoped it will attract the deserved attention from the general readership. As in the previous issues, Austrian, Czechoslovak, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian and Yugoslav cultural facets are represented. Some thematic connections with the prior volumes are noticeable, achieving a certain 17 [pageend17]cumulative effect, healthy fbr a publication of this kind. However, each time there is enough variety as to authors and their subjects to keep up the suspense about the “next Cross Currents.” The first article, translated from French, is “The Austro-Hungarian Empire. Forerunner of a Central European Confederation?” by Eugene Ionesco. The title is self-explanatory. The author supports it by examples of the similarities in Central Europe’s countries and by his own experience when he was awarded the Vienna Prize for his literary works. He then “realized that while intellectually my writing belonged to France, culturally it belonged to the vast space of the Center.” Josef Rohlik, professor at St. Louis University School of Law, and Susan FitzGibbon Kinyon, Law Clerk of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, contributed the study “The Right of Self-Determination and Central Europe.” The subdivisions of the article present The Peoples of Central Europe, The Right of Self-Determination and Its Demise, Recognition of the Soviet Bloc, Substitutes for Self-Determination, Human Rights, New International Economic Order, and Perspectives. All these are precisely documented. One thought-provoking conclusion about the status quo is that “ ... the tragedy of the peoples under Soviet domination is not that they are ‘members’ of a bloc. Their tragedy is that they are dominated by a society which is totally alien to them and which has been constantly trying to destroy their values and national identity.” Mary Hrabik Samal develops “The Case of Miklos Duray,” a Hungarian Czechoslovak citizen, born in 1945 in Slovakia. He is a doctor in geochemistry and became a leader of the Committee for the Legal Protection of the Hungarian Minority in Czechoslovakia. Since 1982 he was repeatedly jailed for his activities and was declared “Prisoner of Conscience” in 1985. Amnesty International and the American section of International P.E.N. Club have been interested in his case. His autobiography, The Dog Trap, was published in 1983 by a Hungarian New York publisher. Emery George (University of Michigan) presents a review of “Istvan Bibo, The Jewish Question in Hungary. ” So far this Bibo’s essay, written in 1948, was published in London while it was known in Hungary only in samizdat but was scheduled for official publication. Bibo gives a summary of the history of the Jews in Hungary, mostly since 1919, and explores some traditional anti-Semitic attitudes. Dr. George compares some of Bibo’s opinions with those of other writers, e.g., Sartre who published his Reflexions sur la Question Juive in 1946. He calls attention to the fact that nobody wrote openly on this topic in Hungary since Bibo’s writings of 1948/49 until 1975. However, even though the Government has been discouraging anti-Semitism, “most grass-roots Hungarians are as anti- Semitic now as they ever were (even if... they know it is not good policy to show it).” This conclusion probably applies to many other countries besides Hungary. 18 [pageend18]A completely different type of contribution is Jan Drabek’s selection of excerpts from a journal he kept during his forty-years-since-the-liberation trip to Europe in the Spring of 1984. “Auschwitz Revisited” was the high point, especially meaningful to his 83-year-old father, a former prisoner number 94692, sent to that extermination camp in 1943 for his anti-Nazi activities. The novelist and journalist Jan Drábek and his lawyer father, living in Canada and Washington, D.C. respectively, produced a short documentary film about that emotionally laden visit to Auschwitz. A short translation from the Chinese oy H.w. Dewey carries rne title “Old Prague Viewed from Beijing”— and a page in Chinese characters is reprinted on the opposite page. The author, Zhon Xiang Guang, reports on a visit to Prague. He states that the Czechs’ average life span has risen from 57 years in 1937 to 71 in 1979 and that roughly a third of Prague’s population is older than 60. He finds the social care for these older citizens very well organized, with a number of well functioning services, particularly in the capital. Apparently the once prevalent attitude of “babička ujida chlebicka” (“granny eats up our bread”) has been overcome. Jan Blonski (The Jagellonian University, Cracow) traces the development of postromantic styles in the Polish literature in the essay “Literature in Literature.” By that he means the strategies of the “younger” writers to find their place in the literature of their country as continuation, radical innovation or some modification of the established styles. Certain continuity in stylistic sequences may be achieved by direct quotation, quotation of structure, pastiche, paraphrase, travesty, parody, stylization, allusion or reminiscence of the known literary works. The author defines these techniques and the aesthetic values they imply. “An Interview with Czeslaw Milosz on Revolution, the Sublime, and the World’s End” by Michael Edward Moore follows. It refers to a school of poetry known as Catastrophism which was influenced by Czeslaw’s cousin Oscar Milosz who lived in pre-war II Paris. In his latest books, The Land of Ulro (1984) and The Witness of Poetry (1983) Czeslaw Milosz’s interest in apocalyptic concepts finds expression, and he talks about it in the interview. Next module consists of “Witold Gombrowicz’s I Am Where I Am Not" by Suzanne Sztajnberg (University of Tel-Aviv), a portion “From Witold Gombrowicz’s Diary” selected and translated by Lillian Vallee, and “A Call to Order: Cosmos” by William Veeder (University of Chicago). Gombrowicz’s existential philosophy and personal alienation is thus described and is illustrated by samples from his diaries and the novel Cosmos (1970 translation into English). “Zbigniew Herbert’s ‘Unmasking Metaphor’” by Stanislaw Baranczak (Harvard University) analyzes the types of figures of speech and methods the poet uses in his works at different times. Numerous examples from Herbert’s poems and prose show his versatility and linguistic skills. A typology of the metaphors is offered. 19 [pageend19]“An Interview with Gyorgy Konrad” was conducted and taped by M. D. Birnbaum during the writer’s visit to New York in 1984. Konrad’s The Case Worker, The City Builder and The Loser have been published in English. The interview ranges from a discussion of Hungarian literature and the position of a writer in East European countries to the next novel Konrad is working on. Hungary is further represented by Emery George’s essay “The Tape Recorder as Tragic Hero: Observations on Istvan Eorsi’s Play His Master’s Voice” and the translation of the complete 2-act play (p. 209-274). The human protagonist is the Marxist philosopher Gyorgy Lukács (1885-1971) whom Eorsi (b. 1931) (in the play) interviews with the help of a rather independent tape recorder. It is necessary to read both the essay and the play to get a picture of the absurdist drama. Emery George suggests that the tragic element changes into magic, via: mag(net)ic. In the Czechoslovakia-related section, Ludvik Vaculik’s “A Recreational River-Boat” and Josef Skvorecky’s “Jaroslav Seifert — The Good Old Drinking Poet” are reflections on the first Czechoslovak writer having been awarded the Nobel Prize. Some reactions from Prague and from the world press are discussed and factual clarifications of certain special circumstances are offered. Seifert’s poem “Paradise Lost” (from The Umbrella from Piccadilly, 1979) in Lyn Coffin’s translation is included. Zdenka Muenzer (The New York Metropolitan Museum of Art) concentrates on the Torah curtains from the holdings of the Prague State Jewish Museum. A sample of the curtains was included in the touring exhibition “The Precious Legacy from the Prague Jewish Collections”, shown in 1984 in several U.S. cities and in Canada. Dr. Muenzer describes the textiles, types of embroidery and other ornamentation that prevailed at different times. She states that, besides the stylistic influences from abroad, “this synagogue art in Bohemia and Moravia often reflects the influence of local art.” She also mentions some documentation that Czech was the language used by the Jews in those areas in the Middle Ages. “The Max Brod Centennial” by Zdenka E. Fischmann was written in 1984. The article concentrates mostly on Brod’s life and activities after 1939 when he arrived in Palestine/Israel where he lived until his death in 1968. His literary production, both fiction and non-fiction, music criticism, lecturing in Israel and in Europe, personal characteristics, ethico-religious philosophy of life and professional relations are touched upon. Milena Jelinek conducted and taped “An Interview with Milos Forman” in New York, in 1984. That was after the premiere of his Amadeus, but the questions and answers concern Forman’s older pictures, his opinions about filming styles, choices of the topics, casting of actors and other technical and aesthetic aspects, besides a few centering on Mozart. References to Forman’s lectures at Columbia University Film Division add some background explanation of the scope of the interview. 20 [pageend20]“The Lessons of Prague” by Jindřich Chalupecky concern the fine arts in present Czechoslovakia. The ways of organizing exhibitions and allowing the “registration” of the artists in their union are explained. Some recent “unofficial” projects by a growing number of unrecognized artists have been more successful with a wider public than the union-organized shows. Vera Calin wrote on “Romanian Contributions to the European Avant-Garde,” presenting Tristan Tzara, Brancusi, Urmuz, Benjamin Fondáne, Ilarie Voronca, Eugene Ionesco and others who lived and worked in Paris and elsewhere between the wars and later. Some Dada poems are reprinted in their original French and other avant-garde styles are specified. “An Interview with Poet Mircea Ivanescu” was held by Thomas C. Carlson (Memphis State University). This Romanian poet, highly appreciated in his country had some poems translated into English as recently as 1983. This interview and six poems, translated by Stefan Stoenescu, present Mircea Ivanescu to the readers of Cross Currents. Harry Zohn (Brandeis University) this time compares and analyzes “Three Austrian Aphorists: Kraus, Kuh, Canetti.” He defines the genre and names its many representatives but'gives a bibliography and examples from the works of the three above mentioned writers. To translate aphorisms from German is difficult and Dr. Zohn exemplifies the problem of puns and double meanings impossible to reconstruct in another language. Oskar Kokoschka’s portrait of Karl Kraus (1909) accompanies this essay. David Packman returns to Isaac Bashevis Singer’s works in “The Problem of The Penitent.” Basically his short article is a polemic with the critic Harold Bloom who called the novel (1983) “a very unpleasant work, without any redeeming esthetic merit or human quality.” Packman explains why Singer’s “anecdotic author” may cause confusion if one tries to read the work only for the narrative story. He defends the value of this complex novel. “Dragutin Tadijanovic,” the most distinguished Croatian poet, celebrated his eightieth birthday on November 4, 1985. I.R. Titunik (University of Michigan) pays tribute to him in the article and has translated the cycle of poems, Intimate Exhibition of Sketches from Rab (written in 1954), for this festive occasion. In 1957 a manuscript was given to Eleanor Roosevelt for safekeeping. Now, “My Two Comrades” by Vladimir Dedijer (Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts) is published here for the first time. It is an autobiographical narration spanning the years 1936 and the 1950’s. Milován Djilas and the future Marshal Tito were the men with whom Dedijer fought during the war for the new Yugoslavia. He very openly reveals personal tragedies, ideological struggles under the pressures of Stalinism, serious illness and disillusions. Yet the friendship with Djilas survived, as a sample of the correspondence between Vlado and Djido from 1960 to 1967 demonstrates. These letters were selected from those that are deposited in the Michigan Historical Collections. ★ ★ ★ 21 [pageend21]T.G.M. REMEMBERED March 7 is one of the dates that have special significance for the Czechs and Slovaks of this century. It is the birthday of Tomas Garrigue Masaryk (b. 1850) which used to be celebrated in all schools and the whole Republic, like Washington’s and Lincoln’s birthdays are yearly remembered in this country. Although the First Czechoslovak President died on September 14, 1937, his birthday is still commemorated by the Czechoslovaks abroad. The following is another example of how he is remembered to this day. T.G. Masaryk Community Center in Israel T.G. Masaryk, First President of Czechoslovakia visited Palestine in 1927. In a speech he gave, he said: “Here in Palestine we stand everywhere on historical ground — or on ground where history is being made.” In 1934 Kibbutz Kfar Masaryk was founded in Palestine. Its members came from Czechoslovakia, a country which practiced democracy and liberalism based on the teachings of the great humanist. Czechoslovak Jewry enjoyed full rights of a national minority. Zionism was accepted by many Czechoslovaks as a national liberation movement of the Jewish people. In the early 1930’s members of the organization Hashomer Hatzair reached Palestine, intent on setting up a new kibbutz. Fór six years they lived in temporary camps on the outskirts of Haifa, working wherever they could: in construction, factories, the port. In 1938, land in the northern part of the Zevulun Valley was made available to them by the Jewish National Fund. The land consisted of malaria ridden swamps, while the other half was a stretch of infertile sand dunes. Undaunted, the members of the new kibbutz, named Mishmar Zevulun (The Guard of Zevulun), set up tents. A peripheral wall for defense and a watchtower were constructed in a single night. Then they set out to drain the swamps. While making the land productive, the halutzim (pioneers) had to live on proceeds from industry. With cooperation of investors, engineers and experts from Czechoslovakia, two factories were established: Askar, which manufactured asphalt and paints, and Naaman, which produced bricks and ceramic goods. Mishmar Zevulun thus was among the first kibbutzim to introduce industry to what had always been a communal agricultural enterprise. In 1940, the new kibbutz moved to its permanent site and was renamed Kfar Masaryk (The Village of Masaryk). This way the kibbutz members sought to show appreciation to their country of origin and pay tribute to its first president. During World War II, Kfar Masaryk became a haven for refugees who managed to escape from the horrors of the Holocaust. It also served as a base for Czechoslovak army units stationed in Palestine who fought with the Allies against the Axis powers. Throughout the war the kibbutz maintained close contact with the Czechoslovak Government-in-exile, seated in London, and its representatives in Palestine. 22 [pageend22]After WWII, Kfar Masaryk took in survivors of the Holocaust from Czechoslovakia. In 1949 an entire Youth Aliya group from Czechoslovakia came to the kibbutz. Upon completing their education and army service, many of them returned to Kfar Masaryk to become full fledged members. In 1948/49 a special adolescent education project was started, and a regional high school, named after T. G. Masaryk, was inaugurated. Today, Kfar Masaryk is a flourishing community with a population of about 800 - and still open to new members. In addition to its modern agriculture, in which it has achieved particular renown for its cotton and avocado crops, the kibbutz has two industrial enterprises, both based on advanced technology: Silora electronics and Ducart packaging industry. Among Kfar Masaryk’s major future projects is the construction of T.G. Masaryk Center, which is to serve the growing needs of kibbutz members in adult education, performing arts and as a meeting place for the entire community. A section of the TGM Center is to be dedicated to memories of deceased kibbutz members. A special hall is to commemorate those who fell in battle. It will also contain a permanent exhibition of TGM, to help us remember the ideals of justice, liberty, humanism and peace for which this exceptional man firmly stoöd. Frank Meissner ★ ★ ★ SOME COMMENTS Milos Yitek from Montreal has sent the following comment referring to “Memories of WWII” (Bulletin VI/3, August 1985). He writes: “I was agreeably surprised by the article bringing up the Holocaust of Czech intelligentsia during WWII and stressing the need to spread and to preserve for history the knowledge of undistorted eyewitness reports on important events of the past. The writer of the article refers to my testimonies on Mauthausen and on Dachau. I agree that similar matters should also be available in English for readers who did not witness the reckless destruction of European democracies. Of particular importance are the writings' by those who had been involved in the Resistance, were incarcerated, have survived and are still living witnesses of what was going on four to five decades ago. Several current “oral histories” (WWII, Vietnam) are on the bestseller lists because contemporary American readers like this approach to past events, exemplified on individual human experiences. The writer of the article summed quite accurately my participation in the events of the most tragic era for the Czech nation and for the individuals who had been formed by Masaryk’s democratic schools. The article mentioned my contribution to the fight against the Nazis and my tribulations in the extermination camp of Mauthausen, which I happened to survive, and in the concentration camp of Dachau. The writer had apparently access only to some of my writings in Czech and implied that similar event should be known also from English sources to remain a worldwide warning for mankind. Consequently I wish to add the information about my writings that appeared in English, French and- German publications. 23 [pageend23]“The English description of the tragedy of the scholars from the Masaryk University and of other Czech intellectuals and patriots sent in 1942 to Mauthausen, a camp of category III, as retaliation after the successful assassination of the Protector Heydrich, can be found in the book The 186 Steps. It is the translation of the French book on Mauthausen, Les 186 marches, edited by Christian Bernadac and published in 1974 by Editions France-Empire in Paris. The book is one of the series of ten books on concentration camps which appeared first in French under the title L’histoire vecue de I’univers concentrationnaire nazi and then in English as Inside the Nazi Concentration Camp World. This comprehensive documentary series offers as volume VII the book The 186 Steps whose chapter “Massacre of the Czechs” depicts the destruction of the Czech scholars and intellectuals assigned to Mauthausen to be worked to death. The title refers to the steep staircase steps up and down the quarry Wiener Graben where the majority of exhausted inmates were beaten or shot to death. This chapter originally was a part of my French manuscript (“Manuscrit inedit, docteur Milos Vitek, Montreal, mai 1968”) which I mailed to Mr. Bernadac. It made known the tragedy of the Czech university scholars side by side with similar cases of the professors from the universities of Strasbourg and of Cracow. In Czechoslovakia my testimony on Mauthausen was used at the trial in Brno of the former Blockaeltester Ackerl, the notorious murderer of the inmates of the Czech block 13. “My evidence on Dachau was published, also in French, in the Bulletin de 1’Amicale des Anciens de Dachau in Paris and that on Mauthausen was summarized in German in the 2nd edition of the book Die Geschichte des Konzentrationslager Mauthausen, edited in Vienna by my Mauthausen coinmate Hans Marsalek. It contains many quotations from the Mauthausen Museum Archives by Vratislav Busek, Josef Podlaha, and myself. Marsalek’s documentary work was translated into Italian and was published in Milan. “Although I had been liberated in Dachau by the units of the Seventh Army of General Patch, I have written an English version of a portion of my unpublished book on Mauthausen 1942 for the Almanac of World War n, at the request of the American veterans, Thunderbolts, whose 11th Tank Division of General Patton’s Third Army liberated Mauthausen along with other camps in Upper Austria. Irritated by the statements of some Austrian Communists that Mauthausen was liberated by the Soviets, the veterans’ association decided to unveil in 1980 a memorial plate at the camp to honor the American soldiers who lost their lives in the liberation fights and to publish an appropriate commemorative almanac . This was an example of a historical distortion which occurs also in other East European countries where a similar attitude prevails, reserving the “privilege” of the resistance and of the imprisonment during the rule of the Nazis for the members of the Communist party. It is my opinion that one of the main tasks of the SVU is to countervail such distortions of historical facts in its periodicals or through its publishing program. Many of the SVU members have written and pictorial materials and documents that should be made public and preserved for the future researchers of the 20th century events.

As a part of Texas’ celebration of 150 years of independence, the event will emphasize the importance of Czech music to the culture of the state. Czechs began to emigrate to lusxas in large numbers during the 1830’s, and they have constituted a significant ethnic group in the state since then. Their rich musical heritage is best known for the traditional polkas and waltzes, many of which preserve authentic folk poetry in their Czech lyrics. The Bryan program will feature dance music but will not be limited to music suitable for ballroom dancing. Dozens of concert orchestras, choral groups, and folk dance troupes from around the state, representing all genres of Czech music, ipduding the classical, will perform during the three-day program. In addition to the musical performances, the symposium will include lectures and panel discussions on the subject of Czech music. The list of speakers includes Josef Skvorecky and his wife, Zdena Salivarova from Canada; Zdenek Salzmann, an anthropologist at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst; Michael Beckerman, a professor of music at Washington University in St. Louis and his wife Karen who is a singer; James P. Leary, a folklorist at the Wisconsin Folklife Center; Calvin Chervenka; Bernard M. Gebala, Vice-President of the Texas-Czech fraternal organization SPJST; Josef Rostinsky, a professor of Slavic languages, and other participants.
