[pageend1]SAN FRANCISCO VĚSTNÍK SEPTEMBER - OCTOBER, 1988 PAGE -2 Sokol Slet in Omaha in our classes. With the memories of the XXIV Olympics fading slowly into the West, the Board of Instructors at Sokol San Francisco hope to keep the Spirit of the Olympics alive by commencing gym classes at Sokol to prepare for our participation in the June of '89, and with that, we announce times for Unfortunately, at the time of this publication, we do not have an instructor for our older children - ages 7 and up. However, we are working toward solving this problem at this very moment. Officially, classes begin on the first Friday in October - October 7 with the following schedule. Tots: Ages 4 -6 Boys and Girls 6:00 - 7:00 pm Children: Ages 7 - up To be announced A fee of $15 paid in advance will be charged for the quarter - October - December, 1988. Adult classes will commence at 7:15 pm every Friday. When we find an instructor for the children's class, there might be a change in class time for adult classes. We are presently awaiting the arrival of all calisthenic drills and apparatus exercises from ASO. We do know that there are two calisthenic drills for the scheduled Slet in Omaha. One is the regular senior drill for both men and women. The other is a woman's drill done with Indian clubs. Women may learn and participate in both drills. SENIORS - clarification! Senior in Sokol is a classification of gymnasts that has nothing to do with being 65 years old. We consider any member 18 years of age or older as a senior. And, there are times when young adults under the age of 18 participate with the senior group. So, please don't picture seniors as old ladies and men with canes and rocking-chairs though we may enjoy a good rocking chair from time to time!!; ! Senior class gymnastic competition also exists, and we encourage our members to compete in this event. There are several classifications representing several levels of difficulty so we're sure you could find an appropriate niche for yourself. Nazdar!

Nejskvelejsim byl rok 1918, kdy se v nove republice obnovila po temer trista letech naše samostatnost, Zcela opacna situace nastala o dvacet let později, když jsme v oněch neblahých mnichovských dnech ztratili sve obranné pohraničí, coz vedlo k uplnemu pohlceni nacistickým Nemeckem. Naše nova republika, vzkříšena v roce 19^5 jiz jen s omezenou svobodou a demokracii, se dostala pod komunistickou vládu po zhoubném puči v roce 1948, To byl treti důležitý rok koncici "osmičkou". Tak zvané "Pražské jaro" v krátkém Dubcekove období, v roce 1968 přineslo jakýsi paprsek nadeje, který byl v zapeti udušen vojsky Varšavského paktu. A nyni v roce 1988, o dvacet let později, ti, kdož se toho dožili ve svobodném svete, máji výjimečnou příležitost vzpomenout! těchto dějinných epoch.

PART 3 Tyrs's philosophy was based on ancient history, mainly that of the Greeks.He admired the attainedheights of their culture,arts, and their educational system.The Spartans believed in co-eduVation. In their institutions under strict supervision, boys and girls were taught the arts of physical education.Competitions were held not only among the separate sexes,but on occasion,girl vied with the coys to attain the "sweet fruit’ of victory. It is therefore unthinkable and inprobable that Tyrš did not have in mind the physical education of women also, knowing very well that primarily the mother is the one most important in the rearing of a child. Thus having been influenced by the idea and education of Sokol, she will more than likely give the same ideas to her children . When the men's Sokol organization was established in 1862, it was an exceptional event in those times. The idea of freedom, equality and brotherhood was something rare. When one thinks back on the way of life and public opinion it is understandable why women were not included in the organization. In those days young girls were brought up in parochial schools and led a very sheltered life. All the time they had to behave like ladies i be serene, demure,always dutiful, etc.,etc. They were not supposed to have the power of decision, that was reserved for men only. At best, women were purely ornaments, that is among the wealthy; among the poor, one more pair of hands for hard work. Since it was unthinkable for women or young girls to skip for joy or even to laugh out loud, and less so for them to perform gymnastics, it was a hard task to convince them that movement and- gymnastics play an important part in the development of a healthy oody. And yet, there were a few courageous women, who Jinder the leadership of Clementine Hanuš followed the example of Sokol men and in 1869 established the first gymnstic association of women and girls in Prague. This was a separate unit, not connected with the men's Sokol. Although the men's units grew in numbers, the ladies gymnastic association was for more than 20 years the only one. In the 1890ties women began to think seriously a part of the Sokol association. At first their situation was not quite clear, as there were many questions unanswered, such as whether they should; 1) have their own leadership, 2) have equal rights, 3) be a part of the men’s unit without special privileges. It was not until 1898, that women were legally accepted in the Sokol organization. In 1901 they have for the first time performed at the Sokol "Slet",and the following year training courses for women were established. On the Slet in 1907 women have shown "what they are made of" by staying on their marks in the stadium even under heavy thundershowers-, a.nd only after a direct order from their leader^ left the field to seek shelter from the elements. Yet, even this show of stamina was not enough to grant them equality, and in 1911 this question was still up in the air. The decision was left to the concerned units, acor- ding to their needs. It was during the first ^orld War, when the life of Sokol units was thrust upon the women's shoulders, and more women and girls were joining, that they have finally acquired equality and rights,The women's ranks were continually growing; not only the number of women's units, but the membership itself was larger than that of some men's units. The final proof of their great interest and capability was the 10th Sokol Slet. There were so many women present that even after a double changeover of performing gymnasts, some of them did not get a chance to perform in the stadium J.K.

A hug can cheer you when you’re blue. A hug can say, “I love you so,” or, “Gee I hate to see you go.” A hug is “Welcome back again,” And, “Great to see you! Where’ve you been?” A hug can soothe a small child’s pain and bring a rainbow after rain. The hug! There’s just no doubt about it — We scarcely could survive without it! A hug delights and warms and charms. It must be why God gave us arms. Hugs are great for fathers and mothers, Sweet for sisters, swell for brothers. And chances are your favorite aunts Love them more than potted plants. Kittens crave them. Puppies love them. Heads of state are not above them. A hug can break the language barrier And make your travel so much merrier. No need to fret about your store of ’em; The more you give the more there’s more of ’em. So stretch those arms without delay And GIVE SOMEONE A HUG TODAY!!!

LABOR DAY 1988 Labor is one of the greatest elements of society — the great substantial interest on which we all stand. No feudal service or predial toll... but labor, intelligent, manly, independent, thinking and acting for itself, earning its own wages, accumulating those wages into capital, educating childhood, maintaing worship, claiming the right of the elective franchise, and helping to uphold the great fabric of the state — that is American labor; and all my sympathies are with it, and my voice, ’til I am dumb, will be for it. — Daniel Webster Grandmother, Grandfather! Sent from above; Child-hugging, heart tugging, symbols of Jove! Kind, understanding faith that supplies You who are keepers of family ties. Grandmother, Grandfather! Life is a test. You are the guardian of all that is best. Teacher, example, leader of men, Someone who listens, wonderful friend! Days became special when shared with a child. Grandmother sits with them, family style. Time to teach lessons with afternoon teas, Calling on neighbors, trying to please. Rainy days spent with a “memory” trunk, Making real treasures from discarded junk. Shaping their secrets, finding their toys, Teaching them gently life’s special joys. Knit a warm sweater, make pinafores, Sewing and cooking, shopping in stores, Note the resemblance to Mother and Dad, Flooded with memories, refreshing and glad. Cookies need baking, swings need a shove, Grandmothers know the importance of love. Grandfathers, Grandmothers! Yours to enjoy, Play with and daydream With your girl or boy! Grandfathers whistle, sometimes they talk, Tell a good story, go for a walk. Go along fishing with someone who cares, Yelling at ballgames, listening to prayers. Deep down inside, the heart sings a song, Feeling like springtime, vibrant and strong! Grandchildren grow up too fast to measure. Grandfathers know they aresomething to treasure. Grandmother, Grandfather! Hold out your hand! For this you were chosen, a part of God’s plan, To love them, to lead them, remove doubt and fear. Tomorrow is present when children are near! John Goodman CONSTITÚTION WEEK The President traditionally proclaims September 17 through 23 as Constitution Week, a special time for the Nation to focus attention on the Constitution. Citizenship Day, September 17, commemorates the signing of the Constitution (1787), recognizing particularly citizens who have come of age (new voters) and who have been naturalized (new citizens) during the year. The Commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution encourages the observance of Constitution Week as a permanent, visible, national commemoration. Your enthusiastic efforts during Constitution Week will enhance this commemoration and the primary objective of educating the public about the Constitution.

Different sections of the British Isles then developed their own variations on the Halloween theme. or a coin, one would be In Scotland, lassies blindfolded themselves and then chose cabbages from the patch to discover whether their future husbands would be young, old, poor, wealthy, sweet or sour. To tell the future on Halloween, the Irish used caulcannon, a dish of mashed potatoes, chopped onions and parsnips. If one’s serving held a ring, a doll, a thimble, married, have children, be an old maid, or be wealthy respectively. In the villages of Great Britain, nuts were tossed into a fire on this night. Good luck was determined by the way they burned. The Welsh fit hilltop bonfires, then raced downhill when the fires burned low. The last person down was caught by the devil. Both Scot and Irish peasants tried to burn the brooms of any witches flying near with pitchforks of flaming straw. Odds bodkins! Fraternal Herald Ellis Island Museum to include American Immigrant Wall of Honor ELLIS ISLAND ------------1892-1992------------- The final phase of fundraising and specific exhibit themes, including a new American Immigrant Wall of Honor on which forebears’ names can be inscribed, have been announced for the Ellis Island Museum. Restoration of Ellis Island and the 200,000 square foot historic Main Building is scheduled to be completed by 1989, when the Museum will open to the public. “The brick and mortar we are repairing and the historic artifacts being restored are merely symbols of our great immigrant heritage. The immigrant stories that will be told, the ethnic history of our country and the emotions felt here at Ellis Island are the real focal points of our effort,” said Stephen Briganti, president of The Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation. Each exhibit will enliven a particular aspect of the immigration experience. Together, the exhibits will recreate the entire immigration process, the emotions and the thoughts of our ancestors as they began their new lives in America. Possibly the most personally gratifying display at the Ellis Island Museum will be The American Immigrant Wall of Honor. Located just off the Great Hall and adjacent to the historic Registry Room will be a unique area devoted to an exhibit of names of all national origins. It will be a collective display, representing the individual family heritages that created the history of America. With a contribution of $100 or more to fund the Museum and its exhibitry, donors can place a name of their choice on The American Immigrant Wall of Honor. It is the first opportunity to place the name of an immigrant ancestor or an individual’s family name on permanent public display at a national monument. For information on participation in the program, write to The Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation, Inc., 52 Vanderbilt Avenue, New York, NY 10017-3808 or phone (212) ,883-1987.
