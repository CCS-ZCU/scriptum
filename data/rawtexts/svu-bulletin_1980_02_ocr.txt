Of all the varied activities of the Society, the biannual Congresses are perhaps the most important. Distinguished Members of the Society and friends of Czechoslovak culture get together for three days to participate in the many activities dealing with contributions of Czechoslovak art, humanities, and sciences to world culture - in fascinating lectures and exciting panel discussions, in outstanding exhibits of paintings, sculptures, and books, and in absorbing and entertaining musical performances. A festive dinner-dance honoring the Congress participants culminates this three-day event, which we hope, will attract this year the attention of our many friends in the cultural, social, and political life of Washington, D.C. And so, dear friends, if you find the fare of the Congress as attractive as we do, start planning now your taking part in it. W e will gladly mail you a full program and, if you wish, help you with housing. W e guarantee you three pleasant, informative, and exciting days among friends of Czechoslovak culture. I am personally looking forward to meeting you and talking to you at the Congress. Yours, Jan F. Triska A NON-PROFIT CULTURAL ORGANIZATION CONTRIBUTIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE [pageend1]MEETINGS 10th World Congress of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences, Inc. October 17 - 20, 1980 at Georgetown University, Washington, D.C. The General Assembly and business meeting will be held on Friday morning, October 17th. A concert of Czech music, in honor of the 100th anniversary of the birth of the late Jan Kubelik, will take place on Saturday evening; the Georgetown Symphony Orchestra with John Welsh, Director, will perform.

STANISLAV J. MARSIK - VICE-PRESIDENT Stanislav Marsik, Research Physicist and Nuclear Engineer at the NASA- Lewis Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio, was born on August 6, 1927, in Vlasenice on the Czech-Moravian Highlands. He left Czechoslovakia in 1948 via Germany and Italy and arrived in Canada in the summer of 1949. He moved with his family to Detroit in 1954 and continued his studies in electronics and communications engineering. He eventually pursued studies in physics at John Carroll University, Cleveland. He is currently engaged in research of solar energy conversion (Photovoltaics) for use both in space and for terrestrial application. He is a holder of several patents in his field, has authored/co-authored more than thirty research papers, and has received numerous awards for his work. He and his wife, Zdenka, are parents of three daughters, a mathematician and system analyst, a Spanish and German teacher, and an agronomist. For relaxation he works on creative photo3 [pageend3]graphic print-making and has received several ribbons and honorable mentions in international competitions sponsored by the Photographic Society of America. He has been an SVU member since 1958 as Director-at-Large and for several terms as President of the Cleveland Chapter of SVU. As a national Vice-President, he was the organizer of the highly successful Ninth World Congress of SVU held in Cleveland on October 26-29, 1978. He is currently the Membership Chairman of the Society, and inquiries about membership should be directed to him (address on page 1). Another project he started to do for the Society was the preparatory work for a SVU Speakers’ Bureau. When we have more information about that potential service, we shall publicize it widely. + V A C L A V H L A V A T Ý - F IR S T PR E SID E N T OF SVU Vaclav Hlavatý was born in Louny, Czechoslovakia, on January 27, 1894, and died in Bloomington, Indiana, on January 11, 1969, shortly before his 75th birthday. He graduated from Charles University, Prague, in 1921 with a Ph.D. in mathematics and became professor at the same school from 1930 until 1939, when the university was closed. He had a difficult time during the Nazi occupation though he continued to work on his writings in various areas of geometry. He returned to Charles University in 1945 but had to leave his country in 1948. He became Distinguished Service Professor at Indiana University in Bloomington where he taught from 1948 to his retirement in 1964, continuing then as a researcher. A Festschrift was prepared by the university with SVU, under the title Perspectives in Geometry and Relativity. Essays in Honor of Vaclav Hlavatý, Banesh Hoffmann, ed. (Bloomington-London: Indiana University Press, 1966, 491 p.; available from SVU books.) Scientists from many countries contributed to this publication, some of them being Dr. Hla- vaty’s former students. By the time of his death, Dr. Hlavatý had published 158 major studies in the areas of differential geometry, non-Euclidean geometry, geometro- dynamics, space-time curvature, theory of relativity, and other subjects. He cooperated directly on some special problems with Albert Einstein, for whom he worked out mathematical solutions and thus proved the correctness of certain Einsteinian theorems of relativity. This work put him into the rank of the ten most eminent scientists in the world. Vaclav Hlavatý was interested in all the cultural and political aspects of Czechoslovakia and was one of the founders of SVU. He was the Society’s first President between 1958 and 1962 and was reelected for the term of 1966- 68. In 1961 he undertook a lecture tour to seventy universities and scientific institutes in twelve countries and used this opportunity to make SVU known throughout the free world. He also met many countrymen and prospective members in the cities where he lectured. A scroll with an address in Latin, to which all the visited institutions attached their seals, was given 4 [pageend4]him by SVU, but it is held at the Indiana University as a one-of-its-kind document, a testament of the multi-faceted activities of this Czechoslovak- American scientist, an exceptional human being. ★ JIRI SKVOR - PAST VICE-PRESIDENT AND EDITOR OF PROMENY (METAMORPHOSES) He was born on June 24, 1916, in Martinice on a farm where his family had homesteaded for many generations. His father became active in politics and gave his son the opportunity to study law at Charles University in Prague. This background of being close to country people and combining an interest in politics and education played an important role in Jiri Skvor’s development. His law studies were interrupted by the Nazi occupation, when Czechoslovak universities were closed for six years. He then graduated in 1945 with a doctorate (J.U.D.) and in 1946 was nominated an alternate to the House of Representatives. He also worked as editor of the daily Svobod- ne slouo and with several organizations promoting rural adult education. In 1948 he escaped to West Germany, was active with the International Refugee Organization (IRO), and two years later emigrated to Canada. His wife, an artist, and son managed to join him there ten years later. In Canada he lived the first year as a “ registered cowboy” on an isolated ranch. He then returned to “civilization” , worked in Montreal as an editor of Radio Canada International, earned a Ph.D. (1956), and taught Slavistics at the University of Montreal. He was among the first organizers of the Czechoslovak Society o f Arts and Sciences, Inc., becoming a Vice-President for several terms. He also edited the cultural quarterly Promeny for eight years until last year. Like many others of his generation, Dr. Skvor had to rebuild hislife several times. In his case what sustained him most was poetry. He started to write poetry in high school and had his first collection published in 1939. In his subsequent poems he reacted to all the disruptive changes around him without ever succumbing to complete despair. While in Germany he chose his pen name, Pavel Javor2 under which he has published his work ever since. He has continued to write his poems in Czech, even though it limits his reader- ship. Among his expatriate compatriots he has gained the prominent position of “official poet of the Czech exile” . An interesting analysis of his poetic production by Maria Nemcova Baner- jee, “Pavel Javor and the pathos of the exile” (in Czech), was recently published in Promeny (16/4, 1979, p. 60-66), followed by a selection of his poems from different periods. One collection of his poems was translated into German under the title Morgenwege (Stockholm, 1955). Another small volume, La Récolte Pauvre, (special issue of the literary revue Rencontres, No. 3, Paris, 1965) offers ten poems in French and thirteen poems in English translation. 5 [pageend5]To present a poet in translation, even a very skillful one, is never adequate but we will reprint two poems by Pavel Javor-Dr.Jiri Skvor, different in form and mood, demonstrating the classicist trend of his nostalgic odyssey and his lyrical acceptance of the human fate. Smoke from Ithaka The fatherland makes itself heard, for the wind there is blowing. Not yet have you drunk all the cup or drained love to the lees. At evening it makes itself heard; the earth’s rancour outgoing, Breathes bitter mistrust of the hemlock and poisons the breeze. Surely, somewhere in yonder blue distance our homeland is hidden. And each day you bury it deeper, a mite at a time. It sleeps beyond oceans afar, veiled in tear-drops unbidden. Eternity walls us about and our words feebly chime. Shall we clasp to our hearts those we loved in youth’s happy devising? Alas, our old homeland grows foreign and from us is riven, Though somewhere in yonder blue distance our home’s smoke is rising. You pray with a suppliant voice and no answer is given. You call with wild heart but a glacial blizzard blows coldly And buries forever all things that you loved in the past. In vain the heart pleads, and in vain utters blasphemies boldly. Hot tears of despair from my eyes gush in silence at last... (Translated from the Czech by Watson Kirkconnell) The autumn II The lonely moon above us - a bright coin on display - A shadow of helpless anguish, sweeping your voice away - A few more autumns passing and then we shall be gone. And still the corn will rustle, the birds fly on... (Translated from the Czech by Alfred French) 6 [pageend6]SVU GROWTH A long-needed publication is in press to be ready by the time of the 10th World Congress in October, Educators with Czechoslovak Roots. A U.S. and Canadian Faculty Roster, compiled by Miloslav Rechcigl, Jr., Past President of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences, Inc.; Washington, D.C.: SVU Press, 1980. W e quote from the author’s Preface: “This publication represents the first systematic attempt to catalogue individuals with Czechoslovak roots associated with the U.S. and Canadian colleges and universities. The term Czechoslovak roots, as defined here, should be interpreted strictly in a geographic context without reference to nationality of the listed individuals. The listing includes persons who were born in Czechoslovakia, as well as individuals who resided and were educated there, and those with professional interest in Czechoslovak matters. In addition, it also includes a small percentage of individuals of Czechoslovak descent - the second, the third, or the fourth generation Americans, etc. - whose origin could be traced with certainty. The last group would have been considerably larger had it been feasible to determine the ethnic origin of the literally hundreds of other persons who bear typical Czech or Slovak names in the U.S. and Canadian academic community. The present compilation - the result of many years of tedious work and effort - is based on numerous sources, ranging from school catalogues through directories of professional societies to biographical compendia...” ★ A New SVU Local Chapter A new chapter of the Society was founded in March, 1980, in Vienna, Austria. A number of Czech andSlovak artists and scientists, SVU members, have lived in Vienna for a long time, among them the opera soprano Jarmila Novotna, after her retirement from the Metropolitan Opera. Other Czechoslovak intellectuals have emigrated to Vienna more recently. W HAT’S YOUR THING? Here is the continuation of “our things” that might interest you, to be gradually enlarged as to the introduced categories and additional information. The Secretary General, all officers of the Society whose addresses are on the front page, and the editor of this Bulletin will be glad to serve as liaison between SVU members and the interested readers. Communication is one of our aims. 7 [pageend7]LITERATURE Josef Skvorecky, Laureate of the Neustadt International Prize for Literature, sponsored by World Literature Today (formerly Books Abroad) This biennial prize, carrying the name of the Oklahoma Neustadt family of industrialists, was first awarded in 1970 by the University of Oklahoma at Norman. The jurors are each time drawn from among literary critics, writers, and teachers of literature of all countries of the world. In the past, Vera Lou- kotkova, a Czech writer living in France, was one of the jurors. This year Arnost Lustig represented Czechoslovakia/USA, and Ivar Ivask Estonia/ USA, editor of the journal World Literature Today, was the chairman of the jury. The previous winners were Giuseppe Ungaretti (Italy, 1970); Gabriel Garcia Marquez (Colombia, 1972); Francis Ponge (France, 1974); Elizabeth Bishop (USA, 1976); and Czeslaw Milosz (Poland, 1978). The candidates for the 1980 competition were from Portugal, South Africa, France, West Germany (Gunter Grass), South Korea, India, Yugoslavia, Greece, Scotland - and the winner, (Josef Skvorecky from Czechoslovakia) Canada. The best-known Skvorecky’s book in English is probably The Bass Saxophone: Two Novellas, translated by Kaca Polackova-Henley, published by Knopf (176 pp., $8.95). However, more of his books are currently available in English: The Cowards, All the Bright Young Men and Women (a history of Czech cinema), Miss Silver’s Past (with a preface by Graham Greene), The Mournful Demeanor of Ltn. Boruvka, and The Story of an Engineer of Human Souls (1980). “The Bass Saxophone” is the title of the second novella, narrating the story of a jazz ensemble existing during the “Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia” . The first novella, “Emoke”, is placed in the ’fifties. The preface, “Red Music” , explains the importance of American jazz for the generations of young people living in totalitarian states, where it became a vehicle for self- expression, a revolt against restrictive ideological condemnations of such music, and the reaching out for freedom beyond the miserable present. This “ lure of the West” has proved to be stronger and more elusive than other forms of proscribed expression. The book was accepted with more than usual comprehension by the critics, who reviewed it favourably in many serious journals and the press, including The New Yorker, Newsweek, The Saturday Review, Los Angeles Times, etc. Josef Skvorecky has been compared with Chekhov, Kafka, Faulkner, and even Henry James for his sensual language contrasting the brutality and bleakness of the environment against which his protagonists rebel. The autobiographical elements add to the authenticity of the narrative. In this connection, Dr. Skvorecky, professor at the University of Toronto, was recently willing to perform on an alto saxophone to prove to his friends and readers he really knew how to “ blow his horn” . However, as he said in 8 [pageend8]the interview for the Czech magazine Zapad (The West, published by Collegium Bohemicum in Canada), he never played it too well even in his youth, and it was easier and more satisfying to write about it. Josef Skvorecky has lived in Toronto since 1969 where he founded, with his wife, writer Zdenka Salivarova-Skvorecka, the Sixty-Eight Publishers. He served as Vice-President of the Society during the terms of 1974-78 and currently is a member of the SVU Council. One of his longer articles, “The Situation of Czech and Slovak Literatures Today” , was published in three parts in the Bulletin of the Los Angeles SVU Chapter, Vol. VI., 1974. ★ One of the best known Czechoslovak writers who was often translated into English before W W II. is Karel Capek. He even enriched Webster’s (and other dictionaries) with his term “ robot” , which he introduced in the play R.U.R. This year marks the 90th anniversary of his birth. ★ Andy Warhol has a Czech-American background. He has just published a new book, Popism: The Warhol ’60s (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich), a collection of his opinions, observations, and comments on whatever or whoever had caught his attention. CZECHOSLOVAK COLLECTIONS Czechoslovak Collection Established at Lauinger Library On September 15, 1979, the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences, Inc. donated some 300 books and documents to the Georgetown University Library. To be known as the Czechoslovak collection, the initial gift consists primarily of books on religious history (Comenius, Jan Hus, Cyril and Methodius, Moravian Brethern, etc.); Czech, Slovak, English, and German essays on the history of Bohemia, Moravia, Slovakia, Carpatho-Ukraine, and Czechoslovakia in general; and documents relating to the contribution of Czechs and Slovaks to development of North America. The handing-over ceremony was held at the Gunlocke Special Collections Room of the Joseph Mark Lauinger Memorial Library. Two special exhibits were arranged for the occasion: documents from the Bohemia Manor, an estate belonging to Augustine Herrman, the first known immigrant from Bohemia to North America; and papers from the recently acquired collection of documents of Richard Crane, the first U.S. Minister accredited to C zechoslovakia after the declaration of its independence. Members of the Washington, D.C., local chapter indicated that SVU would continue to promote the growth of this collection among its own members, hoping that the University authorities will do likewise among Georgetown alumni and friends. An occasion is just around the corner. The Librarian has already promised to arrange some suitable Czechoslovakia- related exhibits for the upcoming 10th World Congress of SVU. (From a report by Frank Meissner, former Treasurer of SVU and former Instructor of Marketing, Georgetown University School of Business Administration. Reprints of the complete report ara available from the author.) 9 [pageend9]University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Russian and East European Center, describes its Czechoslovak holdings in 1979 as follows: Czechoslovakia: Total holdings come to about 38.000 volumes. Illinois has nearly all of the major Czech and Slovak scholarly periodicals in history, literature, the social sciences, philosophy, and art, with a good coverage of religion as well. The literature collections, about 8,000 volumes, include complete editions of all important authors and nearly all of the standard critical and bibliographical works, although there are still significant gaps in the holdings of titles published in the last two decades. There are more than 9,000 volumes on Czech and Slovak history and politics, including many complete runs of historical journals and collections of published documents, in addition of standard monographs. The history of the Czechoslovak Republic to 1948 finds extensive coverage and includes good holdings of contemporary periodicals. Since 1973 the University has also offered a Summer Research Laboratory on Russia and Eastern Europe to scholars (associates) who wish to use the library for independent research. A number of faculty members and specialists are available for discussion groups in many fields. The total number of participants in 1973-79 was 765 associates, staying usually for two weeks. Czechoslovak topics represented 2.7 percent of the research. For information write to: Slavic Reference Service, 225 Library, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801. (From a pamphlet of the University for members of AAASS) ETHNIC STUDIES AND HISTORY Society for the History of Czechoslovak Jews, Inc. (SHCJ) was established in 1961 in New York as a revival of the Society for the History of the Jews in the Czechoslovak Republic, which had existed in Prague from 1927 to 1939. A few of the original members who escaped to the U.S. formed the Joseph Popper Lodge of B’nai B’rith and eventually founded the above society. In 1968 the society came out with Vol. I. of the The Jews of Czechoslovakia. Historical Studies and Surveys, 583 pp., and three years later with Vol. II., same title, 707 pp., both published by SHCJ and The Jewish Publication Society of America. The two volumes roughly cover the years 1918 through 1938. Against the expectations of the planners, who anticipated a modest book, the project was taken up with enthusiasm by writers from all parts of the world, and the collected material expanded so much that a third volume, dedicated to the war and post-war years, had to be undertaken. It is in press and will be ready for distribution in spring, 1981. Lewis Weiner, current President of SHCJ, and the late Ludovit Sturc (1903-1976), past President, as well as some of the authors of the essays and 10 [pageend10]other members are SVU members. Among other activities, SHCJ annually organizes a Memorial Service for Czechoslovak Jews, Victims of Nazism, in which Dvorak’s “Largo” from the “New World Symphony” has become a traditional concluding number. Vol. I. covers Jewish historiography and history of the Jews in the Historic Lands as well as in Slovakia and Subcarpathian Ruthenia. Several essays explore the problems of the Jewish minority and of the religious organizations. The economy and music have each a chapter. An extended section is dedicated to literature, the press, and publishing houses in the whole Republic. Guido Kisch, Honorary President of SHCJ, Hans Kohn, Ruth Kestenberg-Gladstein, Livia Rothkirchen, Aryeh Sole, Aharon Moshe Rabinowicz, Gustav Fleischmann, Hugo Stransky, Joseph C. Pick, Egon Hostovsky, Petr Den, Avigdor Dagan, Harry Zohn, Meir Faerber, and the late Paul Nettl are the authors. Vol. 1Í. is dedicated to the memory of Dr. Oskar K. Rabinowicz (d. 1969), whose long essay on Czechoslovak Zionism is included, as well as personal reminiscences of him by Cecil Roth and Theodore K. Rabb. A major part of the volume presents Jewish movements and organizations, religion, welfare and education. The portion designated to the arts has a good sample of pertinent plates. The last section, Transition, has chapters on refugees to and from Czechoslovakia after 1933, emigration to Palestine, and a very interesting eyewitness’s description of the “ Mauritius” transport. Irma Polak, Gertrude Hirschler, S. Goshen, J. W. Bruegel, Chaim Yahil, Felix Weltsch, Jan Ehrenwald, Hana Volavkova, Frank Reichenthal, Zdenka Muenzer, Richard Teltscher, Eugen Barkany, Kurt R. Grossmann, Manfred George, Fini Brada, Aaron Zwergbaum, and some others from Vol. I. are the authors. The third volume, calculated as approx. 600 pp. and 40 illustrations, will have three sections: The Holocaust, The War, and After. Some specific topics are: The Anti-Jewish Laws and Regulations in the Protectorate (John G. Lexa), Terezin (Zdenek Lederer), Jews in Czechoslovak Armed Forces during W W II (Erich Kulka), The Czechoslovak Government-in-Exile and the Jews (Avigdor Dagan), The Story of Czech Scrolls (Joseph C. Pick), besides othel essays describing the postwar situation of the Jews in Czechoslovakia. A limited number of copies of Vols. I and II is still available. Those who want to have this scholarly, meticulous, and humanly penetrating monumental work should direct inquiries to: Joseph Abeles-, Treasurer, 102-30 62nd Road, Forest Hills, N.Y. 11375. It is an indispensable source of data for any student of the problems of minorities - how they were handled from ethnic, nationality, language, and religion’s points of view - in the highly idealistic First Czechoslovak Republic. In a way, it is also obituary to the thousand- year history of Jewry flourishing in the “heart of Europe”. 11 [pageend11]POETRY Among the old-timers of Czechoslovak descent we find many personalities who contributed their special talents to the U.S. Today we wish to say goodbye to Josef Martinek, the “ poet of the desert” . He was born on March 23, 1889, in Podebrady, Bohemia, and died on March 21, 1980, in Tucson, Arizona, two days short of 91 years. He emigrated to America in 1909 and first settled in Cleveland, Ohio, working in factories as a metal worker. In 1912 he became editor of two Czech language weeklies. He played an important part in the American labor movement, the cooperative movement, and in Czech fraternal societies. He was also a teacher in a Czech school. During W W I he participated intensely in the Czechoslovak liberation movement led by Thomas G . Masaryk. In Cleveland in 1915 he was secretary of the first Conference of Czechs and Slovaks, and in 1918 he signed the Pittsburgh Agreement along with Professor Masaryk. After the war he studied sociology at Western Reserve University in Cleveland and was the president of a large consumer cooperative. In 1925 he founded the Czech cooperative village of Taborville near Cleveland and also served on the board of directors of the Cooperative League of America in New York. In 1934 Martinek returned to Czechoslovakia to work as a newspaper editor. He then published two books of historical and sociological studies. An active anti-Nazi, he was forced to flee for his life from Prague when Hitler invaded the country. Coming to Chicago in February, 1939, he joined Czech President Eduard Benes, who at that time lectured at the University of Chicago, and was working in the second liberation movement. He became the secretary of the Czechoslovak Council of America and editor of its publications. Since 1947 he lived in Tucson, writing his poetry and scripts for Radio Free Europe and Voice of America. He also edited the Czech weekly Americke lisfy. Martinek’s work in ethnic studies, though written in Czech, won him recognition and membership in several learned societies and inclusion in many biographical publications. Despite severe problems with his sight, he worked on his memoirs and revision of his writings. He was an active participant in the establishment of SVU and an honorary member since 1960. He started to write his poems directly in English in 1954 and saw them published in many American, British, and Canadian magazines and anthologies dedicated to poetry. One larger collection of his English poems is the book Songs of the Desert (N.Y.: Universum Press Co., 1963,130 pp.). Some of his poems are a personal expression of his life philosophy; some are blunt political or sociological comments; others appear deceptively lyrical until a surprising turn of phrase shows that Josef Martinek was always concerned with mankind’s fate and questions of life and death, and that he was a fighter for his ideals. 12 [pageend12]The two short poems we reprint from Songs of the Desert show Josef Martinek. in his different moods. Tired The Superm arket Age What I once wrote Drive-in restaurants With a black chalk in the chimney, Drive-in banks. What once I wrote Run-of-the-mill goods, With a light feather on the water, Run-of-the-mill men. What once 1 wrote With a slow finger in snow Again I am trying to write With a brittle stick in sands Run-of-the-ribbon novels. Write-in magazines. Non-writers producing Non-books. While the jealous wind Astir in its Western nest Instant coffee, Instant tea. Lifts its wings to sweep the floor Instant poems. Of the desert clean And I am tired, tired, tired. ARTS Oskar Kokoschka (1896-1980) The painter and writer Kokoschka, though born in Austria, had strong ties to Prague, the city where his grandfather had been a prominent goldsmith, where he met his future wife from the Czech family Palkovsky, and where he stayed from 1934 to 1938 as an exile from the Germanic areas that found his expressionistic art uncomprehensible and “ degenerate” . Between 1938-1948 he lived in England, then moved to Switzerland, where he died on February 22 at the age of almost 94. He was an honorary member of this Society since 1967. Kokoschka was an artist who early developed a highly individualized style. “ Ecstasy as style” is the posthumous verdict of one of his eulogists who tries to describe his painting techniques as well as his inner attitudes to his subjects, whose essence he powerfully transferred on canvas. A certain visual distortion of perspective, reminiscent of El Greco, is attributed to his a- stigmatism aggravated by wounds from W W I. In his portraits of well-known public personalities, he miraculously caught “the inner face” of the subjects, sometimes to their surprise or even displeasure. Among his portraits are those of President Masaryk (1936), Max Reinhardt, West German Chancellor Adenauer, the Archbishop otMorence, and many others. His approach to his numerous cityscapes was similar. He liked to look down at the wide panoramas from an elevated observation point, desregarding details but evoking a suggestive permanence of the 13 [pageend13]place. Somehow he was able to fuse the past, present, and future in his paintings. In this manner he created the complicated backdrop of a timeless Prague view, Komensky’s figure, Jan Hus’s death, and other symbolic features for the serious nobility of Masaryk’s face. Thus he painted a self- portrait into his triptychon “Thermopylae” (1954) for the University of Hamburg, calling this figure a “ loiterer” . Not a hero in the midst of an historical action, but an outsider - observer - was Kokoschka’s position in his art and his life, which went by “so crazily fast” , as he said when he was 75. His Prague landscapes form a special series and were published in 1967 by Artia for Paul Hamlyn Ltd. (London) under the title Kokoschka: The Artist in Prague. The author, Jan Tomes, and the publisher were able to reproduce fifteen Prague paintings, in addition to the Masaryk portrait (Carnegie Institute, Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) and “Prague Nostalgia” (London, collection of Lord Michael Croft), painted in 1938 after his arrival in London. It is interesting that Kokoschka also wrote poetry and plays. His Murder, Hope of Women was used by Paul Hindemith as the libretto for a one-act opera, which had a stormy premiere in 1921 in Stuttgart. Another theater piece, written in 1939 in London and made into a TV script a few years ago, was the play Via Lucis of Jan Amos Komensky. Kokoschka’s respect for Komensky’s teachings and for Chelcicky’s pacifism was another tie to Bohemia, finding expression in his orbis pictus, his unmistakably personal vision of the world. An exhibition of Kokoschka’s paintings and of works by Koloman Sokol, SVU member and one of the foremost graphic artists from Slovakia, was organized in 1968 during the Fourth World Congress of SVU. Josef Paul Hodin, SVU member living in Great Britain, is one of his known biographers and connoisseurs. HOLOCAUST A very special chapter in the history of the “ model ghetto” (concentration camp), Terezin/Theresienstadt, was the temporary flourishing, under unspeakable conditions, of all the arts, including music. Joza Karas,. SVU member and a graduate of the Prague Conservatory, came to this country in 1950 and is active in Hartford, CT. He initiated his research on the Music of Terezin in 1970. CBS aired his hour-long program on this topic in 1971. One musical example perforTned on the show was an excerpt from the children’s opera Brundibar (The Bumble-Bee, 1939) by Hans Krasa (b. Prague, Nov. 30, 1899; d. Auschwitz, Oct. 16, 1944). In 1975 Joza Karas conducted the entire opera at Hartford, with local American children singing in Czech. Two years later he premiered the English version, prepared by his late wife and himself, in Ottawa under the auspices of the Canadian Council of Christians and Jews and other organizations. Translations into other languages have been discussed. A Hebrew premiere in a kibbutz, under the direction of a Czech-born music teacher, 14 [pageend14]Nannc Magel, reportedly took place in 1962, and another performance was planned for 1977/78. The two-act opera on the libretto by Adolf Hoffmeister, described as “a tale of the triumph of innocence over arrogance and power” , was presented over fifty times in Terezin between 1941-44. The American productions were the first in the West. Almost all of the original young singers-actors disappeared in the transports to the extermination camps after this work and other cultural events in Terezin had been cynically exploited by SS as a show for inspecting International Red Cross delegations. However, for the participants and the literally captive audience, “music sustained, gave strength and hope, numbed pain, and at least for a fleeting moment entertained, educated, and defied”, says Professor Karas. His research has led to the discovery of some 25 original scores of musical works created and performed in Terezin. He has recently finished a book about it which should appear in the near future. His expertise has been recognized in Czechoslovakia and Israel, and has been favourably commented upon in the press, who have praised his interest in this topic, though he is not a Jew. He frequently gives lectures on his findings, has published articles, and recently has founded with his Hartford colleagues the Karas String Quartet, which plays music of the Holocaust by Victor Ullman, Karas, and Gideon Klein, besides other standard works. The music of Terezin has been a special project occupying Joza Karas for ten years, side by side with his assiduous promoting of Czechoslovak music in concerts and broadcasts. ★ Among the writers on the Holocaust, Arnost Lustig (b. 1926 in Prague, Czechoslovakia) has won a place of esteem with his novels translated into English. He survived Terezin, Auschwitz, and Buchenwald concentration camps and after the war had a successful career as a radio reporter, screen writer, and novelist in Prague. His latest geographical displacement occurred after August, 1968. He and his family became United States’ residents, living near Washington, D.C. His books, in hardcover and paperback, treat the dimensions of human suffering, hope, death or survival, heroism, and helplessness in face of the evil incarnate. They are the novels A Prayer for Katerina Horouitzova, Dita Saxoua, and Darkness Casts N o Shadow. Night and Hope and Diamonds of the Night are collections of stories.
