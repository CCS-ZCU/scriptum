[pageend2]Urgent Message from the Board PREPARATION OF THE NEW DIRECTORY OF THE MEMBERS OF SVU Preparations are under way for the new 6th Edition of the Biographical Directory of the Members of the Society. We urge all Members to fill out the enclosed Questionnaire without delay and send it immediately to the Directory Editor, Mrs. Eva Rechcigl, 1703 Mark Lane Rockville, MD 20852, USA. In previous years some members neglected to fill out the questionnaire or did not return it in time, which resulted in incomplete, outdated, or inaccurate data in the previous editions. For some members we have no further data than their address. In many instances telephone numbers are missing. We would like to correct these deficiencies once and for all. It is to everyone’s advantage that this document be as complete and accurate as possible. In addition to the vital data, we would like to include scientific, artistic and cultural interests of our members, as well as basic information about their work, including the titles of their publications, works of art, etc. We encourage you to enclose your Curriculum vitae as well as references to other biographical sources that contain your biographical data. In the Questionnaire there is a section pertaining to your children. There are several reasons for this. We would like to encourage our young people to become Members of the Society and to awaken their interest in Czechoslovak culture. Furthermore, the Society has initiated a comprehensive study, under the direction of Dr. Rechcigl, pertaining to the “Contributions of Czechs and Slovaks Abroad”. The information you could provide about your children would be invaluable for this task. Apart from this project, we would like to initiate a new feature on the accomplishments of our younger generation in the Bulletin or Zprávy SVU. We hope that you will respond favorably to this and fully support our efforts. Please fill out the enclosed questionnaire either by typewriter or legibly print the information. Use diacritical marks where applicable. Original academic titles and original names of institutions, rather than their English equivalents, should be used (e.g. JUDr., RNDr, CSc., prom, filolog, etc). If possible, please fill out the English Questionnaire. We need to know how many members plan to purchase the Directory in order to print the correct number of copies. We therefore urge you to state how many copies you wish to order. Members who prepay will get a considerable discount. The price for prepaid will be $8.00, regular price for members $10.00, and $15.00 for non-members. The quoted prices are in US dollars. We hope our members will take advantage of this opportunity and order now. Your cooperation will be appreciated. Milos Kucera Secretary General 3 [pageend3]ON THE MARGINS OF TIME Jiri Nehnevajsa And then, on that lovely day of early May, the angry guns fell silent. The gentle breezes across the face of tortured Europe seemed filled with the sweet fragrance of freedom. There, in the dawn’s moments of yet another springtime, a season was ushered in which all dreams seemed attainable, in which hope could be transformed into reality, in which the caresses of humaneness could once and for all exorcise the barbarism and needlessness of suf fering which some men inflict upon their fellow men. It was a season to sing and dance, to piant and to build. It was a season of deliverance. It was a good time to be alive even though this blossoming of life had been dearly paid for by the tens of millions who perished in battle, in concentration camps, in bombing raids, in death marches, in massacres. It was a season to prove that all this immensurable sacrifice was pot in vain. True, out in the Far East - halfway across the planet - the killing and dying would continue for some time yet until the light of the blazing sun of early August was to be matched, if but for a fraction of a second, by weapons that engulfed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And then, too, the guns were silenced there and all good things seemed possible. Even through the mist of so many years gone by, through the soft haze that veils the clarity of recollection and blurs the sharpness of memory, it is *■ impossible to forget the sense of elation, the overwhelming feeling of joy, the laughter and tears of happiness at the cradle of the season of peace and freedom. Alas, for many lands and many people the promises of the season turned out to be but few and shortlived. For those of us whose roots lie in the soil of Czechoslovakia, the passing of the years has not diminished the anguish, the sadness and, yes, the anger we felt in those days of a dying February only less than three short years after the exhilaration of freedom’s rebirth. It seems easy, if painful to remember. And we were young then. Many of us succeeded in finding a free haven and a new home far away from the land of our origins. We have been able to seek our fulfillment among, and with, other free women and men. W e know only too well that millions and millions of people across the world cannot share the blessings of freedom with us. Thus, perhaps, out of the womb of our collective and individual experiences, we have an obligation to help maintain, nourish, advance and expand the very best there is in the endangered moral and cultural traditions of our Slovak and Czech peoples and in the heritage of free men everywhere. Our strength does not lie in guns, nor should it ever have to lie there, it is the strength of our ideas, of our knowledge and its wise uses, it is our integrity and commitment that bear the invincible seeds of better tomorrows. Pittsburgh, March 17, 1985 4 [pageend4]Společnost pro vědy a umění Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences A NON-PROFW CULTURAL ORGANIZATION · CONTRIBUTIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE RESOLUTION OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD OF THE CZECHOSLOVAK SOCIETY OF ARTS AND SCIENCES IN COMMEMORATION OF THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TERMINATION OF WORLD WAR II IN EUROPE ON MAY 8TH, 1945. Four decades ago, the European phase of the Second World War came to an end. We cannot but remember the suffering of countless people from many lands who were drawn into that global conflict. With sadness, admiration and gratitude, we recall the supreme sacrifice of millions of men and women, including Czechs and Slovaks, who gave their lives or perished seeking to restore individual freedom and national independence. And while this is a moment to pause and reminisce, it is also a time for healing the remaining deep wounds and, above all, for looking ahead. The fortieth anniversary of the deadliest war ever fought on the European continent must strengthen our commitment to ceaseless efforts toward a future when all humanity can and will enjoy the blessing of liberty, human dignity and lasting peace. On this historic occasion, on behalf of its membership, The Executive Board of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences, a world-wide association founded in the United States of America in 1960 and including men and women of letters, artists, scholars and scientists working and creating unimpaired by censorship or thought control, HAS RESOLVED to rededicate the Society to its basic principles of freedom of scientific research, scholarship, teaching, as well as of literary and artistic production; to reaffirm its belief in the right of people everywhere to travel freely inside and outside their national boundaries, to voice their own opinions, to exchange views with partners of their choice, to enjoy freedom of worship, to form organizations in the pursuit of common interests, to express and report publicly their ideas, criticism and research findings; and, mindful that ignorance breeds prejudice, distrust and often hatred, to stress the importance of the right of all people to equal access to education on all levels, unfettered by doctrinarian coercion, by dogmatic uniformity or by discrimination of any kind. For the ExecutiveJSe&rd: Milos K. Kucera , Secretary General 5 Jiri Nehnevaiťa President / [pageend5]!So Niws from London? '1 he saying “No news - good news” is not entirely applicable to the lile of the L ondon Chapter of SVD. The untimely death of the President, Dr. L . Roubinek and of Dr. R. Vaclavik, the Treasurer was followed by the illness of Ing. Moritz, the only surviving member of the Board of 1984. But, despite these misfortunes, the London Chapter's business continued as usual, mainly thanks to the help of la. Lang, Ing. Staller and others. During 1984 we had a lecture by ba. J. Pazderka on “C hristianity and the Bomb;” an interesting and informative talk about “Education in Czechoslovakia Today,” prepared by Ing. J. Kotalik; Ing. B. Kobliha, exlecturer from the University of Zambia-L usaka presented African problems under the title “bront Africa: Religion, Economy and Politics;” and Jindřich Nermut, a visitor from Tasmania informed us about the contemporary situation in Australia (“Australia as it is"). During the summer members of SVE' participated in the London Symposium (July 13-15), and we should especially quote a very interesting lecture by Jaroslav Krejci on “Central European Crossroads,” Ing. Vaclavik’s lecture on “Socialistic Integration” and Ing. Kobliha’s outline of the historical development and present political activities connected with the idea of a Central European Eederation/C onfederation. Ing. Moritz was a member of the organizing committee of the Symposium. T he election of a new- Board of Directors was held in September, and the new President, Prof. Dr. J. Krejci, delivered a lecture on “Post-Industrial Society” at the same meeting. In November, Dr. B. Bradbrook had a talk on the occasion of the Nobel Prize awarded to Jaroslav Seifert. The year 1985 then started with the highly qualified information of Mr. Alexander Tomsky about the so-called “normalization” in Czechoslovakia after the Russian invasion, and the resistance against it by the Czechs. T he newdy elected Board intends to promote more panel discussions and invite more lecturers from the outside of the Society to boost up the interest. T his effort has already showm some positive results, for the attendance of members and visitors has increased. London, March, 1985 IT IS ★ ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★■A The Year of Sts. Cyril and Methodius In 1985 the 1100th anniversary of death of St. Methodius is remembered. We today reprint a graphic representation of the (.wo missionaries w-ho introduced Christianity in Moravia, bringing it from Byzantium. The picture was created by SVD member, Father Cyril, OAR (Enrico Selley Molnar, Th.D.; see Bulletin 11/2). In the past, SVD members, Erantisek Dvornik and Roman Jakobson, organized a “Harvard Symposium on Sts. Cyril and Methodius” which took place in May 1964 in Dumbarton Oaks and gathered a number of Slavists and Byzantologists. We hope to have next time information about the celebrations held this year. 6 [pageend6]Sts CYRIL+METHODIUS [pageend7]Personalia Jaroslav Nemec - 75 The Board of Directors of the Czechoslovak Sopiety of Arts and Sciences, on behalf of all members, wants to express appreciation and thanks for the labor accomplished by Jaroslav Nemec, the first Secretary General, President, and honorary member of SVU. He had participated in the earliest discussions about the foundation of the Society, was a member of the Preparatory Committee in 1958, and has remained a hard, reliable and modest worker ever since that time. Currently, he has been the Editor of Zprávy. Without Dr. Nemec, SVO would not have become what it is, a cultural, non-political exile organization dedicated to the national ideals of freedom of scientific research, artistic expression and democratic institutions respecting the human rights of Czechs and Slovaks. On the occasion of his 75th birthday, the Society wishes him many years of good health and energy for his own work and for the benefit of SVO. (For biographical data of Jaroslav Nemec, see Bulletin IV, 2, May 1983). ★ ★ ★ Lida Brodenova Lida Brodenova is one of the SVU founding members who has faithfully promoted the aims of the Society and has contributed to the popularization of Czech opera in the United States, mostly in New York and Washington, D.C. Lida Brodenova liked to act since her childhood, played piano at the age of 7, and started to study voice when she was 15. In her native Brno she attended the well-known women’s high school, Vesna Lyceum, and the Conservatory of Music. Among her teachers were Leos Janacek, Theodor Žalud, Vilem Petrželka, Jan Kunc and Ludmila Tuckova. In drama, she was a pupil of Emma Pechova and Rudolf Walter. Oldřich Novy tutored her in the operetta genre. Professor Sigmund Auspitzer, the teacher of Maria Jeritza and Leo Slezák who also were Moravian born, sent young Lida to Vienna to an International Competition of Voice and Violin, in which she won a bronze medal. Her career in Czechoslovakia covered the French drama for the Alliance Francaise, guest performances in operettas by Lehar, Joh. Strauss, Weinberger, Kalman and others, some twenty roles. She also was a guest artist on the Brno German stage and in the Brno Radio Broadcasting. Before her emigration she sang at the National Theater in Brno and in Moravska Ostrava. Mme. Brodenova arrived in the United States in 1940, with her artist husband Boris Brodenov and soon found opportunities to make use of her musical and linguistic talents. In New York she sang the finale from Smetana’s Libuše during the World’s Fair and gave well-received recitals in various concert halls, always including Czech songs and arias in her programs. She was a soloist with the Russian Opera Company in the Town 8 [pageend8]Hall, and with Nicola Rescigno prepared a performance of The Bartered Bride. She sang the role of Mařenka and later of Anežka in the Two Widows and the title role in Rusalka. As she says, she got good critiques and made a good name for herself and her art. The critic F.D. (New Yorské Listy, Oct. 16, 1950) evaluated her production of .Dvorak’s Rusalka as a “heroic task” and said: “To be able to inspire so many people with her fire.. .is a tribute to the artist and the woman.” She not only coached the American singers but managed to make them learn their roles in the original Czech. After moving to Washington, D.C., Lida Brodenova founded her own opera group, The Sokol Opera Company, and set to work. Lon Tuck (The Washington Post, Octs 29, 1978) commented on “the first fully staged American performance at Lisner Auditorium” of the opera Jakobin which “had to wait for more than 90 years for this introduction.. .done by that inveterate proponent of Czech Opera in this city, Lida Brodenova, whose sane philosophy has been that Czech opera is better done on a shoestring than not at all.” On that occasion Karel Husa conducted. Besides the above mentioned operas, she also presented, in Czech, the following: Dráteník, Psohlavci, V studni, Tvrdé palice, Hubička, Selma sedlák, Cert a Kaca, and excerpts from Jenufa, Branibori v Cechách, Kral a uhlir, Dimitrij. She also sang in and staged many international operas for the District of Columbia, such as The Tales of Hoffman, The Gypsy Baron, The Merry Widow and so on. In addition she taught voice privately and directed the chorus at Mount Vernon Seminary. Her lifelong work has been variously honored by the Sokol organizations in America, G.M. Society in New York, the Dvorak Society in Prague, and by SVU. ★ ★ ★ Frantisek William Galan Frantisek William Galan was born on January 14, 1947 in Rimavska Sobota, Czechoslovakia. He enrolled in English and American Studies at the Comenius University in Bratislava. Since 1968, he continued at the University of Toronto, earning his Ph.D. degree in comparative literature in 1980. His dissertation was titled “Toward a Structural and Semiotic Theory of Literary History: The Prague School Project, 1928-1944.” He taught at Princeton, the University of Pittsburgh and, since 1978, has been Assistant Professor at the University of Texas, Austin. In 1981-82 he was associated with the Center for Research in Semiotics, Brown University. Besides literature, he has lectured on films and the culture of Eastern Europe, and also taught introductory and intermediate Czech. Dr. Galan has published many articles, bibliographies and book reviews. His books are Prague School Pragmatics (1981) and Historic Structures (1984; see below); he edited Poetics of Cinema: Readings in the History of Film Theory (New York: Columbia University Press, 1985). His translations into English have appeared in Cross Currents and various specialized publications concerning literary topics and cinema. He regularly participates in national and international symposia and conferences organized 9 [pageend9]by the learned societies he belongs to, i.e., Modern Languages Association ol America, American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies, Semiotic Society of America, SVU, and several more. In the 12th Congress of SVU in Ί oronto, he chaired the panel on film. In that connection he called attention to a change that had to be made. The featured and discussed film was Evald Schorm’s Five Girls to Deal With (Pět holek na krku), not Vitr v kapse, as announced in the program. ★ ★★★★★■★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★■A· *·*·*·** Available Lectures Peter Hruby, Senior Lecturer in History and Politics from Australia will be in the United States and Canada from August through December 1985.

An Anthology. Translated and Edited by William E. Harkins (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1983; pp. 321, $15.00 cloth) In the preface to this first volume of Czech prose the translator-editor, William E. Harkins, Professor of Slavic Languages at Columbia University, Past SVU Vice-President, states that it is “a companion work to the volume of Czech Poetry [see Bulletin I, 1, January 1980], published in 1973 in the Michigan Translation Series.” While the former is a bilingual publication, the prose is offered only in the English version. The anthology presents some prose excerpts but mostly consists of complete chapters, stories or other texts byXhe particular writers. The history of Czech prose, according to Harkins, is less continuous than the history of the Czech poetry, especially when Latin or German texts of Bohemian-Moravian provenience, written when the Czech language was not used or was suppressed, are excluded. The present volume begins with both non-fiction and fiction from the fourteenth century and stops in 1918. The projected second volume should then continue with the prose created since the First Czechoslovak Republic was founded. The Introduction briefly traces the development of various Czech prose styles and genres, explaining the cultural-historical background prevailing in the Czech Lands through the centuries. The authors have been carefully selected to represent the main , trends in Czech literature. Each one is introduced by a biographical profile. Portraits and other illustrations, as well as scholarly notes complement each text. The book felicitously begins with a short excerpt from the autobiography of Charles IV (reigning 1346-1378), King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor, to be followed by the opening passages from the Chronicle of the Czech Kings (ca. 1374) by Pribik Pulkava z Radenina. The chronicle was compiled from older sources “at the command of the glorious Charles IV, Roman Emperor,” the chronicler informs us. The first chapter describes the arrival of the Czechs in Bohemia. A picture of the legendary hill Rip accompanies the text. Several anonymous texts come from the 14th and 15th centuries: The Life of St. Prokop (1379), The Weaver (Tkadlecek; after 1407), The Visions of Jirik (late 1400’s), The Tales of Olomouc (1482), and The Tales of Brother Jan Paleček (existing in oral tradition in the 1400’s) demonstrate the beginnings of Czech prose from the historical accounts, through the allegory and didactic narrations to the purely popular story telling. During the same period Tomas ze Stitneho (1331-1401) wrote The Visions of St. Bridget in Czech for his children and acquaintances. Toward the end of his life he adapted and enlarged The Book of Chess (De ludo scaccorum by Jacobus de Cessolis) in his native language. “Two Letters” by Jan Hus (1371-1415) best show the reformer-martyr’s mastery of the Czech language whose orthography he normalized. He wrote them to his followers in Bohemia, the second one from Constance, describing his imprisonment and impending death. However, Hus’ main religious 11 [pageend11]works were written in Latin. His successor in the Czech Church, Petr Chelcicky (ca. 1390-ca. 1458) wrote his best-known work, The Net of Faith (Sit viry; ca. 1440), in Czech. In the section “On City Dwellers” he attributes the origin of “sinful” cities and castles to Cain and compares them with the peaceful, honest and content life in the unspoiled country. Jan Amos Komenský (Comenius; 1592-1670), the last’Bishop of the Unity of Czech Brethren, is represented by “Chapter Ten: the Pilgrim Examines the Estate of the Scholars: First a General View” from his Labyrinth of the World and the Paradise of the Heart (1633). His satirical view of the scholarly community should be an obligatory reading even today. The pilgrimage of 1598 to the Holy Land gave Krištof Harant z Polzic (1564-1621) the opportunity not only to see the biblical places but also to observe and sketch people and their way of life. He described in Chapter 17 of his Journey from the Bohemian Kingdom to Venice, from there by Sea to the Holy Land, and from there on to Egypt (1608) how he and his travel companion, Herman z Chudenic, experienced a Turkish bath in Cairo. Harant is remembered not only by this travelogue but by his music and the tragic death by execution with other Czech Protestant aristocrats defeated in 1620 on the White Mountain. Bohumír Hynek Bilovsky (1659-1725) was an eloquent preacher in Bohemia and Moravia. His collected sermons were published in 1720 as Cygnea cantatio: Hlas duchovni labute (The Voice of the Spiritual Swan). The sermon for the second Sunday in Advent is included. Father Bilovsky represents the Baroque Counter-Reformation in the Czech Lands. That period used to be termed the “period of darkness,” of forced Catholicization and Germanization and of loss of national self- determination. Yet, the Enlightenment soon made itself felt and the so- called “Czech Revival” found inspiration and models in folksongs and the spoken Czech that survived in the countryside and among some city classes. In the literature, poetry “revived” first and the prose followed, becoming productive in the 19th century. Among the first important writers of stories was Karel Hynek Macha (1810-1836), best known for his long romantic poem “May.” His “Pilgrimage to Krkonoše” is an example of his early prose. Another Romantic writer-poet-folklorist-patriot was Karel Jaromir Erben (1811-1870). “The Twins” from his collection of Czech Folktales, is an adventurous story of the two princes who slay dragons, conquer witches and end by each gaining a beautiful princess and a kingdom. As Macha, Erben is best known by his poetry, especially the ever popular ballads collected in Kytice (The Nosegay; 1853 and 1861) which later inspired such composers as Dvorak. The journalist, critic and liberal opponent of the Austrian absolutism, Karel Havlicek Borovsky (1821-1856), published his article “On Legal Resistance” in Slovan on August 10, 1851. Among other very modernsounding ideas he admonishes that “legal resistance may not extend to violence... or to defending our rights with physical force, for wherever force and physical power have stepped in, there legal resistance itself comes 12 [pageend12]- - .-t* I wish to order .......... copies of the Directory.

Its tone and irreverent, sarcastic language seem to partly explain why Havlicek’s democratic opinions led to his forced exile after the 1848 revolution. Czech village novel and the peasant tale, influenced by George Sand’s model, are represented by two women writers, Božena Nemcova (1820-1862) and Johanna Rottova, known by her pen name of Karolina Svetla (1830-1899). Nemcova’s “Wild Bara” has, according to Harkins, “the distinction of being perhaps her liveliest and most vivid” story, though she is best known by her masterpiece The Grandmother (1855). Another side of Nemcova is shown by a letter to a friend who emigrated to Texas in 1853; she wrote that she regretted not going to America herself with her husband who had just been dismissed from the Civil Service for attending the funeral of Havlíček, their good friend. Svetla’s “Poor Dead Barbora” is a story of the love and marriage of Matýsek who cannot accept the death of his wife Barbora. Jan Neruda (1834-1891) could not finish his law studies for lack of funds and dedicated himself to journalism, poetry and prose writing. His most famous collection of urban stories is Tales of the Mala Strana (1878). Professor Harkins included three selections: “How Mr. Vorel Broke in His Pipe,” the often anthologized childhood reminiscence “How it Happened that on August 20, 1849, at Half Past Twelve in the Afternoon Austria was not Overthrown,” and h’is feuilleton “May, 1890” describing the peaceful first demonstration of the Prague workers. Neruda’s poetry has a permanent place in Czech literature, especially some of his ballads in folk style. Several examples of his poetic work are to be found in the Czech Poetry anthology. Antal Stasek was the pen name of Antonin Zeman (1843-1931), a practising lawyer and a deputy in the Austrian Parliament in the 1890’s. He published the collection Our Mountain Enthusiasts in 1895 but his stories about The Shoemaker Matouš and His Friends came out posthumously (1932). “Brabanec” was one of his rather eccentric characters from the earlier collection. Stasek is usually considered a representative of the Czech realism. The next two writers, Jaroslav Vrchlicky (real name Emil Frida, 1853-1912) and Julius Zeyer (1841-1901) are known more as poets than prosaists. Both consciously tried to acquaint the Czech literati and readers with the world literature. Vrchlicky translated many classics and contemporary, modern poets. Zeyer was a well-read and much travelled cosmopolitan man of letters. Both experimented with newer techniques and subjects before the turn of the century. Interestingly the stories in this anthology introduce folk-like heroes. In Vrchlicky’s “For a Chicken” it is the Gypsy Misa, while Zeyer adapts a Slovak legend “Samko the Bird.” Their poetry is represented in the bilingual anthology. 13 [pageend16]An outstanding and very popular writer of historical novels was Alois Jirásek (1851-1930), high school teacher of history and a senator in the independent Czechoslovak Republic. Described as a “Czech disciple of Sir Walter Scott” he has a long row of multi-volume novels to his credit. His Old Czech Legends (1894), from which “The Last of the Rozmberks” stems, has been a basic household book for generations of young Czech readers, something of an analogy to the Heldensagen for German reading public. Literary naturalism is exemplified by “In the Strawstack” by Josef K. Slejhar (1865-1914), a story of a tramp and his unfortunate child, from the collection Impressions from Life and Society (1894). Critical realism was the term used by T. G. Masaryk (1850-1937) for his and his followers’ writings, whether it applied to literature, philosophy or other sciences. An excerpt from his study “Jan Hus. Our Rebirth and Our Reformation” was written in 1896, more than twenty years before Professor Masaryk became the first President of independent Czechoslovakia. Again we encounter two poets, less prominent as prosaists, though their symbolism and fin-de-siecle scepticism also found expression in some stories, plays and other prose writings. Antonin Sova (1864-1928) published his Prosa in 1898. “The Stirrings of Solitary Strings” is from that collection. Two of his poems were included in the Czech Poetry anthology. His younger contemporary, Victor Dyk (1877-1931), a pupil of Jirásek, journalist and eventually a senator, included “The Locket” into his collection The Songs of the Willow (1908). Jaroslav Hasek (1883-1923), the author of The Good Soldier Svejk (1921-22) kept publishing his humorous stories on many topics from 1912 on. Two were chosen by Harkins for this anthology: “Class Distinction” and “The Persecution of the First Christians in Vinohrady.” As 1918 was chosen as the cut-off date for this prose volume, the last text is Karel Capek’s (1890-1938) “Help!” from his collection of stories Wayside Crosses (1917), here translated into English for the first time. It describes a moment of awakening from a dream, from the prison of alienation to the realization that other people need one, that -- as Capek says it -“perhaps the day you await will not come as a holiday, but as a workday, as life’s Monday, as a new day.” That day came to the Czechs and the Slovaks on October 28, 1918. Then Capek could work for the humanity with his mature, humanistic literary production. But that phase would belong to the second volume. William Harkins produced this long needed anthology of Czech prose with a grant from the Program for Translation of the National Endowment for the Humanities and with the support of SVU and Dr. Edward Kupka. It is hoped that the Michigan Slavic Publications and SVU will not stop in this project, and will bring out the second volumes of both the Czech Prose and Czech Poetry, to acquaint English readers with expertly presented and newly translated literature of the Czechoslovak Republic to our days. ★ 14 [pageend17]Two by Karel Capek Michael Henry Heim, SVU member, reviewed Capek’s War With the Newts in “The Book Review” (Los Angeles Times, March 31, 1985). He found Capek’s basic idea, that the newts “stand for technical prowess without the underpinning of civilization or culture,” as timely today as it had been when the book first appeared in 1936. Consequently, he considers War With the Newts a classic and welcomes the new edition, introduced by the Czech dissident novelist Ivan Klima. The praise Heim gives to the Northwestern University Press for “preserving and developing the fruits of civilization” should also go to the University of Wisconsin for reprinting Capek’s The Gardener’s Year, illustrated by Josef Capek. Charles Fenyvesi, Washington writer about gardening, reviewed the book in the Smithsonian (February 1985). He feels that Capek marched to a beat that “is similar to James Thurber’s” and wrote for the armchair gardener. He reminds us that “the garden is indeed civilization.” War With the Newts, translated by Μ. and R.

Murray St., Madison, WI 53715) ★ More English Translations of Czech Books Josef Skvorecky, The Engineer of Human Souls (New York: Knopf, 571 pp., $17.95) Richard Eder in his Los Angeles Times review states, among other things, that “at its best, Skvorecky’s irony is silvery and delicate; but sometimes it can become heavy-handed” and that the author “has written an epic of his country and its exiles.” Such an epic implies all the entertaining, absurd and dismaying facetszof the past forty years remembered by the semi- autobiographical protagonist Smiricky. It also implies both the satire and a caricature. C’est la viel Same author’s Miss Silver’s Past (The Ecco Press, 18 West 30th Street, New York, N.Y. 10001, $7.50 paper) is introduced by Graham Greene. The New York Times described it as: “If its underlying message were not so sinister in its implications, this black comedy would qualify as one of the funniest books of the year.” * Peter Kussi, SVU member, translated Jiri Grusa’s The Questionnaire (Farrar, Strauss & Giroux, $15.95) and Michael H. Heim reviewed it in the Los Angeles Times. Despite the narrative that goes back into the history of Chlumec, the protagonist Jan Chrysostom’s native town, Grusa’s “unfettered fantasy is.. .the work’s most basic element.” In Czechoslovakia the book appeared in the samizdat Padlock Press, and Grusa was imprisoned. This is his first publication in 1 nglish translation. ★ ★ ★ 15 [pageend18]POETRY Zahradniček Literary Fund Prize Awarded Czechoslovak Culture Club in Los Angeles Awarded the 1985 Zahradniček Literary Fund Prize for Czech poetry to Ivan Jelinek, for his poetic life work.

Historical Studies and Surveys Avigdor Dagan, Gertrude Hirschler and Lewis Weiner, Editors (Philadelphia: The Jewish Publication Society of America, and New York: Society for the History of Czechoslovak Jews, Volume III, 1984, pp. 700) The third and last volume of The Jews of Czechoslovakia covers the period of 1938 to 1948 and is dedicated To the Memory of the Czechoslovak Jews Who Perished as Victims of Nazi Persecution. Section I, Holocaust, consists of five essays: Livia Rothkirchen writes ôn “The Jews of Bohemia and Moravia: 1938-1945;” John G. Lexa reviews “Anti-Jewish Laws and Regulations in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia;” Zdenek Lederer’s topic is “Terezin;” Ladislav Lipscher describes the situation of “The Jews of Slovakia: 1939-1945,” and Erich Kulka contributes with his study “The Annihilation of Czechoslovak Jewry.” In Section II, Resistance, Erich Kulka studies the situation of “Jews in the Czechoslovak Armed Forces During World War II” and Avigdor Dagan analyzes “The Czechoslovak Government-in-Exile and the Jews.” Section ’[, The Aftermath, starts with Kurt Wehle’s “The Jews in Bohemia and Moravia: 1945-1948” and continues with Yeshayahu Jelinek’s “The Jews in Slovakia: 1945-1949.” “Prague and Jerusalem: The Era of Friendship” by Ehud Avriel an’d Hana Volavkova’s “The Jewish Museum in Prague” follow. The last essay is “The Story of the Czech Scrolls” by Joseph C. Pick. A “Chronology of Events: 1938-1948,” short biographical sketches of the authors, and cumulative indexes of names, places and subjects are very helpful. We commented on the Society for the History of Czechoslovak Jews (SHCJ) and the first two volumes of this almost encyclopedic work in the past (see Bulletin 1/2). All the initiators of the project and those who realized it, several of them SVU members, created a permanent memorial to the Jewish national minority that had participated “in every aspect of Czechoslovak life between the two World Wars,” before Hitler destroyed it all. Perhaps it is symbolic that the publication of The Jews of Czechoslovakia took as many years as once Masaryk’s Republic lasted, and that the last volume became available now, forty years after the end of WWII. From now on the SHCJ will publish yearbooks as a continuation of the activities they initiated in New York in 1961.

They were taken out on Pentcho, a crowded paddle steamer, which was under the command of a one-legged, drug-addicted captain. Zoltán Schalk pulled bureaucratic strings and made the arrangements for the voyage, while the 22-year-old Alexander Citron proved to be the natural leader who eventually took charge. The passage down the Danube, the easy segment of the trip, took four months. It was successful largely because Schalk talked his way past border guards, while Citron held the group together. The Pentcho was not designed to withstand storms. Yet, its captain proved to be a skilled seaman. He performed miracles when winds rose, engines gave out and the ship smashed into rocks just off a deserted island in the Aegean Sea. All passengers were rescued and imprisoned by the Italians. In 1944, the 350 survivors went to Palestine. It was the first substantial group of immigrants to legally arrive there since the outbreak of World War IL Odyssey is basically a story of how individuals react — heroically, cowardly, or a little bit of both - to adverse circumstances. In contrast to most Holocaust literature, the Pentcho adventures had a relatively happy end. Frank Meissner ★ ★ ★ 19 [pageend22]CULI URAL TRENDS Cross Currents 3. A Yearbook of Central European Culture Ladislav Matějka and Benjamin Stolz,'Editors (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures, 1984, 433 pp., $15.00) It seems that Cross Currents is by now a firmly established yearly publication, continuing with a well defined editorial program, counting with a roster of regular contributors and a growing number of new ones, maintaining the attractive format, and each time increasing the number of pages. Volume 3 appeared at the end of 1984 and again combines Czechoslovak studies with those from other Central European countries. The majority of the texts have been written in English; some have been specifically translated for this volume from Czech, Polish and Hungarian, and a few used prior published translations. Some of the translators’ names are familiar by now but there are also new ones. The cover illustrations and those related to single essays add interest. The yearbook has six thematic sections. The first article, “European Culture,” is a translation of an older text by Jan Patočka. “Political Breviary” by Istvan Bibo was written during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Milan Simecka from Bratislava wrote “A World with Utopias or Without Them?” for the Colston Symposium 1983, Utopias Unlimited. “The Muse of History - 1984: History, Historians and Politics in Communist Czechoslovakia” is the contribution of H. Gordon Skilling (University of Toronto). Paul R. Magocsi from the same university describes his recent impressions from “The Congress of Slavists in Kiev: Some Recollections.” The second section is dedicated to Czech literature. Milan Kundera’s “Somewhere Beyond” analyzes his relationship with Kafka’s work. Michael Henry Heim (UCLA) translated excerpts from Ludvik Vaculik’s Cesky snar as “A Czech Dreambook.” “Havel’s Letters from Prison” is a sample translated by George Gibian (Cornell University) from those that will be published in Czech by the 68 Publishers. Vera Blackwell analyzes “Havel’s Private View,” the three one-act plays that have been very successful all over the United States and other Western countries. Yvonne Howell pays a tribute to “Karel Capek in 1984” stressing the relevance of his works, such as R.U.R., Absolute at Large, Krakatit and War with the Newts. William E. Harkins, (Columbia University) introduces the English translation by Lyn Coffin of The Plague Monument, in “On Jaroslav Seifert’s Morový sloup.” The next section presents Polish literature in “The European Significance of Jan Kochanowski from the Renaissance to the Romantics” by Tadeusz Ulewicz (University of Cracow), including five poems of that 16th century writer; Bogdan Czaykowski (University of British Columbia) writes about “Harmony Restored: Mickiewicz’s Pan Tadeusz Reconsidered on the 150th Anniversary of its Publication;” “Zbigniew Herbert’s Attack Against 20 [pageend23]Myth” by Bogdana Carpenter (University of Michigan) and an excerpt from the apocrypha titled “Kleomedes” introduce this contemporary Polish writer; Frank J. Corliss, Jr. and Grazyna Sandel (Wayne State University) offer ‘‘Jerzy Ficowski’s Notes from Prison” concerning the multifaceted poet interested, among other topics, in the Gypsies and their oral lore; Josef Skvorecky asks “Why the Harlequin?” in Conrad’s Heart of Darkness; and David Packman briefly treats “The Kosinski Controversy.” “Amerika and America” is the title of Eric S. Rabkin’s essay on Kafka’s unfinished book; Norbert Czarny discusses “Imaginary-Real Lives: On Danilo Kish;” “The Vitriolic Viennese: An Introduction to Karl Kraus” is the subject of Harry Zohn (Brandeis University); Irina Livezeanu’s (University of Michigan) “Excerpts from a Trouble Book. An Episode in Rumanian Literature” refers to the short-lived playwright Mihail Sebastian, exemplified by some excerpts from his prose; Emery George pays tribute “In Memoriam Gyula Illyes (1902-1983)” which includes some of his poems; “Cafe Niagara” by Istvan Orkeny (1912-1979) is another example of modern Hungarian literature; and Thomas Butler contributes an essay on “Between East and West. Three Bosnian Writer-Rebels; Kocic, Andric, Selimovic.” T he last two sections cover film, theater, fine arts and music. Herbert Eagle analyzes “W ajda’s Danton;” Ihor Ciskewycz writes on the Ukrainian “Bereziľ - A Discovered Theatrical Form;” to Ukraine also pertains “Modern Expression and Folk Tradition in the Theatrical Art of Anatol’ Petryts’kyi” by Myroslava Μ.

Masaryk, the first President of the Czechoslovak Republic, in commemoration of the 135th anniversary of his birth. The 15-minute ceremony in the village of Lany, about 20 miles west of Prague, began at 11:00 a.m. and was attended by Mrs. Farrand, members of the Embassy staff and a group of Czechoslovak citizens, including relatives of the late President. The wreath of red and white carnations bore a ribbon with the dedication "Od amerického lidu" ("From the American people") in both Czech and English. Following is an English translation of the Charge d'Affaires remarks: President Tomas Garrigue Masaryk was bom one hundred and thirty-five years ago on this date. As Charge d'Affaires of the American Embassy, it is a great honor for me to represent the United States at this solemn annual ceremony commemorating the birth of Czechoslovakia's founding father and first president. 22 [pageend25]Out of the ashes of World War I, Tomas Masaryk helped create a free and prosperous nation in the heart of Europe. A deeply religious man, President Masaryk was a statesman and philosopher who combined the best of the active and contemplative life. His was a major voice of the twentieth century. His close ties to the United States, highly valued by Americans, reinforced the friendship that had long existed between the Czech and Slovak peoples and the United States. In a world too often marked by senseless war and violence, he continues to be an inspiration to those who believe in national independence, in democratic values and in harmony among nations. It is with great respect and humility that I lay on this grave a wreath from the American people to the memory of the first president of the Czechoslovak Republic, Tomas Garrigue Masaryk. ★ Oskar P.
