WERNER and PAUL TABORI This special issue was edited by Prof. John Kosa [pageend2]ALBERT SZENT-GYORGYI THE PERSISTENCE OF THE CAVEMAN Whatever man does he must do first in his mind. The machinery of the mind is the brain, and any machine can do only what it is made to do. Consequently, if we want to understand ourselves, we must understand what sort of machine our brain is. Primarily, the brain is an organ of survival. It was built by nature to search for food, shelter, and the like, to gain advantage—before addressing itself to the pursuit of truth. Hence most human brains are unable to distinguish between truth and advantage, and accept as truth that which is only advantage. We use our brain mainly for finding ways to reach what we want. Simultaneously, we produce the thoughts and arguments which justify our feelings and dealings. I suspect that if I were in the business of selling shelters, my brain would tend to dwell rather steadily on the probability of nuclear war. If I were in politics, I might find my brain 1 ARENA [pageend3]devoting itself less to the next generation than to the next election. There is only one general rule regarding how an animal should be built to survive: it must be adapted to its surroundings. Our species was not built yesterday, but hundreds of thousands of years ago and probably has not changed during the last 20,000 years. We are adapted, then, to the conditions of life which prevailed twenty millenniums ago. To learn about these conditions and to better understand ourselves, let us pay a brief imaginary visit to our nth great-great-grandfather. At night we would probably find him in a cave, huddling with his small clan around a primitive fire, the greatest natural force he knew and handled. We would have to be a bit careful in approaching him: his dominant instinct being fear, he might strike us down. If we came upon him during the day, we would probably find him hunting close to the cave, because even a distance of ten miles seemed an infinity to him, and the greatest speed he knew was that of some animal or of a stone he hurled. If we could talk to him, we would probably find he had not the latest doubt that what he saw and thought was the ultimate reality. This world, the world of our ancestor, was changed by science almost in one stroke, leaving us no time for réadaptation. What science did was to peep behind the scenes of creation and put the hidden, superhuman forces of nature at the service of man. It replaced the speed of animals with the speed of jets, missiles, and radio waves, thus abolishing distance. The fire it replaced with atomic energy, one of those terrific cosmic forces which shape the universe. It introduced death control without birth control, making the human masses swell enormously. With distance abolished, these masses now rub 2 [pageend4]directly against one another, with weapons in their hands which enable them to destroy one another without even leaving their backyard. Here we stand in the middle of this new world with our primitive brain, attuned to the simple cave life, with terrific forces at our disposal, which we are clever enough to release, but whose consequences we cannot comprehend. Their dimensions are too far beyond our human dimensions. When my wife tells me, «the water is hot», I am careful. But if I hear that an atomic explosion has fifteen million degrees of heat, it means nothing to me. I am deeply moved if I see a man suffering and would even risk my life for him. But then I talk impersonally about the possible pulverization of our big cities, with a hundred million dead. I am unable to multiply one man’s suffering by a hundred million. For our ancestor in his cave, the world meant the people he knew. Nations comprising hundreds of millions of people no longer represent people in our minds—they are abstractions. So their leaders begin to talk about abstractions, National Glory or National Survival, for which they are ready to put up with hundreds of millions killed. We are not actually bad. We are just humans, carried into dimensions where we do not belong, with a primitive brain that cannot grasp how hell on earth could look. To stay alive we must create an entirely new world with new human relations, and the question is: who can help us? Science? It may seem a logical idea that the forces created by science can be governed without mortal danger only by that which created them. Can the scientist help us then? There is no such thing as the «scientist». There are thousands and thousands working in science, and. 3 [pageend5]as everywhere, there are a few dangerous fanatics among them, mesmerized by their atomic gadgets. Regrettably it is their advice that is often heeded. There are also the indifferent ones. Fortunately, there are also really great ones, who can see both the technical and moral side, and, I am glad to say, the majority of good scientists are leaning toward them. The government both uses and abuses scientists. It asks us questions about small technical details, but not about the big problems. Man has arrived at the ’crossroads. The road sign, in one direction, indicates hatred, distrust, catastrophe, self-extinction. In the other, it points toward understanding, collaboration, material help, a higher human existence. The great problem is: which road to take? What we should be asked is this: where does it take us if we double the size of atomic bombs every year and double their quantity every three to four years? What happens if we spread them among all nations and let them multiply within our armies even down to the company level, thus placing the fate of mankind in the hands of sergeants, and gradually increasing the probability of an accident to 100 per cent. It is not really the scientist himself who is needed, but the principles which have built science. Science tells us to approach our problems as such, as problems; to collect data and then to sit down with our adversaries to find the best solution, with a cool head, unbiased by sentiments like fear or hatred or egotism; and with uncompromising intellectual honesty, good will, and mutual respect. If our politicians could approach our problems in this spirit, instead of having their eye on propaganda, wanting tit for tat, or rather tit for nothing, we might be marching toward a better future. 4 [pageend6]But where is this spirit to be inculcated? Congress? Our Constitution was pamed at a time when the country had to be built up, and the citizen’s duty was tmbuild up his little corner, and the representative’s duty to represent the interest of that corner. Our representatives still represent little corners. They do not notice that the world has shrunk terribly and that the whole globe has become our little corner. Senators and Congressmen do not lead the people; they are led by people. So ultimately it is a matter of educating people. But education is a slow process, and adults educate children. Thus we are moving in a circle. Politics remain dominated by the primitive ancestral brain, motivated mostly by fear and not doubting that what it sees is the last truth: what it sees as black is black, and what it sees as white is white. Dr. Szilard, one of the moral as well as scientific leaders of our age, is trying a short cut, a science lobby to advise and inform the House and Senate, a most hopeful approach. There is perhaps also another approach. If Senators and Congressmen can be influenced only by votes, and care more for a future election than the future generation, then we have to look for a group which cares for the next generation and has votes, too. There is such a group — women, especially mothers. Women have more common sense than men; they have found out that high-energy radiation damages children and refuse to swallow whatever we tell them about «permissible limits.» They simply want none of it. I have the keenest hopes about peace groups composed of women. However, suppose some women should come to me and say: «We believe you. For whom shall we vote? Where is the party which has your thoughts on its flag?» Then I would be in trouble. I would 5 [pageend7]have to say: «There is no such party. There is no real difference between our two leading parties. They are both headed for doomsday. Essentially we have but one party with two sets of people, the «ins» and «outs», and our political liberty is limited to choosing between these two.» I do not want to finish on such a negative note. Perhaps there is one short cut I could advocate. If we still have the caveman’s mentality and cannot change it, then perhaps we could avoid catastrophe if we but understand one thing. This is that science ¡has abolished distance, and we are all living in one Æave now, our little shrunken globe on which there ¿is a place for only one family, the family of man. We may at least gain time by tacking up a note: «Playing with atomic bombs in this cave is stricktly ¡forbidden.» 6 [pageend8]THE IMMIGRANT SCHOLAR IN AMERICA : A SYMPOSIUM JOHN KOSA THE COMPANY OF SENECA An Essay on the Restlessness of Scholars of All Ages To Americans of all nations, this is dedicated. Salvador de Madariaga, I. Americans For my first encounter with the immigrant scholar I have to go back in time and recall those years of my youth when the world seemed to be safe and secure, when life and play seemed interminable and inseparable. I spent those pleasant years in the company of thirty-odd boys at the Latin School of Budapest where we applied ourselves to classical studies so diligently that Antiquity became the main concern, nay, the living reality for us. The current topics of soccer games and girls occupied our interest only for the idle minutes of small talk, because the foremost matter on our minds was an issue of the classical world: whether Seneca or Epictetus was the greater philosopher. On this issue we could plunge any time into animated debates which, alas, failed to settle the question. The preference for one of the philosophers was a choice of personal creed; it was beyond reasoning and could 7 [pageend9]not be changed by logical arguments; nothing but graduation put an end to our continual debates. We were foppish school boys, to be sure, but our scholastic factionalism had a great deal of sincerity and self-consciousness in it. The two philosophers captivated our adolescent fancy because they seemed to represent the human essence. They spoke to us not only through their books but also through their conduct of life, through the romantic turns of their fates and the colorful events of their luck and misfortune, and they seemed to convey to us a message that was the inner reality of our education and the essence of the Latin School. Seneca, the son of Hispania who spoke Latin with the thick accent of his native province and wrote it with a refinement unsurpassed by other authors, was an eminently successful man in Rome. He achieved fame and dignity as imperial adviser and statesman, as writer and philosopher; he bathed in opulence and happiness as owner of large estates, as husband adored by a beautiful wife, and as teacher admired by faithful students. Having made good in life, he managed to turn death itself into an heroic triumph. Upon the command of the tyrant Nero, he cut open his veins, and, while his old blood was slowly dripping out, he dictated to his secretaries the last meditations on life and wisdom. Epictetus came from Greece, the land of wits and dreamers, and reached Rome as a slave. When his master put him to the torture, Epictetus remarked with composure, «You will certainly break my leg.» This accordingly happened, and the philosopher added: «Did not I tell you that you would break it?» He was crippled, unattended, and destitute; he taught in Greek and perhaps never mastered the Latin; and his earthly possessions consisted of a bed, a pipkin, and a clay lamp. Yet he taught all who came to listen until Emperor Domitian banished the philosophers from Rome. Then he retired in the provinces and died unnoticed, leaving behind some unpolished books taken down by inept disciples. Back in the Latin School of Budapest we became captivated by such vagaries of fate. With the curious sensitivity of 8 [pageend10]adolescent minds we attempted to decipher the message hidden behind the events of life, and we perceived the two philosophers as the architypes of scholars, as the clearest embodiments of those drives that move all men of learning. Seneca aspired to success, pursued it obdurately and cunningly, and held it in his hands as firmly as it was possible in a murderously competitive society; Epictetus stood for his ideas, doggedly and single-mindedly expounded them to an uninterested world, and did not let pain or humiliation interfere with his lifelong office of teaching. The two of them are timeless symbols because success and stand make the scholar. Let us not be deceived by educational commonplaces. Knowledge in itself is not enough for a scholar; the idiot savant will never be our hero, and the many-volumed encyclopedia will never be our favorite reading. Any scholarship worthy of admiration must contain the human element; in some mysterious way it must merge knowledge with the deep- seated drives of the personality; it must appear, speak, and act as a natural part of one’s personal life. It is the human and subjective use of knowledge that separates the many from the few, because many are those of prodigious memory whose knowledge is great on one or sundry matters, but few are able to combine knowledge, success, and stand into a human unity that arouses posterity’s admiration. Success and stand—are they not elusive words? In a maudlin sense, success means the possession of money, power, and fame; the mastery of all goods available to man; the free consumption in one’s privately owned land of milk and honey. In a sublimated sense, however, it means the achievement of something immaterial and personal; the mastery of ideas, dreams and illusions; the conquest of people, not by sword, but by word. It means that one’s ideas come alive and set out on a life of their own; they become public, are taken up by others, live in the hearts and on the lips of contemporaries and their posterity. The scholar has no intention of imposing himself as a corporeal entity upon others and seeking vulgar popularity. The accessories of maudlin success, prestige in 9 [pageend11]the international brotherhood of scholars or status in the chummy community of suburbanites, might incidentally come to him like other chance elements of a professional career; but (and behold the dying Seneca) what he desires as the goal of his achievements is the acceptance of the ideas for which he stands. Does not everybody have ideas? As the nursery rhyme claims, Peter, the pumpkin eater (who had a wife and could not keep her), conceived some ideas on economical husbandry and proceeded to act upon them. But Epictetus, the other conspicuous failure by all maudlin standards, used his ideas for a broader, more penetrating aim; to explain this world of confusing, misty, and self-contradictory phenomena; to create light in the darkness, security amidst anxiety. He had an aim more substantial than Peter of the nursery rhyme, and so have all the scholars who long for creating order in the chaos. But a man can explain the world only in his own terms, for himself and for the satisfaction of his inner restlessness. His exposition—even though it is presented for acceptance by others—is always a part of himself, of his personal essence; it is his pound of flesh and blood that he is ready to defend against the Shylocks. Hence, any creative scholar who once formulates and announces his explanation of the world or of any phenomenon, is prepared to uphold and defend it, stick to it as to a most precious possession, and stand for it as a living symbol. His stand, like probity, is individual and incommensurable. It cannot be measured by yardsticks, and it may be greatest when it amounts to little by the usual standards of success. This is why our youthful debates on the respective merits of Seneca and Epictetus could not be settled. They remained undecided, yet they were not wasted because they led us to a comprehension of the psychological sources of knowledge. The heroes of youth do not entirely vanish from our memory. They retreat, but they are willing to return, when summoned, in the critical moments of adulthood and discharge the heroic duties of teaching, inspiring, animating. It was no surprise 10 [pageend12]that in such a moment of my life the two philosophers revisited my memory and brought along a new message, fitting my changed conditions. By that time, the Latin School of Budapest had disappeared from my sight, the old masters and schoolmates had dispersed in all directions, and I, taking up a new life in a new country, was riding the academic circuit in America, as one of the many wandering teachers of a continent rich in campuses and inquisitive students. The wanderer, whose home is on any campus or perhaps on none of them, searches for friends and relations, and if he does not find them among the living, he looks around among the dead. So I happened to discover a secret affinity binding me to the paragons of my youth. Seneca and Epictetus appeared to me as the eternal examples of wandering scholars who had left their native provinces, had come to the great campus of imperial Rome, and, together with Paul of Tarsus and many other contemporaries of lesser names, had offered to make their stand and success there. The showcases of history, arranged for our edification, display the eminent people of all epochs, and in the display, scholarship appears as an eminent but peregrinating profession. In one epoch, the sophists of ancient Greece carried their knowledge from city to city; in the next era, philosophers of all provinces headed toward Rome; then the academic market place of Paris and Bologna attracted professors and students from all Christian countries; later alchemists and humanists wandered from one prince to the other, looking for the stone of wisdom, a rare manuscript, or a generous patron; then modem times came with their wars and revolutions, and each bloody event sent men of knowledge moving. One may argue that this restlessness of scholars of all ages is just one of those optical illusions that history plays with us. We remember only those men of learning who achieved fame in many cities and in more than one country, and we are apt to forget the sedentary savants and their inconspicuous careers. History is all too often a false mirror, but not in this case. Somehow I think that scholarship and wanderlust are intill [pageend13]mately linked by those unfathomable human drives that direct man’s career and launch him on an inevitable course of life. Is not search for new knowledge (or any learning for its own sake) an imaginary travel into an unknown land, which might be a land without geography, an abstract province of ideas, or an eerie road where the scenery is reduced to mathematical formulas? Is the scholar such a bookish homebody that he is unwilling to leave his favorite armchair for a real destination? I would think that imaginary travel and actual locomotion complement each other. It is natural that after years of spiritual travelling the scholar should bodily take to the road and proceed toward the country of his dreams. Scholarship and wanderlust meet because the desire for success and the compulsion to take a stand set people on the move. That desire and that compulsion prompt man to relinquish his place of birth where life is familiar, ways are secure, and faces well-known. They induce him to defy the angry oceans of humanity and seek a new home amidst strangers. They make him invest his industry and endurance, pioneer in a wild country, clear the primeval forest, fight the savages, and build a new land for himself. What is the profit of his investment? The old pioneer trekking westward in his covered wagon searched for God’s country, and the old scholar, travelling with his gown and books, looked for the world that is explained and understood, ordered and penetrated, by human reason. When reading their history, we must be impressed by the endlessness of their search. The pioneer cleared a homestead and then moved on; the scholar set up a workshop and soon deserted it; they acted as if they had no desire to end the quest. Life is indeed too short to find what one is looking for, and it is a matter of personal taste what kind of treasure we set out to obtain. In this sense, the scholar is a treasure hunter of adventurous predisposition, more interested in searching than in finding. But he is not a tramp and knows what star he intends to follow. The country that promises chance for success and 12 [pageend14]freedom for stand attracts him. Ancient Rome and modem America are the great examples. America was founded by migrants and her vast expanses did not allow the migrant to tarry long at the first port. On the horizon of the first settlement, beyond the wilderness, the mountains, and the prairies, she always projected the misty outlines of a distant promise, inspiring the citizens to pull up their stakes and try their luck at some other place. She taught her citizens to enjoy the adventures of physical restlessness and the pleasures of locomotion; she bestowed respectability upon wandering, made a national virtue out of it. The gypsy takes to the road to escape the humdrum toils of work and the respectable monotony of sedentary life; but the puritanical nomad of America—this civilized wanderer constantly on the go, but with law and order deeply impressed upon his conscience—rides his canoe, covered wagon, automobile, or airplane with the expectation that the trip will lead him to his proper place of work. He wanders as a work habit. He takes up his abode wherever his work calls him; he offers home to any stranger who is willing to take up useful work. And in his nomadic civilization, amidst the many kinds of work, scholarship also receives its place. When Harvard University celebrated the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of its founding, Mr. Justice Holmes cast a glance upon the venerable history of his Alma Mater and another glance upon the multitude of Irishmen, Poles, and Slovaks who were just crowding into the cities of Massachusetts, and declared: «Civilized men who are nothing else are a little apt to think that they cannot breathe he American atmosphere.» The festive orator, an arch-American as he was, did not intend to condemn his fatherland as a country of intellectual barrenness or add fuel to the fire of prejudice smoldering in the cities of Massachusetts. What he was alluding to was an obvious fact for men of his age. Therç was a gaping chasm between scholarship, as the luxury of long-established upper classes, of Boston Brahmins and Phila- 13 [pageend15]delphia Mainliners, and immigration, the desperate rescue action of the poor, downtrodden, and exploited in the backward and badly governed provinces of Europe. He was right. America attracted the raw manpower of Europe, the surplus population of countries where freedom and food were scarce. She attracted the Joes and Stanleys of Eastern Europe whose paths led to the steel mills of Buffalo or the pushcart business of the Lower East Side. She attracted the men of physical energy who hoped to get ahead with the aid of their muscles, vigor, and sweat. The scholar, this pretentious son of civilized leisure, preferred to stay on the other side of the Atlantic. True enough, the three mighty founders of colonial theology—Thomas Hooker, Thomas Shepard, and John Cotton—had come from Emmanuel College in the old Cambridge and helped to establish divinity in the new Cambridge at the Charles. From that time on, the English supply of ministers, teachers, and literal-minded younger sons of the gentry had never dried out; yet, for a quarter of a millenium, the teachers at Harvard constituted an inbred group whose life path ran between the College and a congregation in New England and who abhorred to tread on a strange road. The trickle of scholarship never ceased. Each convulsion of that fickle continent, Europe, sent a few scholars scudding across the Atlantic, but these few savants in America were easily lost amidst the multitude of powerful muscles. They went not to the colleges, where the ecclesiastical influence was too strong to suit their tastes, but to teeming cities of the continent that offered freedom and refinement. Look at Philadelphia as it was about 1800, the glamorous city of Franklin and Jefferson. Here lived mild old Joseph Priestley, the «eighteenth-century Bertrand Russell», who had be.en attacked by a mob of Tories in England, driven across the Atlantic where he continued to preach, search, and write his vast History of the Christian Church. Similar fate brought over Thomas Cooper, once a publicist in old Oxford and now Jefferson’s intimate friend, destined to become the first professor of science in the new University of Virginia. In a little 14 [pageend16]stone school house of the city Alexander Wilson was teaching; he had been a poor lad from Scotland who, on his first walk in America, had spotted a red-headed woodpecker sitting on a green branch. This delightful sight inspired him to compile his great Ornithology. Around the boarding houses of the city the French émigrés swarmed, among them Constantine Volney, author of the popular Ruins on the downfall of absolutism and of a scientific study on the soil and climate of the United States. Next to him one could meet Brillat-Savarin, of the fame of the Physiologie du goût, who took a generous sampling of American food but failed to persuade his hosts to drop their puritanical prejudice against gluttony. The city is loquacious, inquisitive, and sophisticated, it is the natural habitat of scholars. The foreign-born men of learning gathered in the few cities of the continent where they could live by their wits. Much later, it happened that the colleges of the country ceased to be schools of divinity, admitted secular knowledge, and, in the same spirit, teachers from foreign countries. Harvard initiated this movement and through its open door, many distinguished names entered. The Agissiz family came from Switzerland; the father arrived for an exploration but stayed at Cambridge to organize the Lawrence Scientific School; the son turned scholar and entrepreneur and gave away as secret subsidy to learning the fortune he made in copper mining. Hugo Munsterberg, «the great Teuton,» came to establish the laboratory of experimental psychology where experiments succeeded, but psychology got somehow lost. George Santayana, a fellow countryman of Seneca, learned his first English words at the age of nine in a Boston kindergarten; when he returned to Spain at the age of twenty, he felt like a foreigner so be settled in Boston where he kept complaining of his captivity among the Puritans. Bernard Berenson arrived from Lithuania and remained cunningly reticent about his early years; but, having passed through Harvard, he somehow emerged as the prince of art history, which is the history of many princes. 15 [pageend17]«What did you bring?» is the question that people ask of the traveller at his journey’s end. One could answer that the scholars brought the refinement of their native countries, the old traditions of learning that lived within the historical settings of Europe. But this would be a flippant and false answer. Out of the names, just mentioned, only two received their training in Europe, while the younger Agissiz, Santayana, and Berenson were the academic products of America. To be sure, all of them brought along personal problems that made their quest for success and stand different from that of their native-born colleagues. Somewhere in their career they developed a special sensitivity, characteristic of those who are in minority; they developed the feeling of being tainted with something that for lack of another appropriate word must be called the vestiges of Europeanism. Yet, in spite of such differences, no great adjustment was necessary for them. They came to live in nineteenth-century America, the not-yet-estab- lished, still-flexible America which demanded so little from her immigrant children and was so willing to follow European patterns. There is something sad in describing one man as American and another as French or Russian or Spanish. By this act we admit our general failure in establishing the one and undivided mankind, the unity of the children of the earth. By this act we admit our weaknesses and limitations, our submission to the tribal idol of modem times, nationalism. We are made Americans, Russians, or Spaniards without our will by the incidental fact of our birth. Nationality is the most painful example of man’s dependence on contingencies, his powerlessness against the blind forces of the environment, his insufficiency and inability to form himself according to his ideals. The scholar is, of course, somewhat better than the butcher, the baker, and the candlestick maker because he attempts to overcome the restrictions of nationality, to be an international individualist, and to make his stand and success in global terms. The nineteenth century, furthermore, was the golden epoch of high hopes that men of all nations would 16 [pageend18]become free, reasonable, and united; it permitted the scholar to be an internationalist and, if he had come from another country, permitted him to live by his own law in America. The nineteenth century was an era of unlimited opportunities, when success came naturally, perhaps even easily, to men in all occupations. The immigrant scholar was moved in his career by the same forces that propelled the Pulitzers, the Jacob Riis, the Carl Schurz, or the captains of industry. He shared with his generation the belief in the entrepreneurial spirit; he trusted himself, relied on personal resources, and looked confidently into the future. He took his stand as he chose. He came to a country which set store by the idea of progress, rejected dogmatic fights, and permitted him to announce whatever philosophy he professed. The artistocratic philosophy of Santayana and Berenson did not evoke opposition in an epoch which was proudly non-aristocratic and often vulgar; and the left-wing political economy of Victor L. Berger and Louis C. Fraina was not silenced with the Palmer raids and the Bridgman convention. What appeared to be a scholarly matter was left unnoticed by the masses and untouched by the officials. Harvard, the great institution that has carried the burden of academic tradition, stability, and dignity since the beginning of this country, represents only one facet of American scholarship. Another kind of learning has also existed in this country, a home-spun learning, fitting the national spirit of restlessness, which has never felt quite at ease amidst the leisurely ways of serene academe, but has preferred to live on the road, visiting the citizens from town to town. America has always been a country of itinerant preachers and scholars who have carried around a self-assertive, aggressive, even folksy scholarship; who have been sometimes sincere and other times sham; but who, in any case, have reached those classes of the country that Harvard left untouched. The itinerant scholar is a colorful historical character that deserves to be rescued from oblivion. Here is one of them (and he shall be left unnamed because it is no business of 17 [pageend19]mine to separate the truth and untruth about this rather legendary figure) who combined in himself the quackery and the grandeur of the species. He came from Germany as the emissary of a mystical school of philosophy and rode the American lecture circuit around the turn of the century. He believed in his own words and was not afraid of social adventures; he chalked up a memorable success in non-Har- vardian America. When, at first, he lectured in German and the audience was set to hear him in English, the lingual confusion did not prohibit his popular acceptance as an authority on the subject. When, later, he arranged evening seminars in philosophy, lecturing in half-lit parlors and serving tea in Russian style with rum, the mixture of tea and philosophy proved to be another success, and the urbane ladies of the audience kept coming back for both. The present-day respectability of the academic profession (in fact, of any profession) is of recent origin, and not long ago the professional differed but a shade from the carnival man. But in any case, useful work is independent of respectability, and the itinerant scholar served knowledge just as faithfully as the itinerant preacher served God. His service was more than personal. Itinerant scholarship has been one of our national institutions that has come to serve as a popular check on the institutional academe and as a pleasant refuge to the non-conformist man of learning. Stemming from a long established suspicion against institutional learning, it has worked well to save the academe from rigidity and stuffiness and to keep American scholarship flexible and inventive. It must have been irritating for established scholars to see those outsiders competing for the honors of solid academe, but competitive erudition is one of the great contributions that America made to learning. It prompted our universities to invite guest lecturers from all countries of the globe and all walks of life, issuing invitations, perhaps, without much selectivity, but succeeding because of their free and easy manners of welcome. They performed a historical mission by not being selective and inviting those whom the 18 [pageend20]academie officialdom of Europe had rejected. They invited pedants, prigs, pedestrians, erudite fakes, and free-wheeling ignoramuses, but they welcomed Freud, Ferenczi and Adler also, and (if I am permitted to mention Canada under the same breath) granted a brief but official stay to Ernest Jones. And although their illustrious visitors left America after a short sojourn, analytic psychology took up a permanent domicile here and reshaped the mentality of the nation more' than any idea since Rousseau’s time had ever done. The flow of academic sojourners increased in volume and speed. By 1930 German professors were so regularly visiting our campuses that, when Hitler took over their fatherland, they could easily change a visiting lecturship into a regular professorship. The change, of course, was more than a matter of academic rank and title; it was a product of history, that senseless and wicked history that in the term of one man’s life could wipe off the old design of life, politics, scholarship, and happiness. Freud is a historical figure not only as the maker of an epoch, but also as the witness to the decline of Europe. In his middle years, when he came to lecture at Clark University, he had a home in that stable and secure Europe that was the continent of liberal traditions, freedom and progress, wit and erudition; but in his old age, when he came to be a refugee dying in England, he saw around him a sight more painful than cancer itself—Europe in the throes of totalitarian revolt, effacing its noble past. The totalitarian moloch swept away the liberal traditions and set up a thought control more vicious than anything devised by Emperor Domitian. It demanded that every citizen accept the cheap ideology of the men of power; it denied the right to say «nay»; it even denied the right to select martyrdom. The spectacular death of Seneca or the dignified withdrawal of Epictetus could not be repeated. The totalitarian Leviathan took control of the citizens’ fate, and proceeded to make yes- men out of the scholars. Few were those who with cunning or luck succeeded in speaking up. Pitirim Sorokin could force Lenin into a debate before leaving Russia on a trip that 19 [pageend21]eventually led him to becótné Crié of the founders of American sociology. Salvador de Madariaga (engineer, professor, diplomat, politician, and, perhaps, the last renaissance man produced by the Latin race) gained access to the forum of the international press when totalitarianism subdued his Spain. Einstein, never lost for words when important issues were at ;stake, always got a hearing because of his unique fame. But these were the exceptions. The average man was forced to take his stand on a petty issue, as in the case of the German professor whose hour of decision come when the authorities •objected to his examination essay: «To what extent may Carlyle 'be considered a precursor of National Socialism?» Others •were forced to recant; an Austrian Nobel Prize winner was «induced to deny his conviction and to extol the human greatBess of the Fuehrer, a humiliation that did not spare him the necessity of escaping shortly afterwards. And finally, thousands were deprived of speech, action, and freedom, of any sign of human dignity; they were hunted down like beasts because of their race, faith, party affiliation, or success. In face of that totalitarian brutality, how helpless and innocent those sophisticated scholars were! My memory summons up T. L., the friendly sharer of my youthful studies and work, an Epictetus man himself, who, as a young author of fine historical essays and a virgin in mind and body, still expecting life to open up, met his death in a concentration camp. The hunted and humiliated fled, and their flight was unlike that of the Jews from Egypt, directed by heavenly signs and God-sent leaders. Theirs was a panicky escape, without promising signs in the sky and appointed leaders on the earth; everybody ran in the first direction sighted and slipped into the country which had a back door ajar. But strangely enough, the fugitives beheld before their eyes a land of promise, America. In New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles these were the years of depression—of unemployment, soup-lines, and federal relief agencies with alphabetical names. But those who flee in terror rely on instinct rather than on calculation, and, instinctively, the fugitive mass saw in America not 20 [pageend22]dejection, but hope. Was it not the country of fabulous success where uncles and cousins had made good? Was it not the country with a propensity for attending lectures and studying useful and useless subjects? Was it not the country of itinerant scholars ready to lend an ear to ideas of any origin? To attract not the raw manpower but the sophisticated intellectual of Europe—this was a new role for America. Back in the nineteenth century the intellectuals who had escaped from Russia, Prussia and other police states, gathered in Paris, London and the scenic cities of Switzerland. Where else could a European intellectual live? The Russian refugees from the Bolshevik revolution frequented the same cities, and Nabokov states that they abhorred the sprawling, noisy, and vulgar America. But in the 193O’s the geography of the world suddenly changed, at least for the refugees; either the world became smaller or their view expanded. Anyway, they discovered America as a country in which one could live. And with this discovery, America came of age. The youthful country of pioneers had turned into a mature land that attracted scholars. In spite of her inhospitable immigration laws, America was a hospitable country, sympathetic, compassionate, and ready with practical help. What she extended to the hunted and humiliated ones was not the friendliness of her officialdom (is there any country where the officials would be helpful to the homeless and penniless?), but the living traditions of Puritanism and Quakerism, the active principle of charity and admiration for those who take a stand. What she offered was practical helpfulness, organized charity, systematic humanitarianism, and she offered tírese particularly to those who believed in a creed of their own, who had the courage to oppose and speak up for their conscience. She offered all this as the spontaneous actions of her private citizens, who volunteered help so readily that even the most diligent historian is unable to enumerate all the acts of charity. Just one of her organized philanthropies, the Emergency Committee in 21 [pageend23]Aid of Displaced Foreign Scholars helped more than 600 men and women; and just one of her professors, Alvin Johnson, established a special University in Exile at the New School for Social Research. As the refugees came in numbers, popular charity faced the dilemma of how to treat them. They were hungry and needy, but they were not the ordinary poor whom charitable ladies were wont to present with food baskets of ham and turkey. 'They were intellectuals but could not assert themselves in the respectable manner of our college towns. Who were they, .and what treatment should be given to them? The fine points of the dilemma are best summed up by two literary witnesses. One of them is Randall Jarrell whose picture of the Rosenbaums, that unforgettable couple at the fictional Benton College, reflects the American reverence paid to the foreign-born scholar. «Their kind was a European kind,» Mr. Jarrell tells us of the Rosenbaums. «In ungracious moments I felt that their minds were traps in which things came to an already-agreed-upon end; and they must have felt that my mind was so open that things streamed through it without coming to any conclusion at all. And yet—and yet... There was a hardness and matter-of-factness about Europeans, sometimes, an accustomed dismissal of what no one could dismiss—no one, surely, ever become accustomed to—that I was troubled by: they brushed life aside as though they themselves were life, and could afford to do as they chose with it.» This is one of those admirable statements of Mr. Jarrell in which clarity and opacity blend to produce what is more than truth—atmosphere. Yet, in spite of all the atmospheric content, the reader may question whether America is the land full of Natty Bumpos and Europe is the fatherland of superiority feelings. For my part, I rather think that any continent is likely to furnish us with colleagues who possess that Absolute Superiority that comes from Knowing-Some- thing-Better-than-Anybody-Else. Instead of refuting Randall Jarrell, I prefer to call another witness who under the improbable name of Bravig Imbs tur22 [pageend24]ned out an equally delightful college novel. Here again, amidst the colorful figures of an imaginary college, the reader may meet Nadia Schultz Rosenkrantz, the Russian-bom wife of a mathematics professor. She was regularly invited to the respectable parties of the town on the condition that she would wear her national costume; and so she did, although she felt uncomfortable with those rattling wooden beads around her neck. Yes, I am afraid, here is the crux of the matter. The immigrant scholar was supposed to be maddeningly superior and, at the same time, genuinely «folkish,» sophisticated and naïve, loyal to his native country and a civic-minded booster of our social life. To put it shortly, he was not supposed to be un-American but not entirely American either. True enough, all too many of those Rosenbaums and Rosen- krantzes have settled down with no smaller idea than that of reforming America. It is our good luck they have never been able to agree among themselves on the actual content of those reforms; otherwise, they might have turned America into a second-rate Europe. Of course, they wanted to reform their native countries too, although countries in general stubbornly resist any efforts for reform, let alone reform by people of good will and reason. In addition, the potentials of an immigrant as a reformer in America are limited by natural causes. One cannot live in America for any length of time without feeling the rattling wooden beads around his neck become uncomfortable. One cannot live in America without being carried away by her. That very puritanical spirit that has been so helpful to the persecuted ones has a strong persuasive power and molds everybody in accordance with its gentle design. As a result, the Rosenbaums and Rosen- krantzes gladly put down their national costumes when permitted to do so, became Americanized without even noticing it, and gave up their plans for remodeling America. The refugee from Hitler brought in his intellectual luggage a zest for reforms, a passionate involvement in politics, and a subtle inclination for adjustment. He also brought with him (as an inalienable part of himself that no custom officer could 23 [pageend25]tax or confiscate) his scholarship. His was the aristocratic scholarship of Europe, born in the medieval universities, grown under the tutelage of great masters, and reaching its full maturity about 1930. His was basically theoretical scholarship, guided by philosophy and history, the two par excellence European disciplines, and expressed with the easy rhetorical grace of Seneca—a sound scholarship which, however, could not serve him for long. On this side of the Atlantic he was confronted with American pragmatism, taking its guidance from natural sciences and statistics, expressing itself objectively, impersonally, and often artlessly, and aiming for nothing less than a democratic and popular distribution of knowledge. Suddenly, the newcomer had to realize that scholarship has two faces and that its Janus character is more confusing than we are ready to admit in the presence of undergraduate students. He was forced to recognize that knowledge is not a closed and rigid system, but the outcome of human conditions, and that as social conditions and personal sentiments change from time to time and from place to place, knowledge must also change. It was a formidable and challenging recognition. The immigrant scholars needed security more than anything else, and now the new country demanded that they should learn to live with Janus-faced knowledge. Many of them refused to give up the notion that their scholarship (and their social system, sentiment, and conviction) were the only correct ones. Others, who perhaps were of more flexible disposition, accepted the basic relativity of human knowledge, adjusted themselves to the new requirements, and absorbed the American form of erudition, without forgetting its European form, too deeply impressed upon their minds to be eradicated. Thereafter they blended theory and empiricism, worked for a democratic distribution of knowledge, put learning to practical use, labored in applied sciences, and resorted to statistics in testing theoretical hypotheses. With this approach, they contributed to the reformulation, nay, re-establishment of many a discipline. 24 [pageend26]A mighty case in point is the atomic bomb. The Official Report on the development of the bomb tells us: «At that time (in 1939) American-born nuclear physicists were so unaccustomed to the idea of using their science for military purposes that they hardly realized what needed to be done. Consequently the early efforts both at restricting publication and at getting government support were stimulated largely by a small group of foreign-born physicists centering on L. Szilard and including E. Wigner, E. Teller, V.F. Weisskopf, and E. Fermi.» What was the stimulus that the foreign-born had and the native-born lacked? Pure Machiavellianism cannot be a special quality of Europeans or, for that matter, of physicists either. Yet, the decision reached by the small group of foreign-born physicists was so novel, awesome, and fateful that it could not be made without a rigorous examination of one’s conscience; and every conscience works in its own ways. The immigrant scholar was not directed by that strange compass of our inner life, the Puritan conscience, which is known to have guided many American-born nuclear physicists. With his open mind he was quick to recognize that at the given moment the country’s interest demanded moral pragmatism. He acted accordingly, and history vindicated him. Whether engaged in martial pursuit or peaceful enterprise, the immigrant scholar contributed his share to that profound change that altered scholarship’s place in America and America’s place in the world. This was the time when America ceased to be the disciple and became the teacher of nations. Her sons stopped their annual pilgrimage to the European universities to pick up a Ph. D.; in fact, the flow of pilgrims reversed itself, and from now on the sons of all nations came to pursue their scholastic aspirations at the American seats of higher learning. To be sure, the American teachers did not renounce their restlessness, they rather increased the mileage of their locomotion; but from now on they penetrated the foreign countries as a new kind of globetrotters, as grant-sponsored research teams and exchange professors teaching the aborigines the elements of American- type scholarship. 25 [pageend27]This was the time when scholarship became a national concern and attracted the organizational genius of America. It ceased to be a private matter, was taken over by public agencies, and was fitted into the total fabric of national affairs, just as any other field of productive labor. This was the time when the old, Washingtonian America reached its end and a new America emerged which changed the dimension of the national affairs already existing and created Big Business, Big Labor, Big Government, and, soon, Big Scholarship. The last, which came into the world as one of the war babies of the 1940’s, hired the erudite for important jobs in the service of the war, stimulated a mushrooming growth of research organizations, sent a multitude of veterans to college, and proved before a nation wealthy beyond the possibility of usefully spending its wealth the immediate utility of the scholar’s work. The nation was convinced by the proof and decided to employ even larger numbers of scholars for peaceful services in government, business, education, and every possible branch of labor. As things turned out, the instinctive judgment of the hunted and persecuted ones held good. In spite of depression, unemployment, and alphabetical federal agencies, America offered a propitious environment. Her scholarship expanded to proportions never dreamed of, and the man of learning grew with the opportunities. He was called to found new disciplines, organize graduate schools, award Ph. D.’s, and to launch research projects and entire institutes. He was solicited to leave the peaceful campus, move to hectic Washington, turn governmental adviser, administrator, policy maker, public figure. He was entrusted with power over ideas, men, money, and politics, a power second to none of the old Senecas. He happened to live in a creative age, and no other group of scholars ever had better chances. He was just as fortunate in maintaining his stand. Under the traumatic experience of the depression, America cast away her old fear of burning issues that divide the community; the old Calvinistic insistence upon orthodoxy crumbled. The United States of the 1930’s was a much divided country in 26 [pageend28]■which the ideological left and right were engaged in pitched battles. Amidst the raging civil war of words, the accented voice of immigrant intellectuals was frequently heard and heeded with attentive reverence. Not that the fugitive from Hitler was an opportunist catering to the whims of ideological sects. But he was a versatile and sophisticated contender in the ideological battles, a professional against the amateurish American, for the Bierhalles, coffee houses, and little reviews of Europe had given him a good schooling in this rhetorical warfare. Whatever principles he professed, he was sure to command attention, find sympathizers, and make converts in his new country. The refugee from Hitler was more likely than not to be a humanist like Thomas Mann, and thousands of Americans listened to him. But at the same time Whittaker Chambers took orders from his Hungarian-born comrades, meeting them secretly in the New York Public Library, and not far away, at Yorkville, in the swastika-dotted meeting halls of the Bund, German-born Gymnasial professors taught Nazism to excitable young Americans. The morality involved did not make any difference. In each case it was an encounter between a foreign-bom teacher of ideology and enthusiastic American disciples. The group of the 1930’s arrived at a felicitous moment; they were present at the right time and place, when and where the chances opened up; they achieved much in every field of scholarship. Their places were hardly secured in America when, as a quirk of history, another kind of refugee knocked orí the doors of our consulates and security offices—the fugitive from Stalin. Two kinds of political refugees, uprooted within a decade, are bound to share a common fate in personal tragedies, panicky flight, and help received from altruistic America. But history never repeats itself; when it uses an old pattern, it adds some new variations. Hence, the anti-Communist refugee became a new historical type, an added color to the American mosaic. His forerunners of Nazi times had come mainly from the German-Jewish culture which, by the time of Hitler, 27 [pageend29]had found a second home for itself in Manhattan and in the Bronx; but the anti-Communist refugee came from that «twilight zone of Europe» which is hopelessly confusing to the American eye because it is broken up into a jumble of small countries and even smaller cultural units. From the twilight zone a motley crew arrived, speaking many tongues, professing many loyalties, and showing great diversity of wealth and status. They were united in one point only, their staunch anti-Communism, which saved them from submerging unnoticed into the ethnic sea of America and insured them a prominent place in our great national amalgam. No immigrant group received a warmer welcome from the usually reserved Americans; this time even the officials of the country turned out to greet the newcomers, welcoming them, often, before the TV cameras. No immigrant group struck a chord nearer to the American heart because no idea had a more rousing appeal to all Americans than anti-Communism, We Americans like to see the world as a clear-cut picture, as an open field where the forces of Good and Evil fight. We bitterly resent any fact, let alone any theory, that would blur the convincing simplicity of this view. Forever we would like to carry this picture with us and pinpoint the Evil in all our political and ideological fights. Alas, the results of such efforts all too often turn out to be embarrassing, for we can never completely agree on whether the witches of Salem, or old Indian chief King Philip shot down «like a wearied bull- mose in the deep swamp,» or Denmark Vesey and the other Negro revolutionaries were indeed the servants of Satan intent on corrupting our world. But now, in the case of Communism, the recognition of the Evil was clear and unanimous as never before. The whole nation, speaking with one voice, said, «Aye.» Anti-Communism corresponded so perfectly to the prevailing sentiments of the country that it needed no propagandists, publicity agents, or other promoters. The refugee did not create or change it; he depicted and properly exhibited it as an appealing symbol and a valiant fighter of the Evil. The 28 [pageend30]American mind never ceases to search for the lost heroes of our national mythology, for Hiawatha, Leather-Stocking and the other figures of moral rectitude who once fought the Evil with that stubborn single-mindedness that the citizen of the Suburban Civilization is somehow unable to marshal. Now the lost hero reappeared and in his broken English—that was just as expressive as the language of Cooper’s heroes— announced his unbroken willingness to fight Communism. Man has many ways of making good his promise. When the great king captured the House of Israel, some of the refugees sat down by the waters of Babylon and wept, but Joel prophesied of locusts laying waste the land, while Daniel learned the tongue of the Chaldeans and grew up to be an interpreter of secret signs. As it happens, the three biblical ways can be distinguished among the modem fugitives also. The first of them produced a rich foreign-language literature in America; the second turned out as professional anti-Communists, public figures and actors on our political stage; and the third stepped into the mainstream of American scholarship. Once there, the modem Daniel was struck with wonder at he sight of the masses, numbers, sizes, and proportions. By that time mass scholarship was fully developed, and a scholar could not be lonely any longer. Whatever his field was, he met there thousands of colleagues; whatever his research was, he found other teams working on it; whatever his idea was, he heard it announced by many confreres. He had to step up and join the crowd. He was not asked to found new graduate schools or head research institutes, nor was he asked to sit back, meditate, and create according to his pleasance. But he was asked to take his place among mapy experts and to work as a specialist with a team. In whatever terms his letter of invitation was worded, he was asked to fit himself into an organization and to subordinate his personal ideas to the common goals of bureaucratic erudition. As a specialist, success beckoned to him. Big Scholarship could offer rewards of which the imperial patron of Seneca ,or the Puritanical public of John Cotton had never thought— 29 [pageend31]a high standard of living and the cornucopia of goods and services that the daily routine of our automated production system delivers to the door of he suburban citizen. But the immigrant scholar, a specialist on the research team as he was,, could not be satisfied with this stolid land of milk and honey. He desired more, and mass scholarship gave that too. It gave him opportunity to pursue his ideas with financial and mechanical aid never before available to scholars, to publish and distribute the same ideas in copies, languages, and countries never before reached by scholarship. True enough, thousands of colleagues competed with him for the attention of the world, and his voice sounded like a faint whisper in the roaring thunder of mass communication. Yet, there was something formidable and, to some extent, dangerous in the power that the efficient mechanism of Big Scholarship put at the disposal of the man of learning. The erudite specialist, relaxing in his suburban home, with the knowledge of his ideas being irresistibly carried to the masses of the East and of the West, conjures up the image of plenty, power, and self-confidence, in naked contrast to that scholastic self-denial that Epictetus made famous. Indeed, self-denial detracts from bigness, and the Epictetuses in our midst might embarrass Big Scholarship. Our system of producing knowledge needs the company of Seneca, the eminently successful organization men who are conscious of the social origins of their success and are conviced of the necessity of reasonable conformity. They realize that burning issues which divide the nation could undermine its prosperity, and they honestly endeavour to replace the ideological battles of the previous decades with the pleasant, although demure, conformity of an affluent society. They accept a reasonable conformity which manipulates dissent through an appeal to prudence and decency, and which dislikes the use of force and intimidation. The McCarthy investigations did scare the intellectuals, but these were an isolated episode and not routine practice. The era of Big Scholarship is neither harsh nor dreadful; on the contrary, it is alluring, tempting, pampering. 30 [pageend32]It does not impale the dissenter, but gives affluence to the yes-man. The scholar as a specialist has not renounced his duty to take a stand, but relegated it to an unconspicous place, removed it, so to speak, from the front lawn to the blackyard. The depth of his soul, his drive for stand and creativity, his not changed, but on a superficial level he has made a compromise with the exigencies. He has accepted his job for what is was set up, a job of solving the practical problems of an organization and not an avocation of standing up as the symbol of an idea. He has accepted his home for what it was designed, a Suburbia built for the easy satisfaction of all human wants and not for an uneasy battleground of neighbors. He has accepted his immigrant fate at its face value, put aside the philosophical wars that he once waged in Europe, and made peace with all neighbors of every faith and ideology. Look around: the examples of the intellectual compromise are abundant. The former Nazi guard and the former inmate of the concentration camp work now side by side on a military research project; the former comrade and the former antiCommunist refugee ally themselves to ferret out the subversives (and sometimes the non-subversives) on the campus; the present-day condottiere hires out his skill in making rocketry and overkill weapons to any political system that is willing to pay the price; and the immigrant scholar speaks up more frequently and with greater self-confidence in the National Review than in the Nation. The iron rule of self-interest governs behavior in mass scholarship, lets bygones be bygones, and lets everyone watch out for his present goals and future gains. The anti-Communist immigrant, who is by now settled in our midst, does not signal the end of the eternal restlessness of scholars. Each year brings in a fresh wave of men of learning as America, the great employer of the globe, recruits scholars in five continents to supply skilled manpower for Big Scholarship. Let us hope that this influx will continue in the time to come. As long as America attracts the brainpower 31 [pageend33]of distant continents, her economic and intellectual prosperity will be secure. And so it happens that scholars from five continents meet in this modern Rome of ours, the greatest Rome of history, that with its sprawling campuses and sky-scraping offices expands from Massachusetts Bay to San Francisco Bay. There has not been any bigger and richer Rome yet, no place that would have invited more learned men. Seeing their numbers, let us not lament the absence of Epictetus from the crowd. After all, the company of Seneca is certainly with us, an active, eager, and helpful company that works on the solution of many useful problems and promises to accomplish much more. This company, a colorful group, wearing the emblematic signs of accent and eccentricity as permanent badges that can never be cast off, stand out conspicuously agains the native- born majority of the academic profession. But signs are deceptive and emblems are figments. The scholars of our Rome cannot be divided into two camps by their places of birth; they think the same way and work together; they are the best symbols of mankind undivided. And the immigrant scholar ^whatever his name, accent, or eccentricity may be is the strongest promise the human race has ever had that our ancient dream may come true, that a united mankind somehow be established—a mankind that puts aside tribal warfare and barriers and stands united in work, scholarship, and, perhaps, even wisdom. 32 [pageend34]FRANZ ADLER THE MARGINAL MAN ON THE FACULTY The « marginal man » is defined as « a person who is in contact with two cultures, participating in parts of each of them, but belonging fully to neither» (1). He is, typically, the man who is moving away from one social background and working toward his acceptance in a new environment. In this process he either is cut, or cuts himself, loose from his original moorings. At the same time, he is likely to meet resistances with regard to his full integration into the new life. Characteristically, these resistances not only come from the outside, but some, and maybe the most serious ones, originate within himself. The migrant from one country to another is a marginal man, but he is not the only one. Those who move from one social class or caste to another, who change religion, job or school, who grow from one age group into another, who leave one family to found another, and many others become marginal and remain so for a longer or shorter period (1) Joseph S. Roucek and Roland L. Warren, Sociology, An Introduction, Ames, Iowa, Littlefield, Adams & Co., 1951, p. 257 ; the concept was originally suggested by the late Robert E. Park of the University of Chicago and more fully elaborated by Everett V. Stonequist, in his book The Marginal Man, New York, Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1937. 33 [pageend35]of time, even forever. In fact, the world is full of marginal men—there are no others. If this were not the case, all of us would be exact copies of each other, devoid of any glimmer even of individuality, stamped out by the same die: everybody would be a perfectly average man of his social set. The migrant between two countries is very likely to be marginal, not only in nationality, but also in other matters. The migrant scholar moves not only from one country, language, and culture to another, but also, if he is lucky, from one institution of learning to another. His status in private life may also change, and the impact of marriage upon the scholarly career should not be underestimated. He may find his accustomed religion or irréligion a drawback to social or economic advancement, may leave it and join another, or may become unaffiliated. He may lose old friends and make new ones. And in any case, he grows older. All this may be hard or easy on him depending on such circumstances as the degree to which he has internalized the ways of his earlier environment, the extent of the pressures put on him by the new one, his personal flexibility or inflexibility, his ability or willingness to return home, and numerous other factors. Let us consider first some of the pressures of the new environmlent. In almost every case, the migrant scholar must learn to express himself in a new language. But how well he will speak the new language will depend on the age at which he first comes in contact with it, on the inherent difficulties of the language, on its similarity to his own, on his previous experiences with the learning of foreign languages, etc. But the attitudes in different language groups concerning the way the 34 [pageend36]foreigner speaks it differ widely. Frenchmen tend to consider anybody a barbarian who fails to speak flawless French. In England, language patterns, of a lower class will find extreme difficulties in making their way whenever upper-class patterns; are expected. In Germany, the western and northern European accents are acceptable, but the eastern European accents may pose insurmountable obsta- cles to any advancement. In the United States, on the other hand, accents, perhaps with the only exception of that of the southern Negro, are quite forgivable. Most Americans, being uncertain themselves concerning the correct spelling and pronunciation of many words, are reluctant to be overly critical of other peoples’ mistakes. Thus many foreigners whose utterances can be understood only with effort and difficulty, can be found holding forth in academic classrooms. Only rarely will they be found, however, as deans or presidents of universities and hardly more frequently as department heads or other lower administrative officials. This, however, has nothing to do with language. Anybody holding office in an organization must fulfill its formal requirements. The scholar, like any other job holder, must put in certain hours and do the work for which he is paid. He must obey directives issuing from' certain sources and give other directives to specified classes of recipients. While these arrangements may differ considerably from those to which he was accustomed, and while he may chafe under them and resent them, he can easily find out what they are and decide whether their unpleasantness is outweighed by the intellectual and material satisfactions of his employment. Most European scholars in the United States miss 35 [pageend37]the broad freedoms of European academic positions, but, knowing the rules, they have no difficulty in submitting to them. Frequently they find outlets for their dissatisfaction with the formal system by joining the American Association of University Professors or other similarly ineffective action groups in which they propagate highly idealized versions of the academic systems of their home countries before audiences who consider such arrangements purely utopian and unworkable. In the formal systems to which the foreign scholar has chosen to subordinate himself, difficulties arise from features which nobody has explained to him because nobody is aware of them. A German scholar, for example, is used to giving and receiving orders in the linguistic structure and the vocal sound of commands. American orders, almost anywhere outside the armed forces and sometimes even within them, are given in the voice of suggestion. Thus, one German professor whose dean had told him repeatedly during the year in a very cordial tone of voice, « Now, if I were you, I wouldn’t do this, but would do that, » was very much surprised when his contract was not renewed at the end of the year. He felt that he had been informed of what the dean would choose to do in a professor’s position and had not the slightest suspicion that he had been given orders. The same professor at the same time deeply antagonized students and secretaries by telling them directly, in a tone of military command, what he wanted them to do. Among formal elements most difficult to grasp for foreigners are the ways of academic democracy. The ancient universities of the Old World are truly self-administering establishments whose high degree of independence from any outside influence 36 [pageend38]or supervision is strongly supported by the general population. American colleges and universities, on the other hand, are run by boards generally consisting of non-academicians, who are appointed either by political office holders or by private providers of funds, and who, in turn, appoint the school’s chief administrators. The administrators are responsible to these boards rather than to the faculties. The faculties or their elected representatives are at best advisory rather than decision making bodies; their opinions may be disregarded at any time at the discretion of the non-facuity administrators. The foreigner, however, tends to mistake these trappings of faculty democracy for the real thing. Instead of « playing the game » according to the rules, he may become very much upset debating matters which are, after all, being decided elsewhere. Administrators do like to maintain the appearance of factdty consent for their actions. Thus they try to construct majorities by individual or group consultations with faculty members before anything comes to a vote. The naive newcomer who harangues his colleagues with impassioned speeches notices too late that all has been arranged beforehand and that he is merely holding up the proceedings. He is outraged. What he fails to realize is that it is exactly in the private discussions which he condemns as pure manipulations that some effective faculty influence upon the decision process is exercised. The formal academic way of life is interwoven with an informal one. Non-business contacts with the persons involved and their spouses occur in many situations. The foreigner who comes from an environment in which titles and ranks were 37 [pageend39]greatly emphasized and never omitted in social intercourse may feel charmed and elated when the president or the dean pats him on the shoulder* calls him Joe, and, in return, expects to be called Al or Tom:. He easily forgets that the equality this first-name address seems to symbolize applies only to certain non-business contacts and only to a limited extent even in these. He courts disaster if he ever forgets that Al or Tom may still fire him if he oversteps the boundary which is obvious to them and to his native colleagues, but invisible to him. Obviously only a scholar wise to the ways of this academic world, both formal and informal, will ever qualify for an administrative position in it. By the time he has obtained this wisdom he is likely to have offended more influential people ihan all his wisdom will ever manage to reconcile. The environments account for only a part of the Way in which the syndrome of marginality manifests itself. The ways are connected with the individuals themselves. The scholar who arrived in his new homeland with spouse, children, or parents is likely to find it more difficult to recognize and adopt the patterns expected from him in America than the other who founded a family in the new country. The former may use his imported family as a miniature edition of his old-accustomed environment in which he finds shelter after the hardships of life among strangers; the latter may find a native spouse who introduces a conflict of cultures into his family while at the same time eases his adjustment to the outside world. Then again, the family members who arrived together from abroad may become integrated with the new life at different speed and to different degrees, and each may resent the other’s 38 [pageend40]deviance from his own pattern. Parent-child conflicts are particularly frequent in this context, but husband — wife tensions are by no means absent. The subtle and not-so-subtle influences of a person’s family conditions upon his professional life are too numerous and too involved to be discussed here any further. Other important considerations lie in whether the immigrant came of his own choice or was forced to move, whether he intends to stay or to return, and whether he can return if he so chooses or is forced to remain. Voluntary migration, intention to stay, and inability to return are probably positively related to conscious efforts towards assimilation. Related to these efforts is the problem of the reference group, that is, the people whose judgment matters to the scholar. If he tries to apply the standards of professional activity valid in his country of origin, he may conflict with the standards of his new homeland or vice versa. For example, the European who, following the standards learned from his old confrères, lives in the altitudes of lofty theoretical abstractions may find that his more practically oriented American colleagues fail to see any point in his activities. In rare cases his interest in his old reference group may make him an effective missionary among members of his new one. With success, he may find himself able to change reference groups, accepting the new one as the more important one, without really changing his actual predilections. This is what happened during the second World War and thereafter in the United States when foreign born theoretical physicists and mathematicians working on nuclear weapon developments convinced American 39 [pageend41]scientists of the ultimately practical value of high- level theories. Strangely enough, a similar choice of reference group, that is, the acceptance of the Old World members of the profession as the ones that really count, may produce exactly the opposite effect. At least one social scientist explained his development in the United States in the following words : « Back home I never dared to speak out or write because I felt I never could measure up to the demands of the profession. But those critics and judges are far away. The people here don’t count, they aren’t any better than I am. Here I say what I darn well please and feel good about it. » This liberation from the pressure of a group which is still defined as the only one that really counts has permitted this particular scholar to be quite successful in his field in America. Usually, however, the inferiority feelings which this man experienced with regard to his country of origin are gradually extended to the new country when painful experiences teach that what may have insured success in the past is likely to lead to failure in the future. In extreme cases, the feeling of liberation which is an aid to creative activity may be exaggerated to a feeling of utter normlessness, in which the absolute lack of guide lines and limits frighten a person to the point where he is not only completely stifled in his creative efforts but may fall prey to neuroses or psychoses, and may even commit suicide. The same may occur when a scholar is torn between his adherence to conflicting reference group ideals, when he is unable to combine the roles that he feels the two groups expect from him and fails to elaborate an integrated image of him»- self in which he can function effectively. 40 [pageend42]Some immigrants in all stations of life maintain their personalities undisturbed by withdrawing from the general population and living in a ghetto that preserves the major aspects of the home environment and shuts out all that is foreign. There also are academic ghettos of this kind, and, for example, foreign language departments lend themselves more easily to such ghetto formation than others. At times, a whole school appears whose faculty consists almost entirely of migrants from one country. The result is a cultural enclave or a strangely esoteric ivory tower, quite out of touch with the life that goes on around it. Scholars, on the other hand, whose flexibility enables them to form social and professional associations with the native citizens, are likely to find their way toward effective professional communication and participation. So far, mainly the dangers and pitfalls of being a marginal man have been stressed. But, as a matter of fact, this position also has its advantages. In the natural sciences, these rest primarily in the chance that some information or technique may have been accessible to the scholars of one country, but not to the scholars of another. When this knowledge suddenly becomes needed and desired (as it happened in the case of the atomic scientists), the migrant scholar has a great advantage that must be attributed not only to his personal qualities but also to his luck. Social scientists may enjoy similar advantages. Those immigrant scholars who acquired the know-how of American research technique during the Hitler era and then carried it back to their home countries—being there by then almost as marginal as they had been in the United States a few years earlier—found there a demand for this knowledge and, in turn, 41 [pageend43]found it relatively easy to become personally reintegrated in the country of their birth. Indeed, social scientists gain a particular advantage from a marginal position. The way a man sees the world is largely conditioned by the speech and action patterns among which he grows up. Thus, what the culture refuses to see, he cannot see ; what the culture magnifies, looms large in his sight; and this manner of perception is continuously reinforced as long as his social and cultural environment remains the same. If he leaves the country and settles in another, there comes a period when the reinforcements of his old perceptive processes have ceased and the pressures of his new environment have not yet succeeded in giving him other blind spots, distortions, and magnifications. Then he may have a chance to see things as they really are. Here is his special chance to make objectively valuable contributions to social sciences. Unfortunately they are very likely to be rejected by those who do not share his viewpoint unless he is able to produce incontrovertible proof. Nevertheless, the freedom of the mind that the marginal man enjoys is an invaluable asset to the social scientist and, potentially, to mankind. But only the strong can bear to be free, and too many, alas, are those who seek protection from freedom', either in a ghetto or in a neurosis. Let us recall, now, a point made near the beginning of this essay. Marginality is not the monopoly of migrants, much less of migrating scholars. All of us are more or less marginal as we move through life. This is more so than ever before in our secular society where the chances for the acceptance of factual truths are improving. And as reliable knowledge about the social world we live 42 [pageend44]in begins to replace the traditional world views, the liberation of man through increasing marginality becomles itself a factor in change. This change permits us to hope that attempts of building ways of life on the basis of factual information will lead to more satisfactory social arrangements than those based on any of the innumerable bankrupt traditions of mankind. JOHN M. MUNRO «INNOCENTS ABROAD» An Account of Some of the Problems Facing English Teachers at American Universities Recently in England a certain amount of concern was expressed over the large numbers of native-born, British-trained scientists who left their native land to take up positions overseas. Although statistics are not available, the number must be fairly large, •especially for those who go to the United States with the idea of making university teaching their career, because competition for university positions in England is fierce, and the remuneration for the successful ones not particularly high. Nevertheless, it is likely that the number of English university teachers in the humanities at American universities does not 43 [pageend45]exceed that of expatriate scientists, partly because the demand for scientists is greater, but for other reasons too, which have an important bearing on some of the problems which English university teachers have to face in trying to adjust to the American scene. In the first place, while in England the prestige of American science is high, it is generally believed that the United States is something of a cultural wasteland; secondly, the difference between the salary of a young English scientist and that of his American counterpart is much greater than that of a young English university lecturer and an instructor in the United States; thirdly, a scientist who goes to the United States expects to gain valuable experience which will stand him in good stead if ever he wishes to return home, while a person who goes to the United States to take up a position in a humanities department at a university knows that he will have to distinguish himself extraordinarily if he is to attract attention in England; finally, a scientist can be persuaded to go to the United States by the promise of greater opportunities and superior facilities for research, while it is felt by many English scholars that research in the humanities is next to impossible if one does not have relatively easy access to the British Museum or the Bibliothèque Nationale. In short, all this means that the young English scientist can depart for the United States confident that whether he likes the country or not, the experience will he both personally and professionally rewarding, while the Englishman who comes to teach the arts at an American university tends to feel that he is burning his bridges behind him—that once he takes up his position the chances of his teaching in an English university are faint. Thus, the majority of English who do come to teach at universities in 44 [pageend46]the United States do so not from choice but necessity. Admittedly there are many Englishmen who come out of curiosity, or to pursue a particular branch of research for which facilities are available, but they tend to be visitors only, away from home for a year, their posts in England assured. It is also true that some married men with growing families come to the United States because their salaries at home are insufficient to meet their increasing economic needs. On the whole, however, English university teachers in the arts who come to the United States are here simply because they were unable to find satisfactory positions at home. Thus, they tend to be not of the highest quality, or if they are, are probably products of local grammar schools and provincial universities, who have found their lack of public school and Oxbridge training an impediment to their gaining the kind of position they would wish. In either case, they are liable to feel rejected by the English system, and this has considerable bearing on the way they react to their new environment. Some show obvious signs of insecurity; some compensate by over-aggressiveness. In either case, they seem to experience certain problems of adjustment much more sharply than other classes of immigrants. Thus, when confronted with the demands peculiar to the American university system, many Englishmen either find it difficult to fulfill them satisfactorily, or obstinately refuse to try. For example, students at English universities are left considerably more on their own than those in America. It may be argued that this is a wasteful process, so many students lacking the maturity of temperament to pursue their studies without close supervision, while on the other hand the practice may be defended on the grounds that it encourages a lively and responsible independence of thought and 45 [pageend47]behavior. However, the point here is not to consider the relative merits of the English and American systems, but simply to note an essential difference. Thus, the Englishman teaching in America, his visions of English students’ maturity and industriousness becoming rosier the longer he is away from home, finds frequently the necessity of looking after his Charges with an eye only a little less than paternal, rather irksome. He is liable to resent taking daily attendance; giving frequent «quizzes» to ascertain whether students have done their reading assignments; debating whether so-and-so may legitimately be excused from class to play football, sing with the Glee Club, or take part in other university activities ; filling out progress reports for fraternities, athletic directors, deans, major departments, and sometimes for psychiatrists; preparing, when necessary, elaborate dossiers for such bodies as the Students’ Honor Council when a student is suspected of cheating ; and perhaps most of all, listening to students’ problems, both personal and academic. All these things the Englishman tends to find irksome, and will probably resent that such duties are expected of him. Relatively unused to looking upon their students as individuals, many Englishmen will find such day- to-day demands unusually difficult to comply with, while others will look upon them as unnecessary, and maintain resolutely that the way students conduct their affairs is none of their business, and that their responsibility is to teach rather than to babysit. Another difficulty which may cause resentment, is the necessity of tailoring one’s courses to meet the rather special requirements of American students. In an English university students in a particular class will have had, more or less, the same kind of schooling; their ethnic, cultural and social back46 [pageend48]grounds will tend to be similar; most of them will be working towards the same degree, to be granted the same year; and they will all have approximately the same motivation to study. Perhaps most significant of all, the majority of students in a particular class, and in many cases all of them, will be specializing in the subject being discussed, and will all know roughly the same about it. Accustomed to the homogeneity of the average class at an English university, the English teacher may feel completely overwhelmed when faced with the ethnic, social, and cultural assortment typical of most American classes, where students of varying abilities and enthusiasm are held together in uneasy synthesis for a semester. Obviously, if he has any hopes of reaching the majority in his classes, the English teacher will have to review and probably revise his lectures to conform to the general standard. This does not mean that he must necessarily lower his standards, though this to some degree is inevitable; it does mean, however, that he must endeavor to communicate whatever he has to say as clearly as possible, in terms that the students will readily understand. This is not simply a question of language, though a lecturer in America will probably feel the necessity to use a less erudite vocabulary than his English counterpart, but it also affects the method of presentation itself. In England, for example, a lecturer teaching English literature will generally assume that his students have understood what they have read, and he will also assume that they are aware that what the writer has said is worth saying. Thus, his lectures will tend to concentrate on various aspects of literary technique— how a writer has achieved a particular kind of effect —and how a writer’s work fits into the context of the history of English literature. In short, he will tend to regard a particular writer of literary work in a purely literary context. In America, however, 47 [pageend49]one is frequently faced with the problem of students not being able to understand what they are reading, and when they do, being unconvinced that their lives are made any the richer for it. Therefore, if one has any ambition to be more than simply a medium for the transmission of information, one must think of literature in the broadest possible terms, and without appealing to literary precedents or standards, endeavor to show why such-and-such a piece of writing is great, and why a proper appreciation of it can be as rewarding for engineers as for English majors. Thus, a lecturer in England teaching, say, Shakespeare’s dramas, would probably spend more time describing Elizabethan stage conventions, problems of Elizabethan language and rhetoric, Shakespeare’s sources for his plays, the contemporary social and cultural background and so on, than he would going through the plays in class, pointing to various felicities of expression, commenting on the appropriateness and effectiveness of particular speeches, and drawing attention to the significance of various passages not simply with reference to the play as a whole, but to human nature, contemporary society, and even to life itself. Certainly, many English lecturers in America tend to resent what they might be disposed to call «diluting» their lectures for the benefit of people whose interest in literature is either marginal or non-existent, and many are either unable, or possibly refuse, to meet the level of their classes. This inability or refusal to find a common level of sympathy or understanding with his classes is probably only one aspect of a larger issue which the Englishman has some difficulty in accepting: that higher education in America is dedicated to teaching the greatest number of students who may reasonably be expected to benefit from further study, rather 48 [pageend50]than giving special consideration to a few. The lecturer in England is used to addressing small, élite groups of specialists; he expects them to understand his vocabulary, his literary allusions, his jokes, as well as the substance of his lectures. Inevitably a club spirit prevails. Because everyone understands (or at least, pretends to understand) what is going on, and because the underlying assumptions regarding the usefulness of studying literature are taken for granted, there is no necessity to appeal to other than literary criteria to justify one’s judgments or points of view Thus classes tend to be less like sittings in a council chamber where there is a free interchange of personal points of view presided over by a good-natured chairman, which approximates to the American ideal, than congregations of the elect coming together to take in a quasi-religious ceremony under the aegis of an exalted high priest. It is not surprising then, that a lecturer used to the decorum and dignified ceremony of an English, university lecture frequently finds the informal atmosphere of a typical American class rather hard to endure. In English university classes the lecturer has few disciplinary problems. Late-comers are few, for those who cannot arrive on time generally prefer to forego the lecture entirely than enter the room after it has begun. Students are generally quieter, better mannered, and no matter how boring the lecture may be, only a few brave souls would dare to register their feelings with a sigh or a yawn. Certainly the behavior of American students in class is rather poor by any standards, and one can sympathize with the horror which many English visitors express concerning class conduct. Nevertheless, even supposing American students behaved with the same politeness as their English counterparts, the English lecturer would still have to cope with cer49 [pageend51]tain distractions which arise naturally from the traditional way classes are conducted in the United States. Before he enters a class the lecturer in England will have carefully prepared his material, budgeted his time, and in the classroom may deliver his lecture as one would read a paper, broking no interruptions and indeed, expecting none. In America, however, the lecturer must be prepared to ansver questions, clarify and perhaps re-clarify his statements, suffer himself to be drawn into impromptu discussions allowing everyone his say, and although with practice one can control informal class exchanges without too much difficulty and without hurting too many feelings, it is a constant problem making sure one covers sufficient material. Consequently, the informality of American university classes may frequently distress English lecturers, who are likely to find class discussions both time-wasting and distracting, and though few would admit it, an additional strain on their intellectual capacities. The necessity to supervise students closely, the difficulties which result from the variable nature of American classes, and the informal class behavior, are probably the greatest bugbears of English university teachers in America. The degree to which these difficulties may be overcome will depend not only on the teacher’s ability to conform to his new environment, but also on his willingness to recognize that the ideals and functions of British and American universities differ. If he is prepared to accept the fact that American higher education caters not simply to the élite few, but endeavors to provide instruction for as many who may reasonably be expected to benefit from it—in short, if he is prepared to acknowledge that what is different may not necessarily be inferior—then the English teacher in America will have overcome the greatest obstacle in the way of 50 [pageend52]his adjustment. The fact that many Englishmen seem unable to accept this simple fact, is perhaps partly due to the insecurity they seem to feel as a result of their being rejected by the English system. There are, however, other problems which are liable to cause the English teacher in America some concern, but these arise not so much from the differences between the British and American university systems, as the attitudes of students and colleagues to English academics as a class. The difficulties may be summarily dealt with, as they tend to arise from their misconceptions of the English as a race, false views which to some extent have been fostered by the numerous comedy films which have been produced in England during the past ten years or so, and which seem to attract large audiences over here. Thus, students sometimes expect English teachers to conform to the caricatures of the academic profession which they have seen in such films as The Belles of St. Trinian’s, where Alistair Sim portrayed an old-fashioned, other-wordly, absent-minded, rather prim headmaster whose most obvious distinction was his inability to understand the most elementary demands of twentieth-century civilization. In a word, English academics are supposed to be funny and out of touch with life around them. Sometimes, in their willingness to see the lighter side of life, students are apt to regard one’s most sober pronouncements as high comedy, and the effect of this is that one’s classes tend to be regarded more as entertainments than periods of instruction. This certainly has its advantages, and it may cautiously be exploited as a useful teaching device, but there are always one or two students who are unable to determine where comedy leaves off and instruction begins. However, one should not exaggerate the problems arising from American students’ misconceptions of 51 [pageend53]ihe English academic. After the first few meetings the notion that English university teachers are lioticeably different from the American kind should have disappeared, and most students are intelligent enough to dissociate the fictional world from reality. More complex, perhaps, than the relationship with •one’s students, is one's relationship with colleagues. To some extent they too subscribe to a mythical con- •ception of the educated Englishman, not, however, the comic caricature which obtains among students, but to the legend that all English university teachers are witty, urbane dillettantes, superficially brilliant but lacking in intellectual depth. Thus one is expected to be amusing, fluent, gracious, and is indeed valued for these qualities if one possesses them, but at the same time one tends to be regarded as being incapable of real scholarly activity. Therefore, though many department chairmen would hesitate to formulate it thus, the acquisition of one or two Englishmen on the faculty is regarded as adding «tone» rather than substance, and one is never really sure whether one has been hired for one’s nationality or for one’s academic qualifications. Finally, no study professing to deal with some of the problems which confront an English university teacher in America would be complete without some mention of «academic freedom.» Without doubt an Englishman teaching at an English university is used to considerably more academic freedom than his American counterpart. One cannot conceive of a lecturer of English literature with avowed communist sympathies being allowed to teach at an American university at all, much less to present the history of the nineteenth century English novel in terms of the class struggle. In England, however, there is such a man, and his academic career seems not to have been jeopardized on account of his political beliefs, nor, 52 [pageend54]so far as I know, has his teaching been publicly condemned for its socialist bias. Nevertheless, to say that lack of academic freedom is a serious problem for Englishmen teaching in America would not be true, because the English academic tends to be less assertive, less involved with contemporary events, and not used to making controversial statements about political events or systems in class. Admittedly, many Englishmen in the United States will deplore the powers exercised by the university administration, the alumni, the state government, and other institutions to control and stifle a teacher’s right to express what he believes, but one should not interpret their complaints as cries from the hearts. For English teachers in America, questions about academic freedom tend to be little more than theoretical, and fewT, I think, could honestly maintain that it constituted a major problem for them. This article has been concerned with some of the problems that confront an English teacher at an American university, and in the absence of reliable data my account is to a large degree subjective, being based on my own experience and the experience of others in a similar situation. It may perhaps be felt that in drawing attention to some of the problems, I have presented too negative a picture, and one might conclude that the chances of an Englishman adjusting to American university life are 'faint indeed. This, however, is not the case, for though there are many difficulties, there are rewards too. In England the study of literature tends to be a cloistered activity, with lecturers and students sharing in the common experience of enjoying good books. One is never required to answer the question, «is what I am doing worthwhile?», for few would think of asking it. As a result, the study of literature tends to become increasingly detached from life and 53 [pageend55]to take on the character of an esoteric pursuit. More and more one feels that it is little more than a gentlemanly pastime, designed to add polish and refinement to those about to enter the world to make a living, or to provide others with the necessary background to enable them to carry on the teaching of literature elsewhere. In America, however, where the university tends to be less of an ivory tower, one is constantly required to review and sometimes to reassess the fundamental principles on which one’s whole career is based. Certainly teaching English literature at an English university is more «pleasant» than teaching it in America. Only the most partisan American scholar would deny that. Whether teaching English literature in England is a rewarding as teaching it in the United States is another matter. It is frustrating, to say the least, to feel an obligation to try and instill some appreciation for literature into people who, one feels, might be more profitably •employed breaking stones than breaking their heads. Sometimes, however, in teaching students whom one has rather hastily dismissed as incorrigible morons, one will find that somehow one has penetrated to a core of unawakened sensibility and provoked a genuine response in regard to a particular writer or work of art. And when this happens one’s belief in the power of great literature to refine what, for want, of a better word one might call the «soul», is reaffirmed ; faith in the value of teaching and studying literature is renewed; and once again in being reminded of Man’s unique capacity to soar as well as to sink, our faith in the possibility of a better world is restored. 54 [pageend56]WILLIAM T. LIU THE AMERICAN DREAM AND THE CONFUCIAN SCHOLAR Among the foreign-born scholars in American universities and research institutes, those from the Far East have come to represent one of the highest proportions. In the later group, the Chinese intellectual has not only gained particularly much in numbers, but has also pre-empted what novelty and prestige remain in being a Confucian scholar. Many people, colleagues and outsiders alike, still view him as the Confucian disciple of the old days who sets himself apart from the populace. He is the inscrutable man, dedicated to ideas but not to action; he spends his days studying the classics of ancient China; and he is somewhat lonely. While his wife sympathizes with his intellectual pursuits, she does not share his activities, and he himself rarely, if ever, renders her the spousal help in rocking the bassinet or fixing the curtain rod. This stereotype might have been true in the past, but is definitely false in the present. Chinese scholarship in general has gone through some historical changes because scholarship is always changeable and because China as a country has seen more innovations in this century than during many previous centuries of her history. Around 1919 in China occurred the May Fourth Movement (or, as it is called, the- Chinese Cultural Renaissance) which displaced the formerly staid and 55 [pageend57]authoritarian atmosphere of the country’s scholarship with a more robust intellectual, romantic and utilitarian spirit. After that, students in China came to identify themselves with the learning and freedom of the West. A new pattern of thinking emerged. The Western thought and the rejection of Confucian tradition were regarded as signs of scholarship and patriotism, and Western learning was viewed as a sure way to improve one’s chances in an increasingly crowded job market or to prepare for academic careers. The old civil service examination system had been abolished, but no new mechanism had been found for electing the elect, although academic learning continued to be the most respected vocation. Under these circumstances, a Western education became the magic symbol of social prestige, and the Chinese youth considered schooling in one of the Western countries as the foremost goal of their ambition. So they set out, amidst hope and inexperience, on what proved to be a long and devious journey, leading some of them eventually to a lasting residence in America. To say that Chinese scholars in America represent the kind of intellectual who rejects the traditional learning of China and finds a personal renaissance in the Western scientific and technological tradition does not penetrate very deeply into the actualities that seem to influence their mode of adjustment. Each Chinese scholar who discusses his experience in America has a vested interest in expressing satisfaction and pride in his education. When he says, « I started out in my intellectual career as an idealist but learned from the American system that I’d better be a pragmatist », it is like saying, « I have discovered an entirely new type of learning ». At the same time, my own years in America have led me to believe that identification with Western scholarship does not necessarily give a person high esteem in the eyes of his colleagues, not does adherence 56 [pageend58]to Chinese classics impress others as being profound. Rather, these opposing tendencies represent stages in a process which is slow and subtle even for the sharpest minds — to find one’s way into a system of thought. The best way to understand the American experience of Chinese scholars is to contrast those who came before World War II with those who came after. The former came to this country mainly on that indemnity money which the American government, following the Boxer Rebellion at the end of the last century, made available for the education of Chinese students abroad. Because of the general awakening of the intellectual class after the shame of being defeated by the West and because of the age-old system of awards, those whom the Chinese government chose for further education in America were generally bright and dedicated. They were selected by the scholar-bureaucrats of China as men of promise and purpose and sent out on a mission — to learn the Western political and economic system, bring their new learning back to the home country and reform the old system that prevailed there. Those who were selected for this mission had the goal of changing the intellectual traditions of China, but at the same time, they were like the other scholars of the country and closely adhered to the traditions of the old order. Their dilemma was aggravated by the fact that the ruling bureaucracy, too, was pulled both by the desire to change and the will to persist. Such a situation naturally limited their American experience. For all the talk about the conversion of the earlier Chinese scholars in America to Western ideals and about their role as intellectual agents in Chinese society, their conversion seems to have been rather superficial. The newly acquired ideas and values did not, as a rule, penetrate their daily lives, and the Western sentiments could not filter through the intimate network of their social relationships. Both to their American roommates 57 [pageend59]at Columbia, Harvard, and Michigan and to their Chinese kin and associates, the American-educated Chinese remained basically Chinese. In the course of a few years in America they did all they could to learn the science, logic, mathematics, rhetoric, social and political thought of the West. Then, having completed their education, they returned to China and eventually assumed political and social responsibilities. Their impact was great. By creating their own newspapers and magazines, they introduced the Chinese to the writings of Oscar Wilde and Ezra Pound and to the political philosophies of Jefferson and Lincoln as well; at the same time, they introduced the West to the works of ancient China translated into English. The vernacular language and literature movement, highlighted later by the Chinese Renaissance of 1919, was led largely by Chinese students in America, of whom Hu Shih has been the moving spirit. Persuading the Chinese public to accept the new views was a painfully frustrating experience, bound to create tensions. Thus a measure of tension developed between the scholar who returned from America and those who adhered to the old traditions. Further tensions developed within the American-educated elite class, the majority of which followed the traditional career and entered governmental service. For them, the reward of gaining public offices and the prestige accompanying their positions offset the feeling of frustration; these people came to identify themselves with the destiny of the society and consider themselves the guardians of tradition. But those American-educated scholars who for some reason did not take positions in the government became alienated, powerless and self-estranged. Serious though they seemed to be, the purpose of their activities, for better or worse, gradually became centered upon intellectual creativity as an end in itself. 58 [pageend60]What has been said so far is intended to demonstrate that, except for a very few, the Chinese scholars entered into intellectual life neither from a really deep desire to pursue scientific endeavors, nor from a commitment to sustain and transmit the complex traditions of the free intellectuals. Rather, they saw themselves as the guardians of the moral fabric of society and as the custodians of a vast administrative machinery. In this sense they were politicians and bureaucrats. We probably will never know what personal motives moved those Chinese scholars who elected to remain in America; it is possible that a large number of them did so in spite of themselves. In any case, it seems to me, we can distinguish three types among them. The first consists of those who, because of their former political affiliations, could find suitable positions in neither the Nationalist nor the Communist government and established their existence in America as lecturers and writers. Ironically enough, their fortunes greatly changed with the collapse of the Nationalist regime on the mainland. This was the time when many famous research and graduate centers in America initiated China-area studies, offering new opportunities to those who were versatile in such problems. The Chinese scholar of this type required, perhaps, a few months of hard work to refresh his knowledge and brush up his academic routine that he had learned during the thirties at Michigan or Harvard; with that, he became a Chinese specialist within the academic setting, a scholar in a fast-growing, timely field. Thus, their primary reason for staying in America has been more political and familial than economical. They have been appropriately described by Paul Siu as sojourners whose adjustment to America is never quite complete because, in order to capitalize on their background as a professional qualification, they wish people to think of them as being totally Chinese. 59 [pageend61]The second type consists of those who, because of similar reasons, took up work in an international field such as missionary work or cross-cultural communication of ideas. In order to perform their duties effectively, it is imperative that they have a certain professional commitment to the standard of their work. Accordingly, intellectual endeavor is to them only a prerequisite necessary for doing their work well; their real aim lies in their commitment to social and economic action. They find it neither essential nor beneficial to take the role of a Chinese in their public and professional life, although by doing so they add the color of liberal internationalism to the institution to which they belong. Their behavioral model lies not with their Chinese identity, nor with the intellectual community, but with the spirit of internationalism which their institution fosters. The third group consists of those who, having neither the experience of the first group nor the purposes of the second, find an alternative symbol of success : money. Their educational preparation had not given them skills in demand by the host society that would have insured them a more or less stable place in the professions. For those who lacked such skills there was an abundance of business opportunities promising success. One cannot help but notice, especially in the large seaboard cities of America, the number of Chinese scholars who have become entrepreneurial-minded. The diversification of their talents and business activities may be equalled only by the Chinese in Southeast Asia. These scholars-turned-businessmen found their newly acquired wealth less helpful in making a social success than, say, immigrants from Europe did, The competitive structure of the American business system inevitably molded their temperaments and sharpened up their shrewd, business-like approach to life. Beneath the skin, 60 [pageend62]however, they preserved the typical traits of the Chinese — a certain clannishness and a syetem of values that is anything but Puritanical. Since during their younger years in academic circles, they have acquired a special respect for scholarship and the fine arts, they occasionally attempt to compose poetry or write an essay for Chinese magazines. In addition, most of their acquaintances are still in the circle of Chinese scholars and the strong ties with their ivy tower peers continue to bring them back to the group of people with whom this paper is concerned. Suddenly, after World War II, a new kind of Chinese scholar began to arrive in the United States. They were mainly young men who apparently came for an advanced degree in a major graduate school of the country. Were they graduate students in spite of themselves ? Prior to 1953, at which time the Refugee Relief Act enabled many students from mainland China to become residents of the United States, the uncertainty of the State Department’s policy concerning the status of Chinese students and refugees compelled most of these young men to stay in school. As they continued to take a full load of graduate courses, many suddenly found themselves being named to candidacy for a Ph. D. degree; all that was left to be done was to write up the results of a project on which they had already spent a number of years. In 1955, when visiting a big Midwestern state university, I was told about one advanced course in the engineering department where the enrollment consisted of seven Chinese and one American, and the professor reportedly stated in the classroom that his excursion into Chinatown was most exciting. Several years later, Professor Philip M. Hauser of the University of Chicago said that, among 17 students in one of his advanced seminars, 15 were Asian and two were Americans so that the latter were dubbed as « poor foreigners ». 61 [pageend63]Graduate students are a small minority in the campus population of the country. Among the Chinese students in America, however, the reverse is true, mainly because their majority had already completed undergraduate work in the Far East before they came to the United States. Once here, they set their goals at the Master’s level, but, after one or two years in school, the Ph. D. degree seemed to be within their easy reach, and the continuation of their education became a matter of course rather than a matter of scholarly commitment. In the United States there were many job opportunities such as are not available in the Far East; but in order to stay in the United States, the young Chinese needed a certificate of full-time student status. If he happened to be in a field where there were numerous graduate fellowships, he could easily combine work and study; if his field was less fortunate, he could look for employment outside the campus. And so the Chinese student was able to establish an existence for himself which was penurious but not void of its pleasures and satisfactions. Within the confines of the campus and following the standard of living of the graduate students, he could live on $ 50.00 a week, support a wife and a child, drive a used car, much the same way as the other families in the graduate students’ housing quarters did. He could even indulge in increasing his comfort and buying the couch of his neighbor who had graduated and was leaving to take a job. His sense of deprivation was offset by a vision of the future full of untold opportunities. A siege of flu, a burnt-out clutch, or an unexpected expense would not precipitate a mental crisis, but rather helped to assimilate him into the American way of life. He now began to share the anxiety, hope and rhythm of life of the other graduate students; typing papers while their wives fed the baby; paying the automobile 62 [pageend64]repair bill in monthly instalments; and eating hamburgers as the regular diet. The rhythm of the academic semester helped him along, and the vacations gave him a chance to regroup his forces and retreat with his family for a stretch of relatively relaxed living. Then, too, there were other students from the Far East who would visit and share the meals of native cuisine. The written quarterly and monthly reports required by the immigration authorities were now routine matters. The Chinese student’s goal was, by this time, clear and well- defined — to complete his thesis, find a job and become a part of the great American dream. I have sketched the career of the Chinese scholars according to the time of their immigration, but time is by no means the only factor that helps to explain their problem. An equally important factor is the attitude that the Chinese scholar takes towards himself — his selfconception and identification with people and ideas. If he identifies himself with the bureaucratic structure of old China, his present problem in America is to justify himself in light of the new political regime. His work in scholarship becomes much like the work of a lawyer who meticulously prepares his case by presenting more and more evidence to support his position and seldom, if ever, entertains alternative arguments. His work becomes, rather than an original creation, a series of critiques of the present and, as it happens more frequently, of the past. He may do painstaking work in search of information to strengthen his argument; he may uncover new material and develop new concepts. But his desire to follow the intellectual tradition of the West by accepting and analyzing contradicting views is usually subordinated to his original commitment and conviction. If he wishes to identify himself with the intellectual class in America, his main problem is to bridge the 63 [pageend65]eternal gap between the Chinese and. the Western traditions of scholarship. During his education to become a scholar he bypassed that area of learning which constitutes the core of the Western intellectual heritage and later in life he is not likely to make up for what he missed. While his American colleagues show a natural versatility in the Western classics, appropriately quoting Plato, Shakespeare and Freud, his contribution to the cocktail party conversation is often limited to a presentation of Mencius’ view of human nature; and this is usually all that his colleagues expect of him. Whether he likes it or not, he is, in the daily routine of his work and in the daily presentation of his self, forced into the role of being a Chinese scholar, with the accent on « Chinese » rather than « scholar ». After all, he can never entirely hide his Mongoloid racial traits and can hardly obscure his cultural and ethnic identity. But in a world oriented toward scientific and technological achievement, he can stress the technical competence of his scholarship and expect prestige and success as due rewards. It is therefore understandable that his desire to identify himself with the impersonal, sometimes rigid, demands of his profession is stronger than that of his American colleagues. The recent tendency among Chinese scholars to pursue their careers in the pure and natural sciences as well as in engineering can be explained by their search for a goal, in which they can find the gratification of equal achievements with their American colleagues. The criteria used to evaluate achievement in the precise sciences are more concrete and objective than anywhere else. Anxious for security and pushed by the desire to stay in America, the Chinese scholar is necessarily drawn towards research work where procedure weighs more than information, where irrelevancy can be disguised by logical arguments, and where a some64 [pageend66]times deceptive elegance brings startling new order to the disturbing chaos of raw-sense experiences. In 1960, a publication listing the doctoral theses submitted by Chinese scholars in American universities showed that the dissertations completed prior to World War II were mainly in the humanities and social sciences, while those completed aftèr the last war were, in their overwhelming majority, in science, engineering and life sciences. Kung in a more recent volume, Chinese in American Life, reports that of about twelve hundred Chinese faculty members in American universities and colleges, more than seventy per cent are in physical and natural sciences, including medicine, agricultural sciences, and engineering. On the other hand, the combined total in the humanities and social sciences comprises only about twenty per cent of the whole. The remainder is distributed among education, business administration, music, etc. My argument is not the point that Chinese -scholars are oriented towards technical and instrumental fields of scholarship rather than towards normative and socio- emotional disciplines of which the social sciences and humanities are a part. True enough, even among those Chinese scholars who engage in social sciences, the tendency is to identify with empirical research rather than with speculative and historical methods. My argument is that the difference between those who engage in pure and natural sciences and those who are in humanities and social sciences seems to lie in the individual’s perception of his opportunity as. a Chinese scholar in the professional job market. Most of those who are engaged in humanities" and social sciences are given teaching assignments in fields dealing with Chinese or other non-Western cultures. Whether this trend has come about by design or by chance, such academic specialization always seems to reflect the individual’s 65 [pageend67]Chinese origin rather than his scholarly competence. Therefore, I argue, one latent but important reason for entering careers in science and engineering is to avoid the stigma of being a Chinese scholar. Intellectual recognition in itself is not enough to satisfy a person’s social and emotional needs. The integration process always has a non-professional dimension also which poses its own problems. The majority of Chinese scholars are still more at home with their former compatriots. Their cultural and racial identity delimits the invisible enclave within which their activities are carried on. Those who came with their families, of course, have problems quite different from those who came single. The latter are exposed to the whole complex of a previously unexperienced dating and courtship routine of the West. A single man must learn how to lead a life in a metropolitan center in which he is viewed and treated as an alien and a Chinaman. His professional and technical competency does not greatly improve his bargaining position in the fiercely competitive dating market. He can improve his appearance with the aid of tailored suits and the devices of the national toiletry industry. He may attain a superior earning power; yet, in spite of all these, his field for hunting a mate is small for two reasons. First, there is the racial difference, which in some states of the country presents a legal problem. Secondly, his academic background and occupational life limit his range of choice to the college-educated members of the opposite sex. The social pressures to get married and settle down to family life are just as strong on the young Chinese than on any young American, but the chances are not the same. The young Chinese has poorer chances right at the beginning and as he grows older, the chances constantly decrease. Eventually, he becomes less discriminate in his choice and, if he ever marries, his decision is likely to be motivated by reason rather than by 66 [pageend68]romantic love. There are some interesting data hidden in the Annual Report of the American Immigration and Naturalization Service suggesting that the alien Chinese married American citizens more often as a means of obtaining legal residence in America than as a means of satisfying their personal need- for companionship and love. The Report shows that marriages between Chinese immigrants and U. S. citizens increased from nearly zero in 1946 to 195 in 1948, the year when the Communists began their conquest of mainland China. By 1949, the number rose to 235, and in 1952 to 490. But after the Emergency Refugee Act of 1953 permitted the entry of Chinese refugees to America, the number of Chinese marrying U. S. citizens plummeted to 158 in 1954, even though the group of marriageable males had increased since 1948. But let us not attribute more wisdom to statistical data than they really have. The question that I often ask myself is beyond statistics : What are the implications of being a Chinese in these United States ? To this, the old stereotype of the Confucian scholar gives a wrong answer indeed. It might be true, as it is often eaid, that the Chinese student comes to this country with his basic character set like a plaster and, however anxious he is to become Americanized, he remains a Chinese. But the inevitable course of his life must be determined by his professional identity also which gives his existence an additional meaning. As a professional, being exploited by the competitive nature of his academic job and subjected to emotional dislocations by his pride and sense of shame, success and failure, he comes to compromise with the idea that the deeper questions of personal purpose are not worth pondering. As his career proceeds, he becomes more narrowly respectable in his style of life and level of intellectual exercise, he experiences the melting pot of America and fits himself into an intellectual community. Then it 67 [pageend69]does not matter any more whether he still possesses a capacity for worldly salvation, a grasp of the time and the culture to which he once belonged. After all, it might be that the Confucian scholar has never been unearthly and inscrutable, or there are no Confusian scholars in present-day America. And again, it might be that America is inscrutable and modern life imposes upon lis many more problems than the human mind can solve. SIEGFRIED WENZEL CONFRONTATION IN THE ENGLISH DEPARTMENT To write about the immigrant scholar who works in the field of English literature is to write about very small numbers indeed. In contrast to specialists in modem languages or in comparative literature, very few foreign-born professors of English have—during the past three decades or so—found their, way into American universities. The reason for this is obvious : one does not usually go to a foreign country to teach the correct use of its language or the wealth of its literary inheritance. Yet there has been, in the past, a thin line of men born and sometimes fully educated in Europe who came to America to leave their stamp on the study of English. Frederick Klaeber (1863-1954), 68 [pageend70]for example,- whose edition of Beowulf has been at one time or another in the hands of every graduate student in English, was born in Prussia and studied at German universities. After receiving the Ph. D. from Berlin he accepted an offer to teach in the English Department at the University of Minnesota, where he worked in voluntary seclusion until his retirement. Another foreign-born scholar who has devoted his life to English linguistics is Hans Kurath, well known for his work on the Linguistic Atlas of North America and the new Middle English Dictionary. He was born in Austria but came to America as a child and received his university training here. Such cases, however, are isolated and yield far too little material for generalizing statements. In addition, immigrant scholars who work in this particular field have come to America from such variegated backgrounds, at such differing stages of their intellectual development, and for so many diverse reasons, that it becomes almost worthless to speak of them as a group. It seems to me much more fruitful to reflect, simply and humbly, on personal experience, With the awareness that the following remarks may not at all apply to fellow immigrants. To do so, however, appears to this writer as a rather embarrassing task. He is not experiencing his present life as a constant confrontation between himself and America. He is not acutely conscious of living in a foreign country whose peculiarities and mores he has to observe, judge, assimilate, or reject at every second of his waking hours. This may not make him a very good representative of the Immigrant Intellectual in America. On the other hand, it may be worthwhile meditating upon the causes of this state of affairs—subjective as well as objective— in order to elucidate what it has meant, in this particular case, to work as an immigrant scholar in the field of English literature. 69 [pageend71]The writer was born in Germany, where he passed through the normal pre-war primary and secondary school curriculum and had, after the war, a brief glimpse of the intellectual work at a university in Western Germany. He then followed his parents to South America, a step taken not for political but strictly economic reasons. There he undertook the normal four years’ work of university study in English and German languages and literatures, preparing himself for a teaching position in a high school and, eventually, at the university. Good fortune brought him a scholarship for further study at a small state university in the American Middle West, and from there he progressed to a Ph. D. in English at one of America’s mammoth state universities. Scholarly. pursuits had alway been his secret longing, and with the encouragement and help of kind teachers and friends he finally decided to stay. To him, an American university furnishes the best environment he needs to fulfil what he deems his life work : research and teaching. His background is, thus, more complex than that of the average immigrant. Successive adaptation to not one but two foreign cultures and the fact that he is. not strictly a refugee or an exile are perhaps the primary reasons why he is not experiencing a split between himself as immigrant and America. Other reasons can be sought in the reality which has confronted him ever since he came to America, a reality which has made adaptation a fairly easy and quick process. There is, first of all, the very great generosity with which Americans have received and welcomed the foreign intellectual, a generosity which by now is almost proverbial. It shows itself in many forms. On the level of the half-educa ted, it has brought crowds of eager women in search of culture ot the feet of well-paid travelling lectures and litterateurs, whose pronouncements they swallow with charming, if naive. 70 [pageend72]enthusiasm. But this phenomenon is not restricted to America, and it is hardly relevant here, were it not that one often meets the same enthusiasm on a higher level within the university world. There is a widespread willingness among college teachers who have not had much direct contact with foreign-born colleagues to grant them an a priori superiority in mental capacity, a wider range of information, a vaster possession of what is conveniently called « background ». Not that the average European high school does not provide its pupils with a wider and more thorough training in solid disciplines than the average American secondary school; this is a commonplace that hardly needs repetition. But the commonplace has apparently, through long reiteration, sunk into the subconscious and there created an unexamined attitude of admiration and sometimes even awe. It is an occasionally embarrassing state of affairs, because (although I imagine that there may be foreign intellectuals who thrive on deftly handled namesdropping and the production of splendo- rous generalities that impose by their vastness rather than by profundity) in general one prefers being appreciated for what one is, rather than for seeming to represent Universal Culture or some such pomposity. The danger of being mistaken in this way, however, is minimal in the genuinely scholarly world. The immigrant who is fortunate enough to live in an academic community is unlikely to be made the idol of misplaced hero worship. In a world where scepticism is one of the first working rules there is very little chance for the fake to pass unexposed. It is true that almost every campus has its legends about immigrant teachers— usually in the foreign language divisions—who came in the early deacdes of this century and have turned into figures of mirth for their students as well as their colleagues. Their linguistic slips or downright inadequacies, their ignorance of American ways or plain 71 [pageend73]professional incompetence, lightened by charming touches of eccentricity, provide innumerable anecdotes for the coffee break or after dinner talk. But everyone realizies that their academic merit lay only in speaking German or French as natives, while nobody ever took them seriously as scholars. « Characters » of this order can hardly subsist in a self-respecting English department, where mastery of a foreign language is only a secondary asset and where professional competence has to prove itself against a strong and keen competition. In addition to the absence of hero worship, there is another « objective » reason why I am not aware of an opposition between immigrant and American environment. The scholar, especially if he works in the humanities, is trained to be at home in a variety of spiritual worlds other than his hic et nunc. If he had a good education in English literature, for example, he will have received some of the « feel » of a Germanic mead hall or an eighteenth-century London coffee house. He will be able to visualize and imaginatively live on the road to Canterbury in the 1380’s, peep into a Victorian blackening factory, or roam the woods at Walden Pond. To re-create in his imagination worlds of the past that are utterly different from his own in manners, dress, language, beliefs, and customs, is an exercise on which a good deal of his professional activity—teaching as well as scholarship—rests. Indeed, to occupy oneself with a good novel, even with a single poem, usually means to penetrate into a world sui generis, and the better one can divest himself- from his own ego and the accidents of his library, the better will his understanding of the literary work be. A person whose imagination is thus trained to live in different worlds will find it comparatively easy, perhaps unessential, to live in a country which is not his native land. Of course, imagination and reality, literature and life, are not the same, and a scholar would make a pitiable fool of himself if he 72 [pageend74]equated his field of historical investigation or awork of art with the world of Coca-Cola vending machines. But somehow the conscientious research into fields that do not form part of one’s immediate surroundings prepares the immigrant scholar’s mind for a peculiar attitude to his new world. Whatever this attitude may precisely be, it is not one of selfconscious opposition. Rather, it is one of scientific curiosity with the scientist’s objectiveness replaced by sympathy. The literary scholar observes his concrete world, evaluates, and even criticizes it, but he will tend to do so with Coleridge’s « suspension of disbelief ». This attitude of detached interest is, again, a working rule he is expected to follow in research and criticism; but it may easily determine his way of experiencing the real life around him. One can therefore say that the literary scholar carries with him as an acquired habit a certain universality of outlook which makes it relatively easy for him to be at home in a variety of cultures. This universality has, moreover, a very concrete form for the immigrant. Scholarship today has such a strong international basis that an immigrant scholar need hardly ever feel isolated in a foreign environment. Every major university in America has on its staff a variety of foreign-born professors or research fellows. Visiting lecturers and exchange scholars come and go in unending succession. Frequent professional meetings bring together colleagues from all over the world : during the past year and a half, for example, Cambridge, Mass., and New York were the scenes of two international congresses of linguistics, modern languages and literatures. AU this creates an atmosphere in which the local habitat assumes only secondary importance. This universality of scholarship is of course nothing new—scholars have always wandered. Whether the fact that today many of them flit to and fro is a healthy situation for produc73 [pageend75]tive thought does not concern us here; but it certainly lessens the feeling that countries and cultures are aeons apart. This is all well and good, one might now object; the immigrant scholar who works in the field of literature does then not experience himself as a foreign body in the living organism of his academic world. But what about American society at large ? Surely he has to buy bread and milk at the Supermarket, face inanities at PTA meetings where decisions about the intellectual health of his children are being made, and talk the used- car salesman into giving him a good deal ? Is he not touched to the quick by the painful differences between his European background and values and those of the New World ? He is. But here the professor of English (and the same is true of other humanities) finds himself in a peculiar position, because his shocks and frustrations, his indignant repulsions are shared to the fullest by his native American colleagues and students. Antagonism against the destruction of individual values and liberty by a technocratic mass society is not the property of immigrants only; it is the common reaction among what is perhaps not quite correctly called « the intellectuals » in America. About ten years ago the French immigrant Henri Peyre, professor at Yale, spoke on « The Study of Literature » in a series of lectures about the European scholar in America. In the course of his essay he analyzed several deficiencies or fallacies in the American educational system which are most blatant to European professors, and finally made the suggestion that they « may be traced to the unconscious acceptance of two ideals by academic scholars and critics : the ideals of the businessman and of the scientist ». (Perhaps Henri Peyre should have written « the technician ».) From my experiences, however, I can only conclude that these 74 [pageend76]ideals have not been accepted at all, consciously or unconsciously, by my colleagues who teach English literature. On the contrary, there is a general opposition to the techniques of modern salesmanship and its prostitution of language; to the utilitarian approach to learning and knowledge; to administrative tendencies to replace originality and individuality by a well-lubricated organizational machine; to the conformity in values and tastes of the masses. Most young English instructors are at very great pains to awaken their students’ minds and sharpen their critical faculty. Criticism and satire of those dangers to individual freedom and creative thought have become fashionable : one has only to think of such best-sellers as The Hidden Persuaders, The Organization Man, and The Status Seekers. It even seems at times that American graduate students and young college teachers are actually less able than their foreign-born colleagues to take the threats of Madison Avenue or cybernetics with a grain of salt. The point, however, is that in this respect the immigrant scholar finds himself on a common front with his American fellow scholars in defense of values which are not exclusively those of his native patrie. The specific «: fallacies » which Henri Peyre analyzed in his essay are of course very real and cause much complaint from everyone concerned. Professor Peyre mentioned the general fondness for innovation, the requirement that scholars and teachers produce intensively, and the ubiquitous bad writing (by which he was primarily thinking of pseudoscientific jargon). Of the three, the second deserves a little closer attention. It is quite true that a heavy demand lies on all American scholars to publish—articles, books, lectures, addresses, anything that will go on the yearly departmental bibliography. The first-rate scholar who has been fortunate enough during his dissertation work to hit upon a mine of unexplored material will not be bothered by such 75 [pageend77]pressure. But his equally intelligent and sensitive friend whose subject simply needs a longer period of gestation is thereby driven into a frantic haste whose outcome can only be a premature or decidedly third-rate work. Again, it is not only the immigrant scholar who notices the evil; be probably suffers less under it than his American colleague. Once more he finds himself in league with a wide resentment against an unhealthy pressure, whether it comes from his departmental chairman, the university administration, or the abstract notion behind both that the faculty has to show « achievements » to the tax-paying public. In all these matters, then, the rift is not between immigrant scholar and American life, especially university life, but rather between teachers in the humanities and outside forces that do not share, or are perhaps hostile to, humanistic values. Nowhere is this rift more clearly defined than in the attitudes toward the ideals of education. It is perhaps presumptuous to speak of educational ideals in America. The school system is so diversified that one should not generalize. Aims and goals are, as is well known, decided upon individually by each separate unit : school districts, universities, the various groups of private schools, and so on. Yet the public schools do represent the largest sector of education, and they are staffed by a fairly homogeneous group of men and women—mostly women—who were trained in state teachers’ colleges and schools of education. If they received any « ideals » of education at all, those ideals seem to.be a series of the vaguest, too much repeated commonplaces. If they share one common goal, it is to make boys and girls into good citizens—the emphasis lies on the socializing function of public schools, not on imparting knowledge or developing thought or fostering creativity. This sociological outlook of contemporary educators is one of the barriers that alienate them deeply from 76 [pageend78]scholars and teachers in the humanities. Another is the noticeably lower scholastic standards held to in departments of education. They prove a considerable stumbling block to any education student who takes a course in another department, as well as to the teacher who has to deal with him. A third barrier is the abuse of the English language which one finds so frequently in textbooks and the technical literature on education. Clichés, meaningless strings of abstract nouns, unnecessary and ugly neologisms are all aspects of a language that frequently throws the mantle of glittering verbiage over the most ordinary triviality. For this lingo a generally accepted term has been found: educationalese, and college freshmen are warned against it by their English Composition instructors as a prime example of bad writing. AH this, I think, shows clearly enough the awareness on the part of, not just foreign scholars, but English departments in general, of the deficiencies in contemporary American education. There is a split in values, and a good deal of hidden, though well realized, scorn between the humanities and Schools of Education. If the immigrant scholar has little occasion for feeling alone and separated from his environment, then his convictions, his general intellectual outlook, scholarly productivity and effectiveness in the classroom can hardly be hampered by the fact of his having been born and educated abroad. It is of course essential that he master the language fairly well and that he have a cultivated sensitivity for the literature and poetry written in a foreign language. And even with regard to his mastery of the language it must be -pointed out how admirably tolerant and generous American colleges and students are, even to the point of being quite unreasonable.- Thus it has happened more than once that exchange students from Europe and the Far East with a totally insufficient command of English were employed to teach freshman science classes where the students 77 [pageend79]did their best to stick it ont rather than rise in protest. The great tolerance in accepting the foreign teacher without question becomes manifest to me at the beginning of every semester when after a week of class meetings no more than two or three smart students come up to inquire about my origins, because my accent does not sound quite American to them. Beyond this brief inquiry there is never any further pertinent reaction. Equally I do not think that the fact of being an immigrant hampers scholarly productivity. A number of European scholars who came to America in the thirties expressed apprehension in this regard when they compared—perhaps somewhat nostalgically—the relative ease and leisure of a professor’s life in their native country with the hectic busyness here. I cannot judge the leisure at European universities before 1930; but it seems that today the Ordinarius for, let us say, Modern German Literature at Heidelberg or Gottingen has much less free time for research and scholarly writing than a professor of English or American literature does at one of the forty or fifty highest-ranking American universities. Similarly, editors of European learned journals are by no means as overwhelmingly flooded with articles submitted for publication as their colleagues in this country are. And I do not think there is a noticeable difference in the quality of published scholarly or critical papers. If there are, thus, very few negative factors that impede the fruitful activity of the foreign-born professor of English, does he, on his part, have anything positive to his profession for which he is better suited than his American colleague ? During the past thirty years immigrant scholars have contributed much to the various sectors of intellectual and academic life in America. The stimulus and methodological influence of a linguist like Roman Jakobson or of literary critics like Leo Spitzer and René Wellek have been far-reaching and, 78 [pageend80]although none of these men is or was working in an English department, have been felt by a large number of graduate students in. English. If I may be personal once more, I would like to point out, in the following, some larger directions in which I believe the immigrant scholar can make his most fruitful contribution, especially in a humanistic field like English literature. First, an insistence on serious learning and scholarship. The nineteenth-century German notion that language and literature, history, ; and even the fine arts should be studied as Wissenschaften is a most - fertile idea whose possibilities have as yet not been fully realized. I would by no means advocate a return to mere fact-gathering, to arid source study for its own sake, or to the biographical method as the only salutary way to the interpretation of a poem. What I would emphasize is the spirit of disciplined truth-seeking that infused the giant scholars of the past century. All too often one runs into graduate students and college professors who have chosen an academic career because their conception of it promised them a gentleman’s life of leisure pleasantly filled with aesthetic delights and sophisticated cocktail parties. Most of them, fortunately, drop out in time, but a few stay on to produce lectures and articles that drip with subjective impressions or sparkle with intellectual pyrotechnics in which scholarly methods or critical writing have become ends in themselves. In this respect America simply lacks a strong tradition of scholarship, an image of the scholar as a man who is passionately committed to truth and willing to sacrifice comforts and pleasures. Although a good many English scholars in this country fully represent this image in their lives and work, their influence on English studies and students at large has been rather small. The situation is even worse in regard to our primary and secondary education. Despite all the complaints 79 [pageend81]issued in the last decade, high-school students remain ill prepared for genuine university work. The nervous spasm that ran through the American school world on the occasion of Sputnik has given way to the former quiet and complacency. Apparently, nothing will ' be done by the high schools to replace courses in social behavior and safe driving with serious intellectual disciplines. The college professor therefore has to accept the fact that, by and large, truly higher education (in European terms) tends more and more to begin in graduate school. While there is nothing theoretically wrong in stretching out the formative process a few years, in practice the current situation does present a picture of wasted time and lost opportunities. For most normally gifted persons it is virtually impossible to acquire a genuine proficiency in two or three foreign languagès or to memorize lists of hard and dried historical dates after the age of twenty-five. Everyone agrees that without a ready grasp of concrete facts understanding is impossible, and a reading knowledge of foreign languages as well as a framework of the relevant past history is essential for the advanced study of literature. I must confess that I am often amazed at the chasm between the general ignorance of undergraduate students and the impressive knowledge of good graduates; it is only fair to the latter to praise the zeal and hard work with which they try to make up for past deficiencies. Nevertheless, the weaknesses of secondary education remain. As I have hinted earlier, these weaknesses derive largely from an overémphásis in current American educational thought on the socializing aspect of education, on the goal of preparing good citizens. How to get along with one’s fellow men is so much' in the foreground of our educators’ attention that they have little time to consider how to get along with oneself— that part of life seems relegated mostly to the psychia80 [pageend82]trist’s couch. The danger in this more and more sociological approach to education is not so much that individual personalities are deformed and stunned in their growth, as that it prepares the way to the coming of a totalitarian society. Even in the alternative to totalitarianism which is so much discussed today, the pluralistic society, the individual figures merely as a member of a group. In this engulfing pressure of social forces to conform, the voices that would uphold the value of the human individual and cry out for the air needed to develop individual potentialities are few and rather powerless. Old-fashioned humanists are passed over as eggheads who are completely out of touch with reality; religion for most Americans means « good fellowship »; and the late attempt to protest against all this, the movement of the Beatniks (tellingly enough clothed in beards and sandals : the emblems of the true man of God), has been obviously too petty and odd from the start to produce any deep effects. Here the study of literature (including drama in its various forms, from the legitimate theater to TV) seems to be a most promising means to lead young minds to a consideration of what man is, and to compel them— gently yet persistently—to seek for an answer by themselves. This use of literature is not a new idea. The great poems written in the dawn of Western literature, the Iliad and the Odyssey, were used by the ancient Greeks for centuries as models of what a noble man is and does. If today we do not have a unique and universally binding ideal image of man, expressed either in theory or in literature, we can at least use the latter to enrich experience, to sharpen sensitivities, and to make students think. The role of the immigrant English professor in this undertaking is a humble one. Essentially he will find himself in league with a good many fellow teachers. 81 [pageend83]What he can contribute to the common effort is a broader outlook and a deeper personal experience, which might carry greater conviction. With his intimate knowledge of at least one foreign language he is at home in more than one culture and hence, unless he is intellectually blind or dishonest, immune to any narrowminded nationalism. His approach to ideals and works will necessarily be more universal; he is more capable of taking Goethe and Schiller as well as Henry Adams and Walt Whitman cum grano salis. This universality has, further, not only an international but also a historical dimension. Literary scholars in general still share a familiarity with the tastes, beliefs, and sentiments of past ages, despite the tendency in some English departments to allow their graduate students an early specialization in contemporary American or British literature. By and large, the Ph. D. in English is still less a-historically-minded than intellectuals in other disciplines. But the immigrant scholar has a clear advantage over them all in so far as he spent his formative years in a world where the past survives. It is often said that European children grow up among the physical remains of the Middle Ages, if not of ancient Greece and Rome. In the case of an intellectually alert adolescent, however, traditions survive and are imbibed—as it were, by osmosis—in much subtler forms. Not only do castles and cathedrals reflect a dead past to him, but in institutions, folk customs, and richly diversified societies that have not gone through the melting pot the past continues to live. To a well-educated European, Attic democracy and scholasticism, Virgil and St. Augustine, Manicheism and Rousseau, the Reformation and monastic culture, are not so many names and abstractions, but types of human experience which form part of his cultural inheritance and, in very curious ways, truly part of himself. 82 [pageend84]In utilizing and handing on this living experience of mankind’s past, I believe, lies the greatest possible contribution the immigrant scholar can make. By this I do not of course mean the nostalgie praise of bygone Golden Ages or the withdrawal into an ivory tower of antiquarian ism. We all have to face the present and occasionally think of the future. But to do so with an awareness that Man began to live, love, make mistakes, and think about these experiences many centuries before 1776, may be a great help in finding one’s way in an age that demands new answers. Let me mention, by way of example, one contemporary problem of very wide scope in whose solution such an awareness may be practical consequence. Political theorists seem to be agreed that in the near future some kind of world government will emerge in which the presently hostile power blocks will be carefully balanced and will, so it is hoped, peacefully coexist. Exactly what such an organization will look like and how it can be achieved, we do not know. The political experience of recent years, however, has made it evident that simply pouring out monetary aid to underprivileged countries or bestowing, with self-applauding airs, a democratic government on nations that are not yet ready for it, entail failure. More than that is needed : understanding primarily, and an appreciation of the idiosyncrasies, the historical achievement, the culture of other nations. To foster such attitudes is a task wherein no one could be more effective than a person in whom historical knowledge and objectivity are combined with direct personal experience of different cultures. While it would be facetious to consider himself as another Jonah or as a modern parallel to the Greek scholars who, after 1451, carried Antiquity to the West, the immigrant scholar of our days realizes that his peculiar situation offers him opportunities and even challenges to make a contribution of his very own. 83 [pageend85]JULIUS REZLER FROM ACADEMICIAN TO POLICY MAKER We all have a mental picture oí the immigrant as an outsider or a stranger who somewhat timidly progresses towards becoming assimilated into the culture of his new homeland. The picture represents him as an apolitical man, unready to play a role in the public life of his new country and not expected to do so. What he is expected to do after his arrival is to mobilize all his energies for establishing and adjusting himself in the new culture. Only after making a place for himself in the new economy and getting acquainted with the new environment, is he supposed to consider some political activity, probably in the local area and perhaps within his own group. This image, still common among us, evidently refers to the past when it must have been true. Speaking of former decades, a sharp observer of the American scene concluded, « Even had the immigrants been inclined to political activity, they would have found it difficult... At first, their rising generation found little real identification with either of the major parties. In exchange for a favor or a two-dollar bill the newly naturalized worker would vote the way the political machine instructed. » (1) (1) Samuel LUBELL, The Future of American. Politics, New York : Harper, 1951, p. 37. 84 [pageend86]Recent events in American polities, however, demand that this old conception of the immigrant be sharply revised. Since the time of World War II a few immigrant scholars have exerted a profound influence on the national policy of the United States, and may, indeed, have changed the course of American history. These scholars became involved in polities almost as soon as they landed; their activities were greatly encouraged by native political leaders; and they made their contribution, whatever it was, on an individual basis. They differed in almost every respect from the old type of immigrant. In the early thirties, due to the political upheavals in the countries of Central and Southeast Europe, the social composition of the immigrants radically changed. As a consequence of political and religious persecution by Fascism, Nazism and Communism, a great number of scholars, teachers, and other professionals left their native countries in order to escape the suppression of the ideas in which they believed or to avoid persecution and imprisonment. They arrived in the United States in three major waves. The first wave consisted of those fleeing Hitler’s Germany and the countries overrun by the Nazi armies. The second wave, much larger in numbers, began rolling right after the conclusion of World War II. Several elements made up this group : those who survived Nazi concentration comps; former citizens of the South-east European countries overrun by the Soviet army; and, as the most homogeneous group, more than a hundred German missile experts, who late in 1945 were transferred to the first rocket research center at Fort Bliss, Texas. The nucleus of this last group was made up of a small team, the former coworkers of Wernherr von Braun on the V-2 missile at Penemunde. The third and final wave of immigrant scholars came from Hungary after the Soviet suppression of the Hungarian revolution in 1956. 85 [pageend87]Only scanty data are available on the number of scholars coming to the United States. According to the records of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 11,000 natural scientists were admitted to the United States from all parts of the world in the years between 1949 and 1961. (2) To this figure, however, one has to add the unknown number of representatives of other disciplines such as the humanities, the arts, and the social and political sciences — a number that might be several times larger than the previously mentioned one. Representatives from two intellectual disciplines — natural scientists, particularly physicists and chemists, and political scientists — were mainly called upon to participate in American politics. Their involvement in politics can be explained by the existence of some national needs which were created by Word War II and the Cold War — and which these scholars, by their talent and previous experience, were not only eminently suited, but also ready and willing, to satisfy. Foremost of those needs was the development of a revolutionary weapons system without which the United States could not have preserved its independence, freedom, and status as a world power against the agressively expanding Soviet Union. Ever since the first years of World War II, immigrant physicists and chemists, primariliy because of their dedication to basic research, have been playing a decisive role in the development of the major weapon systems, the mainstay of American defense. It was the good fortune of the United States that, in time of national emergency, the talents and knowledge of such leading European scientists as the German-born Einstein and Bethe, the Hungarian-born Teller, Szilard, Wigner and von Neuman, the Italian (2) U.S. National Science Foundation, Scientific Manpower from Abroad, Washington, D.C., 1962. 86 [pageend88]Fermi and the Danish Bohr became available to this country. The immigrant political scientists were called upon to satisfy another national need, the formulation of new concepts of a successful foreign policy in the Cold War. Up to this time there had been a remarkable lack of long-term concepts in American foreign and defense policy. For the greater part of its history, America had been separated from the other parts of the world partly by the oceans and partly by the traditional attitude of isolationism which viewed any intervention in foreign affairs as a temporary evil. As the events during and after World War I aptly illustrate, the United States, after solving a particular problem of international policy, always retreated to its splendid isolation. Henry Kissinger, an astute analyst of foreign policy in the nuclear age, has pointed out that certain features of the American psyche were responsible for this situation. « Foremost among the attitudes which affect the making of our policy, » he reasoned, « is American empiricism and its quest for certainty... Empiricism in foreign policy leads to a penchant for ad hoc solutions. The rejection of dogmatism inclines our policy-makers to postpone committing themselves until all facts are in; but by the time the facts are in, a crisis has usually developed or an opportunity has passed. Our policy is, therefore, geared to dealing with emergencies; it finds difficulty in developing the long-range program that might forestall them. » The lack of a « tragic experience » is another factor in the apparent difficulty of the United States in formulating foreign-policy concepts. « The American domestic experience exhibits an unparalleled success... It is no wonder, therefore, that to many of our most responsible men the warnings of 87 [pageend89]impending peril or of imminent disaster sound like the Cassandra cries of abstracted ’’eggheads. » (3) For such reasons it has become the task of immigrant political scientists to make up for certain deficiencies in their American colleagues and to assist them in developing political strategies for the Cold War, a task for which they were well qualified by their background and experience. They came from Europe, the scene of power politics for centuries, and the study of the intricate power relations of the European states enabled them to offer a frame of reference which could be applied to the American situation. The emergence of the Soviet Union as a world power created further need for political scientists intimately familiar with the Soviet scene. Up to the late fifties, only a limited number of native-born American political scientists understood the Russian language sufficiently to permit them to study the primary sources of information concerning Communist society, and hardly anybody had the opportunity for an on-the-scene-observa- tion of Soviet countries. The vacuum created by the lack of American experts was filled by immigrant scholars who were born in Russia or had lived under Soviet rule. In the first decade of the Cold War the American government in formulating its strategy relied on the knowledge furnished by the foreign-born Soviet experts such as Abram Bergson, Alex Erlich, David Granick, Gregory Grossman, Naum Jasny, Lazar Volin. Naturally it was unavoidable that, in the course of evaluating Soviet policies and conditions, the immigrant experts would inadvertently influence American policy makers by their own value judgments and attitudes toward the Soviet regime. (3) Henry A. KISSINGER, Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy, New York : Harper, 1957, pp. 424, 426. 88 [pageend90]The national needs, as they emerged, required important contributions from immigrant scholars. Should it be taken for granted that these scholars were under obligation to render whatever services were requested of them ? Most of them felt definitely obliged to cooperate with American authorities, and their extraordinary efforts, especially on the part of the atomic physicists, were primarily due to their identification with the United States. They were not only grateful for the hospitality and opportunities received, but they also accepted, to a great extent, the values of American society, notably those of freedom and democracy. They also were motivated by their desire to develop science, learn its secrets, and extend the boundaries of knowledge. As Edward Teller put it, « The duty of scientists is to explore and explain. This duty led to the invention of the principles that made the hydrogen bomb a practical reality. » (4) The overwhelming desire to explore the unknown may explain the apparent contradiction that atomic physicists with pacifist priniples did participate in the development of the A-bomb. Besides the call of duty, the immigrant scientists were led by other motives, such as their desire to « get even » with the oppressive regimes that had forced them to leave their former countries. This was one of the reasons for Einstein and Szilard writing their famous letter to President Roosevelt about the necessity of producing the A-bomb. The political scientists from Southeast Europe were also eager to promote the liberation of their native countries from Soviet domination. The concrete contributions by which immigrant scholars directly or indirectly influenced American policy and public opinion, can be conveniently classified into three categories : the physical development of new (4) Edward TELLER (with Allen Brown), The Legacy of Hiroshima, New York : Doubleday, 1962, p. 56. 89 [pageend91]weapons systems; the advancement of principles concerning the acceptance, use, and testing of these systems; and, finally, the formulation of new concepts for American strategy in the Cold War. The most important single contribution to American security and survival that the immigrant scientists have made is their participation in the development of the three major weapons systems : the A-bomb, the H-bomb, and the various missiles. In the initial phase of developing the A-bomb, the basic scientific priciples for future production were established by Fermi, Bohr, Szilard, Rabi, et al. The solution of the technical problems which stood in the way of the production of the H-bomb were largely solved by Edward Teller. A group of German scientists should be credited with the experimental development of American rockets and missiles. Immigrant scientists did not, however, limit themselves to purely technical laboratory problems. They exerted a powerful influence on national policy decisions in connection with the acceptance, use, and testing of these weapons. In July, 1939, when the clouds of World War II were already gathering, Leo Szilard and Eugen Wigner visited Albert Einstein at his summer house. Szilard and Wigner, who at that time were physicists unknown outside the scientific community, recognized the potentials of the ongoing laboratory experiments which eventually led to the split of the atom and knew that those potentials could lead to developments which would affect the national security. At their urging, Einstein somewhat reluctantly informed President Roosevelt in a letter that « it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium, by which vast amounts of power... would be generated. Now it appears almost certain that this could be achieved in the immediate, future. This new phenomenon would lead to the construction 90 [pageend92]of bombs, and it is conceivable..., that extremely powerful bombs of a new type may thus be constructed » (5). Einstein had no more part in the development of the A-bomb, and later, as we are told, he was sorry even for the small role he had played. At a Nobel Prize anniversary dinner in December, 1945, he revealed some of his feelings on the matter : « Today, the physicists who participated in forging the most formidable and dangerous weapon of all times are harassed by an equal feeling of responsibility » (6). Soon afterwards Edward Teller carried the fight for another favorable government decision on developing and producing the hydrogen bomb. In 1949 the report of the General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Commission stated : « We all hope that by one means or another, the development of these weapons can be avoided. » It was a unanimous statement, reflecting the opinion of Robert Oppenheimer, the chairman of the committee. But Teller strongly felt that « the Russians would follow their development of a fission bomb with a success in fusion, » and turned to Senator McMahon, chairman of the Atomic Energy Committee of the Congress, urging him that « it is vital to the nation’s defense that we proceed with the thermonuclear work » (7). After the intervention of McMahon and Lewis Strauss, President Truman overrode the negative recommendation of the Advisory Committee and ordered the development of the H-bomb. For this political-scientific role, Teller was rightly named the « Father of the H-bomb ». Once the nuclear bombs were developed and the scientists realized the true consequence of their work, (5) E. TELLER, The Legacy of Hiroshima, pp. 10-1L (6) Peter MICHELMORE, Einstein ; Profile of the Man, New York : Dodd, Mead, 1962, pp. 233-34. (7) E. TELLER, The Legacy of Hiroshima, pp. 4244. 91 [pageend93]they felt a strong responsibility for their « brain-child » and did not hesitate to take a firm stand whenever a political controversy developed over the use and testing of nuclear weapons. The first argument over the use of the A-bomb developed near the end of World War II. Szilard took a strong stand against its use in the Japanese war. He drafted a petition, which was subsequently signed by 70 fellow scientists involved in the Manhattan Project, advising President Truman not to use the bomb « unless the terms which will be imposed upon Japan have been made public in detail and Japan knowing these terms, refused to surrender » (8). The petition never reached Truman, whose decision to drop the bomb over Hiroshima was supported by Enrico Fermi. To test or not to test has become another controversial question of national policy. It has been a cornerstone of American foreign policy to seek a treaty limiting the testing of nuclear devices, assuming that such a test ban could be politically and scientifically controlled. Particularly, much attention has been paid to scientific methods of policing a prospective test ban, and therefore, governmental and congressional authorities have solicited with increasing frequency the expert opinion of scientists. Despite the large number of scientists participating in the hearings, panels, and symposia dealing with the problem of testing, the voices of Hans Bethe and Edward Teller have dominated the discussion, and now the controversy over testing has become a scientific and political dialogue between the two. Their argument centers around such basic questions as : Are there appropriate and foolproof scientific methods available to police an eventual test moratorium or ban? Would such a test ban treaty not arrest the development (8) Fletcher KNEBEL and C.W. BAILEY, «The Fight over the A-bomb,» Look, August 13, 1963, p. 22. 92 [pageend94]of American nuclear weapons and thereby freeze the United States in an inferior position against the Soviet Union? Can the reliability and good intentions of the Soviet Union be assumed? On the question of policing a test ban agreement, Bethe recommended the acceptance of a system of seizmographie stations located in the Soviet Union to detect underground tests. As he stated succinctly, « there are a number, actually a large number, of very good methods to improve the system » of inspection (9). Teller was adamant in his arguments against the reliability of scientific inspection methods. In his words, « If the Russians want to perform systematic clandestine tests they can do so » (10). The fact that underground testing was excepted from the test ban treaty signed in July Í963 seems to indicate that the American government accepted Teller’s views concerning the undetectability of such tests. As to the second issue, Bethe was convinced that a test ban treaty would be more advantageous to the United States than to the Soviet Union. He reasoned that « further testing by both sides would bring the Russian capability closer and closer to ours. If we stop nuclear testing now we may keep at least the little bit of military advantage in nuclear weapons that we still possess at the present time » (11). In contrast, Teller strongly advocated the continuation of all types of testing because he believed that « the Russians are developing their war machinery faster than we are. (9) Earl H. VOSS, Nuclear Ambush, Chicago : Regnery, 1963, P. 151. (10) Hans A. BETHE and Edward TELLER, The Future of Nuclear Tests, New York : Foreign Relations Association, 1961, p. 53. (11) BETHE and TELLER, The Future of Nuclear Tests, pp. 34-5. 93 [pageend95]If both of us would stop nuclear testing, then there is no doubt that through espionage they would find out sooner or later what we know, and then we would have lost our last advantage » (12). Accordingly, when concluding his testimony before a congressional committee on the recently signed test ban treaty, Teller emphatically stated, « The treaty is not a step toward peace, but a step away from safety and maybe toward war. It weakens Ü. S. defense and invites attack » (13). On the issue of Soviet reliability, Bethe was convinced that the Russians did not want to violate the test ban treaty : « I believe that they are sincere in wanting the nuclear test cessation agreement and do not intend to cheat on it. » Teller, on the other hand, made no secret of his deep distrust of Soviet intentions and took a strong stand against a treaty which he believed could not be fully controlled : « If we enter into a treaty where the pretense is made that we can be checking, where there are really great loopholes and possibilities of evasion, then I feel that I must raise my voice as a scientist in protest » (14). The conflicting arguments of Bethe and Teller have been reverberating in the halls of Congress, the offices of the government, and the editorial rooms of the newspapers, and all over the country ; they have considerably influenced the public opinion of America. The recent signing of a test ban treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union appears to support Bethe’s contention, but the negative vote (12) U.S. Senate, A Subcommittee of the Committee on Foreign Relations. Hearings on Control and Reduction of Armor ments. 85th Congress, 2nd Session, 1958, p. 1463. (13) Quoted in U.S. News and World Report, September 2, 1963, p. 55.

Senators and the uneasy feelings of many Americans over the treaty indicate that Teller’s views are shared by a broad segment of the American public. Political scientists, unlike their colleagues in the field of natural sciences, have not developed revolutionary weapons for the arsenal of the United States. Instead, they have contributed to the defense of this country by creating new ideas, by calling attention to the deteriorating position of the United States in the international arena, by pointing out the major shortcomings of American defense and foreign policy, and by developing concepts for strategies in the Cold War. The foreign-born political scientists were genuinely appalled by what they regard as the indifference and optimism of the American public in the face of the declining international status of the United States. The Austrian-born Robert Strausz-Hupé and the former Austrian Stefan Possony, in a jointly edited study, remarked : « For several years, the United States and the Free World have steadily lost ground in the international struggle with Communism. If this process continues, it may, within the foreseeable future, become irreversible. » Nor could the German-born economist, Oscar Morgenstern, find more encouragement in the international situation : « Since the end of World War II the position of the United States has steadily deteriorated and is continuing to do so at increased speed. » (15) It is quite possible that these immigrant scholars have reacted to American over-optimism with over-pessimism. But on the basis of their past « tragic experience », they could not help but sense an approaching storm. In any case, they have not stopped by pointing to the dwindling (15) Robert STRAUSZ-HUPE, William R. KINTNER and Stefan T. POSSONY (eds.), A Forward Strategy for America, New York : Harper, 1961, p. IX; Oscar Morgenstern, The Question of National Defense, New York : Random House, 1959, pp. 9-10. 95 [pageend97]power of the United States, but have also offered some constructive criticisms and suggestions. Strausz-Hupé started out with the proposition : a The U. S. and its allies still lack the weapons, strategies and policies that could cope with fair assurance of success with situations calling for the measured use of force ». He blamed the « chronic apathy », « neutralist and pacifist tendencies », « psychological disarmament », and « irrational aberration from the traditional purpose of military power », all of which are prevalent tendencies in Western démocraties, as being responsible for this situation. He concluded that « America and her associates, their commitments to the cause of freedom notwithstanding, have failed to rally their moral and material strength sufficiently to enhance and extend freedom. » (16) His colleagues voiced similar opinions. Morgenstern noted a « distressing confusion » displayed by the American public in politics; Hungarian-born Stephen Ker- îflsz spoke of important structural defects in the foreign- policy machinery of the United States; and Polish-born Zbigniew Brzezinski named the « wild swings of public and press opinion » in reacting to Soviet actions as factors in the unsteady trend of our foreign policy. (17) The analysis of the United States’ deteriorating position in the Cold War and the realization of its causes led some immigrant political scientists to the conclusion that new strategies based on novel concepts are needed. The immigrant experts were unanimous in recommending the formulation of a conceptual framework for our actions. German-born Henry Kissinger repeatedly emphasized the need for a doctrine that would establish (16) R. STRAUSZ-HUPE et al., A Forward Srategy, pp. 9, 14, 407-8. (17) O. MORGENSTERN, The Question of National Defense, P. 4; Stephen D. KERTESZ, (ed.) American Diplomacy in a New Era, Notre-Dame : University of Notre-Dame Press, 1961, P. 10; U.S. News and World Report, September 30, 1963, p. 72. 96 [pageend98]a response the most likely challenges. « The nuclear age », he argued, « demands above all a clarification of a doctrine. Strategic doctrine transcends the problem of selecting weapons systems. It is a mode of survival of a society... It is the task of strategic doctrine to translate power into policy. » (18) Strausz-Hupé advocated that the United States should clearly set its strategic goals and « should steer clear of political objectives which it cannot achieve with appropriate military means. » The strategy of the Communist bloc, so he and his associates argue, is based on the concept of « protracted conflict », a name originally given by Mao-Tse-Tung in his classical book on Communist warfare. « The strategy of protracted conflict postpones the decisive battle and calibrates its challenges to a calculus of risk — until the balance of power has shifted overwhelmingly to the side of the revolutionary forces ». This objective the Communists achieve through « the constant shifting of the battleground, weapons systems and operational tactics for the purpose of confusing the opponent, keeping him off balance and wearing down his resistance. » (19) Morgenstern went a step further in drawing up a conceptual framework when he recognized that the Cold War resembles «a game of stet poker between the Kremlin and the Administration in Washington » where « bluffing is indespensable. » (20) One could add many more ideas produced by the fertile mind of immigrant scholars, such as strategic ( 18) H.A. KISSINGER, Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy, pp. 403, 7. (19) R. STRAUSZ-HUPE et, al., A Forward Strategy, p. 138; R. Strausz-Hupé et. al,, (eda) Protracted Conflict, New York : Harper, 1959, p. 2. (20) Oscar MORGENSTERN, «The Cold War is Cold Poker,» New York Times Magazine, February 5, 1961. 97 [pageend99]concepts for a hot war (Strausz-Hupé and Possony), massive retaliation and preventive war (Teller), a second striking force (Teller), guerilla warfare (Kissinger), and concepts to cope with other possibilities that may arise from an international stalemate or from foreign aggression. But it is, perhaps, unnecessary to point out the great variety of ideas on the theme of the Cold War that the immigrants discussed when there is a question of more practical consequence : What influence did these scholars exert ? Because of the secrecy which necessarily surrounds the strategic plans of the American government in the Cold War, it is difficult to assess in exact terms the impact of the immigrant scholars’ ideas and suggestions on American foreign and defense policy. At best, one has to resort to indirect methods to measure that impact. The influence of these scholars can be inferred, for example, from the frequency of their official and unofficial utterances, from the number of statements they have made before congressional committees, from their participation in official advisory bodies, from their appearances on radio and television and from their appearances in print as authors or subjects of books and articles. The majority of the scientists mentioned here have been, at one time or another, members cd governmental committees where, in an operative or consultative capacity, they may have influenced the decision making process of the American government. Enrico Fermi was one of the four members of the Scientific Advisory Panel which in 1945 advised President Roosevelt in the use of the atom bomb. After the war the General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission was the foremost consultative body of the American government in policies concerning atomic weapons and devices. In this eight-member body, Fermi and Rabi served up 98 [pageend100]to the early fifties; then Teller, Szilard, and von Neuman served as members. Hans Bethe was a member of the President’s Scientific Advisory Committee during the Eisenhower administration and also acted as member of the U. S. delegation at the Geneva conference on the cessation of nuclear tests. The immigrant scholars have exerted considerable influence on the members of the Congress in their frequent appearance before congressional committees. For example, Teller and Bethe dominated the hearings of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy of the Congress dealing in 1958 with the control and reduction of atomic weapons, and in 1960 with the technical aspects of inspection controls of nuclear weapons test ban. The role payed by Teller during the hearings of the Senate Preparedness Subcommittee, which examined the possible effects of the recently signed test ban treaty, was covered in detail by the national press; Teller’s opposition to the treaty was endorsed or rejected by hundreds of editorials and by even more letters to the editor. The appearances of the foreign-born political scientists before the Foreign Relations Committee of the Congress were just as numerous, althrough their contributions might have been more theoretical in nature. The mass communication media, which control the popularity of those who appeal to public attention, made household words out of the names of some atomie scientists, although one may wonder whether they influenced popularity in due proportion to the scholars’ actual contribution to national affairs. Undoubtedly the mass communication media served to convey the ideas of the immigrant scholars to a large segment of the public. As one indication of this, we find that the Readers' Guide, which indexes the articles published in some, hut not all, leading American magazines, lists approximately 140 articles published between 1945 and 99 [pageend101]1961 by, or about, tbe five well-knowp immigrant atomic physicists. As a consequence of the continuous and sometimes extensive exposure to the views and arguments of immigrant scholars, the public could not help being affected by them. Because of the close interrela- ? ionship between American public opinion and government policy, the immigrant scholar, by influencing public opinion, has obtained another means of affecting governmental policy making. The case of the immigrant scholar in America brings out two interesting points about the operation of historical forces. One point relates to the internal weakness of totalitarian regimes. As the totalitarian governments emerged on the scene of international politics as powerful threats, their very totalitarianism contributed to the erosion of their own power; they forced some of their best brains to leave the country, and to seek refuge and work in the United States. The other point concerns the internal strength of America. The United States has a long-standing tradition of absorbing and integrating immigrants at the social level which corresponds to their education and ability. In the case of the immigrant scholar, she offered a unique opportunity to the newcomers to work in their special fields, to further their professional careers, and, at the same time, to make important contributions to their host country. While the immigrant scholars’ contribution to developing nuclear devices stands out clearly, it is more difficult to evaluate their influence in advancing political concepts. The immigrant atomic physicists have been sharply divided with regard to such important issues as the use, testing, and ban of atomic weapons. It might be contended that as a consequence of their conflicting views, their political influence in promoting one line of action was neutralized; but it is equally true that through their arguments they have helped 100 [pageend102]to clarify the issues and to accelerate thé decision making process in this important area of national policy. The foreign-born political scientists, on the other hand, have displayed a considerable degree of unanimity in their Cold War strategy. Their views have corroborated each other, and therefore the intensity of their impact on American policy making has probably increased. Although the immigrant scholar has worked in an era when both the official policy and public opinion of the United States have fluctuated widely, he has played a complex, articulate^ and influential role on the contemporary American scene. In the areas of foreign policy and national defense, his part may even have been crucial. But, with the immigrant scholar being ever active and the national policy ever in a flux, it is better to refrain from evaluating his role. Let us leave it to the judgment of future historians to assign the praise where it duly belongs. 101 [pageend103]VLADIMIR NABOKOV EXILE He happens to be a French poet, that thin, book-carrying man with a bristly gray chin; you meet him wherever you go across the bright campus, past ivy-clad walls.

But I am no Swift, The shape of a nylon calf, the bulge of an elastic [corseted bottom Distracts me; Might as well mate with the mannequin in the pic- [ture window there, That would prove my maleness just as much or even [more Since everybody would see it, And I would prove an inspiring example Of the union of man and plastic From which generations especially suited tb our way [of vegetating will spring. Fit to solve at once our recurrent recessions Ahd to fliš-solve the ubiquitous tear-gas of boredom [and anxiety. 104 [pageend106]For they will consume with machine-likè regularity [and can bé Made more devouring by a simple adjustment of thé [greed-indicator And They will be unbothered by dew, by fumes, exhala- [tions.

To return never in the body to this land, Only to haunt it pallidly, a murky ghost With a set grimace and a cheerfully chirping voice In the first hours after sunrise; To savor still something of the dew and the powdery [sunlight, Smell of the bacon, the taste and tang in live voices. Coolness of sprinkled street And the long uncut grass in a decaying garden, Until I return no more. PETER VIERECK THE MUSE AND THE MACHINE The Impact of Industrialism on Poets — and on Humanity « We do not ride on the railroad », warned Thoreau; « It rides on us ». Not even the present world situation is more delicate than the diplomatic relations between the Muse and the Machine. Their interplay implies far broader issues, which are a matter of life or death to our society as a whole. If a ghost from the Middle Ages had visited the nineteenth century, he would have imagined himself in a world of witchcraft. He would have found men .106 [pageend108]for the first time using metallic machines, instead of flesh-and-blood hands. He would have seen trains and boats moved not by horses or sails but by the invisible forces of nature. If this is magic, is it white or is it black ? The question seemed easy to answer in those pre-atomic days of Victorian optimism when even an enfant terrible Victorian like Swinburne ended his « Hymn of Man » with such Crystal Palace gusto as : « Glory to Man in the highest ! For Man is the master of things ». But even then, in an era whose soul-searchings were as deep as its over-advertised smugness, poets were likewise protesting (Arnold, Clough, and often Tennyson himself) that mechanical things had become the masters of Man. Conceivably this protest, in part, was merely the hurt vanity of artists at being snubbed as « useless » in a machine age. Hell hath no fury like a Muse scorned. Yet the real problem of a mechanized society is not the fate of literature but the fate of all values, moral as well as esthetic. The problem was formulated by the great American philosopher, Alfred North Whitehead in Science and the Modern World : « In regard to the esthetic need of civilized society, the reactions of science have so far been unfortunate. Its materialistic basis has directed attention to things as opposed to values... Ultimate values were excluded. They were politely bowed to, and then handed over to the clergy to be kept for Sundays... It may be that civilization will never recover from the bad climate which enveloped the introduction of machinery. » The nineteenth-century poets were among the first to face the moral issue now raised by the atom bomb, and they faced it one hundred years ahead of 107 [pageend109]time. Often they gave the wrong answers, but at least they asked thé right question, which the statesmen and scientists dared not ask. It is always the < impractical » people who face the urgent issues and ask the embarrassing question, the question about ultimate values. Thé practical folk of the. last century ignored thé moral issue of mechanization because they were too busy being realistic. « Being realistic » meant : to be concerned with such alleged realities aS that nation X is « better » than nation Y, and that wär allegedly is a splendid improvement of the human tacé bècauSe of the new doctrine of the survival Of thé fittest. Meanwhile Shelley, being the most unrealistic of men, was defining the basic task of our time, the task of subordinating material power to the laws of humanity. « The cultivation of poetry », wrote Shelley, « is never moré to be desired than at periods when, from an excess of the selfish and calculating principle, the accumulation of the materials of external life exceeds the quantity of the power Of assimilating them to the laws of human nature. » Most nineteenth-century scientists would probably have disagreed with Shelley’s thesis. But today it is typical that a scientist like Jamës Jeans makes thé same point : « Wè Cannot ignore the tragic fact that science has given man control over nature bëfore he has gained control Over himself. » Though having the vision to see this problem, the nineteenth-century Muse could never make up her mind about liking or disliking the Machine and its gift of material progress. While Baudelaire, in Auden’s words, « went mad protesting That Progress is uninteresting », another great poet, Heine, wrote that he was willing to have hiS pöems in the future used merely to wrap the food of the massés ÏÔ8 [pageend110]if only the masses could enjoy the material prosperity of a socialist industrialism. Scholarship has done almost nothing towards classifying and analyzing writers according to their stand on the mechanization of modern culture. Yet the importance of the issue justifies our present attempt. We soon find that any simple division into pro and anti mechanization is too blunt to be helpful. Eight or more additional distinctions turn out to be necessary, and many writers belong to several of these eight groups at the same time. Writers on the anti-mechanist side fall into at least four separate groups with entirely different motives for being anti. Let us call them : 1) the esthetic mincers; 2) the pious scorners; 3) the back-to-instinct prophets; and 4) the trapped individualists. On the pro-mechanist side, at least four distinct groups are : First, the middle-class materialists, sometimes as conservative capitalists, sometimes as utilitarian liberals and Benthamite radicals. Second, the socialist materialists : these are just as pro-machine as the capitalists but in a different economic and political context. This important subject, especially that of Marxist materialism, would require a separate study to develop adequately. Third, the gadget cultists ; these are not pro- machine for the rational or material motives of the capitalists and socialist?, but for sheer mysticism : gadget for gadget’s sake as a new case of art for art’s sake. This childlike delight in shiny new trinkets is frequent among primitive tribes, including 109 [pageend111]those Madison Avenue tribes who write our advertisements about streamlining and super-chromium . Fourth, the lion-tamers : these accept the Machine in order to tame it for ethical and esthetic ends ; they accept it with last-minute qualms, and they keep looking nervously over their shoulder to make sure it won’t bite. Often the middle-class materialist of a hundred years ago allied his faith in machinery with faith in God; but it was a myopic God with a singular blindness to slums. An illuminating example of this Holy Alliance is a now forgotten Mr. T. Baker. His poem « The Steam Engine » glorified in ten cantos such choice lyrical subjects as the railway boom of 1845, Lord Stanhope’s steamer, and the death of the financier Huskisson, who became the first martyr of utilitarianism by falling off a moving train. Through striving to avoid it, Huskisson By unforeseen mischance was over-run. That stroke, alas, was death in shortest time; Thus fell the great financier in his prime ! This fatal chance not only caused delay But damped the joy that erst had crown’d the [day. (from The Steam Engine, canto X, « The Death of Huskisson The entire early-Victorian optimism about mechanization is summed up in the title of Baker’s ninth canto : « Vision of the World - Begenerated by the Gospel and the Power of Steam. » Despite its evident absurdities, this forgotten epic of the middle class is of real psychological interest today. Like a fly preserved in amber, it preserves for us today a specimen of something long extinct in the west : the « first fine careless rapture » of an early, confino [pageend112]dent, uncritical industrialism. It exemplifies the most extreme idealism, about the most extreme materialism. The new metallic music of machinery has long been a favorite subject of both capitalist and socialist materialists. It is equally popular in the poetry of English industrialism, of Soviet Russia, and of « futurismo », that futureless literary hubbub of the Fascist past. The seductive siren luring all of them is the factory-siren. In Soviet literature two acts of suicide — Mayakovski and Yesenin’s — equally terminated her greatest pro-mechanist poetry and her greatest anti-mechanist poetry. Even today the well-known œuvre of Vladimir Mayakovski still remains machinery’s most rhythmic apotheosis, while Russia’s most moving anti-mechanist poem is Sergei Yesenin’s comparison of the poet to the living horse, heartbreakingly outraced by the impersonal dead locomotive. Statistics would show that more poets refer to the railroad train than to any other form of machinery. An artist’s attitude towards the « locomotive god » will perhaps provide us with a handy synopsis of his attitude toward all mechanization. No wonder we find Wordsworth anti-train, Emerson pro (in « The Poet »), de Vigny anti, and Walt Whitman loudly pro (interesting is Whitman’s poem, « To a Locomotive in Winter »). W.H. Auden has been both pro and anti-mechanization. It was the young fJr-Auden of Marxist days who wrote : Yet sometimes man look and say good At strict beauty of locomotive. Those were the days when Auden terrified all Oxford by announcing a revolution of : Factory girls in over-alls Blowing up intellectuals. Ill [pageend113]Any research worker planning a Ph. D. on the locomotive in poetry will discover spme early and obscure references in the Spanish poet Campqamor (born 1817). He compares « el tren expresso » to « a lion with a mane of sparks » and gives a long account of a love affair in a railway express. Disconcerting is the contrast between Campoamor’s heroic rhetoric and his prosaic practical warnings to travelers, such as the relationship between excessive speed and what the poet daintily calls a « vertigo of emptiness » in the stomach. Meanwhile in France, the poet de Vigny, appalled by a train crash near Paris, wrote stanzas denouncing the locomotive as a menace to mankind. To him it was « a bellowing dragon » (« un draggn mugissant »). In contrast, Victor Hugo’s typically Hugo-like comment on the railroad in 1837 was : « C’est décidément très beau. » Among those poets who would hate to « look and say good » in front of any machine, the esthetic mincers came earliest. Beginning with the pre-ro- mantiçs of the eighteenth-century, their ranks were at intervals reinforced by the Lake poets, the pre- Raphaelites, the Pater schools of esthetes, and the French Symbolists. Mechanization offends them not so much morally as esthetically, because of its alleged « dirt » and « vulgarity », the two words most frequently used in their reproaches, Baudelaire is appalled by the commercial « esprit beige », and Mallarmé by the triumphant reign of sopt. Safety seems to lie only in the lofty detachment of the famous Ivory Tower. The second group of anti-mechanists, the pious scorners being neo-medievalist, would disapprove of the first group as frivolous. The religious scorner is usually more belligerent than the artistic wincer 112 [pageend114]and reacts against the moral ugliness, rather than the physical ugliness, of the modern metropolis. His flight (for example, T.S. Eliot) is not to Axel’s castle of esthetics but to the feudal castle. In the manner of Marie-Antoinette playing at being a shepherdess, he imagines himself a simple medieval peasant, full of touching rural piety and unmechanized handicraft. Such idyllic, if unhistorical, imaginings are made possible by the leisure resulting from the industrialism he scorns. Among Catholics, the scorning Muse includes G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc. Among Protestants, Ruskin combines both the esthetic and the religious anti-industrialism; and so perhaps does William Blake, in his own unclassifiable way. Often overlapping with these groups, as fellow Romantics are the back-to-instinct prophets. The latter defend the natural primitive impulses of the human heart against the « artificiality », « rationalism », and alleged « corruption » of modern life, which is damned as sordid and commercial. Here the escape is neither to Ivory Tower nor to Gothic Cathedral but to Mother Nature. This holds true from Rousseau right down to D. H. Lawrence and — still more recently — Henry Miller. The fourth group, the trapped individualists, are mainly concerned with the dignity of man. They struggle to save the human personality from being crushed by mass-standardization. Surely this is the most thoughtful and most balanced of the four antimechanist groups. Here belong the protests of such classicist poets as Goethe and Matthew Arnold. Unlike the other three groups, men like Goethe and Arnold do not share that romantic anti-intellectua- lism which is one of the roots of the Fascist-Nazi frenzy. 113 [pageend115]Goethe, the greatest of this fourth group, came too early to see with his own eyes the results of the industrial revolution in Central Europe. But he did presumably read about English industrial developments and certainly read and detested Bentham who stood for the new dispensation. In a letter of June 6, 1825, Goethe prophesied : « By means of railroad, postal express systems, steam boats, and all sorts of means of communication, the civilized world is becoming mediocratized in the process of trying to overcivilize itself... We and perhaps a few others shall be the last figures of an epoch which will not soon recur. » Economically more backward and more agricultural than England, Germany was not to have a full-fledged industrial revolution until half a century after Goethe’s death. This makes all the more uncanny — in its meaning for us today — a little- known sentence from the third book of his Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre : « I am frightened and tortured at the prospect of being overwhelmed by a living mechanization; it is rolled down upon us only slowly, slowly like a thunder storm; but it has been set in motion, it will arrive, and it will strike. » Like Goethe, to whom he frankly owes so much, Matthew Arnold turned back to Hellenic tradition and a new humanism of non-material cultural values äs the salvation from modem faith in machinery. « Faith in machinery », wrote Arnold in Culture and Anarchy (1869), « is our besetting danger; often in machinery most absurdly disproportioned to the end which this machinery, if it is to do any good at all, is to serve; but always in machinery, as if it had a value in and for itself. » 114 [pageend116]In his poem Heine’s Grave, Arnold points out the stultifying effect of too much material progress. England Stupidly travels her round Of mechanic business and lets Slow die out of her life Glory, and genius, and joy. Arnold’s chiding of technics and materialism seems smug and mild compared to the almost hysterical language of the embattled individualists of the twentieth century. Feeling their personalities more hopelessly hemmed in by the forces of mass production and mediocrity, they in turn strike back more savagely. Their tone becomes apocalyptic; in their desperation, they yearn for some primordial catastrophe. Rainer Maria Rilke predicts a revolt of the metal ore, ending modern civilization by streaming out of our machines and forcing us to return to a primitive herdsman-society : The ore is homesick. And it wants To forsake the coins and the wheels, Which teach it a petty way of living. And out of the factories and out of the money- [chests It will return into the veins of the gaping hills, Which will clamp shut behind it. Garcia Lorca, the Spanish poet, expressed still more violently the concept that modern urban civilization is ephemeral and will soon be replaced by the jungle again : Sand, crocodile, terror over New York... Primitive and mechanical impulse dancing [together... 0 savage, shameless North America ! Soon, soon the cobra will hiss in the upper [stories, 115 [pageend117]The Stock Exchange be a pyramid of moss, The jungle vines come writhing after the rifles. And soon, so soon, so soon ! Alas, poor Wall Street! (Ay pobre Wall Street) America drowns in her own machines and [grief. Among the pro-mechanists, the most thoughtful are those we called the lion-tamers. Perhaps « synthesizers » would be a better name for them. Basically they are neither pro nor anti-machine. They are pro only in their realistic acceptance of machinery as inevitable; except for that, they are closest to the fourth anti-mechanist group, the trapped individualists. The synthesizers, too, are aware of the threat of mass-standardization to the individual personality as well as to beauty and ethics. But they see their job not in fleeing the threat but in subjugating it. Ralph Waldo Emerson is at his best an example of the synthesizers. In this he differs from his fellow New Englander, Thoreau. I am thinking of Thoreau’s denunciation of the spinning-wheel factories at Lowell, Mass., and then Emerson pointing out how noble a contribution these spinning-wheels could make to humanity if harnessed to the right ideals. This position was echoed by the most important Machine-Tamer in the world, the very first head of America’s Atomic Energy Commission. In a moving Commencement address of 1945, David Lilienthal said : « The predominant fact of our time is the towering place of the machine in the life of mankind. And the great issue of our time, with which your generation will be at grips day in and day out for the rest of your lives, is simply this : Are machine [pageend118]nes to control men, or are men to control machines and direct them for the glory of God and the flowering of the human spirit ? » By far the most exciting pro-mechanist is the poet who rightly called himself « the Pindar of the Machine Age. » Published in New York in 1930, Hart Crane’s long poem, The Bridge, is the most extraordinary example of the psychological impact of mechanization. At his best he belongs with the liontamers. At his worst we must classify him as a gadget-cultist gone mad. The Brooklyn Bridge and the New York subway, one vertical and one horizontal, are two motifs of Crane’s poem. The former symbolizes our soaring Gothic spirit, and the latter symbolizes « the encroachement of machinery on humanity, a kind of purgatory » (to quote a letter to his financial angel, Otto Kahn). Crane aims to ride his subway into and through and out of purgatory, thereby achieving an « epic of the modern consciousness. » At times the poem treats machinery as the third hand of man, a « hand of fire », bound to man by the invisible wrist of electricity. But sometimes the penetration goes the other way : from the machine and not to it. Then it is man who is but another wrist of machinery; riding in the subway, man is ruled by it through his own inner subway network : his own « interborough fissures of the mind... in the back forks of the chasms of the brain. » Describing the triumphant charge of the subway from Times Square to Columbus Circle, the poet asks, « Whose head is swinging from the swollen strap ? » It is the head of that pre-industrial New Yorker, Edgar Allan Poe, symbolizing the lover of beauty who is trapped and tortured in an urban jungle of steel 117 [pageend119]more weird than his own « ghoul-haunted woodlands of Weir. » But since the penetration of man and machine is mutual, this is not the last word either. Man can no more enslave his mechanical « hand of fire » than the machine can dominate the « interborough fissures of the mind. » If the ghost of Poe is swept along by the subway in its surge from Times Square, Poe in turn alters its direction. Its new direction is a goal less material than Columbus Circle; the subway now blends with the Brooklyn Bridge to swing symbolically across the entire American continent, representing in this vast curve all the heavenward aspirations of man and creating a .new American myth : O sleepless as the river under thee, Vaulting the sea, the prairies’ dreaming sod, Unto us lowliest sometime sweep, descend and of the curveship lend a myth to God. The coined work « curveship », in this invocation to the great Bridge, is applicable also to the Poe- transfigured goal of the racing subway. It, too, moves : To find the Western Path Right through the Gates of Wrath. This rhymed couplet, which caught Crane’s imagination, is from William Blake. Not coincidence but portent of the future is this linking of Blake, the extreme of mysticism, with the Manhattan subway, the extreme of modern mechanism. The mystic half of the linkage supplies the timeless direction (« the Western path »), while the subway supplies our time-bound modern means to our goal. But this Moses was never to see the Promised Land he had prophesied. The Bridge had been intended as a yea-saying transcendence of T. S. Eliot’s pessi118 [pageend120]mism, an irrigation of his Waste Land, a T. V. A. for the arid modern soul. But Crane could find nothing to water it with but his own tears, which drowned him in 1932. Does his suicide refute for us the hopeful credo of his poem, or was it merely a comment on his unhappy private life ? In either case, we can find irrefutable good sense in certain of his comments in 1929 on the function of art in a machine age : « Unless poetry can absorb the machine, i.e. acclimatize it as naturally and as casually as trees, cattle, galleons, castles, and all other human associations of the past, then poetry has failed of its full contemporary function. This process does not infer any program of lyrical pandering to the taste of those obsessed by the importance of machinery ; nor does it essentially involve even the specific mention of a single mechanical contrivance. It demands, however, along with the traditional qualifications of the poet, an extraordinary capacity for surrender, at least temporarily, to the sensations of urban life... The familiar contention that science is inimical to poetry is no more tenable than the kindred notion that theology has been proverbially hostile — with the Commedia of Dante to prove the contrary. » These reflections bring us from the past to the ¡role of the poet today and tomorrow. The last century has left him in the position of the explorer standing on the North Pole : with the Parnassian and Symbolist movements, the poet reached the extreme of icy aloofness from humanity. When you stand at absolute North, your next step can only be in one direction — south — no matter where you are facing. Try it and see. And so the poet’s next step must take him back toward the Torrid Zone of 119 [pageend121]the human heart : out of the lonely titanism of the frost giants back to the broad southlands of humanity. And humanity today no longer inhabits elfin glades and woody nooks but is to a great extent urban, sooty, and machine-entangled and is becoming ever more so. Glibness is satisfied by facing only this urban reality of our age — or by facing only the spiritual reality of the ages. But the future may lie with a literature facing both those realities, both the wheel and the aspirations. To face only the wheels, that has been done by the Zola Naturalist school and by the disciples of proletarian verse. To face only the aspirations, that was already being done in the Middle Ages, centuries before the industrial revolution, and is not enough either. Medieval philosophy proudly called itself « the handmaiden of theology »; but the Middle Ages are over, and Miss Atomic Technology notifies the Employment Agency that she refuses to be the handmaiden of ideology. She is a go-getter career-woman and intends — watch out — to marry the boss. Let us think hard about who the boss should be; is there no alternative to the wargod, or mammon, or Big Brother of 1984 ? The answer to this question, at least in a democracy, depends partly on you yourselves. Potentially, mechanization is a means to freedom of spirit. It is a means which the unrealistic esthete dares not grasp and which the over-realistic materialist grasps too eagerly and too grossly. The world of spirit gives us certain aspirations upon which all creeds and nations can in part agree. The world of machinery gives us certain energies which men of all creeds and nations like to manipulate. Unless these two worlds can be united, our road to hell will be paved with good inventions. 120 [pageend122]The unifying artist must see beauty in both and not merely one of these worlds. He can be as I'art- pour-l’art as ever he likes. Yet by seeing simultaneously the beauty of both worlds, his vision becomes an act of mediation between them. He who mediates is also a healer. Especially when this is not his intention. His art becomes a twice-written scroll, saying to the private individual, « I am beauty », and saying to the citizen, « Either love or Hiroshima ». None of us (except in a totalitarian nightmare) is wholly a citizen. None of us is solely a private individual either. To mediate between the two worlds of machine and spirit is, to be sure, not the same thing as uniting them. It is merely a gesture of unity, a vivid metaphor of the solution, not the solution itself. It will solve neither the moral problem nor the economic problem — not even a Muse with delusions of grandeur can claim to do so — but it may inspire in society that double vision which is the prerequisite to any solution. 121 [pageend123]JOSEPH WATSTEIN BEFORE THE SPUTNIKS Russian Technology and Industrial Civilization in America The launching of the sputniks — as well as Russia’s other achievements in the conquest of the space — has again focused the world’s attention on Soviet scientific progress and capabilities. It’s now more important than ever to map accurately the Terra Incognita of Russian science and technology. Just where, in the area between Soviet boasts on the one hand and the wishful belitting of Russian scientific efforts, so often proved wrong in the past, on the other, does the truth lie ? On the right answer to this question, we are told, our very survival may depend. Surprisingly, part of the answer may come from an examination of the Russian scientific microcosmos right in our midst. For, a group of Russian-born and Russian- trained scientists has been hard at work for many years in our laboratories and industrial plants. Many of these Russian-Americans have made signal contributions to American science and technology, and the sum total of their achievements is truly impressive. Yet, compa- 122 [pageend124]ratively little is known or has been written about these interesting people and their work. It is the purpose of this study to present a summary of the contributions of this neglected group to the American industrial civilization. It is hoped also that the findings may help to evaluate with greater accuracy and precision the scientific capabilities of the country of their birth. Some introductory paragraphs presenting a capsule history of Russian science prior to the Soviet era, and outlining the background and the status of the Russian immigrant in America, will help us in our task of evaluation; they will also help explain the prevalent American attitudes on the subject. If the West comforts itself with the undeniable fact that in launching their Sputniks, Soviet engineers and scientists were, like Newton, standing on the shoulders of giants, it had better face up to the fact that some of these giants were Russian. For, contrary to the popular view, Russia has a rich scientific tradition. It is true that the country entered the age of modern science at a comparatively late date. At the time of the Cartesian and Newtonian flowerings in the West, Muscovy was barren of any, scientific stirrings. Many Russian writers, including the nation’s greatest historian, Vasily 0. Klyuchevsky, have attributed this lag to the centuries their people had spent in fighting and conquering their Mongol conquerors, and in standing guard at the frontiers of Asia; meanwhile, secure behind Russia’s strong back, Western Europe was entering its great age of science and exploration. Some Western historians dispute this theory pointing out that the great religious wars at about the same time had kept Europe in turmoil, yet could not stop the march of science. Whatever the reasons, no scientific advance could be detected in Russia until mid-eighteenth 123 [pageend125]century when the astounding figure of Michael Lomo- nosoff loomed up at the scene. Physicist, chemist,, creator of modern literary Russian, founder of Moscow University, Russia’s first, poet, patriot, Lomonosoff would undoubtedly rank as one of the supreme scientific geniuses of all time had he not scattered his prodigious gifts in so many directions at once. As it was, he anticipated Lavoisier by a quarter of a century in formulating the chemical principles of oxidation and related processes. Illiterate until twenty, son of a poor fisherman from the barren North, Lomonosoff had unbounded faith in Russia’s future scientific greatness. Despite the bleak cultural landscape around him, he looked confidently in one of his best-known poems to, the day when Its own Platos And nimble-minded Newtons The Russian land will produce. Lomonosoff was Russia’s thunderous reply to Peter the Great’s injunction to his people « to learn and to study ». The Russians were learning fast and well. With the nineteenth century Russian science really comes into its own and giants appear on the scene. Lobachevski and Chebyshev in mathematics, Mendeleyev in chemistry, Metchnikoff in bacteriology, Pavlov in physiology and psychology, Lebedeff in physics — all of these men, as is well known, had made epochal advances in their fields, winning world recognition for their achievements. There was even that rara avis,. Sophia Kovalevski, the great woman mathematician,, the recipient of many awards, and, at the time of her untimely death, professor of higher mathematics at Stockholm University. On the eve of World War I, the Russian scientist and technologist was a citizen of no mean city. Industrialization of Russia, begun in the eighties, had by 124 [pageend126]now advanced to the point where the country was fully abreast of France in the basic industrial indices. The nation’s growing industrial sinews called for armies of engineers and technicians. Engineers from Germany, England, France and Belgium found positions waiting for them in Russia at salaries they couldn’t dream of at home. But mainly the need was met by graduates of Russia’s own universities and engineering schools which were rapidly growing in number. Russia had even begun to export its scientific talent. The case of Sophia Kovalevski was recounted previously. Ilya Metchnikoff succeeded Pasteur as the director of the Pasteur Institute in Paris on the latter’s death. There were other instances. The history of Russian immigration to America constitutes one of the most colorful and paradoxical chapters of the whole immigration story. The U. S. Census had never differentiated in its reports between the various ethnic groups arriving from Russia, and logically so. But lost in the welter of statistics was the startling fact that until the great hegira in the wake of the Revolution, the dominant nationality of Russia — the Great Russians — took almost no part in Russian migration to America. The Great Russians, hardy and resourceful, alert and saucy — the basic building blocks of Russia’s greatness, and having many points of similarity with the Americans — were content to stay at home. When forced to migrate at all, these people were encouraged by their Government to move to Siberia and other frontier areas of their immense country. It is noteworthy that the few Russians who came to this country in the early days did leave their mark here. Thus, Peter Demyanoff founded the city of St Petersburg in Florida in the seventies, and became a highly successful industrialist. Vladimir Stoleshnikoff, who arrived here at about the same time, switched from 125 [pageend127]law to architecture and designed most of the plans for New York’s Carnegie Hall. Immigrants from Russia reaching the United States during the high floodtide of the immigration era in the generation before World War I belonged mainly to the persecuted minorities from the periphery of the Empire. Many of these people couldn’t even speak Russian. Most of them brought with them bitter memories of persecution and hatred for their oppressors, very often blaming the entire Russian people for their misfortunes. Inevitably, they presented a somewhat distorted picture of their native land. Thus, attitudes were engendered which were to lead later to habitual short-selling and underrating of the Russian people. It was deemed necessary to go at some length into these circumstances to explain the stubborn American stereotypes of the Russian « Untermensch ». World War I and its sequel resulted in sharp qualitative changes of Russian immigration to America. The westernmost waves of the great migration from Russia in the wake of the Revolution began to reach the country in the early twenties. Many of these people represented the elite of their country. There were among them scientists and engineers who were later to leave a mark in this country; some of these will be the subjects of onr study. We shall limit ourselves to what some regard as the « strategic » sciences - disciplines like physics, mathematics, astrophysics, chemistry, etc., which begot our nuclear age. The roster is, of course, far from being exhaustive. Furthermore, the availability of biographical material permit us to give the profile treatment to but a few outstanding performers. Puckish and irrepressible, George Gamow has brought a touch of whimsy to the intensely serious subject of nuclear and astro-physics. He received his secondary education in the Russian city of Odessa where he was 126 [pageend128]born in 1904. Gamow entered the University of Leningrad in 1922, held research fellowship there in 1926, and received his Ph. D. in physics in 1928. His early brilliance and promise earned him a traveling fellowship from the University of Leningrad to the University of Gottingen in 1928. Young Gamow looked excitedly to his first trip abroad, but like many other Russians before him, found the middle-class atmosphere of a small German town dull and depressing. He said later that the dullness of life in Gottingen left him no alternative but to engage in research. The young physicist began asking himself searching questions on the puzzling processes of radioactivity. Why do some radioactive elements, such as thorium, exist unchanged for billions of years while certain forms of radium have a life expectancy of only one-hundred thousandth part of a second ? Gamow found the answers to these and other questions in a new quantum theory of radioactivity. He formulated the new theory in the book « The Constitution of Atomic Nuclei and Radioactivity » which appeared in 1928. The new quantum system brought the young Russian to the attention of thé world of physics, As with many other great Scientific discoveries and syntheses of science, the new theory was also developed independently and simultaneously elsewhere — in the United States — by E. U. Condon and R. W. Gurney. After the fruitful summer at Gottingen, Gamow was granted two fellowships, a Carlsberg fellowship at Copenhagen and a Rockefeller fellowship at Cambridge, England. These fellowships enabled him to work under two great figures of modern physics — Nils Bohr at Copenhagen and Lord Rutherford at Cambridge. Ga- mov returned to Leningrad in 1931 and became a master in research at the Academy of Sciences. It was becoming increasingly difficult for him to obtain permission to go abroad. When allowed to leave Russia 127 [pageend129]in 1933 to participate in the Solvay International Congress on Physics at Brussels, he remained abroad. After a brief series of lectures at the universities of Paris and London, he came to the United States in 1934 and became a professor of theoretical physics at the George Washington University in Washington. He has maintained his connection with that institution ever since. In the thirties nuclear physics seemed a particularly esoteric branch of science with no conceivable practical applications. For this reason, Gamow’s classes were never crowded. One course started with an enrollment of barely half-a-dozen students; the class dwindled inexorably until one day halfway through the term a single hardy student showed up. Conceding defeat, Gamow discontinued the course and made the student his assistant. About this time, Gamow elaborated and expanded his earlier theories of radioactivity. In 1937 appeared « The Structure of Atomic Nuclei and Nuclear Transformations ». He proved that the contrasting rates of radiation of the different elements resulted from the varying degree of « leakage » of the cores of their helium atoms. A corollary of the new theory was that fast protons would make better « bullets » for smashing the atom than the alpha particles then in use. Little noticed at the time, the finding was to prove of immense importance in producing the atom bomb. But teaching, research and the writing of treatises on nuclear physics did not exhaust all of Gamow’s energies. He found time to try his hand at science fiction and popularization. He was to gain great fame in this field but not without some grievous disappointments. « The Toy Universe » described a universe only five miles across. In America this scientific fantasy and others in similar vein brought their author nothing but rejection slips, but British editors proved, more 128 [pageend130]perceptive. « The Toy Universe » was accepted by the British magazine « Discovery » which also published Gamow’s other popular writings on physics and mathematics. A collection of these was brought out in 1939 under the title « Mr. Tompkins in Wonderland », soon to be followed by other books (« The Birth and Death of the Sun », « One, Two, Three... Infinity » etc.) Gamow’s wit and originality drew high praise from so renowned popularizer of science as the late W. Kaem- pffert (« No one surpassed Gamow in explaining how uranium is converted into bomb material »). Another measure of the man’s versatility may be noted : he did the illustrations for one of his books. During World War II Gamow who received American citizenship in 1940, rendered distinguished services to his adopted country. Besides his contribution to the Manhattan Project, he served as consultant to Navy and Air Force boards, to the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory and to universities and corporations engaged in defense contract work. He was a consultant to the Navy Department as a specialist in explosions. Serving in that capacity, he witnessed the first detonation at Bikini. Gamow finds sedate ivory towers too confining and is ever ready for a tongue-in-the-cheek escapade. Lgendary among his brother physicists is the « Alpha-Beta-Gamma » exploit. The widely-known paper « The Origin of Chemical Elements » describing the birth of the universe was written jointly by Gamow and his brilliant student, R. Alpher. When the two signed their names, Professor Gamow felt that something was missing. In a fit of inspiration he added the name of Bethe, another great physicist, to make the Greek alphabetical sequence complete. It is reported that Bethe did not object. In addition to his native Russian, Gamow speaks five languages, French, Italian, German, Danish, and a Rus- 129 [pageend131]sian-flavored English. His frends maintain that all these languages are but different dialects of one language « Gamowian », especially in the spelling. There is the story of the exasperated publisher who pointedly sent Dr. Gamow a dictionary. In his letter of acknowledgment Gamow opined that the dictionary was not quite complete since the word « apple » was not in it. The reply by return mail pointed out that the word was there all right but that it was spelled « apple » and not « appel ». It may well be that in the larger perspective of the history of physics, Gamow will be mainly identified with the felicitous marriage of nuclear physics and astrophysical cosmology. Before Gamow began his work, these two branches of physical science were rather severely compartmentalized. He demonstrated that the giant stars express on a huge scale the characteristics of the atoms of which they are made. Gamow’s restless mind is haunted by the idea that an all-encompassing theory of the universe may some day be formulated and explain all the facts of the physical world. He actually voiced this apprenhension in a recent paper and concluded wistfully that on that bright tomorrow there will still be some facts to be explained. He can take heart from the recent observation by the German-American rocket-builder, Wemher von Braun, that « every new discovery increases the total mystery ». And George Gamow will the there, probing the mysteries, and telling us all about it in the accented Gamowian prose. Major Alexander P. de Seversky — aeronautical engineer, aviator, writer —■ deviates somewhat from the norm of distinguished Russian-Americans who as a group are generally retiring and limelight-shy. De Seversky is uninhibited and outspoken; he generates heat and controversy and produces headlines. 130 [pageend132]He was born (1894) at Tiflis, in Caucasian Georgia, and educated at the Imperial Naval Academy of Russia. Aviation was in its infancy then but the naval cadet sensed the potentialities of the new mode of transportation. Almost every minute he could spare from his studies he spent around a factory in St. Petersburg which among other things was turning out airplanes designed by a young and promising engineer named Igor Sikorsky. Alexander observed eagerly; sometimes he would even be permitted to take a ride in one of those early crates as a ballast. De Seversky graduated from the Naval Academy in 1914. He chose for postgraduate work the Russian Military School for Aeronautics and upon graduation he joined the Baltic Squadron of the Russian Air Service. On one of his first bombing missions his plane was shot down and his right leg blown off. Outfitted with an artificial leg, he was back in action just a year later, by special permission of the Czar. Up to the time of the Revolution he shot down 13 enemy planes and « won every kind of decoration in Russia ». At the time of the Revolution he was packing bags for a trip to the United States as a member of a special Aviation Commission. With Russia in the throes of civil war, de Seversky decided against returning to his homeland, and settled down in America. He worked at first as a test pilot. In 1921 he was appointed consulting engineer to the U. A. Air Service by the Secretary of War. In the same year he was asked by General « Billy » Mitchell to devise a maximum-accuracy bombsight. Since de Seversky was not a U. S. citizen at the time (he became one in 1927), General Mitchell arranged an engineering appointment for him as his special assistant. De Seversky worked intensely at the project and finály came up with the world’s first fully automatic bombsight. A prodigious worker, he perfected during 131 [pageend133]the same period a host of other devices. On General Mitchell’s recommendation, the Government paid de Seversky $ 50,000 for the rights to hundreds of his patents. The money was used by de Seversky to found the Seversky Aero Corporation in 1922, and in 1931 the Seversky Aircraft Corporation was organized. The venture had varied fortunes and ran into serious financial difficulties. De Seversky terminated his connection with the company in 1939 in a blaze of mutual recriminations, newspaper headlines and stockholder’s suits. Despite this setback, de Seversky launched several other enterprises including the quite modern-sounding Electronatom Corporation (1952). Through all his financial ups and downs de Seversky continued with his work of designing aircraft. He chalked up a long series of « firsts ». In the field of military aviation, for example, he perfected in rapid succession the first single-seater, low-winged fighter plane (1936), accepted as the U. S. Army standard, the first long-range convoy fighter, the first supercharged fighter for sub-stratosphere combat, and others. In the meantime, he did not neglect his second profession, that of an aviator. He broke many of the world’s speed records and won a number of trophies for special flying; the coveted Harmon Trophy was one of these. De Seversky is mainly associated in the public mind with his vigorous espousal of supremacy by air power. His near-fanaticism on the subject may have had its inception in his years of association with General « Billy » Mitchell, the maligned prophet of the vertical offensive. De Seversky’s « Victory Through Air Power » appeared in 1942, and significantly was dedicated to General Mitchell. It became a best seller at once. Its apotheosis of air power drew enthusiastic support in some quarters but was challenged bitterly 132 [pageend134]by others. Many of those opposing de Seversky’s views felt that he was oversimplifying the issues and obscuring the need for a balanced arsenal of armaments in which the air arm is an extremely effective but by no means decisive weapon. De Seversky appeared unmoved by criticism and restated and amplified his credo in « Air Power; Key to Survival » (1950). Vladimir K. Zworykin, « scientist extraordinary », in the words of David Sarnoff of the RCA, was born in the historic little town of Mourom, not far from Moscow, in 1889. He was born into a prosperous merchant family and Zworykin the elder fondly hoped that his son would continue the family business tradition. Vladimir, however, showed at an early age that his interests lay elsewhere; he had a passion for science, particularly physics. His father finally bowed to his son’s wishes who then entered the St. Petersburg Institute of Technology and received his degree in electrical engineering in 1912. Much of young Zworykin’s study was done under Prof. Boris von Rosing, one of the true pioneers of television, who undoubtedly had most to do with steering Zworykin into the field where he was destined to add so much to the world’s knowledge and comfort. Zworykin continued his studies at the College de France in Paris under another great physicist and teacher, Paul Langevin. World War I found Zworykin back in Russia. He did his stint in the Russian Imperial Army as a Signal Corps officer. Zworykin came to the United States in 1919. Nearly penniless when he arrived, he worked at first as a bookkeeper for the financial agent of the Russian Embassy. But the very next year he was able to find a position in line with his training and interests. The Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company offered him a position in its research laboratories. He started work as a specialist in the development of radio 133 [pageend135]tubes and photo-electric cells. A last, Zworykin was in his element. The ideas germinated during his years of studies and the trying years of exile finally found their embodiment in the iconoscope tube —- an electronic extension of the principle of the human eye. On December 29, 1923, he filed a patent application for this forerunner of modern television. The kinescope — a companion device of the iconoscope — soon followed. Zworykin thus scored a great technological breakthrough in the field of television. His achievement was fully acknowledged years later (in 1948) when he was awarded the Lamme Medal for his a outstanding contribution to the concept and design of electronic apparatus basic to modern television. » In 1924, Zworykin demonstrated to a select group of Westinghouse executives the first faint transmission of images by the system he developed. But after a few days he was informed very politely but firmly that while the demonstration was extremely interesting, it would fie better if « he were to spend his time on something a little more useful. » It is reported that the main reason for the lack of enthusiasm on the part of the company’s executives was the fact that Zworykin candidly described the technical « bugs » and difficulties his invention had still to surmount. In 1929 Zworykin moved to the Radio Corporation of America as director of its electronic research laboratories. The president of the company, Russian-born David Sarnoff seems to have fully appreciated Zworykin’s work. Sarnoff is reported to have asked Zworykin in those early days what it would cost to perfect his television system. Zworykin « picking what seemed an impressive sum » replied that perhaps $ 100,000 would do the trick. Actually, RCA was to spend around 50 million dollars on the project in the next twenty years. 134 [pageend136]In 1929 Zworykin demonstrated publicly for the first time an all-electronic television. In the same year he filed his first color television patent. An early form of the « electric eye » was perfected by him in 1933. One of Zworykin’s achievements, the electronic microscope, resulted from the application of one of his basic guiding principles — « a scientist always is tempted to find other ways for a new discovery ». The application of the television tube to microscopy when finally perfected produced a microscope which is capable of magnification up to 200,000 diameters- Mr. Sarnoff commented later : « Dr. Zworykin’s research in electronics and electron optics contributed greatly to the victory in World Ward II. » Among other things, Zworykin was a pioneer in the field of guided missiles. As early as 1934, he perfected plans to use his television system in guiding radiocontrolled flying torpedoes to their targets. The project was given high priority during the War, and Zworykin’s guided missiles were fully in use in the closing months of the War. Zworykin’s other major contribution to the war effort was the development, jointly with G. A. Morton, of the Sniperscope and the Snooperscope. These devices utilized the infrared image tube to allow soldiers to see in the dark. They were used extensively in reconnaissance and other combat activities. During the war, Zworykin served with distinction on a number of bodies concerned with application of research to defense. The Ordnance Advisory Comittee on Guided Missiles was one of these bodies. Zworykin received the Presidential Certificate of Merit in recognition of his outstanding achievements during the War. Zworykin was once asked whether he ever sleeps in view of his prolific output and activity. He replied that he sleeps very soundly for in his blood is the heritage of generations of the « kouptsy », the old 135 [pageend137]Russian merchants and traders, imperturbable and unhurried, who always had the knack of doing and accomplishing much without seeming to try. He’s officially retired now, in an emeritus status, retained as a consultant by his company. But there can be no retirement for his fertile mind. When Zworykin, whose basic motto is : « If it can’t be done, I like to make a bet, » was awarded the Rumford Medal in 1941 by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences for « the invention of the Iconoscope and other television devices, » the presentation speech said in part : « Years ago this country welcomed you to its shores. Your life with us has borne fruit of immense value to the people of your adopted land. » Igor Ivanovich Sikorsky was most fortunate in his choice of parents. His mother was an admirer of Leonardo da Vinci; she told little Igor stories of Leonardo’s flying machines and imbued him with an unquenchable yearning to explore the wild blue yonder. His father, a professor of psychology at St. Vladimir University in Kiev, encouraged this interest in science and taught his son the value of scientific detachment and analysis. Thus, the coldly analytical side of science and its warm romance and daring were blended in Sikorsky to produce the « master of the impossible. » Born at Kiev in 1889, Sikorsky was a frail and sickly child. But he disciplined his body at an early age, for he wanted to be a pilot. The habits of dogged persistence and perseverance thus engendered were to stand Sikorsky in good stead in later life; they carried him to triumph over trials and misfortunes that would have defeated other men. Partly because of his frail physique Igor shunned the usual pastimes of childhood. He concentrated on reading and scientific experimentation and used to 136 [pageend138]spend his entire allowance for chemicals. It is reported that when still a child he once made a bomb following the instructions of an anarchist booklet he picked up in the street. The homemade bomb worked only too well and threw the neighbors of the Sikorskys into panic. Sikorsky had a Yankee propensity for working with his hands and for tinkering in his workshop. This quality was not too common in Russia, but Sikorsky kept on building mechanical models including a rubbêr- prôpelled model of a helicopter he built at the age of twelve. He entered the Naval College in St. Petersburg and graduated in 1906. He showed no great interest in a naval career, however. He decided that engineering should be his life work, entered the Polytechnic Institute in Kiev in 1907, but he was restless and unhappy there. The aviation age was dawning. The news of the exploits of the Wright brothers and of Count Zeppelin stirred Sikorsky deeply. Finally in 1909 he left the Institute and with the financial aid of his sister Olga departed for Paris, then the aeronautical center of the world. He observed the efforts of the aviation pioneers and studied under one of them, Captain Ferber. He resolved to build a flying device of his own, a helicopter, despite the warnings of his teacher that it would not work. On his return to Russia, Sikorsky built a helicopter model on the money he borrowed from his sister. The experiment failed. An airplane built shortly afterward could not get off the ground either. And he was nearly killed in the course of his experiments. The outlook was indeed bleak. Engineering education abandoned in midstream, considerable sums expended. 137 [pageend139]months of backbreaking work — and seemingly nothing to show for it. But Sikorsky went ahead undaunted. With his next model, the S-2, he achieved a measure of success, the craft stayed aloft a very short time. The elder Sikorsky was impressed and decided to see his son through. With the S-5 model came the real turning point. That machine set a world record with a speed of 70 miles an hour and with three passengers aboard. A revolutionary development resulted when the plane had to make a forced landing. An inspection established the fact that a mosquito had flown into the gasoline and had been sucked into the carburetor. The near- disaster gave Sikorsky the idea for a multi-motored plane that could continue to operate even after one of its motors had failed. In 1912 Sikorsky won the grand prize — 30,000 rubles ($ 15,000) — at the Moscow Aircraft Exhibition, with his S-6A. He was able to pay his debts to his nearly bankrupted father, and the prize-winning plane attracted the attention of some industrialists. The Russo- Baltic Railroad Car Works hired Sikorsky as chief designer of its new airplane division. A particularly attractive feature of Sikorsky’s contract with the company was the permission to build one experimental plane a year at the company’s expense. Sikorsky was on his way, and making aviation history. His « Grand », the first 4-motor plane ever built, established a world record of staying aloft for nearly 2 hours with 8 persons aboard. In World War I Sikorsky served his country. The « Grand » was adopted by the Russian Army, to be used as a bomber; seventy-five such planes were built and used against the enemy. In the meantime he had become a rich man. When he fled the country after the Bolshevik Revolution, he left behind a fortune valued at half-a-million dollars. 138 [pageend140]After a brief stay in London and Paris, Sikorsky came to the United States in 1919 with a few hundred dollars and no knowledge of English. His early efforts to find a place in the American aviation industry were fruitless. His aeronautical achievements did not impress American aviation executives. Sikorsky eked out a living by lecturing to Russian immigrants in New York on science, mathematics and astronomy. His Russian students and friends finally persuaded him to start building planes in America with the aid of several hundred dollars they collected among themselves. Sikorsky and his associates used secondhand parts from a nearby junkyard, made their own tools, worked long hours without pay. After several failures and more financing by Russian immigrants, success came with the S-29, one of the first twin-engined planes made in America; the plane featured a 14-pas- senger cabin and attained a speed of 115 miles an hour. Sikorsky was now able to get ample financial backing. The Sikorsky Manufacturing Corporation was organized in 1928 as the Sikorsky Aviation Corporation. Sikorsky was making aviation history again. He built an amphibious plane (the S-38) wich proved popular with the airlines and was adopted by the U. S. Navy. In 1931 the « American Clipper » made Kis appearance, the prototype of the planes that were later to carry in comfort millions of passengers across continents and oceans. In the meantime Sikorsky continued working on helicopters. Because of his hazardous experiments around the plant (since 1928, Sikorsky had been the engineering manager of the Sikorsky Division of the United Aircraft Corporation) the helicopter models came te be known as « Igor’s nightmare ». In 1939 the country’s first rotary-wing craft was airborne and from now on « Sikorsky » and « helicopter » were to be virtuaRy synonymous. 139 [pageend141]Sikorsky is known for his unfailing courtesy and gentility. As a rule he addresses a workman with a diffident « If I may make a suggestion », and dislikes giving orders. His generally serious demeanor is relieved occasionally by flashes of humor as when he commented dryly on a suggested helicopter design that would employ two rotors in tandem; « They are like two women in a kitchen. You think you might gain, but really you lose efficiency. » Sikorsky, like Zworykin, is retired, but retirement means a mere formality; in fact, it means work as consultant in the company’s division named after him. He is full of plans for the future such as the utilization of helicopters as flying cranes. How could it be otherwise with the man « the story of whose career is the story of aviation » ? Vladimir N. Ipatieff, « the father of polymerization », was born in Moscow in 1867. Born into a family of improverished nobility, he was slated for a military career. Something of a prodigy, he entered the third year of college at the Michael Artillery Academy in St. Petersburg at the age of nineteen. There is evidence that in his cadet years Vladimir turned his thoughts often to an artillery cadet of another time and place — a century earlier, at Besançon — the cadet who was to change considerably the course of Europe’s history. But for all his Napoleonic dreams, Ipatieff came early to realize the role of science in modern war. Under the influence of a professor at the artillery school he developed an interest in chemistry; thus Russia lost a promising artillery man but gained a great chemist. Some writers on Ipatieff trace a definite connection beteween his artillery training and the fields of chemistry to which he was attracted and in which he grew to such stature. For chemistry of high pressures has some degree of kinship with the operation of guns. 140 [pageend142]And Ipatieff’s training in metallurgy had equipped him admirably for his epochal achievements in catalysis and related fields. After his graduation from the Michael Artillery Academy, Ipatieff became an instructor there and was promoted to full professorship in 1898. He continued his education in chemistry, receiving a doctorate at the University of St. Petersburg in 1908. In the meantime he entered upon his pioneering work in high pressure reactions, although he was greatly handicapped by the almost total lack of equipment for experiments. In 1903 he developed the first practical experimental « bomb » for working at high pressures. This nonexplosive bomb accomplished what Ipatieff set out to do — it forced hydrogen into organic compounds which would not ordinarily take hydogen. Thus hydrogenation was born. Ipatieff worked intensively at these processes and had written many papers about the results achieved. Industrial applications of hydrogenation almost defy enumeration. Ipatieff is particularly associated with the hydrogenation of coal to manufacture liquid fuels. In 1910 Ipatieff made what he himself considered his greatest discovery, that of promoters. These are small quantities of extraneous materials such as the oxides of metals which when added to catalysts greatly accelerate and increase their effectiveness. Out of the application of this discovery in the petroleum field grew the process of polymerization which is perhaps best defined as « the changing of gases which are too volatile for motor fuels into liquids which can be so used » and alkylation, a process for converting badly knocking gasoline into a high octane fuel. The latter process was to prove immensely important in World War II. Ipatieff’s work came by now to be widely recognized in Russia and his name began to be bracketed with that 141 [pageend143]of the great Mendeleeff. He was elected to the Russian Academy of Sciences. An immensely practical man, he nurtured Russia’s fledgling chemical industry in addition to training generations of Russian chemists. In World War I, the Russian Government turned to Ipatieff for leadership and assistance in the chemical phases of the conflict. He was commissioned Lieutenant General of artillery and applied chemistry effectively in the military operations. A deeply patriotic man, Ipatieff refused to leave his country after the Revolution. The Soviet Government valued highly his scientific and organizational genius and assigned him the task of organizing chemical industry in Russia. He continued with his research and founded the High Pressure Institute of Russia remaining its director until 1930. He was also assigned the task of maintaining contacts with foreign scientific bodies. This activitiy involved frequent travel to Western Europe. Ipatieff felt increasingly that his research was being stifled by the Soviet authorities and when sent with his wife to Germany in 1931, decided to leave Russia permanently. This was not easy for a doting father and grandfather, for he had to leave all his children and grandchildren behind him. Blessed with a Midas touch, Ipatieff made $45,000 as a consultant in the few months he spent in Germany. He came to the United States in 1931. Ipatieff’s career in this country, which began at age 64, demonstrated anew his singular combination of teaching talents and of a capacity for the practical application of knowledge. This career centered around two great organizations — the Northwestern University and the Universal Oil Products Company. Ipatieff had been professor of chemistry at the university since 1931 and founded the university’s High Pressure and Catalytic Laboratory in 1939. Likewise since 1931, Ipatieff served as Director 142 [pageend144]of Chemical Research of the Universal Oil Products Company. The twenty-one years Ipatieff spent in this country until his death at the age of 85 in 1952 were rich with achievements, fully recognized in his lifetime. Tie National Academy of Sciences elected Ipatieff to membership and he thus became the only man in history to be a member of both the Russian and the American academies. The American Chemical Society presented Ipatieff with its Willard Gibbs Medal in 1940. No respecter of sacred cows, Ipatieff has disproved tenaciously held beliefs in chemistry. For a long time organic chemistry textbooks maintained that alkylation of paraffins with oleins was impossible. Ipatieff has carried out this « impossible » reaction and thus laid the groundwork for American production of 100 - octane aviation gasoline. Among his many other achievements in this country was the catalytic dehydrogenation of butane; this process is of the utmost importance in the production of synthetic rubber. Ipatieff’s work has benefited greatly the American petroleum industry and contributed to victory in World War II. The Soviet Government in the meantime realized its loss in Ipatieff’s defection to the West. He was cajoled and entreated to come home. A compromise was finally offered under which Ipatieff would return to his native land for a few months’ research every year. But Ipatieff, perhaps mindful of Peter Kapitsa’s experience (the great physicist, when he returned to Russia for a short stay, was not permitted to go back to his research post at Cambridge) was not interested. Retaliation followed. Ipatieff was expelled from the Russian Academy of Sciences and deprived of his Russian cit- zenship. Then came the crowning blow. Of Ipatieff’s three sons, one was killed in action in World War II; his second son, a promising scientist, lost his life in the 143 [pageend145]Belgian Congo while fighting tropical diseases; and finally, his only remaining son publicly denounced Ipatieff as a traitor. He was able to derive whatever comfort he could from the fact that his position as one of. chemistry’s ■ rue immortals was now secure. Richard Willstätter, Gemany’s Nobel prizewinner in chemistry said in 1933 that « never in the history of chemistry had a greater i n an that Ipatieff appeared ». Fritz Haber, another Nobel prizewinner, the inventor of nitrogen fixation, called Ipatieff the « Master » of chemistry. Ipatieff developed a deep affection for his adopted country and maintained a great interest in its young scientists. He donated $26,000 for a research laboratory at Northwestern University and established a trust fund of $35,000 the interest from which after his death was to be spent for prizes in chemistry to students in chemistry, regardless of race or creed. One can name many other distinguished Russian- horn scientists in this country including Vladimir Kara- petoff (1876 - 1948), professor of electrical engineering at Cornell University, inventor of many electric devices, and author of a number of standard textbooks, notably the two volume « Engineering Applications of Higher Mathematics »; Stephen Timoshenko, physicist, and authority in the field of elasticity; Otto Struve, astronomer and astrophysicist, famous for his theory on the origin of planetary systems ; George G. Kistiakowsky, physical chemist, associate of the Manhattan Project, President Eisenhower’s Special Assistant for Science and Technology, known for his work in the fields of molecular spectroscopy; Ivan S. Sokolnikoff, mathematician, professor at the universities of Wisconsin and California, during the war, chief technical aide of the mathematical panel of the National Defense Research Committee, Office of Scientific Research and Development. 144 [pageend146]The present survey which, perhaps, might be called a chapter in the international history of modern technology, should be ended by pointing out a few suggestions that the course of events seems to offer to its students. First of all, it is useful to realize that Russia, before the sputniks and even before the Communist Revolution, developed her own technology and was by no means unsuccessful in keeping up with the technical progress of the Western world; hence, her recent achievements in the conquest of the space cannot be entirely surprising to those familiar with her past. As another point, it should be noted that a branch of the Russian technical science has been transplanted to America; the marvellous technical progress that our country has made on her way toward its present economic and political power cannot be fully understood without the contribution of the many experts hailing from the countries of East and West. And, perhaps, the basic suggestion is that technology cannot be considered as a national science that is advanced by one country independently; rather, it should be regarded as an international science in which the nations willy-nilly cooperate, learn from one another, and work on the same problems; and in which that nation makes the best progress that is most skilled in using the benefits of this cooperation. 145 [pageend147]PROFILES PETER HALASZ INTERVIEW IN ENGLISH «The President of the United States,» the early morning newcast announced, «will present the Enrico Fermi award to Dr. Edward Teller, physicist from the University of California, at 2 P.M. in the rose garden of the White House. Dr. Teller,» the announcer continued, «is the third Hungarian-born recipient of this award, given annually to an outstanding scholar (for research in the atomic field.» Quickly I called longdistance to the press office of the White House and asked permission to cover the event. A friendly but distant voice assured me that everything would be all right if I gave my name to the guard. I picked up the tape recorder, enjoyed a smooth drive to La Guardia, and caught the first shuttle flight to Washington. High up in he air I carefully jotted down a list of questions to ask Dr. Teller. In due time I walked through the gate of the White House and announced my name to the guard, who asked for my press card. I went through my pockets, although I knew that I had left most of my personal documents in New York. A driver’s license was all that I could produce. The guard looked at it, rang up the press room, then nodded. In the rose garden technicians were hurriedly adjusting TV cameras. Not far away some thirty reporters were holding a palaver, in the center of which I discovered Dr. Teller, flanked by his wife. I approached him. «I would like to have an interview in Hungarian,» I said in English, judging it unbecoming to converse in our mother tongue amidst the circle of American reporters. 146 [pageend148]«Impossible,» he answered also in English, «I can’t take my breath. After this presentation I have to attend a banquet, with three appointments scheduled later on.» My self-confidence sagged and I said in a low voice, «I’ve flown in from New York City just for this interview.» «Well, when do you plan to return to New York?» Dr. Teller asked. «Tonight.» «Why don’t you take the four o’clock flight with me? That would give us fifty minutes to spend together undisturbed.» And so we settled the matter. President Kennedy appeared with brisk steps, took his place before the microphone, and invited Dr. and Mrs. Teller to his side. The cameras started to click, the TV people turned their gadgets in every direction as if they were anti-aircraft guns, and a brief informal ceremony began. The President commended Teller’s significant work, and presented him with a diploma and a cheque for $50,000. Dr. Teller in his answer recalled the pioneer era of atomic research. The whole proceeding—speeches, handshakes, cameras shooting— did not take more than ten minutes. The President retired, and Teller with his wife hurried through the crowded press room and disappeared through a garden gate into a black Cadillac. I spent a leisurely hour on a late lunch in a deserted restaurant. By 3:30 I was pacing the floor of the Washington airport in front of the Eastern Airline ticket counter. At 3.45 the Tellers arrived, their hands clutching bags, briefcases, and parcels; behind hem a redcap wheeled four tremendous pieces of luggage. A brief greeting, efficient disposition of the luggage, and we boarded the plane. «Mitzike,» Teller told his wife, «you sit in front so that this gentleman and I can sit together.» Teller and I seated ourselves behind her. «Well,» he said, «for fifty minutes nobody will disturb us.» He spoke correct and precise Hungarian, without any trace of accent. 147 [pageend149]The engine of the Electra roared, silencing for the moment all conversation. By the time we could resume our talk, the plane was in the air. «As a matter of fact, I want to record two interviews,» I explained, «one in Hungarian and another in English.» Teller nodded. I opened the case of the taperecorder, started it, and informed the future listeners about the circumstances of my talk with Professor Teller, at the altitude of 15,000 feet, between Washington and New York. The sun shone brightly where we were, but the ground was hidden by thick white clouds. I told Dr. Teller that, under such circumstances, he should set his sight on a wider horizon and talk about the future of mankind in this dangerous era. Teller took over the microphone. «I am afraid you have addressed the wrong man,» he began. «Experience in a specialized field does not mean that one can size up the future in such broad terms.» As he talked, I suddenly rémem- bered his appearence on television many years ago when all by himself he climbed up some kind of a tower and, as a doctor does with the patient, carefully auscultated the first hydrogen bomb, ready for its launching. It was an unforgettable and frightful view, a tall man with bushy eyebrows, up in a tower, making the last check before liberating the most potent concentration of energy the world had yet known. Teller kept on talking, by now completely oblivious of the microphone in his hand. Musingly he looked out into the darkening sky as if he were talking to himself. «In our times,» he said, «no tyranny can treat its subjects the way Genghis Khan treated his. The Russians are learning this lesson now... We live amidst great dangers, but slowly a system is being developed to control these dangers... The essence of our great conflict lies not in the difference in the economic structures but in the attitudes toward human liberty.» He was under attack and was being decried as the spokesman for armament race and atomic war. But this was not true. AH he wished to convey was that there cannot be any one-sided, uncontrolled disarmament and that the Russians cannot be trusted. As long as there is no actual disarmament, we must 148 [pageend150]be strong and we must be ready since this is the only way to avoid war. The tape reached its end and Teller handed back the microphone. «And now the interview in English,» I said, «Let me change the tape.» I took off the tape, put it into its box and labeled it: «Interview in Hungarian with Dr. Teller on the plane.» I was just fastening the fresh tape when a blonde stewardess appeared, pushing a little carriage which held a ticket counter and cash register. As she tore off our tickets, she noticed the tape recorder. «I’m sorry, sir, but you must not use that.» I had no better response than to ask, «why not?» «It’s the transistor,» she said. «It interferes with the radio waves. It's dangerous and prohibited. Would you care to place it under your seat?» She was an extremely attractive representative of authority and I obeyed. «Well, of course, we cannot go on with it,» Teller remarked, «but I have an idea. Where do you go from the airport?» «Wherever you would like me to go,» I answered, somewhat subdued. «At 6 P.M. I have to give a talk at the banquet of a medical society at the Statler Hilton. At least a thousand doctors will be present. Could you come with us to the hotel?» «Certainly. I am parked at the airport and would be glad to drive you there.» Teller systematically summed up our schedule: «Then you will drive us to the hotel, and, while we register, you park your car, come back, get my room number from the desk, and ring me up. The number will be busy since I have to make a few important calls. But you keep dialing until you get an answer. Then you come to our room and we will make the English interview before the banquet starts. Is this O.K. with you?» It was. The Electra landed at La Guardia airport, and, as we stepped out, fog was descending from the darkening sky. 149 [pageend151]dimming the lights and enveloping the wings of the plane. On such an evening it felt good to have solid ground again under my feet. It was a few minutes past five when we had collected our luggage, dragged them out to the sidewalk and I had started out to find my car. I had left New York on American Airlines and my car was parked far away near, the American terminal. I rushed in the fog through a dimly visible maze of winding driveways, bars, fences, and crosswalks, toward the elusive light-blue letters of American Airlines. At last I reached the parking lot and ran among the neat, endless rows of motionless cars, looking for my tan Volkswagen. It was a matter of endurance, but finally I spotted it and started the motor. Driving back to the Eastern Airline terminal, the fog became denser and more impenetrable. Before the building, on the dark empty sidewalk, I caught sight of the Tellers, standing behind a pile of luggage. I stopped the car, and murmured a few words of apology, but Teller just raised his hand; he would hear none of it For a while it seemed unlikely that my little Volkswagen could hold all the luggage. I put baggage everywhere, in the front, behind the seat, on the seat, between the seats. Then we placed Mrs. Teller on the back seat where she disappeared among the luggage; Teller sat in front, and I started the car. The windshield wipers Jcept up a hopeless fight to give me a small circle of visibility. We seemed to float by dull lights which somehow failed to materialize into meaningful objects; I felt like a pilot on his first blind flight. Suddenly, a sign jumped out from the fog: GRAND CENTRAL PARKWAY. I made a right turn, and we were on the main road. I estimated that we should reach the Statler Hilton a few minutes past six. We were silent in the car. Teller watched the road. There was no word from his wife seated among the luggage; neither Teller nor I dared to glance back. I think Teller and I discovered about the same time that we were running in the wrong direction. On the right side 150 [pageend152]of the road milky lights rose. Eastern Airlines... American... But now we got the view of the terminal buildings from the highway. «We have come the wrong way,» Teller remarked. «Yes, indeed,» I heard myself answering dully, «I am afraid we have lost a few minutes, but let me make a turn at the first exit. It’s good luck, through, that we are on the right expressway.» I was trying to sustain my self-assurance, and my voice intimated that finding the right road must be regarded as an achievement, while finding the right direction was a matter of secondary importance that could be corrected any time. Teller did not answer, but Mrs. Teller asked gently, «Would it be possible to put the heat on?» «It’s on,» I answered and then mulled over the question for a second or two before deciding not to explain that the heating system had always functioned erratically. We drove mile after mile, around curves, past rows and rows of lights, more miles, and finally reached an exit. Happily I turned the steering wheel, left the parkway behind, and suddenly found myself in the spooky center of bulldozers, Steam shovels, trucks, and other gigantic mechanical apparitions. We had arrived at the construction ground of the 1964 World Fair. «That’s it,» I remarked, «Here at last we have a point of orientation.» The answer was deep silence. The Volkswagen jolted over hidden ditches, around the gigantic machines as we searched in the fog for the right direction. We passed under a makeshift bridge and reached a crude track line. «Would you stop for a minute?» Teller said in a low voice, «Let’s think. The exit that we’ve used from the parkway must be on our left. If we make a right turn and keep the direction, we shall be running parallel with the highway. But if we go southwest, we shall cross over to the lanes leading^ to New York.» 151 i [pageend153]We left the machines behind and proceeded on a deserted road, working through the mist. I had no idea in what direction we were heading, but by now it did not matter. Just a few hours ago the President of the United States had shaken hands with Dr. Teller, handing him a diploma and a cheque for $50,000. The diploma and the cheque must have been somewhere in the car, crawling along with us in an unknown direction, while, in the Statler Hilton, a thousand doctors were seated around a banquet table with their eyes slowly crawling toward the empty chair of the speaker and from there toward the clock on the main wall where the hands showed five minutes to seven. On the left side of the road the dim lights of a gas station appeared. With a sign I turned in. «Looking for Triborough Bridge,» I inquired. «The other way,» said a man, spinning a fat cigar round and round in his mouth. «Turn around and you hit Queens Boulevard. You cannot miss the sign.» Teller received the news with laconic patience. Mrs. Teller was asleep. The car started rolling again. Miles, crossings, bridges, oncoming trucks, and we hit Queens Boulevard. It was 7:30 when we came to a stop before the Statler Hilton. Teller quietly turned towards me, «We proceed as agreed. You park the car, come in, get my number and dial till I answer. Then you come up to my room and we will tape the interview in English.» We got out of the car and, in the next moment, were surrounded by a host of tuxedoed gentlemen. «Dr. Teller! Dr. Teller!» they shouted amidst general commotion. Bellhops collected the luggage. Mrs. Teller got out and disappeared into the circle of the tuxedoed crowd. Leaving the car before the hotel under a «No parking any time» sign, I followed the crowd. In the dazzling glare of the foyer I could see the Tellers and the tuxedoes vanish in an elevator. Then I collapsed in one of the armchairs. Having gathered my composure, I approached the information desk, and the clerk had hardly looked at his register 152 [pageend154]when the loudspeaker started booming with a message, «Mr. Halasz, please go to room 1306/A. Mr. Halasz, please go to room 1306/A.» The suite on the thirteenth floor was crowded with bellboys and people in tuxedos. A bellboy slid past me with suits, over his arm, and a doctor in tuxedo, evidently in charge of local arrangements, called after him, «They must be back by seven in the morning, Dr. Teller leaves at eight.» Two telephones kept ringing, and two doctors adeptly handled them. Mrs. Teller in evening dress entered the sitting room, the center of which was occupied by Dr. Teller, in tuxedo pants and white shirt putting on his necktie. «Would you please escort my wife to the banquet,» he asked the doctor in charge, «1’11 be with you in a few minutes, but first I have to give an interview.» «But, Dr. Teller,» the man in charge entreated, «I would like to introduce you both together.» «Mitzike, you go ahead,» said Teller, and applied himself to the necktie. Mrs. Teller took a step toward me and asked quickly, «Mr. Halasz, how does the old rhyme go? Ring around a rosy, a pocketful of posies. Ashes, ashes, all go out.» «All fall down,» I corrected, but she hardly heard me. She left with the tuxedoed doctors. «Don’t disturb us for a few minutes,» Teller shouted after them, and then turned towards me, «Let us start.» He took the microphone, and in a sedate, unruffled voice he summarized his opinion on world affairs and the future of mankind. Then he put on his tuxedo jacket and asked, «Is it all right now?» I had no time to answer, for the door burst open, and the room swarmed with tuxedoed doctors, who in a second whirled out with Teller. From the door he called back to me, «Thank you for the ride.» Then all of them were gone. I took the elevator down to the foyer and walked onto foggy Seventh Avenue. I found my car undisturbed under 153 [pageend155]the no-parking sign and soon I was homeward bound, cautiously maneuvering in the traffic. Suddenly I felt very tired.

AMERICAN LITERARY EXCHANGE 325 East, 53rd Street, NEW YORK 22, N.Y., U.S.A. 154 [pageend156]ARGUMENT We continue publishing the record of our Stockholm Conference with the contribution of our collegue, Szabolcs de Vajay. Il me semble utile d’attirer votre attention sur l’aspect bicéphale du sujet de cette enquête qui nous a réuni à Stockholm. Il s’agit, d’une part, de l’attitude de l’historien en face de la littérature et, d’autre part, de celle de l’écrivain en face de l’histoire. Or, le vaste champ historique ne peut être traité que par tranches. Je me limiterai donc, hic et nunc, uniquement au millénaire qui s’étend entre l’Antiquité dont il a été l’apprenti, et les temps modernes qu’il a engendrés : le Moyen Age. L’historien médiéval, en face de la littérature, avait jadis trois attitudes possibles : celle d’un scribe, d’un annaliste ou d’un chroniqueur, ou, dans une terminologie moderne : d’un documentaliste, d’un journaliste ou d’un romancier. Cependant une quatrième attitude se dégageait déjà de la discipline purement historique, pour atteindre des champs autrement plus vastes : celle de l’hagiographe qui était le doctrinaire médiéval. Quant aux attitudes de l’écrivain moderne à l’égard du moyen âge, elles sont au nombre de trois, suivant le cadre historique choisi. Ce dernier peut-être traité soit comme prétexte pur, soit comme une évocation, ou encore comme la présentation en forme littéraire de l’histoire elle-même. Selon le cas, il s’agit d’un fantaisiste, d’un vulgari155 [pageend157]sateur ou d’un véritable historien qui s’inspire non seulement de Clio, mais aussi de Calliope. Or, il existe encore une quatrième approche à ces temps révolus. Elle est par excellence le produit de notre époque moderne et s’impose à l’homme de ce siècle, qu’il soit chercheur scientifique ou écrivain évocateur. Son actualité s’avère omnivalente sur le plan d’un programme humain. Il s’agit de l’approche sociologique que j’estime devoir placer à l’épicentre de notre échange de vues d’aujourd’hui. S’il est entendu que l’écrivain donne le meilleur de lui-même pour constituer l’essentiel de son œuvre qu’il situe dans le cadre médiéval, l’évocation des personnages sis dans ce cadre se réclame de la pensée sociologique de l’auteur. Car, si l’élément humain est éternel, le comportement de chacun reflète singulièrement ce que nous appelons « son temps ». Et, pour comprendre les préoccupations humaines de jadis, il faut savoir assimiler la psychologie sociale des temps scrutés, avec toutes ses implications quant aux relations dans la société, à la stratification et à la mobilité sociales, ainsi qu’avec ses tendances dans les domaines spirituel, économique et culturel qui, dans leur ensemble, sont désignés communément au niveau le plus bas par « ambiance » et, au niveau le plus haut, par « fatalité ». Ce climat humain trouvera, bien entendu, son meilleur interprète dans l’intuition de l’écrivain. Mais, elle doit être délibérément guidée, et le cadre doit être créé grâce au savoir, avant que le talent ne puisse pénétrer le déguisement de « la peau de l’homme de jadis ». C’est autour des méthodes modernes de cette approche sociologique qu’il conviendrait de susci156 [pageend158]ter une discussion approfondie, dans le cadre de notre enquête. La sociologie, en tant que catégorie, peut s’assimiler au syllogisme : on l’applique toujours, mais on n’en parle guère. Nos connaissances modernes nous permettent de dépister son existence intrinsèque bien avant qu’elle n’ait été sciemment isolée comme phénomène, puis érigée en discipline scientifique. Sa méthodologie appliquée a posteriori peut servir désormais de fil d’Ariane à l’historien moderne qui désire déterminer avec un souci de vraisemblance le mécanisme et les motifs des événements demeurés secrets devant les chroniqueurs et les annalistes de jadis. Ces nouvelles connaissances présentent néanmoins quelques écueils. L’écrivain peut trop se fier à ses connaissances sociologiques. Or, si le mécanisme de celles-ci est stable quant à l’essentiel, il est, d’autre part, dans une corrélation aussi fatale qu’intime avec l’ambiance des temps auxquels le phénomène examiné appartient. L’évocation de l’historien doit donc jouer sur deux cordes du même instrument : sur la connaissance sociologique moderne et sur son intuition trempée dans l’esprit des temps. Nos connaissances concrètes sur le Moyen Age, cette période décisive de l’histoire humaine, se prolongent ainsi dans un savoir plus approfondi d’une science en plein essor et dont l’écrivain doit pleinement profiter pour situer dans l’éternel contexte humain son sujet évoquant des temps révolus. En le situant, il le détermine et lui rend une actualité aux yeux du lecteur moderne. Celui-ci doit découvrir, en effet, à travers le récit historique cet élément éternel qui fait partie de lui-même, aujourd’hui. 157 [pageend159]1 Reste à savoir cependant, dans quelle mesure l’écrivain est-il lié par un cadre historique donné ? Jusqu’à quel point est-il autorisé à fournir des éléments qui lui sont propres, pour remplir ce cadre ? Et dans quelle mesure les méthodes de la sociologie moderne peuvent-elles et doivent-elles être appliquées pour atteindre les buts proposés ? Il appartiendra d’examiner ces délimitations très nuancées entre histoire et littérature qui, grâce aux méthodes que la sociologie moderne nous aide à découvrir, pourront trouver une synthèse : celle du génie. 158 [pageend160]NOTES AND REVIEWS BOOKMARKS Hindsight is often invidious, giving one an exaggerated illusion of wisdom; yet it is very difficult to resist. Reading the twe hefty volumes published by the National Representatives of the Hungarian Israelites (Budapest, 1960) under the title : Indictment of Nazism (Documents on the history of the persecution of Hungarian Jews) there is first of all the sense of tragedy, the helpless, choking anger against all the organisers and executors of the greatest massacre in human history. But what else can one do except mourn and honour the victims and refuse to forgive the murderers ? After this, however, other emotions surface, other facts emerge. The collection of documents was edited by Ilona Benoschofsky and Elek Karsai. It is a selective edition; obviously they could not include everything —even so the two volumes run to over eight hundred pages. But here and there the selection betrays the fact that it was done in a Communist country. A good deal is made of the fact that one of the richest Jewish families effected a deal with the Nazis, handing over a vast factory complex and being sent in a Nazi plane to safety in Portugal. Thirty-one people bought their lives —expensively from the point of view of contemporary values, cheaply enough as the huge business 159 [pageend161]enterprise would have been nationalized in any case in the postwar years. The editors’ introduction also blames the leaders of the Jewish Community for not having refused to cooperate with Eichmann and Co., for literally organizing their co-religionists into convenient groups for deportation and extermination. Did they do this in the hope that they themselves would suiwive ? (Few of them did.) Or did they refuse to believe the reports that came from Auschwitz and the extermination camps before very long ? It is difficult to decide. The documents make fascinating and shattering reading. They fully support Hannah Arendt’s startling conclusions, especially in two respects. In the countries, Miss Arendt said, where the people refused to help the Nazis (as in Denmark and Bulgaria) most, if not all the Jews survived. In other countries (as in Croatia, Slovakia, Rumania, Hungary, etc.) where anti-Semitism had long been active, the native, satellite terrorists and murderers often outdid their Nazi masters. Secondly, as events proved, it would have been far better for the Jewish communities to offer at least passive resistance, destroy or hide their registers, refuse to meet the S.S. killers cap-in-hand, sabotage the official decrees—fight as long as they were alive. Perhaps all these Jewish leaders and officials were simply terrified into obedience and cooperation— as the rabbit « cooperates » with the python when it freezes into paralysis. Or perhaps the reasons were combinations of all three or even more motives ? Does it matter ? Yes, it does. For if there is one lesson the world has to learn from the murder of six million Jews it is the simple one that it must not happen again. 160 [pageend162]Yet at the same time there are striking examples of the invincible and inexhaustible human stupidity in these documents. The Eastern front had collapsed and the Russian armies were hammering at the Carpathians. The Axis had been expelled from Africa. Italy had defected, a landing by the Western Allies could be expected any moment. Germany was doomed—and Hungary with her. Yet grown-up and presumably sane men occupied themselves with issuing decrees that only lunatics could have drawn up. They banned, for instance, all Jews from the manufacture of cabbage-juice. They issued immensely complicated orders a to the size and exact position of the yellow stars the Jews had to wear. The Lord Mayor of Budapest reported to the Minister of Interior that he had cleansed his municipal staff of all Jews—and therefore two wet-nurses and one cleaning woman had been dismissed... And after all this and the senseless murder of hundreds of thousands there came the retribution—the seven week siege of Budapest, the destruction and looting of a whole country and the orgy of rape and sacking which the Red Army was not only permitted but encouraged to do... Eight hundred pages of sickening knavery and cruelty; and hardly a ray of light. It is always dangerous to read the books of one’s friends; either one dislikes them and is too polite to say so or one likes them very much and has to exercise all-too-Christian virtues to praise them. But I have no difficulty in praising a little book by Margalit Gondos and George Rezes, two members of the P.E.N. Centre for Writers in Exile, published in Hungarian by Greif Verlag (owned by another 161 [pageend163]of our members, Alexander Ujvary) in Munich, some three years ago. It is called « Two Tell it in Israel»—which is where Mrs. Gondos and Mr. Rezes live. In fact, the book is the rather rambling diary of these twe people who have collaborated in other novels, short stories and edit, bravely and unpro- fitably, a monthly critical review. Rezes writes in prose; Gondos presents poetry. Rezes is, I think (and must say at the risk of splitting the partnership) the less talented of the two; or perhaps he deliberately gives this impression. His autobiographical notes are fragmentary, disjointed. Their basic note is one of self-pity and a sort of general discontent; blaming the world for whatever shortcomings he has himself. A thoroughly spoiled and pampered child, he grows up reluctantly. Rut he has both courage and persistence; and the pictures, however briefly flashing, he gives of the very young country of Israel, the difficulties of the Central European intellectual who is unable or unwilling to do physical labour, to learn Hebrew and to strike real roots, are often moving and never dull. Of Mrs. Gondos’s very feminine, very sensitive talent I can only give an inadequate sample by offering a rather rough translation of one of her poems : To my daughter Once upon an autumn afternoon, when I’ll be already far away from you, you’ll be dreaming in the autumn rain which here does not fall thread-like but crackling and crunching pours upon the eternally thirsty soil... You’ll remember me then, because there are such hours. You’ll fall musing about your strange mother, perhaps not quite like the mothers of others. She left only a few books in some cryptic language. 162 [pageend164]A few bits of lace she kept in her drawers and one or two coldly smiling photographs. You’ll remember that at dawn she said aloud, help us, my God, what’ll happen to us, the worry, the hasty chase starts again when the sun glances already into our window. She said, my God, in Hungarian and the words help us, too. Always in this peculiar tongue in which the useless books have also been written, all this is old-fashioned, ridiculous, who needs them ? Still, once upon an autumn afternoon, something will twist your heart. She was a strange woman, lonely, hardly one or two people to whom she would talk. She only watched them from afar and sometimes if she took someone to her heart, nothing separated [her from them, only death, but there were so few of these. She grew flowers and of these strange beings she maintained they had souls and could talk. In silvery dawns she sometimes got out of bed and watched their voices or the dew that bathed them and covered the landscape with a silvery mist. All day long lorries and buses passed across it... Thus she lived with much care and few joys. Sometimes she believed in heaven and in the existence of kind people... but these were very distant like the unattainable, bluish mountains on the other shore where her Europe had once, long ago beckoned... She always wanted to leave but she always stayed. Where would she have gone, poor soul ? Europe had ejected her and the East was severe to her, merciless, hard just like it had been once to all its sons who wanted something better [and finer. Some other world into which no profiteer spirit could intrude. The poor are human too, have a right to flowers, pictures, good [clothes, even the right of occasional laughter and freedom from fear of taxes, death, warmongers for whose power-madness this much-suffered people of whom Moses and Jesus sprang and so many prophets, has always provided a good springboard in all ages... World-saviours who after their death regretted deeply that they had saved this hopelessly lost world. Thus she spoke sometimes when in the morning work was piling up too fast, between duster and ladle or while watering her flowers which had so little soil left. For you needed much strength for carrying soil and time 163 [pageend165]but here in the east the poor never obtain these two together. And because she came of dust, she had many faults, she was weak and often of little faith like all other people. And though she knew how to fight, attacking with tooth and [claw the Evil One who would deny life to everybody but himself and built in the Land of the Only God an idol of money, broken promises — still, she was often cowardly. She retired into her cave which was never larger than two small rooms. Here she cried softly, then after a short while, paving gazed long enough at the sea and the landscape, she grew calm again. And wanted once again to enfold this world into her heart. But her voice was swallowed by the voice of the Loud Ones, like the sparrows silencing the cricket’s song, dully and stupidly repeating for ever their own grey songs and never listening to the song of nobler birds. And here, on this autumn afternoon when I shall be already far away, you will brood in the autumn rain which here, unlike across the sea, in Europe, does not fall in drops and driblets. Perhaps then you will understand your mother and the books written in her mother tongue and you won’t put them into a dusty attic but side by side on a book-shelf in front of which you’ll stop sometimes and slowly, like schoolchildren, you trace the words of a poem which she loved so much. Sometimes you’ll smile because you’ll mispronounce the language in which your mother spoke, sang and in which she sighed sometimes in the dimness of dawn : my God ! (Haifa, 1958). After reading Butor, Sarraute & Co. : When you have nothing to say, it matters very little how you say it. 164 [pageend166]Propaganda is one of the strangest and mošt complex phenomena of our age—especially the propaganda of the totalitarian states. The Church designed it for spreading the faith though Heaven and Torquemada know what crimes were committed in Faith’s name. But in the twentieth century propaganda has become the Big Lie, the louder and the bigger the better. Goebbels was the Grand Master of it though only for a very limited period. The truly efficient liar is the one who picks falsehoods which have a good chance of not being found out. But telling the Germans that no enemy bombs will ever fall on their heads when they were huddling in cellars, shivering with fear, was not very effective propaganda. Equally, the Soviet propaganda about the decline of capitalism and the terrible sufferings of the downtrodden workers in the West wras blown to smithereens when the Russians advanced into Western and Central Europe. Today the Communist countries spend at least as much on propaganda as on social services oř cultural institutions. Much of it is preaching not to the converted but to captive audiences. Hungary —a random example for pretty much the same applies to Bulgaria, the German Democratic Republic or the USSR herself—puts out a fortnightly magazine in Magyar which is being sent free to hundreds of thousands of Hungarians abroad. The magazine also issues a year-book called Kineses Kalendarium, an Annual of Treasures. (The title has been stolen from a rather old-fashioned series of yeat-books published before the first world war.) Both the magazine and the year-book are crammed full of the wonderful achievements Of the people’s democracies and especially Hungary. The magazine also specialises in interviews with 165 [pageend167]Hungarians who have either returned to their native country for good or (these are far more numerous) have come on a visit. These interviews, of course, are alle breathlessly enthusiastic, praising the new buildings, the food, the wine, the climate, the schools, the swimming pools, comparing the « bad old days » with the wonderful new era. The whole publication is aimed at arousing homesickness and discontent in the emigres; to prove that Hungary is a country of plenty and freedom. All this is, of course, largely untrue. Certainly the country (as the others in Central and Eastern Europe) has made considerable progress in recovering from a terrible war and the bloody suppression of a revolution, all within less than twelve years. No account is given of the cost of this progress in human lives, in human happiness. No one dares to state the simple truth : social justice can be achieved without tyranny, without a secret police, without the sort of treachery that murdered Imre Nagy and tortured tens of thousands of people in dungeons and concentration camps. I have often wondered about the true purpose of this flood of words, the untold acres of newsprint. Do the propagandists really think that because a retired bookkeeper from Cleveland has kind things to say about the pleasures of Lake Balaton, the workers and peasants of Hungary will suddenly become more enthusiastic about the regime ? Or that if they can extract appreciative words from an octogenarian playwright about the state of the Hungarian theatre, this would make the old folk living half-starved on minute pensions all at once cheer themselves hoarse on May Day ? I had to decide that they were too intelligent to believe this 166 [pageend168]nonsense. Why, then, persist ? I think, after studying the Annual of Treasures, I have hit upon the answer. The propagandists simply want to keep their own jobs. Their propaganda is addressed not to the free world or the former citizens of the country but to the Powers That Be—the Powers That Pay. Parkinson’s Law operates with double validity in the Communist countries. Neither the propagandists nor their targets nor their bosses believe what is being broadcast in a dozen different forms—but to confess this disbelief would be to admit the failure of the whole system. And thus the twaddle about gipsy music and the charms of the collective farms continues because it provides jobs for the boys and flatters the egos of their bosses. * * * Antoine de Saint-Exupery’s delicate and in many ways perverse talent is perfectly expressed in his miniature masterpiece, The Little Prince, which I read first in the original and then in the sensitive Hungarian translation of Mrs. Anna Vamos. The story always teeters on the edge of the cute and artificial but miraculously keeps its balance. Yet I don’t think this is a true children’s book. The worlds which the Little Prince visits are too symbolical of grown-up preoccupations. But the charm persists and the book must be especially appealing to exiles who can find in the Little Prince’s philosophy and adventures a consolation for their own disappointments and humiliations. * * * The memoirs of Vince Nagy who was, for a short time, Minister of the Interior in Hungary and spent 167 [pageend169]most of his life in liberal opposition, must represent some sort of a record in the number of misprints and printer’s errors. Published in New York in 1962 by a firm that calls itself somewhat grandiloquently Pro Arte Publishing Co., it is a revealing and, in some parts, moving book. It contains chapters that are disarmingly naive in their egotism and self- centred bragging; but one is quite prepared to overlook them because of the unwavering honesty and impressive moral courage of the author. The story covers almost sixty years and is, in a way, a political history of Hungary. One of the most inte- (1'esting portraits is that of the late Count Michael Karolyi under whom Nagy served during the short- lived liberal revolution of 1918. Karolyi was an excellent man in opposition but rather weak when in office; his hesitation and indecision opened the door to Bela Kun’s Communist regime. Nagy was responsible for putting Kun and his fellow-Communists in jail; so he was not exactly popular when Kun & Co. came to power. The « Red Journal », the propaganda paper of the Hungarian Communists wrote : « Workers, Marxist comrades, do not let yourselves be ruled by this company of tricksters. Wherever you see a Minister of this Cabinet, beat him to death ! And first of all Vince Nagy, the Minister of Interior ! » Nagy escaped from Budapest and went to southeastern Hungary which was soon occupied by the Rumanians by whom he was interned for several months as a « dangerous agitator ». He returned to Hungary, was elected to parliament and during the twenty-five years of the Horthy regime served unhesitatingly the cause of civic liberties and of progressive reform. When the Germans occupied Hungary in 1944 Nagy had to go into hiding again. He barely managed to escape being deported by the 168 [pageend170]Russians as a « spy » to Siberia. He was the Public Prosecutor at the trial of Szalasi, the Hungarian Nazi quisling; but before very long he was himself in great danger of becoming a victim of Communist brutality. He left the country with his wife in late summer 1947 and, after a brief period in Austria, settled in the United States where he first worked in a factory to support himself and his family. His wife died in 1960 and the doughty old man who had been such a tenacious champion of lost but noble causes now lives alone, still fighting for his ideals. Nagy’s book is a testimony to the triumph of principle over political expediency. Perhaps it has too many local allusions, specifically Hungarian points of view to be suitable for translation; yet Vince Nagy deserves a modest but secure place in the pantheon of those who have devoted their lives to unselfish and highminded work for the benefit of their nation and humanity. * * * Reflection after visiting France, Spain and Portugal : A right-wing dictatorship automatically pushes writers (and all intellectuals) to the left — much farther than they would stand if they had a free choice. « We are all political maniacs », a Portuguese writer told me. And a Spanish one declared : « You won’t find in Spain any intellectual under forty who is an anti-Communist... » * * * Vincent Savarius is the none-too-secret pseudonym of Béla Szász, the Hungarian writer, publicist 169 [pageend171]and critic whose book « Minden kényszer nélkül » (Without any constraint) was published by the Imre Nagy Institute, Brussels, about a year ago and is soon to appear both in France and Germany. It is the story of the Rajk Trial in Hungary — but even more, it is the personal story of Savarius- Szász, the almost incredible, shattering tale of man’s inhumanity to man, of high courage and fantastic physical endurance. To me, I must admit, it is the most convincing, most exciting and most human of all similar stories — perhaps because the author has adopted a more than British sense of understatement. When he describes the nine days during which he was made to stand by the sadistic thugs of the Hungarian Secret Police; when he explains the limits of the body’s endurance compared to the almost infinite resistance of the mind; when he tells, with blinding honesty, how he was tempted to sign a false confession and yet always refused to do so — all this constitutes a document of immense value and also a shining testimonial to the superiority of mind over matter, of willpower over outrageous torture, of human dignity over the worst that the filthiest beasts in human form can devise to destroy a man and his spirit. It is a terrible fact that most of the people who tortured Béla Szász still go about unpunished and largely unrecognized. We are planning to publish an extract from the book so I can let it speak for itself : but I cannot resist to quote one short footnote which has all the elements of a grand guignol — and at the same time is almost tragi-comic : « As far as I know in the subordinate trials of the Rajk case there was only a single piece of material evidence that was presented to any court — in the case against Otto Horvath. Horvath belonged to the middle class of the Hungarian minority living in Yugoslavia but joined the Communist Party in his early 170 [pageend172]youth. Between the two world wars he spent two years in jail because of his Communist activities. During the war he joined Tito’s partisans and later acted as a liaison man between the Yugoslavs and the Hungarian resistance movement. He crossed several times the border between the two countries, at no small risk and in order to be able to move freely within Hungary, he used a forged Gestapo identity card. After 1945 he stayed in Hungary; at the request of the Budapest Institute of Workers’ Movements he wrote an account of his adventures. The Institute preserved the forged Gestapo identity card among the relics of the Hungarian Resistance, exhibiting it in a glass case. Horvath entered the Hungarian police, rose to the rank of Colonel and as he spoke Serbian and Hungarian equally well, he was often used as an interpreter at the confidential discussions of Hungarian and Yugoslav leading functionaries and of the two countries’ Ministries of the Interior. After the Comin- form Resolution against Tito, Horvath — who knew about the persons, the dates and the subjects of the discussions with the Yugoslavs — became for some people an embarrassing, even damgerous witness of their past. That is why he was arrested at the time of the Rajk affair. The AVH (Hungarian Secret Police) removed the forged identity card from the showcase of the Institute of Workers’ Movements, presented it as if it were genuine and Horvath — on the basis of this material proof — was sentenced to death as a traitor, an accomplice of the Nazis, the proven agent of the Gestapo. His appeal was rejected and he was executed... » Could Orwell or Kafka invent anything as fantastic and loathsome ? Paul TABORI. 171 [pageend173]WHEN IN ROME... One can be treated as a stranger only in places which are of permanent social order. If this is so, what can we call those who come in thousands to the campuses of the United States to live perhaps for a year or two and to learn perhaps for life? The implication of this question is, of course, that the temporary environment of the foreign student in the U.S.A. is not conducive to his being considered a stranger. If he were so considered, the rules of coming and going would be defined quite clearly, and travel on well-marked roads of social encounter should not elicit any comments other than «How interesting», or perhaps «How exotic!». The egalitarian spirit of the American college and university campus disdains deference to foreign students and discourages condescension. This ideology puts the visiting learner in a difficult position: although there is a conscientious effort not to discriminate against him (1), the foreign student, who by his very past is unlike the others whom he converses with, is encouraged to be like them; he in turn often tries to fulfill this expectation to become one of many because he, like other humans, cannot tolerate unstructured situations. In the early days there was no problem : foreign students were considered and treated as strangers on the American campus. As their numbers have increased, however, their place has become less well defined, and internationally minded foundations and agencies have undertaken studies to determine the impact and consequences of large-scale student exchange. One among such groups, the Social Science Research Council appointed a Committee on Cross-Cultural Studies to sponsor and coordinate research on foreign students on American campuses. The research would be exploratory in nature depicting the life adjustment of several, culturally contrasting, nationality groups (phase one of the program) to life in America and afterwards, back at home; systematic studies (phase two of the program) would follow up the problems and hypotheses unearthed in phase one. Four exploratory studies were published on the Indian, Swedish, Mexican, and Japanese students (and (1) If there is racial discrimination encountered, it is discrimination on the basis of color, not of nationality. 172 [pageend174]scholars) between 1956 and 1958 (2X So far, three of the systematic studies have appeared, dealing with the academic and social adjustment, national status perception and adjustment, attitudes and social relations (3). The data for the phase one studies were collected by interviewing foreign students in America in 1952 and 1953; the data for the systematic studies stem from interviews of foreign students on American campuses in 1954 and 1955. It is not my intention to discuss the methodological aspects of the three books under review. The questions asked best revealed the authors’ understanding of the problems tackled: these questions were sometimes ingenious (Morris), sometimes ingenuous (Sewell), and sometimes such as to betray the difficulties of teamwork—only common notions are held in common (Selltiz et al.). On the other hand, once we disregard the intellectual Problematik of each of the books, the formal methodology is just about as tight as the logical systems of past theologians. All the books have appendices, some quite expensive (Morris, Selltiz), which should make then suitable for re-analysis by those seeking additional information. The findings of the studies are neither startling nor unexpected. Academic adjustment and performance of the foreign students were positively related to their facility in English, to the recognition of their academic credits from their home countries, and to their acceptance of American experience followed a U-shaped curve: excitement over the sojourn at the onset, disillusionment with certain adverse traits of American life after about half a year- of exposure, and finally a more (2) Under sponsorship of the Committee on Cross-Cultural Education and the Social Science Research Council, these hooks have been published by the University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, Minnesota : John H.

Those students who came to the United States mostly for experience proved to be the most successful adapters; those who came strictly for professional training were, in the main, not as happy with their social life, although they valued the professional training available to them (Sewell). Those students were quite happy with their sojourn who either considered the American campus situation flexible or who had a good measure of personal adaptability and thus enjoyed a good measure of exposure to the style of American life. This indicates that skills of communication can overcome any initial status discrepancies resulting from invidious evaluation of national origins (Morris). If successfull social relations of the foreign students with their American counterparts are the measure of positive attitudes toward the United States, then European students because of their cultural affinity showed more positive attitudes than non-Europeans; this may, of course, be only a measure of sophistication since European students are generally more traveled than non-Europeans (Selltiz et al.). On the whole, the findings are that those students whose primary purpose was to have a cross-cultural experience, felt all in all very satisfied with their stay and returned home happy, having seen another people immersed in happiness ; they showed the greatest degree of social adjustment and acculturation to their temporary environment, having been Romani Romae. But students who came to the United States to pursue a particular field of learning scored, on the whole, lower on the adjustment (i.e. happiness) measure. The disconcerting part of the studies under review is the assumptions which underlie them. It is quite unfortunate that the ideology of cross-cultural student exchange is directed by the supposition that personal adjustment takes precedence over intellectual excellence. The overall measures of success or failure of the student exchange program seem to be couched in imagery of «one big happy family». «If the student is not particularly unfavorable toward Americans or America, but seems deeply dissatisfied with his stay here, ... one reason may be that his chief source of dissatisfaction is lack of contact with Americans—inability to make friends with Americans or to see a variety of American life» (Morris, p. 141). Or, heaven forbid, he may have over-concentrated on his studies, which would have, of course, cut down his chances of cross-cultural contact. These measures of happiness with one’s stay in a foreign country. 174 [pageend176]namely the frequency of personal intercourse, are considered important despite the collateral findings that most foreign students resent the shallowness of interpersonal relations (Morris). It would have been perhaps more significant to devise measures of cross-cultural discourse which evaluate intellectual sharing and appreciation rather than frequency of chumminess. Discourse is by nature argumentative and probing, a process of establishing respect among intellectual adversaries. It defines the boundaries of one’s identity and thus the recognition of the discoursing partners as separate entities. Who knows, perhaps this voluntary Gleichschaltung of campus life brings forth the search for identity among the social fringes of the student body. And it seems to a casual observer that the foreign students on American campuses are quite often seen «hanging out» with this fringe, another aspect which the studies so far have failed to appreciate. I am far from suggesting a revamping of the American educational system so that excellence of mind would reap all rewards (and thus better accommodate most of the foreign students coming from universities of the old order). I find American colleges and universities amazingly adequate in preparing for an industrial society. Of course, a budding genius might easily be distracted by the stress on non-failure instead of on success, since we are trying to substitute love for hate, maturity for impetuousness, sharing for egocentrism, lure for threat. So far, we are making do with the intellectual leadership of those who grew up in harsher times. I am suggesting, however, that we should encourage this immense cross-cultural student exchange (on all levels) but should perhaps suspend excessive serving of coffee and doughnuts and treat those who are coming as strangers in their own right. After all, while we are ambassadors abroad, we take our PX's with us. Let us, then, leave the choice to these strangers whether in exchange for a happiness rating they elect to be remade in our image. Daniel KUBAT. SAGNENES ATHEN (Sagas from Athens). By Susan Vadnay. Samlerens Forlag, Copenhagen. In her foreword to this delightful book, the author states its purpose — «It tries to loosen old stones and makes them tell their own story.» 175 [pageend177]And that’s just what Sagas from Athens does. Many of the stories that the stones of ancient Athens have to tell are quite intriguing... They recount «the strange habit» of the poor who kept their money in their mouths for safety; They reveal the enterprise of the prostitutes who wore specially made sandals which left an imprint saying «follow me» on the dusty Athenian roads; and The report the snapped reply that Socrates made when his barber asked him how he wanted his hair cut — «in silence!». But behind all the witty and entertaining writing one can sense the author’s diligent, painstaking, on-the-spot research; The book is in much the same vein as one that Susan Vadnay wrote about Rome — and for which she received an award during the «Golden Colosseum» ceremony in 1961. The illustrations accompanying every facet of her journey into the Athenian past are by Eyvind Rafn. Susan Vadnay, a political exile from her native Hungary, has lived in Rome for more than 10 years. A member of the International Pen Club, she writes in several languages besides her mother tongue. Her freelance journalist activities include a great deal of fashion writing. She has also breadcast for the Voice of America and worked for Radio Free Europe. And she is the Rome correspondent for the Hungarian literary review Irodalmi Ujsag, published in Paris. Mrs. Vadnay describes Sagas from Athens as «an anti-guide book». And indeed there are no tiring, laborious meanderings around museums or dead monuments, heavily burdened with historical dates. Instead there is a little fact-filled sketch about every stop along your refreshing walk in this cradle of civilization... You are told how theater was born; you look at the Agora— the ancjent market place which was the center of political and social life. And did you know that a lady could not do her own shopping in ancient Athens? She had to send a slave — if she couldn’t persuade her husband to do it for her. You probably didn’t know. But this is another tale from one of those timeworn stones which suddenly spring to life in this book. J. C. 176 [pageend178]Going back on our tracks (A magunk nvomában) by Michael Majtényi. Novi Sad, 1961, Forum Publishers, 264 pages. I am very grateful to Mr. Majtényi, who certainly would not remember me, for giving me an opportunity to write about his delightful little book (the memoirs of a newspaperman and literary connoisseur from a faraway comer of South East Europe) and to indulge in sweet memories of childhood and youth. If ever there was a remote corner of this dour little globe which might rightfully be called the Canaan flowing with milk and honey, it is his Vojvodina, the counties of Bacska and Banat in Hungary before the disintegration of that rather out-of-date institution, the Austro-Hungarian monarchy about which Edward Crankshaw recently wrote such a scathingly unjust historical report. But this is really not the point. The point is that the Vojvodina was and still is the richest grain- and wine-growing county around those mysterious South European parts, magnanimously sprinkled with a flourishing animal-breeding indusr- try. These blessings gave independence and much time for leisure even to the smallest peasant, not to mention the squires of the ten-thousand acre estates. Their leisure allowed people to look for something beyond eating and heavy drinking : a certain culture and, above all, disputes. Because there everything was — and, I sincerely hope, still is — fought out with the utmost fervour, be it politics or farm prices. I remember the discussion of two peasants, members of an American-style share-crop harvester team, who started to argue about the possible price-cycle of eggs in the Argentine and ended up with stabbing each other with the long knives which every self-respecting gentleman had to carry on his person like a Chicago gangster his Betsy. There was a grand style of living all over the place. A Mr. Sz. never went to the Gents without donning a pair of white kid gloves, for he was of the opinion that certain parts of his anatomy should not be handled in a less respectful manner. He carried his personal hygiene so far that he always kept one or two carboys of Eau-de-Cologne in his bathroom (ordered from Vienna) to be on the safe side in case stocks were to run low. This elegance of living had its counterpart in the peasants keeping magnificent thoroughbred horses. (In a Serbian community, for instance, it was a must that the bridegroom eloped with his bride under the watchful 177 [pageend179]but thoroughly appreciative gaze of the whole clan who then gave them chase by organizing a posse of anything up to 10 carts.) The arguments and sometimes violent disputes were carried out in the wine cellars of the vineyards, in the numerous peasant inns or the Viennese-style coffee houses and restaurants frequented by the middle classes. This social stratification, however, was a little arbitrary, for I knew peasants who were richer than, for instance, the local bank manager and the leading industrialist thrown together. Anyhow, arguments and disputes raged all round the year, both in the remote little villages and the cities. Their heat was by no means lessened by the mixed origins of the population. Apart from the native Hungarians and Serbs, there were the Swabians and Alsatians who had settled there after the 150 years of Turkish occupation when land and cities were depopulated by the extensive slave trade; the Shokacz, a mixture of Slovene and Italians, renowned for their beautiful womenfolk; the Bulgarians; Rumanians; Gypsies, Greeks, Slovaks; Montenegrins, the tall mountain folk of Bosnia who replied to the overtures of the tax collector with a gun-show of their long-barrelled, mother-of-pearl studded pistols; there was even a small village, Maydan, whose inhabitants were very proud of being the descendants of odalisques from the harem of Ali, the last Pasha of Temesvar (they looked it, to the last detail of their physiognomies). This love of quarrelling induced the natives to found the Republic of Pecs (about the size of Hampshire) where they had an excellent opportunity to fight out their differences in a parliamentary and truly democratic fashion. What a pity that the greed and jealousy of Hungary and Yugoslavia put an end to those noble efforts after a mere three-months of independence ! This predilection for arguing was a decisive factor and ferment in establishing a real cultural life, of which Mr. Maiténvi is a marvellous chronicler. The painter who designed the bookcover, for instance. Andrew Hangya, started his career by exhibiting his youthful works in the grocery shop where he endeavoured (not very fervently) to learn the basic know-how of the trade. He was promptly discovered, a kitty put up for the necessary funds by a certain Dr. Gyula Tabori (a former member of Professor Steckel’s psychiatric team in Vienna) and spirited off to the Belgrade Academy of Arts whose head was another painter, the first and last president of the above- mentioned glorious Republic of Pecs. I might also mention Geza Roheim who was the first to make an intensive study of the Churunga of the Australian aborigines; Karoly Aszlanyi 178 [pageend180]whose film scripts put Willy Fritsch and Lilian Harvey on the large screen. I could go on, but I’m afraid the Editor will rap my imaginary and real knuckles, so thank you, Mr. Majtényi, for giving me an opportunity to write about your book! What a pity that you have written your book in Hungarian, which is accessible but to the chosen few. It should be translated, really it should. Michael Tabori. PEACE IN THEIR TIME By Emery Helen. Drawing by Alois Derso and Emery Helen. 444 pp. Knopf $ 5.95 «Looks are deceiving» is an old saying, and like many old sayings it’s highly questionable. The noted political caricaturist Emery Helen roundly denies it, and undoubtedly speaks for most of his fellows in the craft. He tells a story of the Swedish caricaturist, Strobl, who was once working in a Stockholm prison hospital, studying the faces of criminals. The prison psychologist brought in a new prisoner and said «What do you think of this one?» «A thief and a pathological liar», said Strobl. After three weeks of submitting the prisoner to all kinds of psychological tests, the official said to Strobl: «You were right. He is a thief and a pathological liar. How did you know?» «I saw it», said Strobl. «Why is it», asks Helen, «that from the first day Mussolini and Hitler appeared on the world stage, my colleagues the caricaturists. Low in England, Sennep in France, Rollin Kirby and Fitzpatrick in the United States, recognized them for what they were, whereas responsible statesmen who dealt with them fell into their trap?» A Hungarian soldier on the Italian front during World War I. Emery Helen escaped from the world madness by pretending individual madness, and was sent for confinement to a Slovakian asylum. Beside some other intelligent malin179 [pageend181]gerers, the place held a number of legitimate madmen. It was, says Kelen, «my academy of caricature. There I got my first inkling of the extraordinary unity that exists between mind and body... Beyond the walls... among people we call ’normal’, the same unity exist.» When Kelen left this madhouse, he found himself in a larger one, without walls. After surviving three revolutions in Hungary, he left his homeland («for a Hungarian, to be a refugee is a way of life that began with Genghis Khan and continues to the present») and went to Munich, where he became a sports cartoonist and had his first glimpse of Adolf Hitler and cronies. His career as a political cartoonist began at the Near East Peace Conference in Lausanne in 1922, where he saw Mussolini for the first time («He tossed his preposterous chin in the air ...bugged his eyes like a lobster... and seemed to be staring entranced at the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse galloping in the distance. I didn’t know whether to laugh or to call an ambulance»). Kelen and a caricaturist frend, Alois Derso, became the unofficial Art Laureates of the peacemakers at the years between the wars, Helen’s pen and pencill were busy everywhere that the famous and the infamous were assembled: Locarno, Stresa, the Reichstag openings, the Round Table Conference in London. He came to the United States in 1938, and covered American political conventions, the Hot Springs Food Conference, and the founding sessions of the United Nations in San Francisco. In the postwar years, Mr. Kelen has presented to the public not his versions of V.I.P. faces, but the faces themselves: he has been television director and producer at the United Nations. «Peace in Their Time» is not only an autobiography, sparkling with aphorisms and anecdotes, but a history of this troubled century as it was reflected, or forecast, in the faces that Kelen has seen and drawn. His writing is as amusing, as graphic, as penetrating as his drawings, and his book is one of the happiest surprises of the new publishing season. HITLER: «What struck me first were those beautiful shining white teeth... What struck me second was that they obviously belonged to his dentist... His eyes did not bulge like Mussolini’s but popped and stared like those of a patient who has followed overlong the watch a psychologist dangles before his nose.» GANDHI: «My first impression was of a pyramid of home- spun cloth topped with a dried prune.» 180 [pageend182]NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN: «He could not laugh, and when he smiled, the smile ran down the tips of his wilted mustache like the juice of a bitter melon.» FRANZ VON PAPEN : «With his deep-set, fast-blinking eyes, beetling brow, spasmodic grin, abrupt locomotion, and barking voice, he was next best thing to a chacma baboon.» ANDREI GROMYKO: «Near Molotov at the Russian reception stood a young man who, with bulbous nose, dolorous eyes, and tight lips, looked like a punchinello whose feelings have been wounded.» ADLAI STEVENSON : «It is not a simple thing to draw a man who laughs easily while his eyes remain staring and rotating like a couple of Andromeda nebulae.» YOUSUF KARSH: «The Armenian-Canadian photographer looked like the little top man on a pyramid of acrobats from Tiflis.» PIERRE LAVAL: «At Dijon the people of France gathered to shout and clap their confidence in him. Could they not have looked twice at his double-dealing face and guessed that in ten years they would have to shoot him?» Maurice DOLBIER. Erich FROMM. Beyond the Chains of Illusion: My Encounter With Marx and Freud. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1963, 182 pp. This book is part of the important Credo Series, edited and planned by Ruth Nanda Anshen. It provides such outstanding men as W.H. Auden, René Dubos, Werner Heisenberg, Paul Tillich (to name a few) the opportunity to help clarify the position of the individual in our time and to express their own credo. As Anshen points out: "It is the effort of the Credo Series to define the new reality in which the estrangement of man and his work, resulting in the self-estrangement in man’s existence, is overcome. This new reality is born through the reconciliation of what a man knows with what a man is”, (p. xi). Fromm’s intent is to review Marx and Freud as a preliminary to stating his own credo in the last nine pages. We will follow Fromm’s review by chapters. 181 [pageend183]In Chapter One, "Some Personal Antecedents," Fromm traces some of the major personal influences which lead him to ask important questions about why people act as they do. In Freud and Marx, Fromm found his own theoretical and intellectual anchors. He states: "I wanted to understand the laws that govern the life of the individual man, and the laws of society — that is, of men in their social existence" (p. 9). Consequently, as a result of his study of Marx and Freud, Fromm indicates that he considers Marx to be of higher stature as a thinker than Freud. This evaluation is apparently in terms of their breadth of theoretical contributions. Fromm also indicates his profound regrets over the "distorted and degraded Marxism" (p. 12) preached in about one-third of the world. In Chapter Two, "The Common Ground," Fromm indicates that Marx and Freud both passionately wished to free men of their illusions. In approaching this task, both men’s work have common origins in humanism, as developed in the Judaeo- Christian and Greco-Roman traditions. In the next chapter, "The Concept of Man and His Nature," Fromm points out that Marx focused on man’s capacity for self creation. Freud, on the other hand, saw human nature in mechanical terms, driven by libido, in the conflicts between the pleasure principle and the reality principle. In Chapter Four, "Human Evolution," Fromm indicates Marx’s great faith in man’s perfectability and capacity for progress, whereas Freud’s view of evolution is tragic, in which society may do more harm than good. In Chapter Five, "Human Motivation," Freud is depicted as seeing man as motivated by confliction forces, as well as sexual desires. In comparison, Marx saw man, in part, as motivated by the prevailing forces of institutions, as shaped by the modes of production. However, Marx felt that the man dominated by material gain is a cripple. Furthermore, Fromm indicates that Marx saw a socialist society as one in which "the man who is much is the fully developed, truly human man" (p. 41). Next, in Chapter Six, "The Sick Individual and the Sick Society," Fromm makes some interesting comparisons. Freud’s theories of psychopathology need no comment. Although Marx never developed a systematic psychopathology, to him the society which alienated man was a sick society. The alienated man does not experience himself as a thinking, loving person. Alienated from work, he is alienated from himself, others, and nature. Thus Marx was interested in the social sources of psychopathology in the form of alienation, specifically as generated by the industrial revolution. In Chapter Seven, "The Concept of Mental Health," Fromm indicates that for Freud the healthy personality is one which 182 [pageend184]has reached the genital level, capable of producing things and reproduction, someone who has become independent of mother and father, able to be guided by his own reason. Marx sees the healthy personality in terms of ’’the independent, active productive man," (p. 65), in keeping with Spinoza, Goethe, and Hegel. In Chapter Eight, "The Individual and Social Character," Fromm points out that the theory of character structure, as developed by Freud, deals with the question of what motivates the individual, whereas, Fromm, following Marx, emphasizes social character as shaped by social institutions, especially the interdependence of the economic structures, social character, and the ideas and ideals of the society. In Chaper Nine, ’’The Social Unconscious”, Fromm emphasizes that each society regulates what thoughts and feelings are permissible — that is, the repressions common to most members of society. Freud, in contrast, was concerned with the peculiar repressions of the individual. Yet both Marx and Freud were aware that much of what determines behavior is unknown to the acton. Health involves knowing these forces. Next, in Chapter Ten, "The Fate of Both Theories," Fromm expresses his hopes in the contributions of democratic socialism, which he feels realizes western humanism. Fromm also sees a bright future for an up-to-date psychoanalytic theory unhampered by "the psychoanalytic bureaucracy" (p. 148). In Chapter Eleven, "Some Related Ideas," Fromm discusses the fetishims of words, our search for reality, and his hope for a humanist renaissance based on Marx and Freud, probers of the individual-social process, removers of the ’’mystifying veils" (p. 173). Finally, in Chapter Twelve, Fromm expounds his credo, which has to be read, not summarized. Fromm has written an important book. His comparative approach to Marx and Freud is richly rewarding of insights into both men’s work. In this respect, it would be interesting to retrace Fromm’s major categories and questions and add Durkheim, Simmel, and Weber to enlarge a comparative picture of some of the major founders of the behavioral sciences. Finally, a brief comment on Fromm’s German origins is important. For example, Fromm’s concern with Marx as a humanist is not surprising in terms of the impact of Marx on European social thought. For Fromm, this interest obviously continues. Yet, it is hard for me to think of many important American social theorists who are currently taking a serious concern with Marx, the social theorist. This may be an interesting reflection of the sociology of knowledge. Berton H. Kaplan. 183 [pageend185]AN EVENING OF BALTIC LITERATURE IN NEW YORK New York had another first, although largely unnoticed by its historians, in its variegated artistic history — an evening of readings from Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian literatures in English translations. The readings were given in the modern auditorium of Manhattan’s Donnell Library Center and drew an audience of over 200. The program began with poems by Maria Under, the greatest living Estonian poet, who had recently celebrated her eightieth birthday. The English versions of her verse managed to intimate a glimpse of the inner radiance of her words and of that synthesis between life and art, peculiar to her, which is rare in contemporary writing. The second Estonian poet was Aleksis Rannit, chairman of PEN in Exile’s American branch, whose verse has been described as «music of the intellect». Estonian prose was represented by an excerpt from a novel by Karl Ristikivi, All Souls Night, spiritually related to Kafka and an excellent illustration of the exile’s world feeling. All the Estonian fragments were translated by Professor Ants Oras. The Latvian segment of the evening was marked by a note of tragedy, as many in the audience found out for the first time that the young and promising Latvian poet Linards Tauns, to whose impassionate poems they listened, had unexpectedly died late last summer. Tauns’ friend and contemporary, Gunars Salins, then read his own verse, noted for its bold modern idiom. An excerpt from Margarita Kovalevska’s novel «Flower of Disaster» gave witness of the richness of her poetic prose. Astrid Ivask and Ruth Speirs were the translators. The program was concluded with poems by Henrikas Radous- kas and Alfonsas Nyka-Niliùnas, two outstanding contemporary Lithuanian poets, and a story by Pulgis Andriusis, which perhaps most eloquently gave witness of the Baltic writer's still close and often mystically tinged ties with his earth. The translations were by Randal Jarrell and Clark Milla The texts used during the evening were taken from the forthcoming Baltic issue of The Literary Review, a quarterly pioneering in lesser known literatures, published by Fairlegh Dickinson University and edited by Charles Angoff and Clarence L. Decker. 184 [pageend186]The Baltic authors were aptly interpreted by a group of young American authors: Patricia McGhee, Marija Matthews, Joseph Daubenas, and Joseph Abramski. A rising young pianist, Aldona Kepalaite, provided the musical interludes, including pieces by the late Lithuanian painter-composer M. K. Ciur- lionis. Evenings of this kind are usually relegated to marginal literary exotica. But there is reason to believe that their role is a more important one and that they are expressions of a development which deserves the attention of those who usually limit their sights to the dinosaurs of the literary fauna. Wherein lies their importance? A couple of answers were given during the Baltic evening. In his introductory words, Algirdas Landsbergis, First Vice President of P.E.N.’s Center in Exile, American Branch, recalled the concern expressed by some Westerners about the levelling of spiritual processes and folkways in our technological era; he said that translations from lesser known literatures performed an outstanding function in counter-balancing the trends toward uniformity in our civilization. And in the motto to the evening’s program, taken from an article by Aleksis Bannit, we read: «In a deepening perception of the creative riches that flow together from the most differentiated ways of expression of the individual European nations lies a source of happiness for each European, indeed for all who belong to Western civilization.» This very theme was echoed by several speakers in the International P.E.N.’s Round Table Conference in Rheims, last October, where concern was expressed about the one-sided flow of artistic impulses from the super-powers to the smaller nations. And in a meeting of the National Association of Book Editors, held in New York last November, Mr. Charles Angoff gave a talk about the importance of the lesser known literatures for our contemporary universalist culture. These two examples, picked at random, show that the subject is very much in the air. 185 [pageend187]P.E.N. MEETING 1963 Between October 17th and 20th, members of the International P.E.N. held their annual meeting in Rheims, capital of the French département of Champagne, where they spent four busy, intellectually fruitful days. The meeting opened on October 17th in one of the conference rooms of the Rheims Town Hall, where the Executive Committee remained in session all day long with only a short recess for lunch. Unfortunately, due to sudden illness, Dr. Victor E. van Vriesland, President of the International P.E.N., could not attend the Executive Committee’s session. Mr. David Carver, Secretary General, presented a detailed report on the activities of the International P.E.N. since the last meeting, announced the formation of several new national P.E.N. Clubs, spoke of the steps taken to ease or solve the various problems of writers in general, and finally reported on administrative matters. The Committee took notice of the report and unanimously re-elected Mr. Carver to the post of Secretary General. Mr. Carver, deeply moved, thanked the members for their appreciation and their confidence in him. After some debate, the Committee decided to hold its next meeting in Oslo, Norway, in June 1964. A round-table conference was arranged for October 18th and 19th by the French P.E.N. under the sponsorship of the Inters national Writers Fund. Since the round-table conferences in Rome and Brussels, this was the third largerscale international gathering of the kind. Seventy-four writers from twenty-five countries attended the meeting the central theme of which was Translation and the Theatre. The four sessions were alternately headed by Yves Gandon of France, Jan Parandowski of Poland, Robert Goffin of Belgium and Robert Neumann of Austriai. Thus, with each session, the honour of chairmanship went to representatives of different nationalities. Participants came from such far away countries as the United States, Australia, India, Japan, even Vietnam. Jean de Beer, Secretary General of the French P.E.N., presented the main issue in an interesting speech. The discussion that followed concentrated on the problem of adaptar tion, as it has become more and more customary to adapt plays rather than translate them. In the course of lively and extremely highlevel debates, practically every aspect of the intricate problem was covered. The conference passed several resolutions 186 [pageend188]aiming to disentangle numerous literary and financial difficulties pertaining to the translation and adaptation of theatrical works, and to protect the rights of the author, translator or adaptor. Mr. Paul Tabori, who prepared and read the closing report of the meeting, received enthusiastic comments on his meticulous and efficient work. Meanwhile, Chairman Victor E. van Vriesland’s condition had so much improved that he was able to leave his home in Holland and travel to Rheims, where he delivered a fine speech at the farewell banquet of the conference. E.H. THE OSLO CONGRESS The next international P.E.N. Congress will be held is Oslo in the third week of June, 1964. A synopsis of its suggested theme— The Writer and Semantics, Literature as Concept. Meaning and Expression—has been prepared by the International Secretariat. For those of our members who intend to attend the Congress or contribute to the special issue of Arena which we are preparing in connection with it, we are publishing here the text of the outline : Though inseparable from its expression, the subject-matter of literature also belongs to a wider context. The importance of meaning, of particular concepts, and of general ideas, has been recognised in our century more clearly than ever before, and not only in philosophy, but in literary criticism. This is not merely of abstract interest: it has vital practical consequences in practical spheres, including the literary, and could have fatal consequences in some of them. The P.E.N. Charter is one highly significant case in point. Much here turns on the concept of Freedom and its potential interpretations which may be very different in different cultures with different histories. The study of their often divergent ideas and 187 [pageend189]approaches, as these find expression in their literatures, may be of essential value in effecting communication between—for One important example—East and West. Some suggestions for different aspects of discussion, meant as a guide and stimulus to Centres which propose to send delegates, are appended: 1. The consideration of different cultural and historical backgrounds and how far these have affected the meaning of words and the general concepts with which all literatures deal—with particular reference to the contrast between East and West, and to the emergent and ex-colonial nations. 2. Particular concepts which affect international relations, e.g. «Freedom»—with special reference to the P.E.N. Charter. 3. Hence the normal and social aspects of translation. 4. Distortion and abasement of language (with particular reference to journalism and the Press). 5. The Two Cultures—language as information and description contrasted with language as feeling and imagination. In general the discussion will be directed to the subjectmatter of literature, its values and ideas, rather than to its effects and its ways of communication—although, of course, there cannot be a total separation of these contrasting aspects.

Warum Innsbruck? Dort findet in dieser Zeit die Winter-Olympiade statt. Wir wissen, dass sich die Masse des Publikums mehr für den Geist des Sportes als für den Sport des Geistes interessiert, — wenn aber nur ein Teil der aus aller Welt Erscheinenden unsere Ausstellung besucht oder von unserer Existenz erfährt, können wir das schon als Erfolg verbuchen. Hierbei möchten wir Sie auch in Ihrem Interesse bitten, Ihre möglichst neuesten Bücher oder andere gedruckte Publikationen die für die Ausstellung geeignet sind, uns postwended zuzusenden, damit wir dieselben noch in den Katalog aufnehmen können. Das bisherige 192. [pageend194]Material umfasst 500 Bûcher. Nicht allzuviel, aber genug um die Existenz der Exilschriftsteller zu dokumentieren. Unser Präsident Herr Tadeusz Nowakowski, München, wird aller Wahrscheinlichkeit nach die Innsbrucker Ausstellung offiziell eröffnen und Pressevertreter aus aller Welt begrüssen. Die Wiener Ausstellung erfolgt dann anschliessend. Dort wird Herr Denis Kovács, unser Wiener Vorstandmitglied, die Interessen der Sektion wahren und die Eröffnungspflichten sowie den Empfang der Presse übernehmen. * * * Robert Neumann (Schweiz), Vizepräsident des Internationalen P.E.N.

We are also happy to announce that, barring unexpected and unlikely difficulties, we hope to publish nine instead of six issues in 1964. We have therefore increased our annual subscription to £1.10.0— or $5.00 and once again we ask those who have been receiving our first seventeen issues to let us have this sum by cheque or money order. These should be sent (drawn an a London bank, please!) to the special Arena account c/o Barclay’s Bank, 74 High Street Kensington, London W.8. G.B. Some of our friends have asked us about life subscriptions and we have decided to be optimistic enough to set these at £20.— or £56.00. We hope there will be a good many of them. Our next issue, to be edited by Kathleen Nott and Paul Tabori will be devoted to «The writer and semantics» the theme of the International P.E.N. Congress in Oslo (June 1964) and should reach our readers by the end of March. In April an anthology of Albanian writers in exile will be edited by Tayar Zavalani. In May a special issue devoted to modem Spanish and Catalan writing will follow — consisting of works by writers living within Spain. In July the "personal choice" of our Chairman, Ivan Jelinek is scheduled. In August Arena will bring an anthology of contemporary Portuguese literature both inside and outside the country. In September K.G. Werner will present his special humour issue; in November we hope to give you a Yugoslav exile anthology edited by Dragoljub R. Acimovic and in December another special number devoted to the work of exiles in film, TV and radio, to be edited by Algirdas Landsbergis and Istvan Bokor.
