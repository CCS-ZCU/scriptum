Fischmann Box 134 Corona, CA 91718 SVU Activities PROGRESS REPORT ON THE INVENTORY OF CZECHS AND SLOVAKS ABROAD AND OF INDIVIDUALS WITH A PROFESSIONAL INTEREST IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA During the Toronto Congress, Miloslav Rechcigl (see Bulletin 1/1, II/3 and IV/1), coordinator of the project, organized a whole day symposium on “Czechs and Slovaks Abroad” and a meeting of the librarians and archivists of Czech and Slovak descent, to discuss the progress and future steps needed to accomplish the goals of the inventory he has been working on for the past three years. His co-workers from Texas, Nebraska, Maryland, Pennsylvania and several Canadian provinces took part in the symposium. As a start, Dr. Rechcigl reported, it was necessary to build a working bibliography of publications concerning Czechs and Slovaks abroad. Books and archival collections had to be localized and reviewed as to their value for the project. Many information sources have been found to be not systematic and critical enough. It was possible to identify some reliable eyewitnesses, willing to cooperate, and some on site workers. The help of the centers of Czechoslovaks in Nebraska and Texas has been assured so far, but similar cooperation from all U.S. states, Canada, Europe and other parts of the world is of utmost importance. The second step was to systematically compile and sort out the available sources. To this date personal and professional data on some 7,000 United States citizens and about 1,000 Canadians of Czechoslovak origin have been collected. A NON-PROFIT CULTURAL ORGANIZATION [pageend1]Certain specific topics have been worked out in detail, such as: the biographies of the first and the second eminent Czech immigrant, Augustin Herman and Frederick Philips, with a genealogy of their offspring; the contribution to America of Catholic priests; the history of Czech and Moravian Brethren in the U.S. and Canada; the contribution of the Jewish families of Czech and Slovak origin to the growth of America; and inventories of scientists and Dhvsicians of Czech and Slovak descent. It is hoped that persons interested in other specific topics of their expertise will be found to work on similar partial inventories or histories. Dr. Rechcigl appeals to all officers, chapters and members of the Society, all exile organizations and the ethnic press, to actively support this longterm, highly important and desirable project. Only through systematic, collective cooperation can we accomplish the goal of preserving the names and deeds of those Czechoslovaks, living or dead, who - without any difference as to their nationality - settled outside their original country (that is: the geographical area of Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, Slovakia and Carpatho-Russia) and contributed to the culture of their new homes.

As the SVU is getting older, so are many of its present members, and we realize that you, the younger generation, are the future of the society. So it seems fitting that we should talk about this and lay some plans. In the first place I think it is important that we start a dialogue. Some of us have been members of the Society since its inception. Many of you, on the other hand — because of your age — are relatively new members. What we have in common is that we believe in the goals of SVU and want the Society to prosper and do new and exciting things. We will gladly share with you our past experience, our ideas and hopes, but we must also hear from you and have your input. You may have fresh ideas about how the goals of the Society may be best attained. We hope you will candidly express your thoughts on what you would like the Society to do for people of your age — and just as important — we hope you will come up with ideas on what you can contribute to further the Society’s aims and how you best can support the Society as a whole. 3 [pageend3]You can begin this dialogue on the pages of the SVU Bulletin by sending your comments to its editor, or you can write to me (Vera Borkovec, 12013 Kemp Mill Road, Silver Spring, Maryland 20902) and I will convey your thoughts and feelings to the Society’s Executive Committee. Also, I’m asking any of you who would like to serve on my Student Advisory Committee to drop me a note. The goal of the committee will be to recruit new young members. It will also be our shared task to respond to the comments that we receive from our young membership. In Washington D.C. we have organized an SVU Junior group. They are younger members of the local SVU chapter, who feel that they know little about Czechoslovak culture and hope to “catch up on their roots” through a series of more or less informal lectures combined with social activities mainly for the young. We think this might be a good model for other chapters to follow. Our young people gain a lot from meeting people of their own age in a social gathering and working together at discovering what Czechoslovak culture has contributed to the world. In this way they will prepare themselves for active participation in the Society and will become that membership which will lead SVU in the future. So, whatever ideas you may have, let us hear from you — soon! Vera Borkovec VP for Student Affairs ★ ★ ★ CZECH MUSIC IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA The WA Chapter of SVU, with the Czechoslovak Association of WA, organized a Concert of Czech Music for December 16, 1984, at the University of Western Australia. The cellist Karel Nemec, new SVU member, performed works by Smetana, Popper, Janacek and Dvorak. After the intermission, he was joined by the Australian violinist Graham Wood and the pianist Graeme Gilling from New Zealand in Dvorak’s trio Dumky. The successful evening was supported by a grant from the Community Arts Board of the Australia Council and the Federal Government’s arts funding and advisory body. More concerts, including Jakub Jan Ryba’s Czech Christmas Mass, lectures and a presentation of Havel’s plays are planned for 1985. Peter Rudolf Hruby, Senior Lecturer in History and Politics at the Western Australian Institute of Technology, was elected as President of the WA Chapter. ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ 4 [pageend4]Personalia We will not reprint the information about reelected officers but want to introduce the new ones who will serve the Society for the next two years and other members who are willing to share their vitae.

Suda, born in Pelhřimov on October 7, 1920, earned his doctorate in Sociology and History in 1948. He left Czechoslovakia and continued his studies at the Graduate Institute for International Affairs, University of Geneva, and at the College of Europe, Bruges, Belgium. Besides speaking Czech and English, he is proficient in some six more languages. Dr. Suda worked with the Department of Publications and Cadres Training of the European Movement, International Youth Secretariat in Paris (1951-54); he then was Editor-in-Chief of the Czechoslovak Section of Free Europe Press and supervising program editor of Radio Free Europe in Munich (1954-68). Since 1968 he has taught sociology at the University of Pittsburgh, as Associate and Full Professor (1983). He has received many awards, grants and honors in Europe and in this country, besides being a visiting professor at several educational institutions where he lectured and did research. Suda has published numerous articles in various international journals and read papers at many professional meetings. Among his books are The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic-Integration and Community Building in Fourteen Communist States (Baltimore: The John Hopkins Press, 1969), Zealots and Rebels: The History of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (Stanford: Hoover Institution Press, 1980) and Directions of Change (Boulder: Westview Press, 1981) of which he was co-editor. He edited Structural Unemployment and the New Perspectives on the Social Meaning of Work (University of Pittsburgh, 1984). His book reviews have appeared in several languages, all over the world. Political sociology, sociology of work, education and socio-political changes are his main academic interests. He explored Fascism in his dissertation and later developed his expertise in analyzing the Communist systems. He accepted the editorship of Kosmas in 1983, starting with Volume II. ★ ★ ★ 5 [pageend5]EDÍT H VOGL GARRETT - 80 With some hesitation about revealing a lady’s age, we do want to express the best wishes to Edith Vogl Garrett’s 80th birthday which occurred in December 1984. An anniversary like this does not find every retiree in such an excellent health and so full of energy as she is. Edith Vogl Garrett was born on December 9 in Nýrsko, Czechoslovakia; She earned her Ph.D. in musicology and classical archeology from Charles University, but also studied piano at the Academy of Music in Prague and wrote music criticism. Dr. Vogl Garrett came to the United States in 1938. She taught piano, musicology, German and Italian at various colleges and universities, including Harvard. One area of her musicological research have been the Bohemian pre-Classics. She has participated in most SVU Congresses and in many Annual Meetings of the American Musicological Society. She had read papers on Ryba, Benda and other composers from the 18th century, but also on Smetana and Haydn in their anniversary celebrations. She is also a member of the International Musicological Society and knows well many of her colleagues from many countries. She has dedicated her life tb music, especially Czech music. Her article “The Influence of 18th Century Czech Composers on the Development of Classical Music” is to be found ih The Czechoslovak Contributions to World Culture, ed. Miloslav Rechcigl (The Hague: Mouton, 1964). Her contributions were published in the Harvard Dictionary of Music and in Studies in 18th Century Music: A Tribute to Karl Geiringer. We wish her much joy in all her tireless activities. ★ ★ ★ JAROSLAV KREJCI Professor Jaroslav Krejci (University of Lancaster, England), completed by the end of 1983 his comparative research in etiology and morphology of revolution. The research was sponsored by the British Social Science Research Council. A substantial part of the results was published in the book Great Revolutions Compared, - The Search for a Theory (Wheatsheaf Books, Harvester Press, Brighton, and St. Martin’s Press, New York, 1983). The Hussite revolution in the 15th century Bohemia and Moravia is one of the six revolutions analysed in the book. In 1983 Professor Krejci chaired a panel The Patterns and Meaning of European Revolutions at the Fourth Conference of Europeanists in Washington, D.C., and lectured at the conference Religion in the Age of Science at Star Island, New Hamshire. In 1984 he took part in the discussions at a Congress of European Movement in Brussel and lectured at the Conference of editors of and contributors to the journal History of European Ideas at the Conference Centre of the Rockefeller Foundation at Bellagio (Italy). In the last three years he also lectured at the following universities: in the U.K.: Bradford, Edinburgh, Leeds and Reading; in the U.S.: Wisconsin (Madison and Milwaukee), Lawrence (Appleton), Michigan (Ann Arbor), Cornell (Ithaca), Pittsburgh, Harvard, Boston and Lawrence Institute of Technology in Detroit; in Canada: Concordia (Montreal), Carlton (Ottawa), West Ontario (London) and Brock (St. Catharines). 6 [pageend6]In the same timespan he published articles in Religion and in History of European Ideas; he contributed to the following compendia: Religion and Politics in the Modern World (New York: U.P., 1983) and in Cross Currents (Ann Arbor, 1983) Krejci regularly contributes to the SVU publications and to the BBC external services. University Association for Contemporary European Studies (U.K.) published his manual Europe in Maps and Tables. ★ Karel Hruby reviewed Krejci’s Great Revolutions Compared in Proměny (Metamorphoses) 21/4, 1984, p. 87-89, in Czech. The reviewer indicates some approaches to this topic in the pertinent literature and gives the background of Krejci’s exploration, during almost two decades, of this sociological phenomenon. Krejci in his book analyses three “closed” historical revolutionary eras (the Hussite revolution in Bohemia, Puritan revolution in England, and the Great French Revolution). Of the three modern ones, the Turkish revolution is in the consolidating phase, while the contemporary Soviet and Chinese revolutionary process is still “open.” He then presents a theoretical model of the revolutionary process in which several factions participate: the right, the center, the left and the extreme left, all opposing the old regime, but also making and breaking alliances among themselves, at different moments. There are, according to Krejci, certain phases found in all revolutions: the effort to legally reform the old system, the struggle for, and assumption of power, time of terror, and eventual consolidation closer to the center than to the left. The particular form and duration of these phases depend 'on the deeper social-psychological structure of behavior and on the values of the struggling groups. ★ ★ ★ OUR LOSS Sir Cecil Parrot died on June 23, 1984, at the age of 75. An authority on culture of Czechoslovakia, his death is a great loss to all of us. His major contribution to Czech culture is the excellent translation of Hasék’s Good Soldier Svejk (1973) into English. Until then that work was available in an abridged and incomplete edition. Cecil Cuthbert Parrott was born on January 29, 1909, and educated at Berkhamsted school and Peterhouse, Cambridge. In 1934 he became a tutor to the young Crown Prince Peter of Yugoslavia. He acquired a good knowledge of Serbo-Croatian language and thus a basis of his future specialization in Slavonic studies. In 1940 he joined the British Foreign Service. His first post at the British Embassy in Prague was as an information officer, from 1945 to 1948. At that time began his enthusiasm and commitment to the Czechoslovak culture. From 1948 to 1950 he served at the Foreign Office in London. He was a member of the delegation of the United Kingdom to the United Nations, 1950-1952. Between 1952 and 1954 he served at the British Embassy in Brussels, and then, until 1960, as Minister at the British Embassy in Moscow. From 1960 to 1966 he was the British Ambassador to Czechoslovakia. That was his last diplomatic appointment. 7 [pageend7]In 1966 Cecil Parrott went to the Lancaster University where he chaired the Russian Studies until 1971. During that time he founded the Comenius Centre at the university, the Czech studies being always of great interest to him. In 197,1 he became professor of Central and South-European Studies and held that chair until his retirement in 1976 when he became Professor Emeritus. Sir Cecil Parrott published his autobiography in two volumes: The Tightrope (1976) and The Serpent and the Nightingale (1978). He wrote a great number of articles on Czech and Slavonic matters. His major contribution is his translation of The Good Soldier Svejk. It made Hasek immediately readable to multitudes of people outside of Czechoslovakia. He also published, in 1977, a biography of Hasek, The Bad Bohemian, and in 1981 translated a further collection of Hasek’s stories under the title of The Red Commissar. We have been fortunate to have lived at a time when a British Ambassador in Prague learned the Czech language so well that he was able to translate a major comic fiction from Czech into English, a difficult task, indeed. We shall remember him and remain grateful. Frank Marlow ★ Frank Marlow (see Bulletin III/2, May 1982), past SVU Treasurer and past President of the Los Angeles Chapter, compiled a Czech work, Rejstřík ke Švejkovi (Annotated Index to Svejk), to be published by the 68 Publishers. Sir Parrott, answering a letter not long before his death, wrote among other things: “Alas! Only a Czech or a foreigner who has lived long in Prague, knows the language and mentality of the people, can appreciate the original and delightful humour of Hasek... You can understand my difficulty when I try to explain some of Hasek’s jokes to my own fellow countrymen!” Tn the Introduction to The Good Soldier Svejk, Sir Cecil Parrott writes more about the problems he encountered in translating the book. First of all, he had to make choices between various texts because the original manuscript has been preserved only in part. Secondly, the “common Czech,” differing in pronunciation and vocabulary from the literary Czech cannot be rendered in English. Same goes for the use of German words and phrases (related to the Austrian military language) that are often mispronounced by the Czech characters. Thirdly, the translator explains that the richness of Czech “bad language” cannot be matched in Britain, especially as to the shades of intensity. Last, Svejk’s long-winded story tellings disregard the syntax, but may be understood in Czech in which the word sequence is more flexible than in English and the grammatical connections are differently accomplished. “This is the first unabridged and unbowdlerized version of the book and, in 1973 The Good Soldier Svejk must stand as he is, without any fig-leaf,” says Sir Parrott — and his Czech readers agree. ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ 8 [pageend8]SVU MEMBERS RECOGNIZED (in alphabetical order) Washington Acaönnu nf Sciences 1101 N.

Following the concert at a reception held in Kennedy Center Mr. Husa received the ten thousand dollar prize together with the Sudler Medal of Honor of Jhe Sousa Foundation from Louis Sudler, sponsor of the International Wind Band Composition Competition. Mr. Sudler is a successful Chicago businessman, a fine vocalist and patron of the arts. He also serves as Executive Chairman of the board of the John Philip Sousa Foundation. The new Husa work was the centerpiece of a brilliant concert prepared for the occasion by Col. John Bourgeois and the United State Marine Band. The capacity audience gave Mr. Husa and the Marine Band a standing ovation at the close of the performance of the Concerto. The next day Kate Rivers music critic of the WASHINGTON POST responded with a glowing approval of both the Marine Band’s performance of the concert together with the statement that “All three movements reveal Husa’s characteristically brilliant orchestrations. And, like his other works, the Concerto will surely secure a high place in contemporary wind repertoire.” Left to Right: Col. John Bourgeois, Leader U.S. Marine Band, Mr. Louis Sudler, Sponsor, Dr. Karel Husa, Winner, Dr. Al Wright, President - Sousa Foundation, Prof. Maxine Lefever, Vice President & Secretary - Sousa Foundation. 10 [pageend10]The winning composer Karel Husa, a Pulitzer Prize winner in Music is an internationally known composer and conductor and the Kappa Alpha Professor at the Cornell University. An American citizen since 1959, Husa was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia in 1921. After completing studies at the Prague Conservatory and later Academy of Music, he went to Paris, France, where he received diplomas from the Paris National Conservatory and the Ecole normale de musique. Among his teachers were Arthur Honegger. Nadia Boulanger, Jaroslav Ridky and conductor Andre Cluytens. The “Concerto for Wind Ensemble,” is meant to be a display of virtuoso passages, given to solo instruments, as well as to the groups of the ensemble. In the Fanfare of the first movement, the brass section is “con- certizing” in the groups of four brass quintets (2 trumpets, horn, trombone and tuba or baritone), spread from left to right in back; the saxophones (S,A,T,B) are placed in front of the brass quintets and the woodwinds occupy the front of stage, with percussion on the left and right side. It is divided into three movements (1) Drum Ceremony & Fanfare, (2) Elegy, and (3) Perpetual motive. Performance time is approximately 21’ 45”. The Sudler Competition is administered by the John Philip Sousa Foundation and is held every two years. 165 manuscripts from 17 countries were received for the 1983 competition for which the prize was just awarded. The selection process utilizes an international panel of distinguished wind band composers and conductors with Sir George Solti, Musical Director and Conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra serving as honorary chairman. Members of the international jury are from Canada, Japan, England, Holland, France, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, and the United States. The American composer Robert Jager served as chairman of the International Jury. Dr. Al Wright, President of the Sousa Foundation serves as chairman of the International Administrative Board and Maxine Lefever, Executive Secretary of the Sousa Foundation serves as secretary. Plans are now being implemented for the 1985 competition.

We plan to enlarge this section in terms of both categories and information.

Communication is one of our main aims. 12 [pageend12]PUBLICATIONS OF INTEREST Cross Currents 2. A Yearbook of Central European Culture (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Michigan Slavic Materials, 23, 1983) In the last Bulletin we only referred to two groups of articles that concerned the Nobel Prize poet Jaroslav Seifert and the “dissident” dramatist Vaclav Havel. Today we will report on the rest of the 1983 volume of Cross Currents. As in the first issue of this yearbook which was reviewed in SVU Bulletin IV/2, May ’83, the majority of the articles is dedicated to Czechoslovakia, but other countries are also represented. Two essays concern the whole Central European area. Louis Erste, University of Michigan, analyzes in depth the “Legal Effects of the Yalta Agreement,” raising such questions as whether it is a true international treaty or merely a political declaration and how “legally binding” some of its atypical provisions are. This scholarly and well documented exposition of the international law pertaining to the validity of usual treaties is especially timely, in view of the recent trend, represented by various “Captive Nations,” that calls for abolishment of the Yalta Agreement. The author ends by stating: “Being a plaything in super power politics is rarely conducive to the interests of small nations” and he gives Poland as a clear example. The essay “Austrian Neutrality - A Model for Conflict Management in Europe?” by Vladimir Reisky de Dubnic, University of Virginia, explores the events of 1955, when the Soviets withdrew from Austria and signed the Peace Treaty, on condition of a complete neutrality of Austria. He sees a creation of a “neutral zone,” stretching from Scandinavia to the Balkans, as one effective way of East-West disengagement between the two superpowers and as a means toward more security in Europe. According to the author, the Central European countries seeking their self-determination would welcome this type of “Austrian Solution.” Of the four Poland related articles three are dedicated to poetry. Stanislav Baranczak, Harvard University, in his “Polish Poetry of the ‘State of War’”offers a selection of poems written in Poland under martial law and made available by the emigre publishers. Poets Anka Kowalska, Jan Polkowski, Adam Zagajewski, Ryszard Krynicki and Leszek Szaruga are represented in English translations. Hans Robert Jauss, University of Konstanz, writes on “Norwid and Baudelaire as Contemporaries: A Notable Case of Overdue Concretization. ” Cyprian Kamil Norwid (b. 1821), living in exile in Paris, finished his poem cycle Vade-mecum in 1866 but had remained rather unrecognized during his life. Only today has he been discovered in his native country as an important “classic of repressed modernity.” “The Poetry of Czeslaw Milosz: The Parable of the Great Disinheritance” is the subject of Aleksander Fiut’s study. He stresses Milosz’s Lithuanian roots and his “gentry ethos,” with the consequent nostalgia of an individual driven from his “Paradise.” The “fable of the Great Disinheritance” is presented by Milosz “via three well-known figures 13 [pageend13]drawn from the literary tradition: the exile, the witness and the pilgrim.’’ Fiut further explains that certain of Milosz’s works are indecipherable and untranslatable, unless the reader intimately knows the whole culture of the poet. A parallel between Milosz, Nobel laureate of 1980, and Seifert, Nobel laureate of 1984, causing similar difficulties for foreign readers, comes to mind, though Milosz has lived in exile since 1951, and the first English translations of his poetry appeared in 1973. The fourth essay on Polish literature is Sylvain Patrice Lieberman’s, University of Pennsylvania, “The Terrorized Reader,” which relates to the novel The King of the Two Sicilies (1970) by Andrzej Kusniewicz, published in English translation in 1980. The author specifically analyzes how the novelist reconstructs and authenticates the cultural atmosphere of the turn- of-the-century, by overwhelming the reader with his omniscient, cumulative use of countless literary, artistic and historical details. Hence the title of this essay. Three articles refer to Hungary. Janos Kenedi from Budapest starts his “Biographical Sketch of Istvan Bibo” by the events of November 1956, ‘during the Hungarian revolution. The lawyer, scholar and writer Bibo (1911-1979) was a true fighter for democracy in his country. Due to the changing political configurations, his writings had not been published since 1949, though he exercised considerable influence on his contemporaries in samizdat. Thus, “Istvan Bibo’s life’s work represents, in Hungarian culture, that solid moral strength without which the causes of democratic community and of human freedom cannot become one.” Miklos Radnoti (1909-1944) is not much known in tms country, though Emery George, in “The Image of America in Miklos Radnoti’s Poetry,” compares him with Auden or Mandelstam. Radnoti was a translator of Western post-expressionist poetry from five languages, a film critic, a “jobless Ph.D.” and an avid student of America, though he never visited this country. He was killed by Hungarian guards on a forced march from the Bor concentration camp. Some of the poetry he wrote even on that march is included. His poetry is available in the English translation by Emery George from Ardis, Ann Arbor. “Human Nature and Politics in Contemporary Hungarian Cinema” is the title of Herbert Eagle’s article. He considers the exposition of the human nature rather than of the political morality as the characteristic of the Hungarian “new wave” since the mid-1970’s. He analyzes and describes in detail several films as examples of this trend, including Angi Vera (1979) and Mephisto (1981). Vladimir Dedijer, in “Literature and History in the Totality of the Historical Process,” brings forth a wealth of information about the writer Ivo Andric (b. 1892) whom he considers “a precursor of those who have been conducting a large scale codification of genocide since the mass slaughter of whole nations in WWII.” With his highly reliable knowledge of the historical processes in his country and with deep understanding of the psychology of the victim and the opressor, Andric gives in his literary work a true picture of the “cultural genocide” (specifically exemplified by the Islamization of Bosnia), beside the treatment of the more easily acknowledged physical genocidal activities against the oppressed group. 14 [pageend14]“The Anecdotic Author in Isaac Bashevis Singer’s ‘The Captive’” by David Packman analyzes the story’s “narrative within the narrative” from the theoretical point of view of “the problematic relation... between self and style, author and text.” Packman stresses Singer’s “ghostly existence in translation” which affects the exchange between writer and reader, but allows for multiple “alien voices” that speak through the anecdotic author and the protagonists of the tale, confusing their sense of personal identity. All the other essays relate to Czechoslovak cultural issues. An unusual contribution is simply titled “Dying?” A recent escapee, Andrej Mraz, Jr., describes in a very open manner his growing up in contemporary Slovakia and the reasons why he left. The lack of respect for citizens’ dignity and creativity on the part of the regime has produced a generation of “cheats, loafers, idlers, neurotics and drunks,” cut off from their historical values, existing in an atmosphere of declining spiritual qualities, humiliated, apathetic, frustrated and alienated. Mraz ends by saying: “This is the end of the article and, I suspect, also the end of a nation. A pity. I quite liked some of those people.” H. Gordon Skilling, University of Toronto, gives the history of “The Rediscovery of Masaryk” in Czechoslovakia, in 1968 and again in 1980. In between, Masaryk officially was an “unperson”, though he still was respected and remembered by many, and some of his writings were available in samizdat. Professor Skilling, in his repeated visits to Czechoslovakia since the 1930’s, was able to directly experience and observe some of the changing attitudes toward T.G.M. He stresses that Masaryk, after being expunged “three times from the historical record... emerged anew as a source of inspiration and as an example for the future.” Currently his multifaceted work is being subjected to critical evaluation by many Czechoslovak intellectuals, in exile and in Czechoslovakia. The following essay. “Czech Past and Present at the Crossroads of Civilizations,” is dedicated to the philosophy of history. Jaroslav Krejci, University of Lancaster, reviews the comments of Jan Patočka on Masaryk’s philosophy of Czech history and confronts them with the opinions of Toynbee, Skalicky and others. He documents several points of time when the history of today’s Czechoslovakia can be understood within the framework of North-South European conflict, shifting to a pronounced East-West opposition since 1917. He maintains, with Toynbee, that any study of history must take into account supernational, socio-cultural and strictly political formations at a certain historical moment. The Czechs, due to their geographical location and tendency to reform, have been “more susceptible than their neighbors to ideological commitment and hence to direct, active participation in confrontations freighted with differences in beliefs and other convictions.” The author is somewhat optimistic that, in the future, “there might be space for some new arrangements which could rectify the twisted interpretations of agreements between East and West at the time of World War II.” The next section of the yearbook pays tribute to the centennial of birth of Hasek and Kafka in six articles. Karel Kosik asks who Svejk is not and who he is in his grotesque world of the Great Mechanism whose terror he undermines with his humor. Kafka’s bureaucratic labyrinth is not less absurd and also causes the man to become alienated and powerless. 15 [pageend15]“The Tragic Comedy of Jaroslav Hasek” by Jindřich Chalupecky from Prague is basically biographical and offers a complex picture of the creator of Svejk. Predrag Jirsak from Zagreb compares Svejk and Uncle Pepin, created by Hrabal, another master of the “barroom story,” a characteristic genre of Czech urban folklore. A detailed analysis of Milena Jesenska’s translations into Czech of some of Kafka’s texts is offered in “The Judgment: A New Perspective on the Milena-Kafka Relationship” by Hana Arie-Gaifman, The Hebrew University, Jerusalem. In “Franz Kafka, Jazz, The Antisemitic Reader, and other Marginal Matters,” Josef Skvorecky, University of Toronto, reminisces about many persons “around” Kafka’s work he has got to know during his literary career, since having read Kafka for the first time as a student during the Protectorate. Milena Jesenská as the writer is then represented by her journalistic articles “People on the Promontory (The Fates of German Refugees)” from October 27, 1937; “Hundreds of Thousands Looking for No Man’s Land (The Wandering Jew in a Prague Street)” from July 27, 1938; and “In No Man’s Land” from December 29, 1938. These well written and courageous articles were translated and introduced by George Gibian, Cornell University, under the title “Refugees from Hitler in Czechoslovakia, 1937-1939.” This is a worthy sample of Milena on her own — without Kafka. We mentioned last time the Roman Jakobson “module,” which included Seifert’s “Russian Bliny.” “The Czech Comenius” was Jakobson’s first American publication, originally a lecture he delivered in Czech on December 5, 1942, in New York, shortly after he arrived as a refugee. He streses Comenius’ “Czechness,” though his works were written mainly in Latin, his patriotism and faith in-the future of the Czech nation. The next article, “Kokoschka’s Comenius” by Daria Rothe, explains the painter’s early acquaintance with Comenius’ work, specifically his Orbis pictus. Besides painting Comenius into the famous portrait of Masaryk, Kokoschka also created the play Comenius, an encounter between Rembrandt and the protagonist. He reworked the original version of 1936 in 1972. It was shown in 1975, on Kokoschka’s 89th birthday, on German television. Excerpts from Act IV are included. Peter Zdenek Schubert, University of Alberta, traces the background of “Resurgence of the Wallenstein Theme in Recent Czech Literature.” He explains the factors that have led to the feeling of “history repeating itself,” the parallel between the events in Bohemia in the 17th century and those of our days being personified by the still controversial figure of Wallenstein. “The Death of a Beautiful Fish” by Hana Svobodova, University of Amsterdam, is a tribute to the literary work of the late journalist and sports editor for the Prague Radio, Ota Pavel (1930-1973). The title alludes to his last collections of stories, The Death of Beautiful Deer (1971) and My Encounters with Fish (1974). Pavel’s autobiographical reminiscence, “A Race through Prague,” never before published in book form, follows. 16 [pageend16]Ondra Lysohorsky, real name Ervin Goj (b. 1905), is the protagonist of Igor Hajek’s, University of California, article “Poet of a New Nation.” Lysohorsky, at first greeted in the 1930’s as an heir of Bezruc, used the Lachian dialect which he considered an independent language and advocated the establishment of the Lachian region as a “nation.” He spent the war years in the USSR and was successful as a recognized and translated poet, a member of the All-Slavic Committee in Moscow and later of the Soviet Writers’ Union. After his return to Czechoslovakia he was not published until the late 1950’s. A volume of his old Lachian poems, in a Czech translation, appeared in 1964, but he by that time had changed his style and wrote in German. He was published in East Germany, Hungary and France; English translations were made by Auden and appeared in 1976. Thus the “Obstinate Non-Conformist” became more appreciated abroad than in his native country. Zdenka Brodská introduces — as “Words Without Bottom Filled to the Top” — a selection of poems by Jan Skácel, translated by Lynn Coffin. As many of his contemporaries, Skácel was not officially published during the 1970’s, but was well known and highly esteemed by his readers who were able to find the copies of his intimate, lyrical poems, especially his terse quatrains. The last section of the 410 pages of the yearbook is dedicated to the arts. The novelist Milan Kundera was asked to write a portrait of Leos Janacek, whose student Kundera’s father was. He gives the main points of Janacek’s life and work, as well as the characteristics of his original musical style. He says that Janacek’s music “remains unclassifiable, always surprising and, after half a century, still awaiting rediscovery.” Leontine Zimiles, Empire State College, wonders why the Czech Surrealist artist Toyen (1902, Prague - 1980, Paris) remains unrecognized in the United States. Toyen lived in Paris in the twenties and then again since 1947, being well known in the artistic circles. In Prague, Jaroslav Seifert knew her in her beginnings and gives her description in his memoirs, even saying that he suggested the name Toyen. She was an extremely private and rebellious person, remaining the “mystery of surrealism.” Jarka Μ. Burian, SUNY at Albany, informs about “Some Examples of Contemporary Theatre Planning and Activity in Czechoslovakia,” especially the renovation of the National Theatre for its 100th anniversary. The new, modern building for the Theatre Academy and another for the Laterna Magika will use all the new concepts of open and variable staging space, impossible to attain in older theatres.

A copy of the journal, or perhaps a yearbook, Slavica Othiniensia, 6, was received from Jaroslav Pavlik, one of the editors and a lecturer at the Slavic Institute, Odense University, Denmark. He has two articles in this issue. The first essay (p. 55 - 81), in German, is dedicated to an analysis of Frantisek Ladislav Celakovsky’s Mudrosloví národu slovanského ve příslovích (Philosophy of the Slavic People in Proverbs), which was first published in Prague in 1851 and since then has been reprinted in several newer editions. Celakovsky collected proverbs, folk sayings and farmers’ “weather predictions,” comparing the Czech and other Slavic versions with those existing in the classical, Romanic, Germanic and other languages. Pavlik concentrates on the Czech weather sayings and adds a whole row of equivalents of the “farmer’s wisdom” in Danish that do not exist in Celakovsky’s work. His second article (p. 82-105). also written in German, is dedicated to the “Exemplary and Ordinary Boys in Jaroslav Foglar’s book: Knaben vom Biberfluss,” (Pavlik does not indicate the Czech title; it could be translated as Boys from the Beaver River; the Czech original appeared in Prague in 1934). Pavlik published a biography of Foglar in the previous issue of the journal and this time writes about this one book. Foglar, a Scout leader himself, explores the adventures of a group of boys who develop their characters under the apt leadership of Rikitan. The badges they work to win, the friendships they make, all they learn are steps toward maturing as positive and highly responsible young men. Those are good qualities promoted by the Czechoslovak Scouts organizations — and also, which is something Pavlik does not say, qualities promoted by the Masaryk’s Republic, as many of the oldtimers growing up in the twenties and the thirties will immediately recognize, even if they do not remember Foglar’s book. In the reviews section Jaroslav Pavlik writes about the book Co vyprávěly stare pražské domy (What the Old Prague Houses Narrated, 1982) by Jan Wenig. Vera Pavlik, high school teacher and translator, reviews a Danish book, Tjekkoslovakiet (Czechoslovakia, 1982) by Sigurd Bo Bojesen and calls attention to all kinds of regretful and avoidable “cultural misunderstandings.” Just one example: The polka “Skoda lasky” (translatable as “What a pity I gave you my love”) appears in the book as “I love Skoda” - Skoda being the well-known industrial concern producing cars of that name, besides arms. It is worthwhile to read this review, written in German. Jaroslav and Vera Pavlik are new SVU members. They both studied at the Purkyne University in Brno. Together they published a special Russian- Czech Phraseologie Dictionary for History (Prague, 1957). Each has published own works in Czechoslovakia and in Denmark. Vera Pavlik is finishing the first Danish-Czech and Czech-Danish pocket dictionary. And they both are interested in, and contributing to the knowledge of Czechoslovak culture. It is good to know about their activities. 18 [pageend18]The following contributions in Slavics Othiniensia are in Danish. The article by Mikael Klefter has a short resume in German, explaining that he analyzes the “Jeans Prosa” in the USSR. Erik Kulavik writes about the novelist Andrej Bitov’s characters (the resume is in Russian). “Dostoevsky’s Dreamer Heroes and ‘A Little Hero’” by Preben Viladsen has the only resume in English. Marina Orlova-Jermak has an article in Russian, on ‘Semantic Relationships of International Words in Danish and Russian Languages,” using texts on economics as a basis of comparison. And vera Pavlik informs, in Russian, about Soviet libraries. The whole issue should be of interest to those who read all the languages or are interested in specific topics represented this time.

It involves Hanna Block and Walter Kohner, children of solid middle class Jewish families in Northern Bohemia. As teenagers they fell in love, became engaged in the late 1930’s were separated by War and Holocaust, and were miraculously reunited in 1945 to live happily ever after. The introductory chapter of how Sergeant Walter Kohner found Hanna in 1945 is told by him. Thereafter follow six double-chapters in which Walter and Hanna tell their version of what happened to them at different stages during the decade from the mid-1930’s to the end of World War II. The book ends with a moving Hollywood type epilogue: In May 1953 Hanna’s story was televised on the This is Your Life show; the fate of major actors in the couple’s life was updated. After a number of miscarriages, due to an abortion in the Auschwitz extermination camp, Hanna got pregnant in Fall 1953. Patriotically enough, a daughter Julie was born on July 4, 1955. Logically enough, the book is dedicated to “our daughter Julie and to the memory of her grandparents whom she never knew.” Frank Meissner ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ 19 [pageend19]BALLET New York born Nina Brzorad found her career very early in her life. At 11, she was enrolled at Balanchine’s School of American Ballet and later also studied modern dance with the Alvin Ailey group. She performed as a child and at 16 danced with the Eglevsky Ballet Company. She became a member of the American Ballet Theater in 1974. In 1977 she was engaged as the prima ballerina at the Iranian National Ballet and performed principal roles in Sleeping Beauty, Nutcracker, Romeo and Juliet, and other ballets. In Iran she met the dancer-choreographer Ali Pourfarrokh, her future husband. Mr. Pourfarrokh had studied at the Metropolitan Opera Ballet School, the American Ballet Theater and with the Martha Graham School of Modern Dance. During 1970 to 1972 he was the principal dancer and choreographer with the Garden State Ballet in New Jersey, and then went to the Iranian National Ballet in Tehran. Both artists spent three years at the Essener Ballet in Germany, where Ali, in his role of co-director and resident choreographer, created many works for Nina. They recently returned to New York and settled in Port Washington, forming their own company, Dance Theater of Long Island, combined with their North Shore School of Dance. Last December they inaugurated their local activities with a performance of the Nutcracker, Act II. Besides that, Mr. Pourfarrokh choreographed two shorter works, using music by Debussy and Josef Suk. • We wish the couple much success in their artistic careers, and welcome Nina Brzorad to our Society. ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ FINE ARTS This time we have information about some fine arts events from Europe. Pravoslav Sovak has lived in Switzerland since 1968. He has currently exhibited his drawings and prints at the Art Association in Mannheim, Germany, evoking strong, positive responses from the critics, just as he did on a prior occasion in Paris. One unusual feature reportedly is his attitude of taking a risk by going his way, against the “spirit of the times.” His brilliant and original techniques make the viewer pause. As Milan Kundera says, “any millimeter of the paper presents a problem over which one could meditate for many months.” ★ The second event is the exhibition of “Czech Art 1878-1914” in Darmstadt, arranged by Czechoslovakia. A long review in Die Zeit praises the selection of paintings, sculptures, art objects and plans or photos of architectural works, by artists little known abroad. The exhibition illustrates the development of Czech art from the nationalistic romanticism to cubism and proves that there were other important artists besides the few well known ones, like Mucha, Kupka, Gutfreund and perhaps Preisler, according to the reviewer Helmut Schneider. He also feels that this exhibition gives Darmstadt an excellent overview of works which are usually held in several Prague museums. ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ 20 [pageend20]News Received Dr. Frank Hovorka, Hurlbut Professor of Chemistry Emeritus at Case Western Reserve University, died on April 9, 1984. Dr. Hovorka spend his entire teaching career at Western Reserve College and CWRU, where he was known both as an outstanding teacher and as an outstanding scholar. In 1973, the Board of Trustees of the University established the Frank Hovorka Chair in the Department of Chemistry in his honor. Born August 5, 1897 in Bohemia, Austria-Hungary, Dr. Hovorka immigrated to the United States in 1913. He received the B.A. in 1922 from Iowa State Teachers College (now the University of Northern Iowa), the M.S. in 1923 from the University of Illinois, and the Ph.D. in 1925 from the University of Illinois. He joined the Western Reserve University faculty in 1925 as an instructor in Chemistry, rising to become full professor and director of university chemistry labs in 1942 and to a chaired professorship as Hurlbut Professor of Chemistry in 1954. He was chairman of the chemistry department for ten years, from 1950 to 1958 and from 1962 to 1964. “His virtuosity in the classroom and his extraordinary ability as a counselor are attested to by the respect with which he is held by former students,” the late CWRU historian C. H. Cramer wrote of Dr. Hovorka. “He enjoyed thoroughly the counseling of both undergraduate and graduate students.” He supervised theses for over 45 masters degree and 63 doctoral candidates, a number unparalleled on the campus. His major scholarly concentration was in electrochemistry. He was responsible for more than 100 papers published in professional journals or delivered at national scientific meetings. He perfected platinized graphite electrodes in the 1930’s, paving the way for today’s fuel cells. He pioneered the development of improved techniques for measuring the acid concentrations of solutions, work of importance not only in chemistry but in biology, medicine and dentistry. He was likewise a pioneer in interdisciplinary research, collaborating with faculty members in medicine and dentistry many years before such collaboration was common. During his lifetime, Dr. Hovorka was listed in many professional journals, notable among them are Who’s Who in America, World Who’s Who in Science - From Antiquity to the Present, American Men of Science, Leaders in American Science, Chemical Who’s Who, Leaders in American Education, Who’s Who in Engineering, and Who’s Who in the World. Selected some years ago as one of the 25 outstanding Czech-Americans, Frank Hovorka was a credit to his heritage and an inspiration to every person whose life he touched. Ralph J. Perk, then mayor of Cleveland, designated June 16, 1973 as FRANK HOVORKA DAY IN CLEVALAND, and stated, “The Hovorka Chair in Chemistry at Case Western Reserve University is a source of pride to Cleveland and the nation.” 21 [pageend21]When he retired in 1968, the Department of Chemistry appointed Dr. Hovorka as a consultant. He continued with his work, arriving at the University at 7:30 a.m. daily until his death. In June, 1926, he married Sophie Nickel. She died in 1979. In July, 1982 he married Dorothy Humel, a trustee of Case Western Reserve University, the Musical Arts Association, The Cleveland Institute of Music, University Circle, Inc. and other Cleveland organizations. The Hovorkas resided in Shaker Heights. He is survived by Mrs. Hovorka. The Frank Hovorka Memorial Fund has already been established at Case Western Reserve University.
