Paul Tabori and George Faludy [pageend2]ARENA A Legend Old chronicles tell of a land where it was the custom that everybody walked around with bowed head. By law and tradition these people were forbidden to throw even a furtive glance toward the sky. Archeological conjecture has it that this impractical custom was first introduced by a tyrant who felt so superior that he forbade his subjects to lift their eyes to his sacred throne. He demanded this submissiveness even from his family. His death came so suddenly that he could not explain to his eldest son the arbitrariness of this prohibition. Thus the new ruler ascended the throne with lowered eyes and guarded the hallowed rule more strictly even than his predecessor. The priests and officials of that realm spread the doctrine that anybody who glanced at the sky would instantly be struck dead. The rays from above were considered deadly. Occasional thunderbolts were interpreted to be saying that some rebel had just dared to look upward. The physicists and artists agreed that the sky’s color was yellow — a special, indescribable, horrifying yellow which did not occur on the earth. The more fanatical adherents of this dogma went through life crawling on their bellies. Soon the 1 [pageend3]country’s society was organized, so that the mean- minded, the sneaky people were granted the most exalted positions : the lowliest had become the highest on the social scale. The babies in their cradles lay only on their stomachs, and the dead were interred with their faces sunk in the dust. Since these people did not know any other mode of existence, they ignored their subjection to fear and magic oppression. One morning — the chronicles tell us that it was in springtime — a young man and a girl walked over a meadow. The sight of the flowers at their feet delighted them; and the maiden remarked that the blue blossoms seemed the loveliest of all. Both regretted that the color blue, which for them had indistinct connotations of bliss, was not the prevailing cosmic hue. Although they sauntered around with deeply bowed heads, as was the prescription, they probably had not watched their steps : anyway, they stumbled and fell into the grass. At first they obediently hid their faces on the ground. But soon the girl wanted to see her friend’s features, and turned her head. Then she saw the beloved face framed by the sky. « Look, the sky is blue ! » she cried in utter confusion and amazement. After the youth had conquered his terror at the blasphemy, he too dared to look up. Swept away by the incredible happiness of the discovery, he Mssed the girl, jumped up and ran to the town. « The sky is blue », he kept shouting, « look how radiantly blue the sky is ! » And he pointed upwards with outstretched arms. But the people he met cowered and hid in order not to be struck by the lightning which was about to fell the youth. The young fool stood in the center of the market place, ecstatically erect, when the militia surrounded and captured him. Of course he had to be 2 [pageend4]executed for his breach of all decency and piety. Manacled, he was stood against the temple wall; and a platoon of stooped sharpshooters loaded their weapons. Confused by the blissful smile on the doomed criminal’s face, one sharpshooter felt the impulse to verify the fool’s statement. Pretending to examine his weapon, he threw a furtive glance to the upper regions. He nudged the next man : « That villain seems to be right, the sky is blue. » « Fall in ! » ordered the officer. « Indeed, the sky is blue », whispered the next man to the third one. « Take aim ! » cried the officer. « Blue. And nothing happens. » « Nothing can happen to us », they murmured. « Shoot ! » yelled the officer. But his soldiers stared upward and forgot to execute the blasphemer. When no yellow thunderbolt crashed down on the mutineers, some of the spectators looked up too; and soon the square was filled with men and women who dared to observe the reality of the world. The dark spell had lost its power. For several centuries afterwards — so the chronicles relate — a monument stood on the market place showing a young couple with enthusiastically uplifted eyes. Stephan LACKNER 3 [pageend5]THE P.E.N. IN EXILE : SLOVAKS František Vnuk SLOVAK LITERATURE IN EXILE The two thousand Slovak intellectuals leaving Slovakia with their families in April 1945 to escape the advancing Soviet armies included some of the best known Slovak novelists (Hronsky, Urban) and poets (Žarnov, Dilong, Sprinc, Strmen). Three years later, after the Communist coup d’état in Prague, there were still more writers among the new wave of refugees from tyranny. One could, perhaps, compare this exodus with the flight of Polish men-of-Ietters to France after the collapse of the 1831 revolt against Russia. Torn from their natural habitat by a chain of events beyond their control, the Slovak émigré writers (as well as the émigré writers of other Central European nations) recovered only slowly, and never completely, from the heavy blows and still heavier psychological shocks of the hard and inhospitable life of the exile. Being too much the true sons of their own nation, they failed, as a rule, to strike roots in new surroundings. Thus they have come to represent a pathetic group, steeped deeply in their own mental and spiritual sufferings and longing for the return of better days. There are some forty Slovak émigrés who at one time or another have shown visible signs of literary creativeness. Their organization, the Association of ’4 [pageend6]Slovak Writers and Artists, was founded in January 1956 (President : A. Žarnov, Secretary : M. Sprinc). Most (The Bridge) is their official quarterly organ. This journal and Literárny almanach (Literary Almanach, edited by J. Pauco) are the two best known avenues open to the literary efforts of Slovak writers. In addition, several novels have been serialized in the twice- weekly, Slovenska Obrana (1946-1950), and in the weekly, Slovak v Amerike (since 1958) and subsequently published in book form. Still the number of belletristic books appearing annually seldom has exceeded ten titles and the rate is decreasing. Practically all the Slovak writers now in exile had already made their literary reputations before 1945, at home. There have been no newcomers to speak of, and with the passage of time emigre literature is becoming a rapidly withering branch of contemporary Slovak literature. Nevertheless, in spite of all these defects, difficulties and melancholy thoughts, the emigre branch of Slovak literature has some significant shoots worthy of a closer look and deeper attention. The Slovak writers abroad may have become victims of their own nostalgia and homesickness, as well as ardent advocates of poetic justice in a prosaic world, but their works are at least free of the cult of personality, formalism and other diseases of socialist realism which, having been imposed on their less fortunate brethren, have paralysed Slovak literature at home. In the field of poetry a very prominent place is occupied by Karol Strmen (1921-) now living in the U.S.A. This promising poet and able translator has matured in exile which has widened his outlook and brought new qualities into his poetry. His two books of verse show him to be a truly European poet of great sensitivity. The first collection, Básne nepreverených (The Poems of the Dispossessed, 1948) still mirrors the poet’s personal sadness over his own and his nation’s tragedy. 5 [pageend7]Strieborná legenda (The Silver Legend, 1950) contains some of the most beautiful love poems in the Slovak language. Strmen’s translations from English, French, Spanish, Italian, etc. into Slovak further demonstrate the poetic skill and ability of this fine artist. Mikuláš Sprinc (1914-) editor of the quarterly Most (The Bridge, since 1954) and instructor at the Borro- meo Seminary in Cleveland (Ohio) was known before 1945 mainly as a translator of Papini, Rilke and Western authors of the Catholic Revival. In 1949 he surprised his reading public with an unusual and most readable account of his odyssey to the U. S. A., K slobodným. pobrežiam (Towards the Coasts of Freedom, 1949), followed shortly afterwards by a book of poems, Ozveny v samotach (Echoes in Solitude, 1949). His poetry is still in a state of flux, showing unmistakable influences of the Spanish, French and Italian poets, culture and scenery. His verse is at its best in Vinohrad (Vineyard, 1950) written partly in Italy. Sprinc’s other publications include collections of poems, Tvarou proti slnku (Face towards the Sun, 1956), Z poludnia a polnoci (From South and from North, 1960) and Mladost orla (Eagle’s Youth, 1962); light essays, Cesty a osudy (Journeys and Destinies, 1957); lyrical religious meditations, Matka krásneho milovania (Mother of Fair Love, 1954); translations from Papini, etc. Andrej Zamov (pen-name of F. Subik, 1903-) was one of the best known Slovak poets of an intense nationalist sentiment. A doctor by profession, he now lives in the U. S. A. where he emigrated in 1952. Here he has written only a few poems. One of them, Slovensky zial (Slovak Sorrow, 1954), is an eloquent and poetically very powerful lamentation over the sorrowful Slovak present. Rudolf Dilong (1905-), a Franciscan friar now living in the Argentine, is as prolific a writer abroad as he was at home (where in the period 1939-1943 he publish6 [pageend8]ed some ten books of verse). Dilong’s poetry is too diverse and volatile for a short characterization, especially as he is better at imitation than at originality. His « novel » (of 78 pages) Pieseň lásky (The Song of Love, 1953) is heavily laden with sentimental lyrical images; another novel, Bez matky (Without Mother, 1955), is partly autobiographical. Other interes ing products of Dilong’s versatile and many-sided mind are religious legends in Golgota (Golgotha), books of poems, Balady (Ballads, 1953), Za svetlom (In the Pursuit of Light, 1954), Na vrchu nádeji (On the Crest of Hope, 1955), Dotyk s vecnostou (Contact with Eternity, 1961), etc. Gorazd Zvoničky (1923-) is a Salesian priest who experienced the Communist closing of monasteries in Slovakia and subsequently escaped. His poetry, though written in far-away Argentina, is typically Slovak and emigre. In a passionate outburst of protest and accusation, the poet cries out for the Lord’s vengeance. He has published many poems in various Slovak journals and magazines and recently a book of verse, S ukazovákom na mraku (Indexfinger on the Cloud, 1958). Another emigre writer still deeply rooted in his native soil, Jozef Varínsky (1922-) is the author of a booklet of poems, Krvavé roraty (Bloody « Rorate »- mass, 1961). Marian Ziar (pen-name of Imrich Kruzliak, 1914-), a poet of articulate verse, lives in Germany. His poems appear mainly in Most and bear witness to an alert eye for the contemporary literary scene in the West. But Ziar is also a keen and sympathetic observer of literary events behind the Iron Curtain. He has published translations of the East European poetry of the post- Stalinist « thaw »-period, Podaj nam ruku, Europa ! (Grasp our Hand, Europe, 1956). In 1955 he edited Modlitby v putách (Prayers of Those in Chains, 1955), a 7 [pageend9]most remarkable collection of poems of anonymous prisoners of the Communist regime. Other poets whose contributions sporadically appear (or used to appear) in the Slovak press abroad are : Jan Okal, author of a booklet of 15 short poems, Kronika Slovákov (Chronicle of the Slovaks, 1954) and of a satirical novel, Blizenci (Gemini, 1962) ; L. Bese- novsky, M. Juskova, J. Zvonar-Tien, J. Doranský, K. K. Geraldini, Vagovic, Dragos-Alzbetincan, L. Sebesta, M. Chudoba and others. Among prose writers, the most distinguished was Jozef Ciger-Hronsky (1896-1960), an outstanding master of the Slovak language. His profound knowledge of the psyche of the Slovak oclittle man» enabled him to depict the complex pattern of Slovak village life with unsurpassed artistry. In exile, in addition to a number of short stories, he wrote a historical novel Andreas Bur, majster (Magister Andreas Bur, 1948). His most ambi tious project, a novel, Svet na Trasovisku (The World at Trasovisko, 1960), did not reach the standard of his best pre-1945 writings. The action in this novel takes place mostly during the last year of the war. Juraj Slavik (1890-) wrote poetry before 1919 (under the pen-name Neresnicky). In subsequent years he became deeply involved in politics and abandoned poetical pursuits. His last position was that of Czechoslovak Ambassador to the U.S.A. Having resigned this post in 1948, he returned to writing. In 1952 he started with the serialized publication in New Yorksky Dennik (The New York Daily) of his memoirs, of which the first volume Detstvo, chlapectvo, mladenectvo (Infancy, Boyhood, Youth) appeared in book form in 1955. It is a delightful recollection of persons and past events, narrated in a simple, unassuming style. The book contains many passages of lyrical beauty and has a powerful emotional appeal. 8 [pageend10]Draga Divinska (pen-name of Draga Paucova, 1922-) is a sensitive writer of short stories. Her prose work has trne feminine freshness and shows signs of a search for an expressive individuality. Pavol Hrtus-Jurina (1919-) started as an author of very great promise. Since his emigration to Australia (in 1949) only a small fraction of these expectations has been realised. In exile he has published a few short stories of imaginative vividness and rich lyrical undertones. Norin (pen-name of Juraj Ciger) published his first and so far only novel, Tri stoličky (Three Chairs, 1947), after which he withdrew into silence. Among other writers of prose one might mention M. Gerdelan, author of a novel, Krai otrokov (The King of Slaves, 1962); M. Dafcik, A. Kalnik, T. Rjachinova, J. Dafcik, J. Detvan, R. Kalencik. The impact and consequences of the imposition of the Communist regime over the Slovaks served as a subject matter for several books in English. While the Reverend L. M. Telepun’s experiences as recorded in The Bloody Footprints (1954) have a ring of improbability, the book of Sister Cecilia Barath («ghost-written» by William Brinkley), The Deliverance of Sister Cecilia (1954) unfolds a sincere and touching story which captured the minds of many readers in the English-speaking world. This kind of dramatically rich documentary prose found an interesting interpreter in Jozef Pauco (1914-), the author of two semi-documentary novels, The Uncon~ querables (1958) and The Flight to Wonderland (in the press). J. Pauco is a professional journalist and political writer, facts which visibly colour his literary writings. There is no outstanding dramatic achievement among the works produced by Slovak emigre writers. Their drama reflects most plainly the emigre obsession with the 9 [pageend11]nostalgia of the past. Milan Novak’s (pen-name of K. Strmen) dramatic attempt, Krvavý kriz (Cross of Blood, 1950), misfired and turned out to be a languishing melodrama. Jan Doransky (1911-), living in Canada, is the author of several plays of which the most successful, Stara mat, neopustajte nas ! (Grandmother do not Leave us Alone, 1956), was staged by some Slovak dramatic societies in Canada, Argentina and the U. S. A. J. Zvonar-Tien published in Canada his drama in Alexandrine verse, Ohne (Flames, 1956), which was originally written in 1942 and which deals with the events in the revolutionary years 1848-1849. Some writers tried to revive in their dramas the distant history of the ninth century when Slovakia was the setting of glorious and fondly remembered events. Thus Cyril Ondrus wrote a play named after the greatest ruler of the Great Moravian kingdom, Svätopluk (1956) ; Rudolf Dilong called his dramatic experiment after a Slovak disciple of St. Cyril and Methodius, Gorazd (1963). Such is, in outline, the picture of Slovak literature in exile. Its achievements, if measured by the number of books published, may not be very impressive. But when measured against the heavy odds it has had to overcome, these accomplishments will have an honourable place in future histories of Slovak literature. 10 [pageend12]Rudolf Dilong PSAUME Seigneur, voile de lumière la lame sanglante de l’âge, Envoie tes anges sur les routes. Le dernier rayon de la lune s’éloigne des yeux de [l’homme, Et l’ombre envahit la terre des fils de Dieu. Car je marche sur les tristes chemins Et je trouve à chaque pas un Abel mort. Me voici entouré des frères de Caïn. Dois-je leur chanter les Saintes Heures ? Le chant du jeune Abel était si beau Seigneur, que je suis prêt à mourir debout. Je n’ai pas peur : le ciel resplendit sur les montagnes Et tu me précèdes, Pasteur de mes jours. Mes yeux te suivent comme tes brebis. Et vois, je marche dans la foule avide de sang. O, Seigneur, Tu connais celui qui voudrait nve tuer, Pardonne-lui quand tu le verras. Emplis mon cœur d’amour : Je ne dois pas maudire mon ennemi, moi non plus... Mon dernier chant s’élance Vers les deux entr’ouverts : Je veux bénir encore Ceux qui m’ont assisté A mon suprême instant. Ensuite, que sur la terre resplendisse la lumière. La paix soit avec vous, mes Frères. Traduit par Mme Renée Perréal Miskus en collaboration avec Mme Marcelle Mattret. 1! [pageend13]Andrej Zarnov POUSSIERE ROUGE Le soleil se noyait dans le sang, J’avais peur de faire un pas, Tout fasciné, Et, le visage en feu, je m’arrêtais dans le champ. Des sillons abreuvés de larmes séculaires, La poudre s’éleva en flammes d’orage. Le soleil sifflait dans le sang, La poudre rouge brûlait mes lèvres. La nuit noire tomba sur la route Et, comme d’une enclume, Elle fit jaillir des mottes Une dure chanson : Vous, poussière des serfs, Vous, race maudite, Vous n’avez pas trouvé le bonheur, L’amour, sous la voûte des cieux. Les nuages fuyaient à l’horizon, Feuilles enflammées du couchant. Ce qui a grandi dans le sang Semblera écrasé... Mais ne périra point. Traduit par M"1 Perréal Miskus en collaboration avec Mlle Marcelle Mattret. 12 [pageend14]Karol Strmen THREE PRAYERS I Before me with Your passion You appear. I know Your one concern—am I. Obsessed, for months on end You’ve given me no rest. Hold out, Lord. Look, I’m filled with fear. There is no love in me worthy of awe, nor have I seen the ladder Jacob saw. I stand here silent with a skull to mend, in Your long line of Levites—at the end. Why have I lived, if I’m to finish stranded? Who will receive me, if You should forsake me? Caress me like a goat guilty of error, unto Yourself with both Your strong [hands take me, with Your own mark let my back be branded, and in Your sacred blood immerse my terror. II What have I of the world? A meagre gain: official dust to shrivel up the spirit. Nothing have I. No storehouse and no grain. Even my speech has nothing to endear it. We’ve met already, Lord. Your choice likewise is one: the opposite of capital, a robe of scorn and me t.o guard the prize. 13 [pageend15]My lips puff up from vinegar and gall, warm blood I carry folded in my shawl, and we together fear and sympathize. m You wish to have me glorify You. How? For You want everything. My spirit. Me. Smoke from the chimneys veils the city’s brow, a coal dust nurtured rose is vanity. Am I to ask? Oh, I’m a practiced hand at that. Grasping Your pocket, Your very best, I beg again for solace and fatherland. A pauper, could I importune for less? Suitor Divine, turn not aside from here where sleeps my son and crimson turns the cup. But sue again, although I go to cheer no one with ready smile and jovial jests. In this poor dwelling where the simple sup increase the wine for Your dear wedding guests. Translated by Jaroslav Vajda. Mikulas Sprinc SO LONG AS ONE OF YOU SUFFERS So long as one of you suffers, the anguish will be mine, thorn of my discontent: a lonely voice will cry out loud, again and again, the voice of a depth which breathes, which has a right to be, 14 [pageend16]in which reverberates the echo of justice. And not the vanity of a solitary poet. Place on the wound a medal: pain is worthy of honor. The world is such an invalid, only numbers count any more: words and words, miserable dust. Here as well there, fools freely sound forth: as vain as it is to throw peas against a wail, whereon with infinite deception they blithely hang their crowns. Your duty, poet: Terrify! If not, your hours are numbered. Here, too, above the comfort a voice is heard, yours, shining and piercing the haze like an eagle’s eye. Not otherwise. Thus. Translated by Jaroslav Vajda. Draga Divinska THE RETURN You are a fugitive huddled in the woods. There you hide, filled with the terror and commotion of war. When the big guns convulse the air, you crouch under a tall fir tree or between the wheels of a wagon. You pray for your life, but you petition most frequently 15 [pageend17]for the day when the dove of peace will fly to you and alight on your shoulder. You will pour into your band a generous portion of grain for her to peck. Your offer of food will be liberal, for you know that in the peace proclaimed by the dove there will be more grain to come. You will be able to sow it, and no one will dig it up. You will see it sprout, and no one will break the delicate stem. The shoots will grow sturdy, they will saturate themselves with greenness, and when they turn to stalks they will wave in the wind. Only the wind will bend them and sway them. No soldier’s boots will trample them, nor wheels of caissons press them into the ground, grinding out their emerging life. Ears of grain will lift their heads from their green pillows, stretching them toward the sun. They will innocently steal the sun’s rays as flowers plunder the morning dew. The kernels will grow fat as they don their golden yellow coat of ripeness. And the time of the harvest will come. And no one will summon the reaper from the harvest and ask him to exchange his scythe for a gun and leave the grain rotting in the field. When the reaper remains a reaper, he will mow the harvest so that there may be full pourings and generous handfuls once again. You think of this as you stroke the dove. She will peck up the handful of grain and fly away to announce the arrival of peace to others. Three seeds will remain in your hand. In the hope kindled by the dove you see them multiply and fill your hand again. So it will be, for the dove signifies peace, and peace signifies a full hand. When Mircetic awakens one morning and the day greets him quietly without gunfire, he has difficulty believing that peace has really arrived, for he does not see the dove. He stretches his limbs and lis'ens to the silence. He drinks it in thirstily after such a long time of hearing the incessant concussions. This new silence 16 [pageend18]is oil for his eardrums as the hammers finally stop beating on the anvil. « Miloje, do you hear ? » « What am I to hear, father ? » « The silence. The wonderful silence. The cannon have stopped thundering, and the whining of the rifles has ceased. Even the forest is still as after a storm. Not a leaf stirs. If it stays like this, peace has come to us again. » « Something is happening that hasn’t happened for a long time. Only I don’t know what it is. How would it be to go to the edge of the woods and find out ? Maybe the front has passed by and we will be able to go back home. What do you think, father ? Shall we go and take a look at Skela ? » «c Come, but don’t awaken anyone. We’ll manage. » And so they set out, father and son, to become messengers. They do not know as yet what they will announce to the others. To learn for themselves as quickly as possible, they forge through the underbrush hurriedly. They do not mind that the thorns scratch their hands and faces. That is the smallest sacrifice to make for the news that the fighting is over. They come to the edge of the forest and stop to evaluate the situation. Their glance flies across the fields, unintercepted by the sight of any soldier. They look at Skela, through which the front has passed. It lies there where they left it. It hasn’t moved an inch; it hasn’t been carried away by the horses. It is somewhat blackened, however, and its outline is blurred, making it look unworldly. The white houses do not show up white, and their red roofs are not reddish. It is all blended into a gray mist in the valley between the hills. « Something has happened to our Skela, father. It’s like... » 17 [pageend19]« As it is, so it is, but it is. When we left, we thought we might never see it again. And now it fills our eyes. Our Skela. The front has drawn a smoky veil over it. We’ll make it white again. We’ll dress it up in holiday clothes, for this is a holiday. Our Skela has survived the war and waits for us. Let’s not keep her waiting long. » They ran back into the forest with the good news, and the woods helped them spread it. From fir to fir, from bush to bush, they murmured : « The war is over — over. Skela is empty — empty. Forsaken — ’saken. With open arms she waits for her children — children. » Skela’s children clapped their hands when they heard the news. The forest had prepared them the loveliest concert, plucking on their feelings instead of strings. Feelings, such as love for the native village, joy, and hope that they will see it again and live there again. From these rosy hopes the forest wove a wreath which they would place around Skela’s head when they came home. To keep the wreath from wilting until then, they watered it with tears of thanksgiving. Mingling tears and laughter they threw everything into the wagons and bags they had scattered throughout the forest. And they threw themselves into the wagons as quickly as they could or flung their bags over their back, and off they went ! The same procession of wagons and walkers which had evacuated Skela before the front arrived, now began to move out of the forest. Skela’s children were returning home. The forest gazed at the departing fugitives. « I was their mother for such a short time, and they my children so briefly. » The forest had become accustomed to the fugitives, and now it missed their human converse. With whom could it now laugh or cry ? It will laugh again when 18 [pageend20]they come back picking mushrooms and the fruits of the forest. It will weep with them when they come for wood that will fall on them, cripple them, and pierce them. But it will have them only occasionally as guests y they will not belong to the forest. Henceforth they will belong to Skela. The Skelanites returned home over dry and cracking fields. As they drew near to Skela, the fields grew moist with the most precious moisture and they were planted with the most precious seeds. It was the costliest moisture that nevertheless dries the fastest. They were the costliest seeds which, however, would not produce life. Dead moisture and dead seeds. On the parched fields, the sacrifices of war lay in pools of blood. They had come in ^love-grey uniforms from every country in central Europe here to lay down their lives. For the fatherland. For freedom. There were so many benefactors that the living could not keep up with the burials. The dead bodies of the soldiers were waiting to be buried. Blood-caked. Mangled. One’s legs were torn off, another’s bodv rested without its head. The separated head was spilling its brains out through empty eyesockets. A sight too dreadful to behold. The Skelanites shuddered. They 6tood benumbed, and the wreath of hope with which they were going to adorn Skela, they placed at the feet of the fallen soldiers. They knew what kind of Skela awaited them. A Skela full of dead inhabitants. Skela — a cemetery. The eagerness with which they had set out for home died with the dead on the field. There was nothing to be happy about. They would not live in hope. First they would be grave-diggers. And if they found someone from their families among the dead, they would be orphans. And if they were greeted by a heap of rubble instead of a home, they would be beggars. Nothing good awaited them in Skela, the graveyard. 19 [pageend21]« Why hurry ? Let’s stop here. We’ll be gravediggers. We’ll be orphans. And then we’ll be beggars. » And so it was. When they arrived in Skela, they were beggars. They saw why the village looked like a grey mist. Why the walls were not white and the roofs not red. There was no white wall left standing, and no red roof that would cover it. The houses that were left standing were spattered with smoke and mud. Those were the more fortunate ones. There were more that were transformed into greyish-black piles of stone. One next to the other, without a fence, without a boundary. Guess, owner, which rubble is whose ? You have guessed. It all belongs to the beggars, for the beggars have returned to Skela. (Translated by Jaroslav Vajda.) Felix Mikula A FRIEND OF MINE DIED It could not happen otherwise — for I saw him the first time when he was dying. Should you be interested to know his name, I could present you with a long series of names. Right now, though, I have in mind just one of many dying friends. His name was Avite. I spent many horn's 20 [pageend22]at his bedside. Through him, I realised that a priest — at the moment he decides to become a priest — consents to have as his friends the dying and the dead. The idea of friendship implies a «sharing of goods», of interests. Which is the most acute interest of a man when he already stands on the threshold of eternity? It is the interest in Him whose word the priest spreads throughout his life and imparts to his fellow men. An intense interest in eternal God will certainly unite any two persons in a genuine and ennobling friendship. I realised this most convincingly at the death bed of Avite. I once asked him whether he wished for something I might provide for him. He answered : « No, thank you; just keep me united with God.» A splendid reply. A friendship with dying people may appear rather cheerless at first sight. On the other hand, we have friends everywhere; and they, too, are sineerely devoted to us. An unfortunate incident almost deprived me of Avite’s friendship. One of his workmates, entrusted with the « sick call », gave me the wrong address. When I rang the bell (it was a pretty dark evening) an old lady reluctantly opened the door. She was literally scared of me. «I never asked for a priest», she asserted. Maybe it was the first time in her life she talked to a Catholic priest; or she may have reasoned: what sort of priest in America would walk such a long distance in this darkness, in this heat? —- Fortunately, I had made a note of Avite’s telephone number. The cautious lady did not let me in to make the call but she herself found the right address for me. After that, I had to walk another mile or so, to the astonishment of all the car drivers, until one of them recognized me and gave me a lift. 21 [pageend23]AMERICANS, WHEN THEY FACE DEATH Before I resume my story I have to tell you that dying Americans generally are interesting, lovable people, i.e. to us, Europeans. Their first look at you betrays surprise. When you start talking to them they focus their attention on your foreign accent; and they watch you, forgetting to answer your questions. Finally they ask: «Where are you from, Father? » I can tell you that the ice begins to melt when thet learn that « Father » has come from Europe. Nowhere have I met such confidence as that of the brave Americans when they are dying. They may not have much time for feelings or meditation when they are in good health. They may appear too « practical » and reserved. But when facing death they warmly appreciate somebody letting them feel the « European heart ». They watch you with undisguised satisfaction, as if great-grandmother Europe herself were looking at them with your eyes. She had to send their forefathers away, for she was poor and could by no means provide a bed of roses for her children. Still, the forefathers told their descendants nostalgic stories about her — and all of a sudden she comes to see them, in a situation in which they need something that cannot be bought for any amount of dollars. Once I visited a lady who had attempted suicide. Continuous fits of crying made conversation impossible. Only when I called the third time did I find the lady in a fairly peaceful mood. She then told me: « You have time to talk to people. You are not in a hurry all the time. You have given me back the courage to go on living.» Her husband joined in: « And you had to come for that from... I don’t even know where you’ve come from.» — We have remained good friends ever since. 22 [pageend24]Or take old Joe W. Death got a grip on him in the form of a cruel stomach cancer. Joe suffered immensely. In his suffering, he was mostly alone, sitting in an armchair. They called it « Convalescent Home » where he had to wait for death. On my first visit we had only a short conversation. But he evidently liked it and called after me: «Come again!» He repeated his «come again» after each further visit, even after the last one... Whenever I came to see him he asked me candidly to hold up his head («The way they hang people», he had to explain because I did not understand his request right away) for it sank forward and caused a terrible pain in his neck. He also asked me to rub the upper part of his feverish body with alcohol. And on the last day of his life he gratefully accepted all services. Naturally, a refugee feels well if he can bring somebody a little happiness. His presence may disturb well-to-do people, but he is quickly adopted as a brother by sufferers. I will make another general observation. Men in Texas look old for their age. They quite often suffer from stomach diseases, ulcers and cancer. The reason? Everything matures faster in the sunny South, people not excepted. Men there have to work harder than in Europe. Every family has at least one car; they very seldom use their feet for more than a hundred steps or so. I have never seen Americans promenading in the European sense. Practically every family owns a house, with enviable comforts. There is any amount of food. In other words: too many material advantages. AT AVITE’S BEDSIDE Let us now go back to our good Avite. I knew that I was going to an elderly man who did not realise that he was dying of cancer. Avite, in 23 [pageend25]his bed, looked like a starving poor devil. True, his eyes were still shining with energy. His face likewise preserved most of the traits carved on it by a strong will in past and better days. His friends and family had assured the dying man that a priest would only make a kind of routine call. Still, it was easy to see the surprise in his eyes. He had evidently imagined the priest somewhat different. We exchanged a few words, and then came the question: « Where are you from, Father? » What a welcome question to an exile ! He is sure of interested listeners. When I told Avite that, after a lucky and exciting escape from my country, I had spent many months in France, he proudly interjected that he also was « French » and started talking in Louisiana French. As a matter of fact, the majority of Catholics in Port Arthur (my first station) were of French descent. Two refineries (possibly the largest in the world) had lured them from neighbouring Louisiana to the new town. Louisiana was French until 1803; consequently, the older generation still predominantly speak French although they can neither write nor read it. Avite admitted that he had also moved vears ago to Port Arthur tó make more money. His ancestors were Belgians, but Louisiana made perfect «Frenchmen» out of them. Avite could probably coftverse better in English, but he found it more natural to say his prayers in the language of his forefathers. As you maÿ already have guessed, an «entente cordiale» was almost immediately established between the patient and the priest. Initial reserve, if any, soon gave way to the unrestrained communicativeness of a sufferer who feels himself in the presence of a well-disposed listener. Avite tried to explain his trouble to me in his own way. He said: «It is 24 [pageend26]something unusual; the doctors themselves cannot understand it although they have recently operated on me». He concluded his explanation with a sigh: «I should like to live at least a few more years. I have seven children, and some of them still need me». To comfort Avite, I told him that some diseases may last for years and yet get cured eventually. Judging Avite to be at least sixty years old, I insinuated: «The most critical age for men is fifty».-— «Good for me! I’ll be fifty-one pretty soon,» Avite replied, laughing at me kindheartedly because my consolation had been so unsuccessful. I thanked Heaven for Avite’s joke, for it gave me a chance to hide my embarrassment behind a smile. As if a little ashamed of his poor shape, in the presence of a healthy man, Avite continued: «I also used to be a strong man. I weighed 220 pounds; only (he did not want me to think of him as a stout and chubby fellow) that weight was due to my solid build; all the men in our family had broad shoulders and very strong bones. My folks will show you a picture of me, if you like.» Later, they not only showed me a nice picture of their dad but also presented me with it. «He was strong both physically and spiritually», was the description by one of his daughters on the day of his departure. His daughter was right. The photograph showed a stocky American watching the Gulf of Mexico; broad-shouldered and well-nourished; although be was only about 5.7 ft. tall the heavy weight of 220 pounds suited him very well. And, judging from the picture, he himself was conscious not only of those 220 pounds but of everything suiting him very well: a Texan belt, a straw hat pushed slightly over the forehead, an open shirt, yes, even that pensive look at the unruly Gulf of Mexico the waves of which 25 [pageend27]can treat huge sea monsters as irreverently as toys and, some sixty years ago, in infernal co-operation with a furious hurricane, plunged the harbour of Galveston into its depths. Obviously, when I came to see Avite, only those «strong bones» were left of his imposing stature and probably nothing of his sound self-respect. At a death bed, we usually face a human being longing for some moral support. It took a couple of days before I decided to see Avite again. His family received me a little reproachfully: «Father, dad has been waiting for you all the time.» And he sure was glad to see me again. After that, I had to call on him every day. The day of Avite’s death was an exception; on that day I had to hurry to his bedside three times. I administered the Sacraments to him on one of my first visits. Avite received them with the manly attitude of an American. — He became more and more communicative. We eventually conversed like two friends rather than priest and patient. Once he let me see his scarred body on which they had operated shortly before, without any hope of success. Avite, not knowing his sad fate, would repeat with the optimism of a child: «I am so weak only because I cannot eat, and I cannot digest even the very little food I take. Everything will get better as soon as I can enjoy my food again and walk outside.» The family asked me to disclose the plain thruth about his condition to their dad. I did so, as tactfully as I could, but I realised later that he had not understood me. Eventually, his wife had to tell him everything, only four days before he died. She had to do so: the pain increased, and Avite insisted that the doctors should once more open his stomach and 26 [pageend28]«take out that strange object which caused a terrible pressure.» Avite’s reaction to his wife’s frank words was edifying. He had one reproach though: «Why did you not tell me a long time ago? I could have saved you money before I die. The hospital and all those medicines were just a waste of time and money.» (Was he not, after all, an American — even four days before his death?) Thereafter, a genuine faith was the strongest factor influencing all his behaviour. I still consider it a privilege that I could withness such faith in Avite’s house during the last days of his life. Each visit meant a spiritual uplift to me. Avite had many friends, and his room was always crowded after sunset. We regularly recited a decade of the Rosary. All the visitors knelt down while praying. Avite whispered the «Hail Mary» in French. He received Holy Communion every day. Towards the end his pains steadily intensified. Nevertheless, he only took the prescribed sedatives every four hours. He avowed: «I suffer with joy for I think all the time of our Saviour.» He was often assailed by spasms so that he could not catch his breath for a long while. AVITE’S DEATH Its scythe mowed him down on November 15th, 1951, after sunset. The clairvoyance of dying peaple is proverbial. Avite foretold his death three days in advance. When his last week began he was told that some relatives from Louisiana would come to see him on 27 [pageend29]Saturday. He replied: «That will be too late; they ought to come on Thursday.» That Thursday morning, he seemed to know even the exact time of his last hour. One of his friends promised to come back «after tonight’s meeting», scheduled for seven o’clock. Avite warned him: «After the meeting will be too late.» He was right. His agony began at the same moment as that meeting. He did not look as if this could be his last day when I brought him Holy Communion on Thursday morning. True, he tried in vain to sit up in bed. He commented on his unsuccessful attempt: « I am weakening rapidly.» He held my hand longer than usual when I was about to leave. He evidently wanted to express something special, believing that I would not come again that day. All farewells are painful, even to healthy people. Therefore I tried to imitate the conventional forms, assuring my friend I would be with him whenever he should wish it, certainly at the usual evening hour. I meant what I promised. I wanted to be with Avite, especially in his last minutes although, generally, I do not like watch the horrifying struggle between death and poor human creatures. — Avite’s family assured me that somebody would fetch me if their dad’s condition should become critical. I had no peaceful moment that day. It is bad enough when death does not announce its coming. We feel even worse when we know the fatal day. Healthy people who are told the exact hour of their execution have to endure the greatest mental torment imaginable and therefore deserve the compassion of all decent people in the world. There was a telephone call for me soon after lunch. Avite’s family let me know that a car was on its way to pick me up. It seemed obvious that I would have 28 [pageend30]to say the prayers for the departing soul. I put the liturgical booklet into my pocket. When I sat in the car, driven by one of Avite’s daughters, I thought it unnecessary to ask any questions. Finally the lady herself broke the silence. She told me that her dad was not dying yet, that he only wished to talk to me urgently. (Was it true, then, that I was not superfluous in this country? I had had to flee from my home with empty hands; yet I had evidently brought something with me that even a strong American could appreciate in a moment when he hardly cared for anything in this world). The face of the dying man was contorted and his voice barely audible. He welcomed me with the simple words: «I wanted to talk to you.» We were left alone. I had to bend down to understand what my dying friend had to tell me. After be had done so, we spoke some short prayers and invocations, and I was ready to go. Avite seized both my hands and regarded me with a genuine smile all over his face. Any talking would have meant further fatigue for him, and I also preferred to remain silent. After all, I knew everything he wanted to say. He again understood; I hope so, because I did not resort to spoken words. In some situations of our enigmatic terrestrial life the human vocabulary has a painfully hollow sound. — Back at home, I spent all the afternoon waiting for the usual evening visit. One of our parishioners gave me a lift in his car. I shall regret all my life that I did not arrive at least some five minutes earlier that night: at the very moment I stepped over the threshold, the first cry of his agony hit my ears. Only measureless suffering can make a dying man strong enough to bring forth such a loud cry. 29 [pageend31]All I then saw might explain the Psalmist crying in his anguish: «The floods of Death encompassed me...» He could hardly have chosen more fitting words to express the agony of the spirit. I have not seen any man dying in such terrible pain as our brave Avite. His strong constitution, the pride of his better days, turned into a fatal disadvantage. He had been the very model of a peaceful sufferer during the past few days. But now he somehow regained a voice that penetrated into the marrow of one’s bones. His dark eyes, protruding from their hollows, were alight with the expiring vital energy and seemed desperately to look for something. His emaciated body somehow got the strength for a meaningless, convulsive tossing; but how could a dying organism contradict the whims of the instinct of self-preservation? Philosophers see in the pains of death special proof of the existence of the soul. Rightly so. If death were nothing but the disappearance of material energy it would be hard to explain that incredible flaring up of vitality and spiritual force in dying human creatures. Jiri Wolker, the poet, had to die in the prime of his life. He reasoned thus: «Death is by no means an evil in itself; death is just a small part of hard human life.» It is a pity he said it with such charm but — incompletely. He looked at death only with the eyes of a short-sighted creature. To a believer, death is not merely the most bitter part of a life that is ending with it, but also a blissful step into a new life that never ends. Blessed is a dying man if this faith is keeping watch over his death bed. Such was the case with Avite. His room was more crowded than ever before. While some of the visitors were trying to soothe his pain I started with the 30 [pageend32]others to recite the liturgical prayers destined for this unique moment. We commended the departing soul of our dear friend to the infinite mercy of his Creator. Avite evidently become aware of our devoted supplication, for he quietened considerably. When we had finished our devotions I stepped closer to him, without expecting him still to be able to take any notice of me. He recognized me, though. He fixed his eyes on me; then his lips managed to form the word «Father». — «Sure, Father is here, too,» was about all I could say in response. He tried to shake my hand; his look expressed a multitude of thoughts, but his lips remained closed. Let us hope he did not expect any words from me either. How could I have managed to utter any? I hope he could read my thoughts in my eyes. My last look at Avite contained also an apology to him that he was dying, in his own home, leaving a widow with seven children, whereas my lot and my determination were to go on living. I gave up my place by his bed to Avite’s wife, stepped back and started to pray the Sorrowful Rosary, with all the crowd present. Avite tried to pray with us for a while; now and then, he even pronounced something in a low voice. He gave no further sign of life when we prayed the last decade. His last words I could still understand were « Mon Dieu ». He addressed, in the language of his childhood, the Supreme Lord of life and death whom he was soon to meet face to face. I made the sign of the cross on his forehead and was ready to go. I said to the weeping widow: «Your husband was a good man; I’ll be happy all my life that I have met him.» 31 [pageend33]P.

(Translated by Joseph Sevecka.) 32 [pageend34]Marion Ziar WALL Wall — or walls, for they are many and rather different in kind too... Some could narrate of centuries! Work of human hands are all of them. Tiny flowers, moss or copse would cover them with time, mice pierce their holes beneath, birds build their nests upon, bats flutter over them at night, they make swallows titter on a sunny day; don’t mention sparrows, for you know too well the nasty treatment they give to all walls. Wall — walls: Men — barriers. Life rises both before them and behind; up to them shines the light, behind them hover mystery and fright; Death whets her scythe on their edges, they hide the burglar prying for some booty. The shade of walls spreads far, dims eyes, dips into minds or even memories. WALL What is it indeed? Which one do we mean? Some are protection against cold, storm or spying [eyes, to warrant ease, calm, intimacy; behind those thrive love, trust, words born to have one single moment’s life. 33 [pageend35]Behind a wall the miracle of life springs up, maybe a thought that kindles spirits and stirs up [its time; there loving mothers pet their babes; there priests recite their prayers while candles burn and people cry at the tunes of « Requiem »... For a life reached its end pouring into endlessness. Behind this wall, years are lapsing without any come-back; captives rub into it their days and weeks and months loaded with awe, hope and despair of variating ends. Behind the wall lies a realm of darkness thick as to choke a man to death. Among the captives there are thieves, murderers. rioters, spies, democrats, priests, grey-beards, mothers — anybody. Man — Wall Wall — Man The first means a benefit for men. The latter is a sign of servitude. You take the first, you’ll find a door that opens to either side. The other case — neither doors nor windows, for it’s a wall of shame. There is such a wall within a city. An ugly wall indeed, created by an ugly architect, creating an ugly life. Why do some people build a wall having no doors or windows or any other means of passage? Why is it guarded by grim mercenaries? Why can’t kids play in its shade, why can’t a poor devil lean on it for rest? 34 [pageend36]Wall — yes, what is your meaning? Are possibly your stones so precious to be watched by armed guardians from the sun’s rising to its setting and afresh, until it rise again? Do we face an enigma of time? Or perhaps an enigma of wall? Not at all! Some enigma of man? Oh, woe to a man who does not open to his brother, erects a wall on his path to freedom, who commands shooting down the wall’s violators, who tries to borrow power from a wall. Which frivolity, angry folly is pushing such a man into the depth of vice? What abasement. There is no shamelessness through for the sake [of itself, there is some purpose in each of them; the meanest one will sever freedom by a wall! Let centuries expire, let the whole world lapse into ruins, figure a bloody bath, atomic blaze, hostile camps with shrieking megaphones, defiance, seething hatred breeding wars, or think of woes, destruction, death; think of all that (what dire throught, oh Lord!), and still it will seem more natural than the wall in Berlin. Yes, it stains the entire world, a whole generation with dark shame. Not only upon those who built the wall, who dance in front of it with a trembling pride the shame should fall, nor on that side only where feelings, the heart’s noblest flowers, have decayed already; the shame of the wall should pour out 35 [pageend37]likewise on those who tolerate that ugly thing, who give just inquiring squints each other, who shrug one shoulder and bow the other one to shake off the load of a common guilt. Wall, Wall, Wall. A damnable, the most damnable feature. Shame, hundred and more times a shame on us. Look here, you antistalinists, that’s Stalin monument. Yevtushenko, set out to the Berlin’s wall with your proud Fourth Guard. Grab clubs and shovels; do away with that monstrous pulpit from which Stalin’s red gospel is preached to the drowsy world. Translated by Felix Mikula. Norin : COURS DE SECOURISME Je me suis fait inscrire à un cours de secourisme. Pourquoi ? Un coup de cafard. Un jour je me promenais sur la route nationale quand tout à coup je pensai : Suppose que tu tombes dans ce fossé plein d'eau le long de la route, sans personne alentour. Adieu, mon gars, tu serais bel et bien noyé. Une entrée dans le pays des poissons. A bien réfléchir, c’est vrai. Qui me dirait comment sauver ma peau ? Je crèverais dans la bouil- lasse, agitant bras et jambes. La respiration artificielle ? moi, je ne sais pas comment on fait. 36 [pageend38]— Eh bien ! Tu ne peux pas faire attention ľ s’écrie de sa portière un gros automobiliste rougeaud, un marchand de fourrures, Que je t’écrase avec ma bagnole, tu seras si bien aplati que tu ne pourras même pas lever un doigt ! — Ben quoi ! Et le code de la route, c’est pour qui ? Faut klaxonner avant de traverser la route ! Non mais, regardez-moi ça ! Bon à jeter dans une poêle, assaisonné aux petits oignons au lieu de tenir un volant entre ses mains ! ! Il m’écraserait, et moi, qu’est-ce que je deviendrais s’il n’y avait pas de secouristes près d’ici pour me sauver ? Je serais complètement incapable de me remettre les os en place, de me recoller les reins ! Et ça, c’est la vérité ! Aussitôt rentré chez moi, je me suis fait inscrire à un cours de secourisme, parce qu’autrement, je n’aurais pas été tranquille. Alors depuis, comme je vous le dis, je suis les cours comme un gosse à l’école. A son dernier cours, le prof nous demande ce qu’on ferait si un ours nous mordait. — Ét qu’est-ce que vous feriez si un cobra, soit un colubra comme on dit en latin, ou bien un serpent à lunettes noires, comme on l’appelle en slovaque, vous mordait à la jambe ? — Tiens, je n’y avait pas pensé. Le prof s’est mis à rire. — C’est facile ! vous n’avez qu’à vous couper la jambe. — Bravo ! Nous applaudissons et admirons notre professeur. — Et maintenant, que feriez-vous si le serpent mordait votre ami au bras ? — C’est facile ! je lui couperais la jambe. — Mais non ! — Ben... la mienne alors... 37 [pageend39]— Sapristi, non ! Il faudrait lui couper la main, dit le prof. Les copains ont presque cassé les tables et les carreaux, dans leur enthousiasme. Où va-t-il chercher tout cela, le prof, on se le demande ! Mais lui, il sourit, pas fier, et le cours se termine sur cette phrase : — Maintenant, mes chers élèves, vous êtes armés pour la vie. Vous pouvez vous servir de vos nouvelles connaissances dans n’importe quelle circonstance. N’oubliez pas que la devise de nos cours est : « Aide ton prochain comme toi-même. Aide humaine, aide divine ! » C’est ça. On applaudit encore une fois et on sort dans la rue. Et là, presque à nos pieds, un type est étendu de son long sur le trottoir. Du coup, deux gars de notre cours tombent dans les pommes. — Mais c’est un mort ! s’écrie l’un de nous. — Un mort ? Tu as un verre dans le nez ! Ecoute voir son cœur. Nous nous baissons pour écouter son cœur. Il bat, c’est sûr. — C’est drôle, dis-je. Le cœur, c’est du côté droit. — Alors, tu dormais quand le prof a dit : « une personne sur mille a le cœur du côté droit ». Ce type serait le millième ! me répliquent les copains. Bon, vaut mieux me taire. Le plus vieux d’entre nous commence un discours : — Camarades, c’est le moment de mettre en pratique nos connaissances. Première chose à faire, vérifier l’identité. En cherchant ses papiers, voilà qu’une montre tombe de la poche droite du gars. 38 [pageend40]Son cœur s’arrête de battre. L’ancien s’écrie : — Il faut lui pomper de l’air dans les poumons ! Deux garçons sursautent et volent la pompe d’une bicyclette. Ça ne marche pas. Le type ne se ranime pas. Après une longue discussion, on décide que le mort est victime d’une crise d’appendicite aiguë. Le silence règne, nous baissons tous la tête. Un d’entre nous est allé téléphoner à la morgue pour avoir un cercueil. Il commence à pleuvoir. Arrive un miracle. Le mort commence à s’éveiller. Il ouvre d’abord les yeux, se lève tout doucement et se tient même debout. Trois copains, des mauviettes sans nerfs, se sauvent, quatre autres s’évanouissent. Moi, mes dents jouent des castagnettes. — Mais, qu’est-ce qui se passe ? — C’est clair... le gars a attrapé un coup de mort, me répond le plus brave. — Mais puisqu’il est déjà mort ! — Non, avant qu’on soit vraiment mort, il faut compter trois heures. Je regarde ma montre. — Déjà trente minutes que le pauvre diable est en train de mourir. Il ne lui reste que deux heures et demi. Pendant ce temps, le mourant éternue, essuie sa tête trempée par la pluie. Alors trois autres du cours tombent dans les pommes. Le mourant demande : — Qu’est-ce qui m’est arrivé ? 39 [pageend41]— Silence, prudence, vous êtes en train de mourir, dit le plus brave. — Moi ? — Qui d’autre ? Couchez-vous immédiatement. — Je me dépêche pour aller à la poste. — A la poste ?... Mille excuses. Couchez-vous. — Non, pas à la poste. Au bureau de sûreté. — Couchez-vous, je vous dis. Le mort commence à pleurnicher. — Comprenez-moi donc ! Il faut que je me rende au bureau du Ministre de l’Intérieur. — Vous voyez bien, il est en pleine transe, nous dit mon copain brave. — Mais dans quelle transe ? — Taisez-vous et couchez-vous. On va bientôt apporter le cercueil. Le mourant lève les bras au ciel, halète, déclare qu’il veut soit aller au bureau d’approvisionnement, soit au centre d’aménagement ou encore au magasin acheter avec des tickets de rationnement des souliers. Mais mon copain ne se laisse pas influencer; il le tient solidement par le cou et le serre contre lui. — Vous allez rester couché jusqu’à ce que le cercueil arrive. Que peut faire le pauvre diable ? Il grince des dents et dit d’un ton menaçant : — Je me vengerai ! Je vous ferai tous enfermer ! Finalement, comme après trois heures il ne se décide pas à mourir, nous concluons ; — Le mort n’est pas mort; il a simplement eu une crise d’appendicite aiguë. Son cœur est à gauche. Les copains qui s’étaient évanouis reprennent connaissance, les mauviettes qui s’étaient enfuies reviennent. 40 [pageend42]Le gars se ramasse et crache sur le côté. — Attendez un peu. Vous me le paierez ! Je n’irai pas à la poste, ni au bureau de sûreté, ni au bureau ď approvisionnement, ni au centre d’aménagement, mais je vais de ce pas au poste de police et je vous ferai coffrer. En disant ces mots, il vacille et serait tombé de nouveau si mon copain le brave ne l’avait rattrapé au vol. — Qu’est-ce qu’il y a ? — Oh ma tête, elle va éclater ! — Mais pourquoi ? — Ils m’ont accepté au service civil I — Il a des hallucinations, il délire, s’écrie un de nous. Donnez-lui vite un verre d’ammoniac ! Trois copains se précipitent sur lui, l’arrosent d’ammoniac tandis que les autres lui appliquent la fameuse respiration artificelle. Et moi ?... Je ne veux pas me vanter, parce qu’il paraît que je suis né sous une bonne étoile. Pendant mon travail de secouriste, je me suis seulement luxé la jambe. Le plus brave a été le plus malchanceux. Il s’est évanoui, et semblait bien mort. Alors, nous l’avons allongé dans le cercueil et nous l’avons conduit au cimetière. Par bonheur, le cimetière était complet I Traduit par Janka KIPSCHBAUM 4Î [pageend43]Jozef C. HRONSKY LE PETIT MONDE DE TRASOVISKO (Un extrait de roman) (Le récit se situe dans la Slovaquie centrale, en août 19M. Les armées soviétiques atteignent les Carpathes, frontières de la Slovaquie orientale. Leur commandement lance sur le territoire slovaque des parachutistes et des troupes de partisans s’y faufilent. Ceux-ci, avec les communistes locaux et leurs sympathisants, commencent à organiser un soulèvement. De l’ouest les Allemands contre-atta- quent et pénètrent en masse en Slovaquie. Des milliers de réfugiés venant de l’est et de l’ouest fuient les armées soviétiques et allemandes. Entre les deux fronts, on commence à ressentir les secousses d’un séisme moral et social, des rancunes et des haines apparaissent refoulés depuis des siècles, les antagonismes entre les familles, les villages, les églises se déchaînent.) De même, Martin Hrancok s’est mis en route avec la dame blanche et Zbygniew, il les accompagne un bout de chemin, presque jusqu’à la montagne, qui domine la croix. Le vieux Gonda l’a envoyé voir comment les Grnâc creusent des fosses dans les champs voisins, où poussent choux et pommes de terre, comment ils garnissent les fosses avec de la paille et ce qu’ils cachent dans les champs. 42 [pageend44]Ainsi Hrancok est arrivé sur les champs de Grnác, mais il n’est pas allé voir les fosses, car il était déjà tard et dans cette vallée commençait à régner une certaine effervescence; l’on n’avait aucune envie de quitter la maison, au contraire, il convenait d’y rester ou d’y entrer. Bien longtemps avant qu’à Bebrava ne commençât à régner une agitation, causée par l’arrivée de certaine voiture venant de Lieková et chargée de partisans blessés, des alentours de Krupina, sortirent alors trois gars du village : deux Russes et le sommelier de Zlaté Moravce. Il était visible que celui-ci avait bu, mais relativement moins que les Russes qui titubaient fortement. Sur la route, derrière le village, les Russes avaient fomenté déjà bien des histoires. Le plus petit, la peau presque noire, le visage étroit, coléreux et qui paraissait le plus ivre, se retourna tout d’un coup sur la route, tira en l’air et commença à arrêter les gens : — Où vas-tu? Toi! En arrière! Charogne!... Tous en arrière ! Combattre !... Tous combattre ! Tuer des Allemands ! Charogne !... On avait donc des ennuis avec lui. Le sommelier le tiraillait par le bras, lui disant que les femmes et les enfants ne sont pas capables de se battre, que les gens qui fuient sont des braves gens, mais le Russe ne voulait rien entendre. — Allez tous vous battre ! Tous... Charogne ! Toi tais-toi ! Silence !... Peut-être toi aussi tu es un Allemand !... Qui le sait ?... Qui sait si tu n’es pas un Allemand ? Je te tuerai aussi ! Tu as l’air d’un Allemand !... — Lui il n’est pas Allemand, Vasil, c’est Antoine ! — l’autre Russe s’en mêlait, un gars trapu qui ne cessait de rire. — C’est notre Antoine, Vasil, notre Antoine, un frère ! 43 [pageend45]— Mais il a caché la femme, lui ! Lui ! Quoi, qui sait si ce n’est pas un Allemand !... Il ľa cachée ! Ou bien est-ce toi ? — Tu n’est qu’un imbécile, Vasil ! — Alors, dis-le, c’est toi qui l’as cachée ! Toi !... Une fois déjà tu l’as cachée devant moi ! Charogne !... Il en oublie le chemin, de loin, les gens cherchaient à les éviter; derrière le village, il recommence à rechercher querelle au Russe trapu. C’était un homme méchant, au visage étroit, celui- ci, dans la colère, se plissait parfois de telle manière qu’on aurait cru que sa bouche allait l’engloutir complètement. Mais enfin, ils se mirent en route. Le sommelier Antoine réussit à les faire marcher, peut-être Vasil avait-il aperçu les derniers Ukrainiens près de Sihelcica et cela l’avait-il incité à les chasser parce qu’il les détestait, quoique, en vérité il ne sût vraiment pas pourquoi. Peut être aurait-il tiré directement sur eux si ses compagnons ne l’avaient apaisé, il réussit tout de même à disperser près de la rivière un groupe de ces malheureux grelottants. Quelques- uns d’entre eux prirent peur et traversèrent la rivière, mais Vasil commença de les pourchasser en les injuriant et en les accusant d’attendre les Allemands; il proférait des jurons, Antoine acquiesçait et le calmait et le deuxième Russe, le trapu, riait. Tout d’un coup, tout à fait gaiement, il s’adressa par cris à la foule de gens affolés auxquels on avait auparavant défendu de bouger, mais la foule se mit tout de même en mouvement et recommença à se traîner pour monter la vallée Sihelcica. Où allaient-ils ? Mais qui s’en préoccupait ! Vasil qui les pourchassait en oublia pour un moment, la dame blanche. 44 [pageend46]Mais, tout de même pas complètement. Au tournant du chemin, près des champs de la famille Geljenov, il se souvint d’elle de nouveau et son visage se crispa, il devint encore plus furieux parce que l’autre Russe riait toujours, et parfois il riait tellement qu’il ne pouvait plus marcher. C’était Antoine qui portait la bouteille. Arrivé derrière le village, il pensa que Vasil était déjà assez ivre et qu’il ne fallait plus lui donner à boire, mais près des champs de la famille de Geljen il changea d’opinion et pensa qu’il serait mieux de l’enivrer complètement. Il recommença de lui offrir à boire et cette fois ils vidèrent la bouteille jusqu’au fond. Ce fut à ce moment que la sirène de Lieková se mit à hurler le plus fort. En arrivant vers les champs de Grnác, Vasil se dirigea directement dans la cour, les deux autres n’avaient pas envie de le suivre, mais ils durent y aller tout de même. Dans cette cour, se trouvait aussi Martin Hrancok, il y était resté seul. — Vasil arrive et il est ivre — dit Grnác. Chez les Grnác on connaissait déjà Vasil et on n’avait pas bonne opinion de lui. Quand Vasil arriva, tous disparurent de la cour, même Grnác n’y était plus. Antoine suivait le noir Vasil et le souriant Russe trapu titubait derrière eux. Ainsi, ils arrivèrent dans la cour. Vasil hurlait et crachait. — Fils de chien... il l’a cachée ici... Tout d’un coup, il se retourna contre l’autre Russe, et ni Antoine, ni Hrancok n’auraient jamais pensé à quelque chose de pareil, la mitraillette de Vasil se déchargea en crachant le feu, contre le Russe trapu qui, lorsqu’il s’écroula, donnait l’impression de pouffer de rire. 45 [pageend47]A ľinstant, il expira. Sur le coup, Martin Hraneok fut indécis. Mais se rendant compte que les Grnác avaient disparu, et que les hurlements d’Antoine n’avaient attiré personne, il aurait bien voulu disparaître lui aussi, cela lui semblait le plus raisonnable. Mais Antoine lui hurla : — Aide-moi ! Alors il se saisit du Russe, ils le précipitèrent à terre et Antoine commença de le frapper et le frapper encore. Hraneok eut l’impression que le deuxième Russe serait bientôt mort lui aussi. Antoine le frappait où il pouvait, et plus il cognait, plus il devenait furieux, il était épuisé, et toujours agenouillé sur le dos de Vasil, il le frappait sans cesse. Sa mitraillette avait disparu, alors il frappa avec ses poings nus, ensuite il attrapa la tête du Russe et la heurta contre la terre de toutes ses forces. Impulsivement, Martin Hraneok, sauta sur le furieux, afin qu’il ne tue ni n’étrangle tout à fait le Russe. Il arriva enfin à le le lui arracher. — Mais tu le tueras !... Si tu ne l’as déjà fait !... En effet, on avait l’impression que Vasil ne vivait plus. Tout d’un coup, celui-ci se ressaisit, il sauta comme un chat, attrapa même sa mitraillette et courut se réfugier dans la maison des Grnác, directement dans la chambre. De là, on entendit les salves de sa mitraillette jusqu’à ce que toutes les balles fussent tirées. Ensuite ce fut le silence. Un silence, comme au cimetière. Antoine s’est collé contre le mur et a dit : — Tu vois !... Tu vois ce cochon ! Martin Hraneok s’est aussi plaqué contre le mur. Mais de la chambre on n’entendait plus rien. 46 [pageend48]One ne pouvait même pas distinguer si Vasil bougeait encore. Il s’était précipité dans la chambre, se jetant le visage contre le lit. Ce faisant, la gâchette de la mitraillette s’accrocha et l’arme commença à cracher le feu, les balles pénétrèrent dans le duvet qui se mit à fumer. La chambre s’emplit de poussière, de plumes et de puanteur, comme si dans toute la maison on eût brûlé des plumes. Mais le sommelier n’osa entrer dans la maison que lorsqu’il en entendit sortir le ronflement de Vasil, étendu sur le lit. Martin Hraneok n’attendit pas le retour des familiers de Grnác, il quitta lentement la cour, ne s’arrêta qu’un instant près du vieux fermier et lui dit : — N’ayez pas peur. Celui-là, aujourd’hui, ne fera plus d’histoires. Il dort et ronfle. Et celui-ci... sera tranquille pour toujours. Grnác mit sa main gauche sur sa poitrine; avec la droite, il s’essuya la bouche du revers de la main. Il était pensif. — Ne vous inquiétez pas, voisin, cette affaire ne vous regarde pas — ajouta Martin Hraneok, car il devinait à quoi Grnác pensait. — Le diable le sait, Martin... Le diable le sait ! Qu’ils s’entretuent, mais que ce soit arrivé ici... — Mais, après tout, cette affaire ne vous regarde pas ! — Probablement, j’aurai quand même des ennuis. — L’avez-vous vu déjà auparavant ? — Ils venaient ici à chaque moment. Quel dommage que ce soit celui-ci ...Si au moins c’eût été l’autre. Déjà le soir — en effet, c’était déjà la nuit — cela devenait presque intolérable. Il cherchait sans cesse une certaine femme et menaçait ces deux. Je n’ai aucune envie d’entrer dans la maison. — Il dort et ronfle déjà et l’autre vide ses poches, alors il ne faut plus le craindre — Martin Hraneok 47 [pageend49]encouragea le Grnác et quitta rapidement la cour en passant près du jardin. Il serait arrivé à Trasovisko par un sentier en traversant le vallon, mais il a vu que la route était pleine de gens qui fuyaient avec leurs chariots. Parmi eux il remarqua aussi des connaissances et il vit qu’ils pourchassaient leur bétail. — Qu’est-ce qu’il arrive ?... Puis il descendit sur la route et la première personne qu’il rencontra fut Anne Gonda. Elle rentrait avec Thomas. — Qu’est-ce qu’il arrive, Anne ? — Les Allemands s’approchent... — Quoi ? — Tous, tous fuient ! — continuait avec peur la Gonda. -— Mais ne t’affole pas ! Si c’était vrai, on pourrait s’en rendre compte ! — Du village on pouvait entendre des fusillades. Tous fuient... Ils sont déjà à Dolná Huta. Ils brûlent tout !... — Ne t’affole pas ! — Martin Hrancok calmait Anne Gonda. Il écoutait, mais n’entendait rien. Toutefois, en haut, sur la route, on voyait marcher deux petites colonnes militaires, d’en bas, derrière le village, on entendait le ronronnement des voitures, alors il ne put plus nier que quelque chose se passait dans la vallée de Bebrava, derrière les rails des chemins de fer. Tout d’un coup on entendit une forte détonation; c’était le pont du chemin de fer de Domanica qui suutait. — Eentends-tu, entends-tu ! — Nous avons déjà entendu de pareilles détonations... — Tu ne peux pas croire ! Mais ils arrivent certainement. Eva est aussi dans la foule, devant ou 48 [pageend50]derrière nous, tu pourrais la chercher. Elle est arrivée au moment où les gens se mirent en route. Elle ne savait que faire, elle répétait seulement qu’il aurait fallu rester au village comme tu le disais... Tu pourrais la chercher... Il ne la cherchait pas, et il ne disait mot de ce qui s’était passé auparavant. Il voyait de nouveau la mort de très près. Il marchait sans parole à côté de Gonda, il ne se rendait presque pas compte que dans le chariot suivant se trouvait la femme du pasteur de Bebrava, laquelle appelait sans cesse sa servante qui marchait à côté du chariot. Il est venue avec la Gonda jusqu’à sa maison. Il a trouvé dans sa cour des gens. La femme de Krajcik est venue il y a quelques instants, son fils était encore dans la cour, à côté de leur vache, qu’ils avaient emmenée avec eux. Il commençait à comprendre qu’en effet les Allemands s’approchaient, mais s’ils arrivaient ainsi, sans difficulté, cela signifiait que personne ne leur résistait et que là-has il n’existait aucun front d’insurgés, ou qu’il s’était dissous sans combat. — Martin, nous sommes venus, acceptez-nous — commençait la femme de Krajcik — on dit que dans le village il ne restera pierre sur pierre et nous n’avons que cette vache. Une pierre sur pierre... Ainsi disent même les partisans. — Mais restez, naturellement, restez, n’ayez pas peur ! Les gens s’affolent plus qu’il n’est nécessaire ! N’ayez pas peur, on trouvera de la place pour vous. La femme de Krajcik prétendait que les Allemands étaient déjà à Lieková. Cela ne pouvait pas être vrai, Martin Hrancok le savait bien, mais il ne contredisait pas, ce jour-là personne n’aurait pu arrêter les rumeurs qui montaient de la vallée de Sihelcica. 49 [pageend51]— Les Allemands s’approchent ! — Avant la soirée ils traverseront la vallée ! — Ils seront dans la soirée ou au matin à Bebrava ! La femme de Krajcik racontait que Laluch était au milieu du village, qu’il proférait des injures en disant que les gens étaient devenus fous, mais que lui aussi avait un fusil. Durant le souper elle racontait que chez les Benka la femme du pasteur ne faisait que pleurer parce que son mari ne voulait pas quitter la paroisse. Elle lui avait bien demandé d’aller directement à Bystrica, de quelque manière ils y seraient parvenus, certainement ils y auraient trouvé leur fils, ils y auraient trouvé un refuge avant que les Busses n’arrangent tout parce que les Allemands ne parviendront jamais à Bystrica. La femme de Krajcik s’était rappelée aussi que vers midi la garde rouge avait fouillé toute la paroisse, qu’ils avaient voulu arrêter le doyen, et peut-être l’avaient-ils déjà fait, mais à midi il n’était pas encore rentré, les gens disaient qu’il était allé à Bebrávka pour confesser. Ils cherchaient aussi des « gardistes », mais ceux-là depuis des semaines ne logaient plus chez eux. Celui qui ne s’était pas sauvé, depuis longtemps était incarcéré à Lupca ou se trouvait dans un endroit encore pire. La gaîté ne régnait donc pas non plus dans la maison des Hrancok à Trasovisko. Du village l’agitation gagna de même la forêt, ainsi que cette étrange atmosphère qui courait depuis longtemps et qui fit naître justement ce bizarre embrasement, cette rencontre de regards : de regards vénimeux, peureux, méfiants, vengeurs et par-dessus tout haineux. Comme si dans cette agitation les gens s’étaient dévoilés, comme s’ils n’avaient plus le temps de feindre et de cacher leur vraie nature, maintenant ils se montraient tels qu’ils étaient, telle que Bebrava était et avec elle toute la vallée de Bebrava. 50 [pageend52]Ce qui était semé depuis longtemps, commença à germer et à croître. — Pourquoi arrivent les Allemands ? — Qui les a appelés ? — Qui les a invités ? — Où est notre père ? — Qu’a fait de mal le doyen ? Où transportait-on ce matin le jeune prêtre ensanglanté ? Où sont mon char et mes chevaux ? Où est l’organiste ? Où est Jean, le fils du sacristain ? Pourquoi enrôle-t-on des protestants dans les troupes destinées à la protection locale, tandis qu’on n’envoie que des catholiques sur le front ? Pourquoi a-t-on confisqué toute ma farine et pas celle du voisin ? Qui a causé tout ce malheur au village ? Et pourquoi Laluch et Rurik et les autres au lieu de se battre contre les Allemands préparent- ils déjà leur fuite ? Maintenant criez : mort aux Allemands, maintenant !... Lorsque le doyen de Bebrava revint de Bebrávka, non loin du pont, cinq hommes sortirent de la forêt, munis de haches. Les deux vieillards qui accompagnaient le prêtre s’arrêtèrent aussi comme galvanisés. Le doyen jeta un regard sur les hommes, il n’avait aucune raison de les craindre, il les connaissait bien, c’était des citoyens sérieux, honnêtes, tranquilles. Mais il craignait leurs regards. — Vous devez nous suivre dans la forêt, Monsieur le doyen ! Et ils l’attirèrent dans la forêt. — Hommes ! Qu’est-il arrivé ? — Ne perdons pas de temps en vaines palabres. Dès maintenant vous nous obéissez quoique vous soyez prêtre. Vous ne retournerez pas chez vous, le sang coulerait, dirent-ils. Ils affirmaient aussi qu’à Bebrava le sang est irrité, qu’on le contrôle difficilement et qu’il deviendrait aisément bouillant. Son regard devint incertain lors51 [pageend53]qu’il regarda ces hommes, quand il rencontra leurs regards sombres, quand il aperçut leurs haches et quand il entendit jurer ces gens autrefois silencieux, paisibles et modérés. Il prit la décision de rester avec eux. (Trad. Raymonde GREBERT). Joseph Pauco EUROPE ON THE EAST SIDE I have in mind the East Side in New York City. There, in the vicinity of First and Second Avenue, you will find a European mixture : Slovaks, Germans, Hungarians, Czechs, and other nationalities. They settled there more than sixty years ago, and they are there to this day. They have built schools and churches; they have established their own parishes. There they have their societies and clubs and organizational headquarters. They meet regularly for stage presentations, debates and entertainment. There one hears the fiery csardas, the lilting waltz and the brisk polka. In a word, you imagine you are in Europe when you visit New York’s East Side. There you find national foods, typical European restaurants and stores. There you can obtain just about anything you would find in 52 [pageend54]Bratislava, Prague, Budapest or Munich. Menus are- printed in the language of the proprietor’s ancestors. And everything tastes exactly as it does in Europe. I like to wander over to the East Side. For one reason, it was on 66th Street that I spent my first night in America. That is where my sponsors lived. But I like to go to the East Side also because I meet Slovaks there. Besides, I can find our specialties there. I see the Slovak or Central European merchant beam with pride when I tell him I have come, not from the State of New York, but from Pennsylvania. It pays to visit the East Side. For instance, one can find outstanding Central European smoked meats there. They are sold by Slovaks, Czechs and Hungarians. Excellent smoked sausages, distinctive blood pudding, fine peppered or plain smoked bacon, tlačenka, and ham with a flavor that immediately reminds one of Bratislava or some other European city. Most of these items can be obtained on First Avenue. You can go from one store to another and choose what you wish. Not only smoked meats, but also delicious pastries such as nut rolls, poppyseed cakes, cheese tarts and best of all, splendid strudel. One has to get to the bakeries early in the day, for every European in this Old World quarter of the cities besieges one store after another for these delicacies. I doubt if I have ever seen such crowds of customers anywhere as I have outside these « European » shops on the East Side. Every language of Central Europe is spoken. And each is understood. You can confidently make your requests known in whichever language is dearest to you. In fact, I discovered that native Americans know what « lekvár » and poppyseed are. So, I like to go there myself, for this is a slice of Europe. These New York delicacies are liked everywhere. When I planned to make my first trip to New York, and my new friends in the shop learned of my plans, 53 [pageend55]they handed me a request. A written one. It was signed by all the petitioners. And it went like this : We, the undersigned, have learned from reliable sources that on Saturday morning our new colleague will leave his wife and us, his fellow-workers, to spend a couple of undisturbed free days in the city of New York which is famous for its meat products. On this occasion we take the liberty of requesting you to bring back for us the following items : (Please note the amounts.) Bill—10 lbs of bacon George—15 lbs of bacon, 5 lbs of sausage and tlačenky Vince—10 lbs of tlačenky Andy—5 lbs of bacon Theo—5 lbs of pork sausage Joe—10 lbs of bacon If there is room in your bag for more, you may double each order. And for the rest you may bring back at least a pound of each delicacy you find on the East Side. Wishing you a pleasant stay in the big city, and confident that you will return safely with your suitcase to these premises, we remain Yours sincerely, « The rascals from the shop. » I had a good laugh over the petition. Nevertheless, I promised to bring them at least a portion of their requests. And I did. However, I did have a little difficulty with my mission. Not with the stores, but with the passengers on the train. Somewhere in Philadelphia, a man near me began to fidget. He sniffed and looked about. Others began to wonder what was wrong. He even began to complain that there was a strong odor of garlic in the car. 54 [pageend56]« Now they’ve got me », I thought. « My sausages are giving themselves away. » For a fact, the aroma had penetrated both the wrapping paper and suitcase. Everyone began to glance around and ask what each was carrying. They eventually turned to me, too. I told them I had Europe in my baggage. « Europe ? » « Yes. But this is American Europe. From the East Side of New York. » THE SECOND FLIGHT That Sunday in July was an unhappy one. After what had happened when they transported us toward the East, everyone surmised that this day’s order to be ready for departure early the next morning meant another trip back to the region we had left in our flight from the Communists. There was a great deal of perplexity. The remaining refugees consisted mostly of women and children. The men had already been taken awav. They were in other camps, worse than ours here. What would the women do ? Since that previous departure from the camp, only a few of them had left. When this new order was issued, Javor sky also decided to leave with his wife and child. Joining them in their plans were George Horniak, a notary public, and Javorsky’s friend Stephan. The details of the escape were worked out. Marica pretended to take Svetko for a walk. In her hand she carried a pail, ostensibly to fetch some water from the well on the other side of the creek. They reached the well. Then they went beyond it and took refuge in the woods. 55 [pageend57]Her husband and Horniak set out that evening. Stephen decided to leave the next morning. He was curious to know what was going on. As it grew dark, Javorsky and Horniak made ready to leave. They each took a blanket and some small items. Everything was set. Suddenly they heard the rumble of tanks. They were circling the compound. What did it mean ? Would they surround us as they did that first time when we had to leave the monastery ? Would they put those same women and children and few men through that same experience again ? The tanks did not encircle the camp. The manceuver lasted only some two hours. They then withdrew and the compound was buried in darkness. It was thick enough to cut. Javorsky and Horniak made for the little hut near the creek as their first objective. There they stood a moment, then sat down on the bench and listened. You could have heard a fly buzzing, it was so quiet. « Let’s get going », said the notary. A heavy mist began to settle. That was good protection. The leaves would not rustle, and the guards would hesitate to grope about the compound, much less trample through the woods. With a prayer on his lips the notary stepped across the narrow creek, and after him Javorsky took a first step, looking back at that dog house where they had spent several sleepless nights and eaten a few dishes of fatless beans and peas, and clutched their cramped stomachs struggling with the peculiar heavy black bread. They would not have to do that any more. Or would they ? Do you know what’s waiting for you, Javorsky ? 56 [pageend58]Hunger perhaps, who knows what kind of misery, or even an early death. Are you even sure you will live to see tomorrow’s dawn ? Thoughts of that sort began to haunt him. But there was no time for them. Beyond the creek lay a road, and beyond it the thicket that connects the camp with the woods. There are your wife and only son. Both of them are waiting for you. They need you in this dark hour, and tomorrow and after tomorrow. And to the end. « Hurry, Javorsky », his conscience whispered. <c There is no time. The tanks may come again. They may light up the whole compound, and then where would you hide ? » Homiak did not seem to be confronted with so many difficulties. He had already been separated from his family for quite some time. They had remained in Slovakia. He had already shed his tears over them. Now he was all the more intent on getting into the thicket. Javorsky trailed behind him. He threw the blanket over his head to keep dry. Their path took them up a hillside. The earth was soggy by this time. Their feet kept slipping, perhaps from unfamiliarity with the terrain and mental weariness. Anyone making plans under such a strain becomes exhausted in a few minutes, physically and mentally. Javorsky could hardly drag himself along. He did not give up, however. As they stumbled along the path up the slope, Horniak brushed against a rotten branch. It broke off and struck Javorsky in the face. It made no noise, however, in the damp underbrush. « Watch it, George », Javorsky teased, a we don’t want to wake up the guards ». « How can I watch when I can’t see three feet ahead ? » 57 [pageend59]« Let’s go. Let’s get into those woods as soon as we can. » The sooner they did, the sooner he would be with Marica and Svetko. Still speaking, Javorsky fell down upon a heap of stones. Even worse, he bruised himself, and the stones made a great deal of noise as they rolled down the hill. Unfortunately, there was an old bottle in the path of the stones. One of the falling stones hit it, and it rang like a brass bell. Someone was awake in the barracks below, because a light was lit and a dark figure stood in the doorway. But the figure did not call out or light a lamp. Javorsky and Horniak froze in their steps, and the stones stopped rolling. Soon it was silent as before. They went on. They had gone a good fifty feet farther, and Javorsky began to call in a strong whisper : a Maricaaa ! » He had to call just three times before the answer came : « Here we are ! » A child’s voice could be heard, too. It was his wife and son. « Thank God for His goodness ! We are saved. » But were they really ? « You are drawing conclusions a little early, Javorsky », an inner voice told him. With Horniak beside him he proceeded in the direction of Marica’s voice, and in a moment she was in het husband’s embrace. Svetko had something to say, too. « Daddy, they were singing ! » « What’s that, son ? » Before Marica could relate how they had arrived safely at this place under the thick pines, she had to explain how she and the lad had listened to the last Slovak vesper devotions in the camp. As the melody of the Marian hymn floated through the air, Svetko had remarked excitedly : 58 [pageend60]« They’re singing ! » That was the first thing he said to his father when they met. Instead of falling asleep while waiting, he had watched with his mother. Horniak suggested that they move on while talking. Javorsky took his son in his arms, Marica relieved him of the blanket, and they went on. They came to a clearing, then walked through a potato field and into another wooded area. Because it was raining steadily, they did not attempt to go farther. Huddling together, they snuggled under some leaves. Javorsky had a heavy overcoat. It was enough for him. He gave his wife the blanket for her and Svetko. They lay down. Horniak said good night, and Javorsky kissed his family and made the sign of the cross over them. He sat awhile, leaning against a huge tree trunk. a When the world will no longer take my burdens from me, I place a few of them on you. Even as a child, I used to ease my mind in the oak, beech, and birch forest. I grew up at the edge of it. So then, virgin forest, planted by God, protect me in your bosom. The wood and the heavens are a temple. Here we are apart from people, here there is more peace than elsewhere... » His eyes were getting heavy. But Marica interrupted him. « Palko, are you sleeping ? » « How can I ? » cc I think you should. We have much ahead of us tomorrow. » « I’ve been wondering what we should do first tomorrow. » « Don’t worry. God is good, and we’re healthy. We won’t give up. » Golden womanly courage, faith, and certainty. 59 [pageend61]Javorsky had a splendid wife. She had learned to bear the hardships of the day in a heroic manner. Her words put him at ease. He leaned with his whole back and head against the beech tree and shortly fell asleep. Suddenly his own snoring startled him. He got to thinking again : thoughts about what had happened and what might follow. Yet who could foresee what was coming ? His thoughts wearied him. Just before dawn he awoke. Down in the camp, the racket of engines and shouting voices could be heard. Horniak stood up. Stretching his arms, he said : « God has helped us through the first night. We are free once again. I wonder if Stephan will come. » They waited. It wasn’t long before they heard the whistle they had prearranged as a signal. It was Stephan. The rascal came into view with a big smile on his face. He said he had no trouble getting away. Everyone was in the center of the camp. The soldiers did not bother to go across the creek. He pretended he was going to wash, and when he noticed that no one was watching, he slipped into the thicket. There he took out of hiding the few belongings he had concealed the night before, and hurried after Javorsky and Horniak. « Everyone had to leave the camp », Stephan said. « The big transport vehicles were again standing where they were two weeks ago. I watched from the woods what was going on. A soldier went into each room of the barracks and called our people out. Then he led them to the convoy. « I did not wait to see it all, because they might have sounded the alarm, and then they would scatter out into the woods, too, searching. » But there was no such search. If there was, the band of five pilgrims were not aware of it. 60 [pageend62]The engines filled the air with a racket. It was the last departure of the Slovak refugees. Where were they being taken ? « Will we ever know ? » Javorsky asked himself. Horniak suggested that they pack their things. It wasn’t hard to do. There was little to pack. Thank God it was raining lightly. It was bearable, even though the blankets were quite wet by this time. They wanted to cover at least another mile or two, so that they would be farther from the camp and closer to some civilians. Several times before the flight from the camp Javorsky had stopped at a nearby farmhouse asking for eggs. Three times he got two apiece. It was a treat for Svetko. « We’ll try again today », he told his wife. « He might give us some milk. » They emerged from the forest into a clearing and then into a field. The grain was heavy, almost ready for the harvest. Suddenly it began to rain heavily. They hurried. In ten minutes they had arrived at the house of their farmer a friend ». They stood on the porch. The door opened, and when the farmer’s wife recognized Javorsky, she looked understandingly at him and especially at Marica and Svetko. She asked if the boy was hungry. She had a tender heart. She heated some milk and served it with a piece of good bread for each of them, giving Marica a little extra to put in the knapsack. « Where can you go in this rain ? » the farmer’s wife asked. « Stand on the porch and dry your blankets and coats. The rain has to stop eventually. Then you may be on your way, with God’s help. » Her welcome was balm for their fresh wounds. It was like a silent prayer after their recent experiences. 61 [pageend63]The weary pilgrims had received some alms. They were safe until nightfall. The sun smiled as though it were thanking the farmer’s wife. Once more the pilgrims set out. They went into a valley and across a neighboring farm where there were said to be some other Slovak refugees. Would they find refuge there ? No. A grave for young Javorsky. 62 [pageend64]FORUM Roger Caillois : POST-SCRIPTUM POUR « PONCE-PILATE » Mon récit Ponce-Pilate, où j’imagine que le Procurateur de Judée libère le Christ, de sorte que le christianisme n’a pas lieu, n’est aucunement, comme on l’a dit, un ouvrage de science-fiction et encore moins une philosophie de l’histoire. Il apparaît même comme le contraire d’un récit de science-fiction dans la mesure où la vision de l’Assyrien y présente comme imaginaire ce qui s’est passé réellement, c’est-à-dire l’histoire du monde telle qu’elle s’e9t déroulée en effet après la crucifixion du Messie et le triomphe de la nouvelle religion. La science-fiction aurait, au contraire, consisté à donner pour réel ce qui aurait pu se passer dans l’hypothèse du Christ mourant de sa belle mort. J’ai inversé la démarche. En second lieu, je n’ai nullement souhaité démontrer que le cours de l’histoire dépendait de la décision d’un individu, encore qu’il y ait des aiguillages de grande conséquence. Pascal ne me convainc pas, quand il fait décisifs le nez de Cléopâtre et le grain de sable dans l’urètre de Cromwell. En revanche Montesquieu explique lumineusement que ce n’est pas le désastre de Poltava qui perdit Charles XII : « s’il n’avait pas été détruit en ce lieu, il l’aurait été dans un autre. Les accidents de la fortune se réparent aisément; on ne peut parer à des événements qui naissent continuellement de la nature des choses ». 63 [pageend65]J’estime de la même manière que si le christianisme n’avait pu se produire, serait née et aurait triomphé une religion apparentée : messianique, égalitaire, universaliste. Différent sans doute dans l’anecdote, mais répondant aux mêmes besoins, son évangile eût répandu un message analogue. Ceci dit, mon propos touchait pour une part à la théologie, d’autre part à l’éthique. Il s’agissait en particulier pour moi de réfléchir sur la nature de la religion, de toute religion, et d’examiner s’il est concevable que l’humanité puisse s’en passer. Pilate, stoïcien, libère Jésus, tout bien pesé, c’est-à-dire en sachant, grâce aux conjectures inspirées de Mardouk, qu’il n’y aura pas, par sa faute, de christianisme, et en supputant tout ce que l’homme y perdra. Il fait le pari qu’on peut demander aux hommes, au nom de l’homme, ce que les religions exigent d’eux au nom des Dieux. J’ai employé mon récit à présenter les différents aspects de ce problème, que je ne prétends pas, il va de soi, avoir résolu et où je n’ai pas trop pris parti, encore que le lecteur attentif puisse voir aisément de quel côté j’incline à la fin. En même temps, j’ai tenté d’analyser le mécanisme d’une décision humaine. C’est sur cet aspect purement psychologique de mon entreprise que je souhaite insister ici. Je rassemblerai d’abord les données qui subsistent sur le personnage et qui sont peu nombreuses, comme il est naturel, s’agissant d’un fonctionnaire subalterne. Elles sont aussi tardives et contestables, en ou're hostiles. La famille de Pilate semble originaire de Samnium. Peut-être descend-il de Pontius Cominius qui, en 387 de la fondation de Rome, quand la ville fut assiégée par les Gaulois, descendit le Tibre sur un radeau et releva le courage des habitants en leur apprenant la victoire de Camille. Il est raisonnable de le présumer parent de ce Pontius Telesinus dont Sylla fit promener la tête à bout de pique autour des remparts de Préneste 64 [pageend66]pour effrayer les soldats de Marius et aussi de Lucius Pontius Aquila, l’un des conjurés qui poignardèrent César aux Ides de Mars. L’histoire connaît d’ailleurs plusieurs autres Pontii. La douzième année de son règne, Tibère confia à Ponce Pilate, sur la recommandation de Séjan, la tâche délicate d’administrer la Judée. Pilate emmena avec lui sa femme Claudia Procula, ce qui n’était pas la coutume. Il établit sa résidence à Césarée, à deux jours de la capitale religieuse de la province, Jérusalem. Peu de temps après son arrivée, des légionnaires entrèrent dans la ville sainte avec leurs enseignes déployées. Au-dessous des aigles, elles arboraient l’effigie de l’Empereur. Cette représentation de la figure humaine était sacrilège aux yeux des Juifs et jusqu’ici les Romains, respectueux de leurs croyances, avaient toujours laissé les enseignes aux portes de la cité. Le lendemain, une députation des habitants se rendit à Césarée pour demander le retrait des effigies. Les délégués supplièrent sept jours. A la fin, le procurateur leur ordonna de rentrer chez eux. Sur leur refus, il menaça de les tuer et les légionnaires mirent le glaive à la main. Les Juifs crièrent qu’ils étaient prêts à mourir pour leur foi. Pilate recula et consentit au retrait des enseignes. Pilate, en une autre circonstance, employa l’argent du Temple à la construction d’un aqueduc. Quand il vint à Jérusalem, les Juifs attaquèrent sa résidence. Le procurateur fit donner les légionnaires. Il y eut plusieurs morts et de nombreux blessés. Pilate acheva néanmoins la construction de l’aqueduc. A Jérusalem, il habitait l’ancien Palais d’Hérode, qu’il voulut décorer de boucliers. Par précaution, ils ne portaient pas l’effigie, mais seulement le nom de César. Il lui fut demandé de les retirer. Il refusa. Les Juifs adressèrent une supplique à Tibère, qui désavoua Pilate et lui ordonna d’enlever les boucliers. 65 [pageend67]Il semble également que, lors d’un autre incident, le procurateur se trouva responsable du massacre de plusieurs Galiléens. Il ne paraît pas cependant que les bonnes relations qu’il entretenait avec Antipas, le tétrarque de Galilée, aient souffert de l’incident. Ici, se place l’épisode que j’ai choisi d’évoquer, l’arrestation et le procès d’un prophète galiléen que le Sanhedrin entendait faire condamner à mort. L’affaire eut lieu en 782 de la fondation de Rome. Elle fut ensuite datée de l’an 29 de l’ère chrétienne. Mon récit tend à démontrer que ce nouveau millésime n’était pas inévitable. Plus tard, le bruit courut que les objets précieux du Tabernacle avaient été enterrés par Moïse au sommet du Mont Garizim. Une troupe d’aventuriers s’en fut à la recherche du trésor. Pilate imagina qu’il s’agissait de rebelles. Il les fit intercepter par ses légionnaires, qui en tuèrent un grand nombre. Les autres furent faits prisonniers et exécutés. Plainte fut déposée auprès de Vitellius, légat de Syrie. Pilate fut destitué et rappelé à Rome pour y justifier son administration. Pendant son voyage, en 790 de Rome, Tibère mourut. Sous Caligula, Pilate fut exilé à Vienne des Gaules. Selon les uns, il s’y suicida; selon les autres, il fut décapité sous Néron. On montre en tout cas le long du Rhône, un monument en ruines que la tradition désigne comme le tombeau de Pilate. Plus tard, l’Eglise Ethiopienne en fit un saint et un confesseur de la foi; et, semblablement, une sainte de sa femme Procula. Leur fête est célébrée le 25 du mois de Sané, c’est-à-dire le 19 juin. Il ressort de ces diverses données que les conflits qui opposèrent le procurateur à la population locale ont tous également pour cause les sentiments religieux de celle-ci — foi, fanatisme ou superstition — et l’obstination de Pilate à ne pas en tenir compte. Il juge que 66 [pageend68]le meilleur emploi d’un trésor sacré est une construction profane d’utilité publique; il tient à mettre les. emblèmes du pouvoir sur les murs de sa résidence et: à faire défiler les légionnaires avec l’effigie de César, il défend contre les prêtres et la foule un illuminé qu’il croit innocent : toutes mesures explicables, défendables, sinon estimables, mais peu politiques, étant donné les circonstances et la susceptibilité de la population soumise. En outre, il s’aperçoit qu’il est sans caractère : il menace, puis il cède; il s’engage témérairement et se trouve désavoué par ses supérieurs. D’autres fois, il agit avec une violence inutile, presque avec cruauté. On peut encore reconnaître un signe de faiblesse en cette brutalité intermittente, maladroite, presque toujours inopportune. C’est celle qui, chez les faibles, tient lieu de fermeté. Peut-être éprouvait-il ensuite du remords, et du mépris pour soi-même de se voir si peu doué pour l’exercice du pouvoir. Je pense qu’il voulait agir pour le mieux et que ses hésitations le plaçaient dans des situations difficiles, dont il ne savait sortir que par un recours exaspéré. Aussi sa carrière fut-elle prématurément interrompue. Il n’était pas fait pour un métier qui demande moins de scrupules, plus d’esprit de suite et plus de résolution. Il faut dire que ses bévues n’eurent pas trop de conséquences, sauf pour lui-même. Seul, l’incident que j’ai retenu, si le Romain avait acquitté le Messie comme j’ai feint qu’il avait fait, aurait pu en avoir de perceptibles. J’ai essayé — hélas, par conjecture, non par savoir contrôlé — d’expliquer comment le procurateur prit, une fois dans sa vie, par sursaut d’honnêteté et par droiture, une décision contraire à son caractère apparent. Peut-être était-elle conforme à sa nature profonde. Peut-être était-il simplement las d’être tenu pour celui qui se lave les mains. Je l’ignore. Je m’avoue 67 [pageend69]incapable de choisir entre ces solutions antagonistes. Je me suis efforcé de reconstituer, non les faits, qui sont connus d’autre part, mais les motifs, les intrigues, le jeu politique, les ressorts plus mystérieux d’une psychologie disputée, où ce qui l’emporte à la fin doit peut-être sa victoire à la fatigue ou au hasard; peut- <ê re aussi, à l’obscur total des actions, des négligences et des démissions d’un être, à la somme de ses reculs, de ses audaces avortées. En même temps que les abandons s’additionnent, les remords se capitalisent, les efforts sans lendemain, et jusqu’aux fugitives velléités ne sont pas perdues pour autant. Elles se conjuguent et accumulent une secrète vigueur. En cette comptabilité constamment à jour, il n’est rien qui ne s’inscrive et qui ne pèse. Lentement, elle infléchit ou mitige l’effet des défaillances antérieures. Toute décision prise influe sur la décision à prendre, dans l’un ou l’autre sens. Selon qu’elle laisse plaisir ou dégoût, elle contribue à creuser ou à combler une ornière. Dans le cas de Pilate, l’ornière semble avoir été profonde, et telle qu’elle ne pouvait guère lui laisser de liberté. En outre, j’ai multiplié à plaisir les pressions qui ont pu s’exercer sur lui pour le convaincre de laisser exécuter le Sauveur. J’ai décrit chacune de ces pressions, des plus sordides aux plus nobles, et leur redoutable convergence. J’ai même imaginé un disciple fanatique du Christ venant adjurer le procurateur de permettre l’accomplissement des Ecritures, puisque c’est au prix seul de sa mort ignomineuse que le Prophète pourrait devenir le Rédempteur de l’Homme. Pourtant Pilate refuse, tout lâche qu’il est. J’ai cru pouvoir justifier son très invraisemblable courage, non seulement par la sorte de renversement intime, à laquelle j’ai déjà fait allusion, mais encore par un secours souterrain, qu’il aurait alors reçu du meilleur 68 [pageend70]et des meilleurs de l’antiquité païenne, de l’Académie- et du Portique, de Socrate et d’Epictète, de mille exemples d’un héroïsme dont il se connaissait sans doute incapable, mais dont il savait que d’autres avaient fait preuve et qu’il était contraint d’admirer. J’ai conjecturé que cette rumeur innombrable et diffuse l’avait assisté en son débat difficile, comme chaque homme peut se trouver affermi ou contaminé par ce qu’il sait ou soupçonne de la conduite de tous les autres. Aussi n’ai-je pas décrit la conscience individuelle livrée seulement à la postérité de chacun de ses choix; il m’a paru équitable de la montrer en même temps subissant secrètement et bientôt ouvertement, comme eau qui sourd, l’imperceptible, extérieure et inextricable influence de la somme algébrique de la totalité des choix humains. J’ai vu là comme un substitut modeste et laïc de la Communion des Saints et de l’idée de la réversibilité des mérites. A la réflexion, cette hypothèse n’est pas aussi aventureuse qu’elle semble d’abord. Elle ne fait qu’insinuer que, dans le monde moral comme dans le monde physique, rien ne se perd et rien ne se crée. Tout s’ajoute perpétuellement et tout se retranche. De l’existence de ces additions et soustractions, constantes, infinies, infinitésimales, il me semble qu’on peut puiser, sinon la conviction, du moins l’espérance d’une solidarité universelle effective. Celle-ci, assurément, demeure diluée, incertaine. Dans le meilleur cas, elle reste si complexe qu’il est vain de présumer qu’on puisse jamais en escompter les effets, encore moins les prévoir et même les identifier. Toutefois on peut supposer qu’une telle solidarité existe et en tirer une règle de conduite. Pareille conjecture est assez exactement ce que Platon nommait un beau risque. Contrairement à celui de l’histoire, le Pilate que j’ai imaginé l’accepta. 69 [pageend71]Frederick Karinthy : BARABBAS This story by the late author of « Journey Around My Skull » who was beyond doubt one of the most brilliant writers of our century is a perfect afterpiece to Roger Caillois’ striking essay. It is also, we believe, a breathtakingly concise summary of the problem of democracy and justice, the mass-mind and the individual. And on the evening of the third day he stepped quietly from the narrow opening of the tomb and began to walk down the road. The ruins smoked blackly along both sides. Down at the bottom of the dry ditch he found the first of those who had shouted the name of Barabbas outside Pilate’s house. He was howling with a blackened tongue at the red clouds. He stopped close to him and said softly : « I am here. » And the man glanced up and started to sob. « Rabbi ! Rabbi ! » he cried. And the Master continued gently : « Do not weep but arise and come with me. For I am going back to Jerusalem to the house of Pilate to demand a new judgment upon myself and upon you who had chosen Barabbas and to whom Barabbas has done this evil. » And the wretch struggled to his feet and grabbed His garment. a Master ! » he cried, his voice choked with tears, « I am coming, Master ! Tell me how to save myself ! Tell me what to do ! Tell me what to say ! » 70 [pageend72]« Nothing. » « He replied tenderly. » Nothing except what you should have said three days ago when Pilate stepped onto the porch and asked you : Whom will ye that I release unto you ? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ ? » « Oh what a miserable fool I am », shouted the stricken man, beating his head with his fist. « Fool to have cried Barabbas ! Barabbas who has brought me to such misery ! » « It is well », the Master continued gently. « Come with me then to the house of Pilate, pay no attention to anything, watch nobody except me and when I signal to you, cry with all your heart and all your lungpower : ’the Nazarene !’ as if you cried : ’my life !’ » And the man followed Him. And on their way they came upon another wretch whom Barabbas had robbed of his home and his wife and his children and whose eyes he had put out. And He touched his forehead quietly with His hand and said : « It is I. Come with me to Jerusalem and when I touch you with my hand, cry : ’the Nazarene ! ’as if you cried : ’my home ! my children ! my sight !’ » And the blind man brust into sobs and followed Him. And they found still another whose hands and legs were tied with rope and looped around his neck while his face was pressed into a stinking swamp by Barabbas, to rot among loathsome reptiles and bugs. And He went to him and loosened his bonds and said : « I know you. You were a poet proclaiming the ecstatic flight of the spirit. Come with me and when I signal to you, cry : ’the Nazarene ! ’as if you cried : ’freedom ! liberty of soul and thought !’ » And the poet kissed His sandal and only pleaded with his eyes for his mouth was still choked with the mud. 71 [pageend73]And thus they walked on and more and more of the lame and the halt, the blind and the lepers joined them who had been ruined by Barabbas. And each of them heat his chest, sobbing, pleading with Him to give a sign when the moment had come to cry : « the Naza- rene ! ’as if they cried : « peace ! peace ! peace upon earth ! » By the evening they reached Jerusalem; in front of Pilate’s house they stopped. Pilate sat on the porch, sharing his evening meal with Barabbas, the murderer. They sat there, bulging, their faces shiny, drinking heavy wines and eating rare food from gold plate; their scarlet garments shone red in the dark. And the Nazarene, at the head of the multitude that followed him, stepped in front of the porch, raising his pierced hands and spoke quietly : « The Feast of Passover has not yet ended, Pilate. It is the custom and the law that one of those condemned you must let go as the people demand. They chose Barabbas and I was crucified — but I had to return from the tomb because I saw that the people knew not what they were doing. This multitude behind me has learned to know Barabbas and desires now a new judgment — ask them again as it is written in our Books of Law. » And Pilate pondered this, then shrugged and, stepping to the front of the porch, gazed in wonder at the crowd and asked : « Whom shall I let go then — Barabbas or the Nazarene ? » And He gave them the sign. There arose a shout and the multitude sounded like thunder. And the multitude cried : « Barabbas ! » And they looked upon each other in great fear because each of them, separately, had cried : « the Nazarene ! » 72 [pageend74]The Master turned pale and, swinging around, looked at them. And one by one He recognized their faces but in the evening dusk these many faces became a single one, an immense head, grinning stupidly, insolently and evilly into His face, its bloodshot eyes winked and a stinking saliva dripped from its mouth and its throat roared hoarsely : « Barabbas ! » as if groaned : cc death ! death ! death ! » Pilate lowered his eyes embarrassed and said to Him : « You see... » And he nodded and ascending the steps calmly, held out his hands to the executioner so that he could tie them. Translated by Paul Tabori. Pura Santillan-Castrence : THE PHILIPPINES, A MELTING POT OF CULTURES So many people have written about the mixed character of Philippine culture that to repeat it seems not only boring but somewhat even impertinent. Suffice it, therefore, to mention the fact that more perhaps than America is the Philippines a melting pot of cultures. The interested tourist who goes to the rural sections of the Philippines, the barrios and the municipios, will see interesting customs he will not have seen elsewhere. Perhaps at dusk he may come upon a group of workers in the fields, some pounding rice, some winnowing the pounded grain, some just loafing around picking the 73 [pageend75]straw scattered on the ground. Perhaps, as he watches the peaceful scene, fascinated by its calm and by its beauty, the church bells might ring the Angelus chimes. It is six o’clock — time to pause from whatever one is doing to give a little prayer of thanks for the day and for a quiet mutual greeting for the evening which is approaching. Everybody bows his head, and the interested spectator sees moving lips; the moment of reverence is all too soon over, after which the people, gathered together, say good-evening to each other, the young ones kissing the oldsters’ right hand as a sign of respect. It could be fiesta time, the barrio patron saint’s day. Then every house is open to every visitor, and by « open » is meant that anyone who comes partakes of something to eat. Since days, if not weeks, go into the preparadon of the food, the visitor is sure of something delectable and succulent. These fiestas show several characteristics of the Filipino. They show, in a rather dramatic, sometimes pathetic way, his proverbial hospitality, an oftentimes self-denying hospitality which can be very quixotic and, in instances, almost exasperating. It can make the Filipino insist that a guest, who has just eaten a heavy meal, eat again, and then again. It makes him pay for a guest’s purchases in a store or for a casual acquaintance’s meal in a restaurant or his ticket in a bus. Often enough he leaves guest or acquaintance uncomfortable especially if they are not Filipinos. These fiestas show the Filipino’s happy-go-lucky trait expressed in the Tagalog phrase bahalá na, meaning roughly « let happen what may ». The celebration, the food, the decorations of the house, may drain the family coffers completely, bahalá na. They may do more harm than that, they may mean debts. Bahalá na. The fiesta must be celebrated comme il faut. The future will take care of itself. 74 [pageend76]The future, it seems, does take care of itself for these happy people who love to laugh and sing and dance and philosophize. The fiesta is a time for laughter, song, and dance for the young, and for philosophizing for the old. Here, as the merriment goes on, with noise and music blending with the good food and drinks, the old men and women sit around and spin out proverbs. Why has So and So met such and such a fate ? It could be that, after all, who does not save for a rainy day, must starve when the rainy day comes. The son of a neighbor has turned out badly. Is that to be wondered at ? After all a mango tree does not produce a santol fruit. The nods and winks are very telling. Or, the son of another neighbor has married a sweet and virtuous girl. He is lucky, for is not a woman’s virtue to be cherished more greatly than riches ? Superstitions can be another subject of philosophical conversation. The Filipino is an imaginative individual and he is capable of bridging the gap between the knowable and the unknowable with the most astounding, even the most eerie explanations. Superstitions are, fortunately, gradually being swept away by the winds of education. The resulting gain in true knowledge comes in the wake of the destruction and, therefore, the loss of a world of fascinating make-believe to which our old superstitions belong. Is the child happy to discover, in the process of growing up, that there is no Santa Claus ? Thus we have discovered, through education, many things, wonderful and sad, beautiful and ugly, about the world outside and our world inside. We are Malays, therefore, Eastern, but our culture has become, through the process of history, through Spanish and American dominations, quite Western. Our religions are, in the order of their significance to us, and the number of people professing them, Catholic, Moslem, Protestant, Pagan, with Catholics predominating with a ninety-five percent or so rating. Spain 75 [pageend77]was a successful colonizer. The ways of our old people who were educated in Spanish schools are the ways of the Madrileno, the Spanish aristocrat with his quixotic ideas of chivalry and impractical urbanity. America was no less successful as a colonizer in the realms which she explored. People call us a « little America », a cognomen we naturally resent, but there is some truth in the label. Those of us who have been educated in the American kind of schools « think American » about such traits as sportmanship, fairness, outspokenness and practicality. We are not fully understood by the Filipinos who were raised by Spanish-trained parents or who have preferred the Spanish kind of schools, or by Filipinos who, living in rural places, have not had too much contact with the American way of life. We might perhaps say, that one levelling instrument is the American movies which show American mores and morals, music, dances, etc. (unfortunately not at their best) to all classes and groups of Filipinos. The melting pot has recently been seething with unusual restlessness. The war has opened horizons hitherto unexplored. The world has figuratively shrunk in size since travelling from one part to another has become so easy, and Filipinos are now everywhere on the face of the earth. Filipino students go not only to Spain and the United States. They are also in France, England, Holland, Italy, Germany, India, Japan, Pakistan, Singapore, Hongkong - politics and a contrary belief have prevented them from being also in the Iron Curtain countries. The Filipino has become almost ubiquitous. With all these influences beating upon the Filipino’s consciousness, he cannot readily accept the disdainful reproach of his manifesting a nondescript identity which is sometimes thrown at his face. Can he help it if his culture is so manyfaceted ? The pure-cultured or relatively pure-cultured peoples are, doubtless, to be envied 76 [pageend78]their good fortune. They have been able, through the centuries, to preserve an individuality all their own. The Filipinos have not. This is a statement of fact, not an apology. They could not because they were not left alone to find themselves in their own way. That is another statement of fact, not a reproach. The concoctions issuing from the melting pot are interesting. Filipino art (paintings and sculptures), architecture, music, the dance, the theater, Filipino literature — in short, Filipino culture, from the point of view of his expression of his imagination — shows the varied strains of the manifold influences of the Filipino’s national history. These strains are used in versatile ways, some almost pure, often in a harmonious, homogenous mixture. Filipino painting, for example, ranges, like the paintings of other countries, from the most orthodox to the most modern or the most abstract. The old-fashioned paintings may clearly denote a Philippine motif, but might have the style of a European artist. The more modern paintings would have obscure themes, or no themes at all, would be as unidentifiable (for country) as any modern painting from any country, and the influence could easily be from France, Japan, or elsewhere. The same may be said of Filipino sculpture. Filipino architecture ranges from styles which are truly native to those which have been influenced by the Spanish Occupation, and more recently to those brought home by architects who have studied in the United States and Europe. The styles do not shock unless they are pretentious or are inartistic because of uncouth combinations intended, perhaps, for distinction and difference, but succeeding only in becoming grotesque and tasteless. Filipino composers have sought, with some success, to express Philippine motifs in the accepted vehicle of modern music. The effect is sometimes shocking, 77 [pageend79]especially when, in the combination, relatively little of the old strains is recognizable for identification. But even when shocking, the resulting product is interesting. Luckily the old classics, which show the blend of Spanish and Malayan influences, remain, not as museum exhibits but as living specimens of what we always enjoy hearing, or interpreting, ourselves. The Filipino folk-dance is one of our national prides. Fortunately Filipino dance-masters and mistresses have been successful in collecting samples of these dances all over the country and preserving them in books and phonograph records, as well as in schools which are expected to perpetuate them as part of the school curriculum. The Filipino folk-dance is known now all over the world because of the imagination and courage of these dance-experts and the schools which have believed in and have supported their patriotic undertaking. These dances have done very much, incidentally, in familiarizing the Filipino from one region with the folk-dance and folk-music from another region and are, even from that point of view, useful in promoting national closeness. This is specially important since the country, divided as it is into so many islands (more than 7,000 according to statistics), affords an undesirable isolation of different regions which many Filipinos do not take time to correct or modify. Most of the Moslem and pagan dances and songs, for instance, have been, up to the time of the folk-dance vogue in the Philippines, not known in the Christian regions. It is almost certain that the other situation is true also. The Filipino theater (if one is to speak of the legitimate theater), has been undergoing a very healthy revival in the Philippines. There is distinct awareness that, in the socalled search for the real Filipino in art, all these explorations into what we were, whether that was already mixed up or not, are indispensable and of the greatest significance. Thus, our children see 78 [pageend80]for the first time, old romantic dramas (zarzuelas, they are called) full of what would now be impossible situations, recited in vernacular verse and acted in full panoply of color and gestures. The Filipino movies are still, one might say, in their infancy. If they succeed in weaning themselves away from the influence of the old Filipino melodramas as well as from the American Hollywood influence (the contrived Hollywood ending) and portray, like the Japanese and the Indian in realistic artistry, the varied facets and colorations of Philippine life, they would be better off than they are now. We have yet much to learn in cinema presentation. A wise selectivity of topics can, treated sensitively and boldly, depict on the screen the harmonious blend of Filipino nature. Filipino literature is a topic in itself. A country as conglomerate, as multilingual (there are 150 dialects of which five are the most significant), and as variously and colorfully influenced in its history as the Philippines cannot but have an unusual literature. In the first place, its literature is multilingual, of course. For the purpose of simplification, the vehicles of expression of its literature may be reduced to three languages, namely, the national language, Filipino, English and Spanish. The problem is still not so simple. The psychology of English and Spanish is different from the natural psychology of any Filipino dialect. The Filipino writer writing in Filipino is more likely to express in that tongue with sensitivity and understanding the innermost and deepest feelings of his people. Thus the great Filipino poet, Balagtas, wrote in Filipino (or Tagalog) the, to the Filipino, immortal narrative poem Florante at Laura. But, unfortunately, some Filipino writers write in Filipino because they do not feel adequate in expressing themselves either in English or in Spanish (now the majority of « adequate » writers use English). Such writers in Filipino would, 79 [pageend81]generally, not have followed the literary trends that have shaken the most significant literatures of the world. More often than not, the old romantic topics would be exploited, the old romantic solutions. There are, of course, some who have studied the new ways, the new meanings of literature, and use these with Filipino as vehicle. A few have been successful. They, at least, have broken the ground. Yet, for clever writers that they are, they cannot help revealing in some subtle way or another that they must be, in the recesses of their unusual minds, translating their thoughts, from a foreign language, English perhaps, instead of these coming out directly from brain to paper. The unusual character of the language they use gives the suspicion. The other kinds of Filipino writers, those who write or wrote in Spanish (Spanish is not so much used today anymore), or those who write in English, face the problem of competency of language transmission. At this juncture it may be mentioned that Spanish seemed, during its time, to carry the Filipino’s deep thoughts and feelings much better than English now. The reason given is that both Spanish and Filipino are florid languages, given to roundabout ways of expressing a situation or a sentiment. Both are inclined to poetize, both are somewhat impractical, not immediately functional. The novels of Rizal (the Filipino writer who died for the country and whose death did much to fan the flame of the Philippine Revolution) were written in Spanish, yet they caught completely the nuances of Filipino living and Filipino feeling. The Filipino writers today who write in English have almost the whole world to compete with. Their task is difficult. Yet, in spite of the natural psychological limitations that they must surmount, a few of them have succeeded in winning places of honor not only in their country, but also abroad. These Filipinos have been able to transcend geographical boundaries, and, 80 [pageend82]while essentially speaking as a Filipino, have sublimated feelings and thoughts to make them understood by the foreigner who, essentially human, in turn, responds to the universal in the Filipino equally with what is universal in any human being. The Filipino poet has invaded England, the United States, India, Australia; the Filipino fictionwriter and essayist are known also in these countries. The Filipino writer has not yet set foot in Europe, so to speak, but the Filipino is relatively young in his calling and has a promising future ahead of him. Clearly he has the imagination (note his superstitions) and the wisdom (note his tendency to philosophize when he gets old). He has the gift of laughter, of music and of rhythm. He has suffered, he has fought nobly, in wars for his own cause, and in wars for the cause of man’s dignity. He has rejoiced too in his survival and has risen, by his own bootstraps, to personal freedom and a position of respect. One day he will express all this in a great way in literature. Ip what language will he speak ? Lydia Slater : CORNFLOWERS Please do not bring me flowers any more, At least not those so full of recollections. They speak of things you never meant to say, Reviving dreams of long forgotten beauty. Those deep-blue, prickly petals, how they smell Of things long past, when life was still a promise, 81 [pageend83]Of yellow fields, a Russian countryside, Of summer heat, and happiness and sunshine ! The sky so blue above the golden rye, The larks’ unceasing joy inmidst the sky, And warm, discreet, blue flowers, dry and sweet, Collected by small hands among the wheat. We made them into bunches, and we wound Tight, dark-blue wreaths and put them in our hair. We were two little girls, and life was still An unperturbed and steady flow of seasons. But childhood soon had gone; and other years Came down on us, and brought us hopes and worry. And trouble started, never yet to end. And then I met my first, my closest friend. O streets of Moscow, still and white ! O endless walks through wintry night ! A wintry sky and stars above, We did not know that that was love. The snow so clean, the sky so dark, And lace of birch-trees in the park, And nothing else, but he and I, And snow, and trees, and stars, and sky. It had no future from the start. When summer came we had to part. His were the deep-blue flowers... No, do not bring me flowers any more. You’re not in love with me, no use pretending. Give them to girls who had no friend before. And make a story with a happy ending. 82 [pageend84]MEEK REBELLION Sick I feel of being patient, Sick of taking in all those Endless tales of stricken people, Their afflictions and their woes.

But instead, with streaming eyes, Frozen stiff, I write to silly Letters sillier replies. Never-ending silly letters, Endless phone-calls, endless knocks, Endless washing-up and cooking, Endless holes in endless socks... Lord, forgive me, I am sininng, But it is a passing mood, And I try to count my blessings, To give in, and to be good, Struggling on, resigned, and tired. Of a load of love, unspent; Far too old to be desired, Far too young to be content. 83 [pageend85]ANNALS OF EXILE « I will not let thee go, except thou bless me ». Vladimir Stedry : JACOB’S LADDER There was a soldier called Pinsker who used to wander around Jerusalem with me. There was a street of the same name in Tel Aviv, but that had nothing to do with him. Neither he nor any of his family ever lived there, had not even been born in the town. So it was not his street, and anyway Eugene Pinsker would have been a little young for such an honour. He had not been long in Palestine, in fact he only arrived in the Promised Land a few months before Hitler started his war. Nor did he come as an exile, but rather as a wanderer returning home. Ëugene Pinsker was a convinced Zionist, but an atheist and a socialist at one and the same time. It seemed rather odd, you can imagine, coming across an atheist in the Holy Land, but that is how it was. He confided to me that his purpose in making the journey to Zion was not to seek his God, as with many pilgrims. He had wanted to work in a Kibbutz, a collective settlement, and to help Palestine become once more the home of all the sons of Israel—a free and sovereign state. 84 [pageend86]In a free Israel Eugene Pinsker wanted to work, live, and if need be, to fight. But his luck was out. Heavy labour on the scorched and sandy plains of Palestine proved bad for his health. So when war broke out, being a native of Klatovy in Bohemia, and disappointed in himself, he volunteered for the Czechoslovak army. And that is how it came about that we two met in the Czechoslovak Military Mission in Jerusalem, I an exile, and he the son who had returned to the land of his ancestors. But he was equally unhappy in the army. Instead of fighting the enemy he had found himself struggling against malaria in the Syrian desert, and after that he was never posted to any front. At the time we met fighting seemed to be in progress everywhere except in Palestine, so we had time to spare for wandering around in God’s own land. It was Eugene Pinsker who showed me all the sights of Jerusalem. We went together around the bazaar in the Old Town, encircled by the yellow ribbon of Soliman’s Wall; we visited the main synagogue, the delapidated Khuerva, from whose tower we could admire the mosque of Omar; and we halted together at the tombs of the prophets. We visited the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the house where St. Anne, the mother of the Blessed Virgin, was born. There were beautiful passion flowers in bloom, and you could still find the very bushes with thorns like spears, which provided a crown for the hapless King of the Jews. Together we climbed Mount Olive, where a treasured relic is guarded— the footprint of the victorious Christ at the moment of His Ascension—and from there we came down to the garden of Gethsemane, where one of the most beautiful of all Christian churches stands. And we passed together under the arch from which Pilate exhibited Christ to the furious mob: Ecce Homo! 85 [pageend87]Along the Via Dolorosa, Friday after Friday we saw pious Poles making their way in the steps of Christ’s sacrifice. In fact whatever was worth seeing in Jerusalem I saw for the most part in the company of Eugene Pinsker; even the site of Solomon’s temple, his palace, harem and stables. There were only two places that I missed. One was the grave of Sarah, Matriarch of the tribe of Israel; the other the encampment where God once appeared to Jacob, son of Isaac, and promised him the land where he had lain. Pinsker confessed to me that he had never felt any inclination to visit the grave of Sarah, nor yet the place where Jacob had seen a ladder growing out of the desert leading up to Heaven. He was not even sure where they were. One evening we were on duty again at the Mission. It was spring, and the evening a wonderful, mild oriental one. Fireflies were twinkling with their phosphorescent light, and our garden was filled with the perfume of sliced sweet melon wafted over from some fruitseller’s booth. We lay outside our stifling office with the windows open so that we could hear if the telephone rang. We had turned out all the lights and stared up at the sky out of the darkness; for it is the finest sight of all. In our home country the night sky had a washed out, grayish look, flat and cold; the stars seemed dead, like chips of mother- of-pearl scattered over faded plush in an antique- shop window. But in the East the stars shone bright and vivid on the soft, black velvet of the deep-vaulted sky, and your imagination arranged them in the loveliest of patterns. You can play games with those eastern stars; there are so many of them and they look so close in perfect stillness, with nothing to disturb you while you try to remember what each one is called, or invent your own names for them and decide what they augur for the future. £6 [pageend88]Oh God, how lovely it is to lie in peace under the fathomless mirror of the universe, when the air is fragrant and fireflies are glittering around your head ! Suddenly Pinsker started talking: «So this is the Promised Land. Yes, looking up at the sky one could forget that hot drudgery in the fields of the kibbutzim.» And then he went on to tell me how he had pegged away on that co-operative farm till he had fallen sick and had to abandon farmwork altogether. He described regretfully the beauty of being able to turn the sandy wilderness into gardens, vineyards, fertile fields and orange groves. «It makes you feel like the Creator himself, and the joy of grinding toil is boundless.» He heaved a sigh. «A pity I couldn’t stand up to it. Each one of us tries to make a piece of heaven for himself. But we never reach our heaven. It’s just a bit too high for us.» I tried to make light of his mood, saying that Heaven couldn’t be all that way off, when Jacob in his dream had seen a ladder leading straight to the threshold of God. Somehow I could not resist the temptation to get up and fetch a Bible. Before coming out into the garden again I switched on a tablelamp in the office and turned the shade till the light fell on the spot where I had been lying beside Pinsker on the blanket outside. This time I threw out a pillow, so as to have something under my head. Then I went out myself and settled down and started to read from the twenty-eighth chapter of Genesis. «And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran. And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep. And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set 87 [pageend89]up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven ; and, behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it. And, behold, the Lord stood above it, and said, I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; and the seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of. And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the Lord is in this place; and I knew it not. And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place: this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillow, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it. And he called the name of that place Beth-el: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first. And Jacob vowed a vow, saying. If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, so that I come again to my father’s house in peace; then shall the Lord be my God: And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God’s house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee. Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east.» I finished reading and waited for Pinsker to say something. But he made no reply. So I started to explain to him that actually I had made a discovery. I had discovered the patron saint of exiles and that 88 [pageend90]in none else but in the biblical Jacob, the son of Isaac, the same Isaac who was to have been sacrificed to God just on that stone which is kept hidden from the eyes of unbelievers beneath the main cupola of the Mosque of Omar. «Haven’t we been scattered like the dust of the earth, too, west, east, north and south?» Perhaps I was a little over-enthusiastic with my discovery disturbing the mournful train of Pinsker’s pitiful, disillusioned reminiscences; he had found nothing but a mirage and a deception in Palestine. Suddenly he sprang up shouting: «What stupid nonsense you’re talking! Patron saint of exiles! Just take a good look at the sky up there. If you only close your eyes you can imagine whatever you wish. Oriental fables and old wives’ tales, that’s all they are! Ladders; Heaven indeed! Lord God Almighty!» «You needn’t take my patron saint away from me just because you don’t believe in anything yourself,» I protested. Eugene Pinsker laughed like a jeering schoolboy. «Nice sort of saint for exiles, I must say! Robbed his own brother of his birthright for a plateful of boiled lentils, and wheedled a blessing out of his old blind father. Nothing but a confidence trickster.» «Which qualifies him all the better to be our patron saint,» I replied. «Just look at us! Think how often we boast with other people’s assets! And which of us poor devils wouldn’t like to be the first sometimes? Even Jacob came to repent in the end, and plenty of us will have to when the time comes. Anyway, aren’t you now serving just for the sake of a mess of potage...?» «Hot air,» exclaimed Eugene Pinsker with an angry wave of his hand and left me. All of a sudden the garden had lost its scent, the fireflies had guttered out and the stars receded by 89 [pageend91]billions of light years. For a moment I could still see the shadow of Pinsker, the angry Zionist, who refused to believe in God because He had not granted him the strength to make his own private Heaven out of the sandy wastes of Palestine. Then the door into the Mission was closed, I closed the Old Testament and remained alone. But at that moment it struck me that it is sometimes harder for a man to disbelieve in God than to believe in Him. Take a look at this Eugene Pinsker. The features of his face were almost girlish, and between the narrow Hebrew nose and high forehead his eyes were stamped with the sufferings of whole generations of Jews. Those dark eyes were not yet twenty- five years old, their expression however, was full of anxiety and perpetual escape, persecution and abasement. They glowed with an endless quest for the undiscoverable and unattainable, the incessant longing for peace, reconciliation and permanency. And if his mouth was a trifle twisted, it was because his hereditary disillusion was turned into sarcasm. His grandfather had been a Godfearing man, his father somewhat less so, and now the son believed in nothing at all. His young soul was weary of the lot of the despised who resorted to despising their own ancestors in return. He went along with a slight forward stoop, so that even when he was walking slowly he seemed to be chasing something, and his speech by daytime sounded quite different from that when night cast its net of mystic darkness over the world. At those times something in him seemed to rebel at the presence of the unknown; he (feared the magic of a power he did not know or wished to know, and from which he vainly tried to escape. Pinsker lived in hatred of something he could not flee — that nostalgia for his ancestors which seized him when the stars, like semaphor 90 [pageend92]signals in the night sky pointed to him the way home. It was then that I came to understand in my own way Jacob’s tussle with the angel, and his words of prayer and defiance: «I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.» But where was home for Eugene Pinsker? Was it in Klatovy where he was born? Or in this land of Abraham whence his forefathers had come? How essential it is for all of us to know where our home is; for how else can we find the path to Heaven? Jacob, son of Isaac, was still on his native soil when he saw the ladder growing up out of it and the angels ascending and descending before the eyes of the Lord. Even then, perhaps, the sky was as star-filled as it was to-day, even then the perfume of sliced melon was wafted abroad, and the fireflies flew round Jacob’s head like a living aureole. That evening at the beginning of the world could not have been so different from this one, for time stands still in the Orient and the only clocks are European ones. And when Jacob closed his eyes, did he not see hosts of stars behind his eyelids, living and mysterious stars—hosts of angels ? That mystic night when God appeared to Jacob in all His glory, surrounded by the seraphim, light and fragrance! A solitary Czech soldier in the garden of the Military Mission in Jerusalem yearned from the depths of his heart to have a vision of that kind. But the Lord God is not at home to everyone. Yet if there was one thing about which I felt certain at that time it was that I had at least discovered the patron saint of all the myriad exiles who walked over the face of the earth during those days of war. I had not rested my head on a desert stone, true; only a pillow stuffed with crackling straw. I had had not pitcher of oil by me to sanctify the stone, but a half-empty bottle of tepid soda water. 91 [pageend93]And around me was no stony wilderness of the Promised Land, but a neglected Arab garden full of cactus that pricked your shins wherever you went. Yet somewhere near me I sensed a ladder growing up, every rung marked with the date of a year lost in foreign countries. Did the ladder reach to heaven? No, heaven was too far away, and of angels there was no sign at all. I gazed around for a moment, disillusioned; then I went to look for Pinsker in the room we shared. Not having discovered my angels I was anxious not to lose a friend as well. It was some years later that I recalled that quiet evening in Jerusalem. Many exciting things had happened meanwhile. The war had ended, and I and thousands of others had returned home. We had tried to forget the severities of war, the red tape of army life, the risks of bombs and raids. We had forgotten the cold and rain of England; the blazing heat, the sunstrokes and illnesses of the sandy eastern plains; guard duty during raids, and in cold and rain; marches, patrols and skirmishes in the exhausting desert. And we had forgotten many good things along with the bad. It was not until later when a new tyranny arose and a new kind of oppression came to my country, and I—and thousands of others—were on our way again to a land where we could live in freedom, that I remembered Eugene Pinsker, our wanderings around Jerusalem, and that evening under the stars and the story of Jacob’s ladder. A refugee once more, I had plenty of time to recall the past. 92 [pageend94]One evening I found myself lying on the dirty, dusty sand beneath the stars in a refugee camp in southern Italy. The sky was not nearly such a deep one as in the East; the stars sank back into the abyss of the night and I had a thousand unfulfilled desires. One of them was that I might find peace and calm and permanency, that heaven on earth for all those who must continually be on their way and have no home anywhere. The people around me, refugees from a new barbarism, had the same thoughts as I, but they spoke in different terms. They talked of Brazil, Chile and Peru, of Bolivia, Africa and Australia, Canada, the United States, of Great Britain. Many had their nearest friends in New Zealand, others in Israel, Persia and Afghanistan, even in India. In that Italian refugee camp the talk ranged over many lands and all five continents, and it went on in several languages. I felt as if I were listening to a number of simultaneous prayers, but none ended with an «Amen». The prayers they offered up to their future homelands all finished with the word «Visa». «Grant me, Lord God, a visa to Great Britain, Peru or Bolivia, to Chile, Canada or Australia, to Africa or New Zealand! Grant me , Lord God, a visa to some country or continent where there are houses of wood or stone; in which real natives light up their rooms at dusk, people who were actually born in the country, perhaps in that very house and behind those very windows.» «Grant me, Lord God, a country and a town in that country in whose streets and houses not every face will be strange to me. Hearken, Lord God, and grant me a visa!» Mrs. Karpinsky and Mr. Silhan are telling one another how she will model hats in Melbourne and 93 [pageend95]he will make handbags in Buenos Aires. Emil Dundr and Juri Kobr are planning to set up a motor repair shop in Chicago one day. Rudolf Sejbal intends to write a book about his journeys and Emanual Fric is learning Portuguese to improve his prospects in Venezuela. Karla Myskova, being young and pretty, is sure she can marry money whichever country she goes to. All the people around me were thinking the same thoughts as I; only they spoke in different terms. When evening came and I lay down under the stars and shut my eyes I could see a ladder growing up out of the grey, dusty sand of the refugee camp; each rung marked with the date of a year lost away from home. But no angels climbed the ladder. Instead, I saw in it the figures of Mrs. Karpinska and Mr. Silhan, Emil Dundr and Juri Kobr, Rudolf Sejbal and Emanuel Fric, and Karla Myskova, fresh, young and attractive. All of them were climbing up, on and on, myself amongst them. But heaven never opend up to us. Every evening I saw not one but dozens of ladders rising up from the waste land of the camp, every evening I saw that not one of them led anywhere. Our dusks were full of dreams, and our wishes dropped with the stars down through the abyss of night to the depths of the dawn. Each one of us, 0 Jacob, son of Isaac, carries your ladder with him and lies down at its foot when night falls, with the stone of anxiety under his head and the alien desert all around, a wilderness which is so bitterly hard to turn into fertile fields! The labour tells on our health, and when we wearily ascend or descend your ladder, we see on it not angels but the faces of our fellow-pilgrims, or of those we left at home. And these are harrowing encounters. 94 [pageend96]Each of us carries your ladder within himself, Jacob, and tries to prop it against his lucky star before the barred gates of his own private heaven. We wander through the world with no visa to Heaven in our pockets; we never get beyond the beginning of our journey. Gizi de Zsemley Blore THE EXILE We are exiles, not heroes. The heroes stay —and die. We ran away and tell of horrors we escaped. Exiles. (The heroes stay —and die.) Don’t look up and ask why your new sky is grey, Exile. We are not heroes, the heroes stay —and die. 95 [pageend97]We are safe, and yet complain: the food is strange, the new home cold, not like the old, the spring is dull, the summer dead, no flower sweet, even the beat of our heart is changed. Memories crowd us, beautiful, tormenting, as we remember the old home and cry. Heartbroken people, the Exile. Not heroes. The heroes stay —and die. Robert Ray REFLECTIONS Our potted green plant, with its many leaves forlornly sticks toward the ceiling, climbing on air, with many empty heaves from that handful of dirt. It’s funny to look at and to watch it grow is amusing, nevertheless, it seems pathetic when you had 96 [pageend98]thought of its limit, its final aims. Why does it do it? Can it feel anger or sorrow or when the thick veins stand out in its thick, green flesh; are they the sign of strain? Does it quietly scream in a frustrated wave of wanting? Is it choking on air, polluted by the smoke of cigarettes? And when we are out for days, does it fear the lonesome echo of our miserly room? Are we its friends, or are we its Gods? And when its single bloom comes forth, is it an offering for us, a princely gift with myriad shades, or just the start of the setting of the rot? 97 [pageend99]PROFILES Herbert Kretzmer : FELIKS TOPOLSKI He is a small, sturdy man who works underneath a railway line and has become rich and famous by painting grotesque pictures of celebrated people. He takes himsef very seriously. Lots of people who donťt, have called him everything from a charlatan to a cartoonist. Feliks Topolski is neither. He is an artist intensely involved in life, with a style as instantly recognisable as the dome of St. Paul’s. He is clever and canny and commercial—an inspired doodler who likes to see himself as an out- of-step original, scorning the rules, forging new paths, a tireless witness of the human pageant. Probably no other artist working in England today has established for himself so wide an area of recognition. He told me with pleasure: «Once when I was drawing something in the street a docker looked over my shoulder and said: ’You’re that fellow Topolski’. Knew me right off. A docker. Fascinating.» Prince Philip, a personal friend, commissioned a 100ft. Topolski mural of the Coronation for Buckingham Palace. 98 [pageend100]On the other hand almost any charwoman in the country could identify the scribbled pencil portraits that precede the B.B.C.-TV feature. «Face to Face * without waiting for the credit line. Calling on Feliks Topolski at his studio is something like Judy Garland visiting the Wizard of Oz. The whole place is utterly bizarre and theatrical, a lofty cavern directly beneath Hungerford Bridge opposite the back door of the Royal Festival Hall. Over Topolski’s head tens of thousands of Londoners travel every day to and from Charing Cross. The rumble of trains punctuates his working day, interrupting conversation at time-tabled intervals. Gigantic and ponderous canvases writhe and clamber up Topolski’s walls. Flags, sofas, bric-à-brac— even a small printing press—are strewn across the place as though scattered there by a giant hand carelessly throwing dice. Dwarfed by such awesome paraphernalia. Topolski darts about his chaotic grotto like a man obsessed by the need to keep on the move. He talks fast and well. But, maybe because he is provoked by the sometimes scornful attitude towards his work, he is also cagey, self-protective, sensitive about his reputation. «What do you want? What do you want to say about me?» he demanded to know. I said that I considered him a buccaneer. He beamed with pleasure. «That sounds sympathetic» he agreed. Topolski is a Pole. He was already established in his own country when he came to Britain in 1935 to record the Jubilee celebrations for a Warsaw newspaper. Britain affected him deeply. He reacted with an almost childlike pleasure to the panache and pomp of ceremonial parades. 99 [pageend101]The early seeds were planted for his consequent conversion. «It was at a time,» he recalls, «when Europeans were becoming more and more like each other in costume and behaviour and attitudes. »England for me had the sudden, exotic quality cf being utterly different, something almost of another time. »I became involved in England. I grew into the country. The blitz of London changed Britain for ever. And it changed me for ever too. »I was wounded in the raids, you know. You needn’t print that if you don’t want to. I’m not fishing for heroics. »I have an English wife. It is here that I developed my friendships and my hates. This is the one country which gives me a sense of assurance. England is the most reliable country I know. How can I put it? It gives me the feeling of a good roof over my head.» Even as he spoke the roof over Topolski’s head shivered as another train nosed its noisy way towards Charing Cross. Topolski’s hates are not many. But they are fervent. High on his list are those art critics who have never given him his due. I got the impression that Topolski feels spurned, underrated. He insists on the pretence that he is unconcerned by criticism. «I have outgrown insults.» But clearly he has not. «Critics can be despicable,» Topolski said. «They are such vogue followers. They change their standards over and over again, according to what is currently fashionable. They are swept along by fads... «They are, as a result, quite ruthless in their judgment of an artist who works according to his beliefs, an artist who isn’t prepared to alter his style in order to be modish. I have a continuous style and purpose, 100 [pageend102]and this makes them most impatient with me. They write me off, some of them, as a mere stylist. »They forget that people who have style without inner heat are either fools or tricksters. I am neither. One must be fired by the heat of an idea. Otherwise one is nothing...» I looked up at the walls. Inner heat was everywhere. The portraits glowed and wriggled in their frames like faces in a nightmare. A deep purple John Betjeman rolled cod’s eyes heavenwards next to a bright-boiled-pink Evelyn Waugh, small-mouthed and disapproving. Four Nubar Gulbenkians made up a composite portrait of almost mystical opulence. Bertrand Russell (sitting down, of course) was all wispy whiteness, like a wellwhisked cream puff. Edith Sitwell leered sideways like an an teáter... They were, all these portraits, ugly, compulsive and immediately recognisable. Topolski said: «Let others settle for comfort. I am an explorer. I try to open the road. I am completely prepared to break my neck doing so.» He waved a hand up at the gallery of celebrated demons climbing the walls around us. «I don’t try to caricature these people,» he said. «I want to get at them, into them. Out of this effort comes the exaggeration. I don’t state anything coolly. I underline. I try to give them energy and vitality. I am not a photographer.» Such vitality and energy derives, in large measure, from Topolski’s own restlessness and gluttony for life. He is probably the most travelled artist alive, wallowing waist-deep in history as it happens, charging about the world with his pencil poised like a lance. 101 [pageend103]«During the war I visited every front I could find. I sailed in a cruiser in the Arctic. I go for life. Yes, it is a kind of gluttony which pushes me into uncommon, even dangerous experiences, not because I am brave but because my curiosity overwhelms all other instincts, self-preservation included. «I am, you see, interested in human beings, not in being fashionable. I have always hated to march in step. I was always tempted to walk the other way. »I am not a weak person. I didn’t have that kind of weakness which makes other people fall for readymade religions or ready-made political groupings. I am against all mass movements. »I have no conceit. I have no self-assurance. I shall go on to the end being obedient to my own gifts. I shall go on to the end refusing to follow banners...» MARTIN KUKUCIN écrivain et exilé slovaque Martin Kukucin (1860-1928) par son destin et son œuvre est très proche de maints exilés d’aujourd’hui. Il a vécu la moitié de sa vie en exil volontaire, en refusant de supporter l’ambiance suffocante de son pays, créée par la domination étrangère. Sa vie reflète avec une féroce clarté la situation cruelle, dans laquelle se trouvait son peuple à la fin du XIXe et au commencement du XXe siècle. « Parce que j’étais en opposition avec les gouvernements, 102 [pageend104]je préférai partir pour l’Amérique », a-t-il dit en 1911. De sa vingtquatrième anne jusqu’à sa mort survenue à 68 ans, il vécut presque sans cesse à l’étranger. Il prenait ses sujets, non dans le seul milieu slovaque, mais dans ceux de Prague, de la Dalmatie, de l’Amérique du Sud, du Chili, de l’Argentine, dans la vie des émigrés croates à Punta Arenas. Il a vécu huit ans à Prague, douze ans sur l’île de Brac, en Dalmatie, une année à Santiago du Chile, quatorze ans à Punta Arenas, au point extrême sud du continent sud-américain, il avait une ferme en Patagonie, près de Lago Argentino, il a passé les dernières années de sa vie en différentes villes de Yougoslavie, il est mort en 1928 à Zagreb, en Croatie. Il a souffert comme tous les émigrés, « en mangeant le pain amer des exilés », mais son exil n’était pas pour lui une cause de désespérance, plutôt une source d’insoiration. Par ses œuvres, il a enrichi d’une manière durable la littérature slovaque et ses livres méritent d’être lus non seulement dans les pays d’où il tirait ses sujets, mais ils contiennent aussi un message universel destiné à tous les hommes. Il est un des plus remarquables représentants de l’école du réalisme littéraire slovaque. Martin Kukucin (de son véritable nom Matej Ben- cur) est né en 1860 dans un petit village slovaque, Jasenova, au nord de la Slovaquie, d’une famille de paysans. Il est devenu instituteur. En 1885, il part pour Prague étudier la médecine. Déjà comme jeune instituteur il a commencé à publier des nouvelles. Elles laissaient pressentir qu’un écrivain de talent était entré dans la littérature slovaque. Il y introduisit le premier « l’image de la vie du simple homme slovaque ». La situation des Slovaques vers la fin du XIX' siècle était très difficile. La Slovaquie était administrée par le gouvernement de Budapest, l’administration et 103 [pageend105]I les tribunaux locaux étaient exclusivement aux mains d’une bureaucratie chauvine, l’autonomie locale fui abolie, les écoles pénétrées par un farouche esprit d’intolérance nationale, la plus grande partie de la terre était aux mains de la noblesse magyare ou magyarisée, l’industrie en grande partie était propriété de la bourgeoisie étrangère (1). D’après les lois de. 1872 à 1874, les ouvriers étaient obligés de travailler 16 heures par jour, les enfants entre dix et douze ans, 10 heures par jour. Les crises économiques (p.ex. celle de 1873) créèrent un chômage chronique, des régions entières souffraient de sous- alimentation et d’épidémies, les impôts étaient écrasants, l’usure ruinait les paysans (en Slovaquie orientale on payait jusqu’à 70 % d’intérêt), le manque de capitaux, une terre peu fertile, de mauvaises récoltes — tout cela eut pour conséquence une terrible saignée d’émigration, des régions entières se dépeuplèrent. Durant quelques dizaines d’années avant la première guerre mondiale, plus de 700.000 Slovaques émigrèrent (en 1914 il y avait approximativement 2,5 millions de Slovaques en Hongrie). L’intelligent- zia slovaque, sous prétexte de « panslavisme », fut persécutée ou boycottée par les représentants du gouvernement omnipotent et tous ceux qui dépendaient de lui. La fraude électorale battait son plein, entre 1884 et 1892 il n’y avait pas un seul député slovaque au Parlement de Budapest. En 1874, le gouvernement frappe un grand coup contre le mouvement national en fermant les trois dernières écoles moyennes privées slovaques, pépinières d’éducation et de l’esprit national slovaque. En 1875, il supprime l’institut culturel national slovaque « Matica slovenská », créé avec les dons des patriotes et convertit (1) Jászi : A nemzeti államok kialakulâsa és a nemzetiségi kérdés, Budapest 1912, pp. 437-495. 104 [pageend106]les finances confisquées de cet institut dans un but de magyarisation. Dans cette ambiance vivait et commençait à écrire Martin Kukucin. Il était originaire d’une famille et d’une région nationalement conscientes et réagissait très sensiblement aux humiliations nationales et sociales dont il était témoin ou objet. Dans ses nouvelles, il peint le village slovaque et ses figures caractéristiques, le simple homme slovaque, dans sa rude réalité, le plus souvent des êtres les plus déshérités. Le peuple slovaque, dont il connaissait bien la force, la résistance et les faiblesses et à l’avenir duquel il croyait profondément; il le peignait sans un pathos sentimental ou lyrisme pseudoromantique, sans didactisme et sans vouloir moraliser, comme le faisaient ses prédécesseurs, mais avec amour et compréhension. Dans ses nouvelles, il a atteint une perfection rare qui rappelle certains traits caractéristiques d’un Charles Dickens. Il sut admirablement transplanter dans ses œuvres le style de langage populaire slovaque ainsi que l’humour populaire, même si c’est souvent un sourire à travers les larmes, « il riait pour que son cœur ne pleure pas » (Krcméry), il couvrait par l’humour « la terrible réalité de la vie dans laquelle se trouvait l’homme slovaque, en tant qu’être individuel et en tant que collectivité » (Meciar). Ses nouvelles appartiennent aux plus belles réalisations de la littérature slovaque de la fin du XIXe siècle. Pour pouvoir échapper à l’ambiance étouffante de son pays natal, Kukucin espérait trouver des moyens d’existence en Bohême. A cette époque plusieurs jeunes intellectuels slovaques cherchent un refuge spirituel à l’étranger. Dušan Makovický devient le médecin de chevet de l’écrivain russe Lev Nikolaïe- vitch Tolstoï, Aurel Stodola, professeur à l’Université de Zürich, d’autres (journalistes, prêtres) émi105 [pageend107]grent aux Etats-Unis d’Amérique. Ce fut une des raisons pour lesquelles Kukucin fit ses études de médecine à l’Université de Prague. De même, il s’illusionnait quant à pouvoir vivre là de son activité littéraire. « Mais je me suis trompé », écrivit-il plus tard, « déjà après mes premiers pas, je me suis rendu compte que je ne pourrais pas faire une carrière à Prague ». A ses sept ans de séjour à Prague, se rapportent quelques petites nouvelles du milieu de cette bourgeoisie. 11 a travaillé ces sujets seulement après son départ de Prague, « comme des souvenirs et non comme un essai de pénétrer dans cette ambiance et de l’utiliser artistiquement d’une manière permanente » (2). Mais elie n’atteignirent même de loin la force et la profondeur de celles dont les sujets sont empruntés à la vie des villages de son pays natal. Même durant son séjour à Prague, le village slovaque est resté l’objet de son amour et la source de son inspiration littéraire. D’une manière différente devait se manifester son intérêt artistique durant son séjour de douze ans sur File de Brac, en Dalmatie, où il devint en 1894 médecin de commune, dans la petite ville de Selce. Kukucin avec son caractère cordial et gai, acquit rapidement une grande popularité dans cette région. Lorsqu’il se maria, avec la fille de son protecteur et ami Didolic, en 1904, le jour de son mariage « fut une vraie fête nationale ». A Selce vinrent des paysans, des pêcheurs, des marins et des bergers de tous les villages et hameaux de son district pour assister au mirage de leur « sor dottor » (3). Comme médecin il eut la possibilité de connaître une grande quantité de personnes, il visitait des (2) Noge : Martin Kukucin, tradicionalista a novátor, Bratislava 1962, p, 202. <3) Noge : ibidem, p. 286. 106 [pageend108]familles, connut leur vie, leur manière de penser et leurs problèmes. Il écrivit plusieurs nouvelles, feuilletons et récits de voyages, ainsi que l’un des meilleurs romans slovaques d’avant la première guerre mondiale : « La maison sur la côte » (1904). Dan$ ses nouvelles ainsi que dans son roman, il a admirablement raconté la vie des paysans dal- mates, de la bourgeoisie et des propriétaires terriens, leurs relations sociales, leur manière de penser et d’agir. Son roman est une magnifique fresque de ce petit monde au bord de la mer Adriatique, peint d’une manière pénétrante et plastique, avec une fidélité et un réalisme étonnants. La ressemblance des langues slovaque et croate permettent à Kukucin d’insérer souvent dans son texte des mots typiques de la langue croate et des dialectes locaux de la Dal- matie, compréhensibles au lecteur slovaque, ce qui donne à son récit une couleur originale sans choquer le lecteur par un exotisme artificiel (4). Mais la situation sociale sur cette paisible île de Brac devint au commencement de ce siècle également très difficile. Des centaines de familles sont obligées d’émigrer en Amérique du Sud. A Punta Arenas, sur les détroits de Magellan, au sud du Chili, les originaires de l’île de Brac forment déjà en 1911 la majorité relative de la population. En 1907, après la défaite aux élections communales de la famille Didolic dont Kukucin avait épousé la fille et la cause, il n’a plus d’espoir de conserver sa place de médecin de commune. Il n’a d’autre choix que de suivre le courant de l’émigration de sa clientèle. A la fin de 1908, après un séjour d’une année à Santiago de Chili où il a homologué ses diplômes de médecine, il (4) Habovstiaková : Chorvátske jazykové prvky v Kukučínovej dalmatínskej tvorbe, Jazykové štúdie, V., Bratislava, pp. 199- 222. 107 [pageend109]débarqua sur cette lointaine presqu’île, Punta Arenas, « la ville la plus sud du monde », en réalité au « bout du monde ». En comparaison avec la Dalmatie ensoleillée, la différence est désespérante. Cette ancienne colonie pénitentiaire ne compte que quelque 5.000 habitants, de 947 maisons seulement 169 sont des constructions en brique, le reste est en tôle ou en bois. Le climat est rude, froid, des pluies et des brouillards interminables, des vents glacials. La grande majorité de ses habitants vivaient « sans avenir et sans joie », ils étaient comme « entre ciel et terre, dans l’incertitude face à leur avenir et dans la tristesse en ce qui concerne leur passé » (Meciar). Outre des Croates, on trouve là des Chiliens, Argentins, Allemands, Français, Anglais, Espagnols, des émigrés, des aventuriers, d’anciens détenus. Dans cette ambiance Kukucin a vécu durant quatorze longues années. Là il a écrit « un des plus grands romans slovaques» (5), en cinq volumes: « Mat volá » (La mère appelle). Il y décrit la vie tragique des émigrés croates, un saisissant tableau de la vie de la colonie dalmate à Punta Arenas. Les personnages et les événements ne sont que le cadre qui sert à formuler la critique de la société contemporaine, de son égoïsme et de sa rapacité, à présenter ses vues sur le sens et la fonction de l’argent, du travail, de la richesse, de la liberté, de la fraternité entre les hommes et les nations, sa foi en l’avenir de l’homme, son optimisme sur la victoire de la pensée sur le chaos, de l’Amour sur l’égoïsme. L’œuvre culmine par le retour des principales figures du roman en Dalmatie et ainsi il prend une tendance « d’antiémigration ». Durant son séjour en Amérique du (5) (Pisût, red.) : Dejiny slovenskej literatúry, Bratislava 1962, p. 381. 108 [pageend110]Sud il a écrit aussi un récit de voyage : « Les promenades en Patagonie », en trois volumes, de plus de 900 pages, dans lesquel il décrit ses souvenirs de voyages et sa vie en Patagonie où il était propriétaire d’une ferme. En tant que médecin, il était connu pour son attitude désintéressée et humanitaire. Il soignait les pauvres gratuitement, il leur payait souvent des médicaments. Il était non seulement leur médecin, mais également leur ami et conseiller. Sur la plaque commémorative à Punta Arenas, érigée par la Croix Rouge Chilienne et dédiée à son membre honoraire, Martin Kukucin, on peut lire les mots suivants : « En 'reconnaissance profonde pour son œuvre toute d’amour pour le prochain. » Durant la première guerre mondiale, il prit une part active au mouvement pour la libération de la Croatie, en tant que président de l’association des Dalmates à Punta Arenas. En 1922, il visita son pays natal, la Slovaquie. Il y fut l’hôte du président Masaryk; on lui offre plusieurs fonctions importantes (sénateur, directeur du service médical en Slovaquie, etc.), mais, il les refusa. A cette époque, les relations entre les Slovaques et les Tchèques sont déjà en pleine crise. Il refuse parce que « l’état de choses entre les Tchèques et les Slovaques ne lui plaisait pas, il a voulu rester indépendant, sans obligations envers quiconque » (6). Les dernières années de sa vie, vécues en grande partie en Croatie (Zadar, Split, Zagreb, Crkvenica, Lipik), il les a consacrées à l’étude du passé slovaque et aux problèmes de l’évolution de la spiritualité et de l’individualité slovaques. Deux romans de cette époque sont consacrés à ces problèmes Lukáš (6) Peter Didolic : Kukucin zblízka, dans le livre «Kukucin v kritike », p. 686, cit. Meciar : Kukucin živy, II, p. 36. 109 [pageend111]Blabosej Krason (1929) et Bohumil Valizlost Zábor (1930). Ces deux romans, publiés après sa mort, représentent son testament spirituel à son peuple, ses vues sur les caractéristiques de son individualité et de sa mission dans le concert des nations. Elles sont en même temps une pénétrante analyse des différences entre la mentalité slovaque et celle des Tchèques, entre les différentes tendances qui les séparent. De ce point de vue, Kukucin est fidèle à la tradition de l’évolution individuelle de la littérature slovaque, marquée si profondément par les œuvres de Holly, Štúr, Sládkovic, Vajansky, Hviezdoslav, Rázus, Hronsky, Žarnov, Beniak, Lukác, etc. L’œuvre de Kukucin, avec son niveau artistique, avec ses tendances démocratiques, pénétrée par un christianisme vivant, actif et tolérant, a largement contribué à hisser la littérature slovaque au niveau des autres littératures des petits peuples de l’Europe centro-orientale. Arved GREBERT. 110 [pageend112]ARGUMENT HISTORY AND THE WRITER’S IMAGINATION Thanks to the help of our editor, Mr. K. A. Jelenski we have at last succeeded in having the tape recordings of our Stockholm meeting in June 1961 transcribed and we continue publishing the various contributions : PAUL TABORI : I think there are certain general principles that can apply both to historical and to any other kind of writing whether it is poetry or drama. One of these general rules is that basically all literature is a kind of short-hand. The writer has to make a part stand for the whole. Nothing could be more tedious, for instance, that to reproduce verbatim every conversation in a novel. Some French novelists have tried to do that recently and, to me at least, the result is unmitigated boredom. Equally, in character drawing, whether in historical or non-historical works, this rale applies. For myself, I have developed the iceberg theory. A1- you know, of the average iceberg only one-tenth shows above the water and the other nine-tenths are invisible. When I try to shape characters — even historical characters — in my novels, I try to find out everything possible about them — as, indeed, Mr. Prawdin has suggested that the historical novelist must do. But of this material only a very small portion, less than ten 111 [pageend113]per cent appears in print, emerges above the surface. I think this holds good for all character drawing in literature. You must know about your characters where they went to school, what was their first love affair, what they think about God, how they react to a bolt of lightning and so on — you have to know all this before you can select the important facts, the circumstances that matter. In other words, in some way or other you must create your iceberg, collect and freeze the facts into a huge mass out of which only a small part will be visible. But how can you change the facts of history ? how can you adapt them to your own purpose ? That is a different question. We have heard how one of the speakers presented the danger of the falsification of history, the distortion of facts. Something strange happens to the writers who are guilty of such a creative crime. Recently I had to make a study of a subject that may appear to you to lie very far from ours — the problem of left-handedness. Now, as you may know, the human brain consists of two hemispheres. The speech centres and action centres and the various other sensory centres of the right side of our body, including those of the right hand, are in the left hemisphere of the brain. About 25 % of all babies are born lefthanded — but ours is a righthanded world and the social and physical pressures turn all but 5 % of the babies into right-handed beings before they reach school age. Still, there remains the stubborn five per cent who are genuinely left-handed. If you try to turn them into right-handed ones by force very peculiar things happen. They start to stutter and squint and if you go on forcing them to become right-handed, very serious psychological and mental disorders can be the result. Now, I feel that this can happen (and indeed happens all the time) to writers who are forced by the [pageend114]totalitarian state to change their true left-handedness into right-handedness — or, if you like, are forced to write not as they want to write, as their minds, their hearts, their souls tell them to write, but as the literary commissars, the Surkovs and others do. That is why you find so much stammering and squinting in Communist or Fascist literature. And I think in the conjunction of history and the writer’s imagination, it is the task of the true writer — whether he writes for a wide public or only for his desk drawer — to resist this pressure that would turn a genuine writer into a mental cripple. For all writers who submit to pressures which outrage their true nature become cripples. And I think that here the problem of the writer being true to himself and the problem of where the historian begins and the imagination of a writer ends become merged. Whether it is a historical novel or a learned book by a historian or a general literary work, it is only the writers who preserve their ’left-handedness’, their true nature in the face of all political pressure who can produce anything of enduring value. GEORGE FALUDY : I am writing a historical novel — but Í really want to tell you how I came to write it rather than about the novel itself. The subject is Constantine the Great, the period 315 to 336 A. D. Here I want to speak about the genesis of the book rather than its contents. In 1946 I returned from the United States to Hungary. I went back with the intention of writing about what was going on in Hungary and in all those other countries that were faced at that time with the dilemma whether to become democracies or totalitarian states. I returned to see what was happening — because I believed that one of the most important problems of the twentieth century was what would happen in Eastern Europe. 113 [pageend115]I wanted to discover whether Europe would be divided into two parts — one to sink to the level of Byzantine atheist states — I mean Communist atheist states, countries in which the state religion, Communism, is preached by priests who do not believe in it — and the other in which democracy would survive. I considered this such a tremendously important test that I had to witness it and write about it. Even if I found that I liked America much better than my own country after all those years during which I had been away, Í could not help wanting to write about this central problem. Therefore I had to go home to face it and write about it, no matter what the outcome was. Stendhal said that humanity could always be best observed in times of bitter suffering... Now, I returned home and after a few years when I had collected my material, I realised that it W’as completely impossible to write about my chosen subject. I couldn’t put anything on paper because my house could be searched any day. If I had written as I wanted to, I would have been put into prison — which happened anyhow but not because they found any manuscripts of mine. I had to consider what to do. With poems it was easier. If I wanted to write one, I could go to the National Library, take out one of the huge volumes of bound newspapers and by underlining one letter each on subsequent pages, I could put my poem on paper — with the hope that someone would decipher it in ten, twenty or fifty years’ time. But obviously this was impossible if I wanted to write a novel. Finally ï decided to write my novel — but write it as a historical novel, by finding a background that was similar to that of Communist Hungary. That was the reason why, when I wrote about the Communist takeover in Hungary (which happened in the years 1947- 1949), I chose fourth-century Alexandria for my setting. 114 [pageend116]At first I didn’t really know how close the similarity was — but as I read my historians, I discovered that when the power in the Roman Empire passed from Rome to Byzantium, State and Church became identical» This had never happened in Roman times nor anywhere else. It meant that the power of the state decided what ideology or theology or, if you like, philosophy was acceptable and could be practised. Suddenly it became clear to me that you can present a theme of the twentieth century while writing about the fourth century. 115 [pageend117]NOTES AND REVIEWS JANIS VESELIS (April 1, 1896— May 18. 1962) Janis Veselis passed away in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, while attending the annual convention of the American Latvian Association on behalf of the Latvian Press Association. He had been a resident of Kalamazoo, Michigan, since immigration in 1950. Prior to immigration he spent 6 years in refugee camps in Germany. The body of Janis Veselis was returned to Kalamazoo and interred in the Riverside Cemetery on May 23, 1962. «Though dead you shall not die — you are a branch Upon millennial arborescence.» * * Arturs Kaugars, «Parnacejs» (Native Returned), Dzerve sane; tr. by M. Kaugara. These words—with which the Latvian Student Society «Ausma» paid their last respects to Janis Veselis—express the sentiments of all who admire him. A peer of a number of our writers, especially those born in the 19th century, Janis Veselis was the son of a farm laborer. He was born in a region of Latvia rich in ancient traditions, a region which had preserved a rich, singular dialect of the Latvian language. Veselis matured to become one of the great Latvian writers of this century. No account of our literature, however brief, would be complete without his mention. As a person Janis Veselis was a multifarious intellectual; as an artist he was a master of his tool and medium—the Latvian language. To him it was a substance to be moulded into new shapes and forms. Janis Veselis experimented with most forms of literary expression. Poetry (3 vol ) and prose (novel; short story; «teiKsma», an artistic legend rooted in mythology ;—23 vol.) comprise the bulk of his work. Ke has also contributed a 116 [pageend118]history of Latvian literature; an autobiography; numbers of essays, literary critiques, reviews, articles, and translations (F. M. Dostoevski, J. Joyce, et al.). Janis Veselis lived to witness the publication (in 1961) of Terawda dvesele (The Soul of Steel), a trilogy of «teiksmu» novels which were written during the period 1934-1946. He is known to have considered this to be his major work. Blazmas staigataji (Twilight Strollers, ill. by Edgars Rutks, woodcuts), his last novel, was published posthumously in 1962. The work, embodying the romance of his native region, impresses with its artistic unity and belongs among his best—a worthy epilogue to a life of writing. Janis Veselis is practically unknown beyond the Latvian- reading public. The few attempts to translate his works into English have been comparatively mediocre. The «teiksmas», as well as other works, are saturated with concepts deeply rooted in our culture. The style is most difficult to penetrate and synthesize. At times it may approach the incommunicable. The ideal translator to present Janis Veselis to the English-speaking audience is yet to be discovered. Mara Bera. THE SIXTH BIENNALE OF POETRY IN KNOKKE Under the auspices of the UNESCO, the Royal Academy and the PEN of Belgium, and of several literary and public figures of international repute, the 6th Biennale of Poetry took place in Knokke-Le Zoute, in Belgium. Knokke is a large holiday resort of markedly «posh» character, a cross between a brand- new satellite town and a high society gambling place. Instead of stockbrokers’ Tudor, it is built in Bankers’ Contemporary, glittering with tubular frames, metallic Scandinavian chairs and barge-size American Chryslers. Everything seems to be the latest and mostest, and even the few antique shops, judging by their prices are on the lookout for American tourists—let alone the fact that the majority of their age-old ivory saddles, spinning wheels, gongs and statuary have the flavour of artificiality, spray-shop and phoney patina. 117 [pageend119]As in many English satellite towns and suburban dormitories, what is missing in Knokke is its soul—a cathedral, some time-honoured tottering dwelling places or a standing collection of Vermeers which you are amply catered for next door, in Brugge. To instil this essential element if only for a few days, and to endow Knokke with a soul, is a miracle that only a huge gathering of poets is capable of. For five days, the palatial Casino (and the baronial Réserve) of Knokke echoed masterpieces in French elocution, literary problems of international magnitude, quests and queries of poetry which, perhaps, till the next Biennale in two years’ time, will not be spoken of in Knokke, but only charily, and privately, at the fireside of Belgian poets, those who have one, that is. The climax came when, at the closing session, on the 11th of September, the Mexican poet Octavio Paz was awarded the 2,000 dollar prize of the Biennale, adding his name to such famous ones already on the list as the Italian Giuseppe Ungaretti, the Nobel Prize winning French poet Saint-John Perse, and the Spanish Jorge Guillén. On or around the rostrums, in the hall and corridors of the conference, it was nice to see so many familiar faces. Among the impressive crowd of poets we saw Mr. Pierre Emanuel, Mr. Jean Follain, Mr. Eugene Guillevic, Mr. Paul Chaulot, Mr. Noël Ruet and Mme Anne-Marie de Backer of France. Mr. Ladislas Gara, who at least à titre d’honneur, is as good as a Frenchman, led an illustrious pleiade of eminent French poets ; collaborators who helped him to make his kingsize Anthologie de la poésie hongroise the success of the year in Paris; the white-haired head so characteristic of Mr. Maurice Carême, Mr. R. Quinot, the enterprising publisher Flouquet and the eminent Mr. Pierre Bourgeois of Belgium, Mr. W.K. Seymour of Great-Britain, Pino Della Silva of Italy, Van Vriesland of Holland, Mr. S. Weores, one of the greatest living poets not only of his native Hungary, but of the Continent, Mr. Tchicaya of Brazzaville and many others. The meetings started with the anticlimax of some spoil-sports, and professional cynics saying, «An ecumenical Council of Poets: why? what for? what can it achieve? Right at the outset growing out of proportion and, therefore, paralysed, does it not run the obvious risk of waxing into a Mutual Admiration Society?» Some mocking-birds went even further by gloating over the central theme of the Conference, pre set and ostentatious as it has been nicely printed, The Youth of Poetry, «Why the Youth, and why not the Antiquity, of Poetry? Could we not, in the same academic way, be drowned by no end of speeches, toplofty thoughts and elevated gobbledigook, by exchanging niceties and reappraising compliments on the Anti118 [pageend120]quity of Poetry, the same way we did on the Eternal Youth of it?» Happily enough, this chain-reaction of academism which is an ever-emerging threat on similar occasions, was skilfully nipped in the bud by Mr. A. Haulot, the eminent Secretary General and one of the founder-members of the Biennale ; and after the first warming-up addresses and greetings of the marathon opening session, the conference got down to «brass tacks» if there are any left for poets. After having split into four working groups yet still each one on the scale of the General Assembly of an «emerging nation», the Biennale recaptured its right spirit, recovered its meaning. The first, «Music and poetry» got down to a wide range of problems well- known to poets who ever had to do anything with music and musicians in a professional way. The second, «Modem Techniques of Expression», though startling and often breath taking, left the majority with the satisfaction that, as long as human beings go on using words instead of fancy super- stereoplasmic tentaculae for conveying sentiments and feelings, the Verb is going to stay with us as the medium of poetry, a primal medium too which does not really need the support of gimmicks, intriguing as they be. The third, «Poetry and translations», was a working session in the real sense of the word, dealing with the esoterics of the craft, problems the poet- adaptator has to solve by the score when doing his job, such as : limitations and possibilities of faithfulness to the original as to rhyming and cadence, prosody and lilt, the rendering of puns, the salvaging of couleur locale, etc. ; although the final communiqué did not reflect either the heated arguments that were going on nor the ultimate fruitfulness of the debate. Whereas the fourth working session about «Poetry and Publishing», under the chairmanship of Mr. P.L. Flouquet, a selfless and devoted publisher of poetry himself, was an entirely different affair, touching some un-poetical yet no less eschatological, aspects, of poetry: the pockets of both poet and publisher, the survival of both in a materialistic age when the sale ratings of washing machines, television sets, cars and gadgetry are steadily increasing while the interest in, and even the snob-value of, poetry is alarmingly on the decline. Indeed, during the session and after, in the evening, at the bar counter, small groups went on searching the reasons of this world-wide malaise, proposing remedies, some serious, some quixotic ones like inventing a cortical hearing-aid geared to poetry. Before long, after having «de- masked» poetry as the «second profession» (which, in plain English, means «hobby»), poets were wildly emulating one another by «demasking» themselves as so many lawyers, tea- 119 [pageend121]chers, farmers, beggars and millionaires; there were even two distinguished Paris poets, one—a travelling salesman, and the other, an Inspector of the Police. (The latter, needless to say, was the softest, sweetest charmeur I ever met.) Thus, being, in one way or other, all champions in swimming against the tide in the very middle of an affluent society, we enjoyed all the more the royal treatment we got from the organizers of the Biennale, the excellent programmes, the princely meals we had, and, last but not least, this big coming together with our own kin—restoring our confidence that the cause of poetry is, after all, not a lost one as it never can be, and agreeing upon the common article of faith that it is a cause which is the sweetest to fight for till the bitter end. Victor Hatar. Dear Friends, I was asked, when in Knokke, to write an article about the Sixth Biennale. This I had to refuse, knowing well that a poet is usually a bad reporter, even when he fancies himself to be a good one. And now I will let you into a secret; during those five days of interesting speeches and galvanising discussions, I had to do a little job of my own, namely, to write twenty-four little trifles for the Polish Calendar, the idea being that each month in the Calendar will be adorned with two of my efforts. Thanks to Knokke and its inspiring climate, I managed to finish the job, and hand it to the Editor in good time. This represents my net profit from the Biennale and I now wish to share some of it with my friends in «Arena». The twenty-four little poems are all topical, as any short poem always should be. Unfortunately, some of them depend so much on the language and its peculiarities, that they cannot be translated without committing murder. Others are purely parochial and will be of no interest to people outside the «Polish Church». Some are simply very bad poems, when the quantity (ordered) took the upper hand over the quality (intended but not executedX Those faulty goods are, of course, not for export. After lengthy deliberations I made a choice of six, translated them into English to my best ability, and here they are presented to «Arena» in lieu of the article about six hundred 120 [pageend122]poets. I trust that this reduction from six hundred poets to six poems is sound economy, and I hope that you will enjoy my fruits from Knokke, as much as I enjoyed Knokke itself, which I did.

Jan Rostworowski. 122 [pageend124]UBER DAS EXILSCHAFFEN JOSEF CIGER HRONSKYS Nach Martin Kukucin (1860-1928) ist Josef Ciger Hronsky (23.11.1896 3.VII.1960) der zweite bedeutende slowakische Prosaiker, der ausserhalb der Grenzen seiner Heimat starb. Nach langjährigem Exilaufenthalt in Südamerika während des ersten Weltkrieges hatte Kukucin wenigstens das Glück, in die befreite Heimat zurückzukehren. Manches wirkte hier aber anders auf ihn, als er es sich vorgestellt hatte, und deshalb ging er nach Jugoslawien, da Kroatien schon vor dem Jahr 1914 zu seiner zweiten Heimat geworden war. Hier in der Heimat seiner Ehefrau lebte er sein fruchtbares Leben des Arztes und Schriftstellers. Hronsky dagegen musste sein Leben im Kreise seiner Familie (der Ehefrau, des Sohnes und der Schwiegertochter) im fernen und fremden Argentinien beenden. Dies war ein umso härteres und tragischeres Schicksal, als Hronsky ein Mann einer erstaunlichen schöpferischen Kraft war und immer wieder neue Pläne schmiedete, die ihn in Gedanken in die Slowakei zurückführten. Josef Ciger stammte aus Zvolen (Altsohl), einer kleinen aber geschichtlich bedeutenden Stadt der Mittelslowakei. Nach Beendigung seiner Studien wurde er Lehrer. In dieser Hinsicht ähnelt er sehr dem tschechischen Dichter Otakar Brezina, der auch als Lehrer zu einer der bedeutendsten Erscheinungen der tschechischen Dichtkunst wurde. Schon als junger Lehrer machte Hronsky auf sein schriftstellerisches Talent aufmerksam. Er tat sich allerdings nicht nur durch seine schriftstellerische Begabung hervor, sondern auch durch seinen Sinn für organisatorische Arbeit und seine ausserordentliche Liebe zum Theater. Er stammte aus dem Tal des romantischen Hron (Gran), der am Fuss des mit Sagen und Liedern umwobenen Berges Kralova Hola entspringt, und deshalb wählte er sich nach dem Fluss Gran (Hron) den Beinamen Hronsky. Im Jahre 1920 erschien sein erstes Werk, ein Buch der kleinen Prosa. In den Jahren 1920 bis 1927 veröffentlichte er fünf Bücher, die Erzählungen beinhalten, und das Drama «Firma Moor». Vom Jahr 1928 an begann er Romane zu veröffentlichen (Das gelbe Haus in Klokoč, Die Prophezeiung des Dr. Stankovsky, Brot, Josef Mak, Schreiber Grac, Auf dem Hof des Bukva), die seinen schriftstellerischen Ruf begründeten. Fruchtbar war ebenfalls sein literarisches Wirken für die Jugend. Er schrieb für Kinder und Jugendliche mehr als ein Dutzend Bücher, die sehr beliebt waren und auch in andere Sprachen übersetzt wurden. 123 [pageend125]Vom Jahr 1928 an war er in der Slowakischen Matica, der bedeutendsten slowakischen kulturellen Organisation, die im Jahre 1863 gegründet wurde, zuerst als Generalsekretär Und dann als Leiter tätig. Diese Organisation führte Hronsky bis zum Jahr 1945 zu ihrer grössten organisatorischen und kulturellen Entfaltung. Hronsky hatte mit Kukucin nicht nur ein ähnliches Schicksal gemeinsam, sondern es verband sie auch die gleiche Liebe zum slowakischen Dorf, aus dem beide Anregungen für ihr literarisches Schaffen schöpften. Während Kukucin die charakteristischen Typen des slowakischen Dorflebens wirklichkeitsnah beschrieb, analysierte Hronsky schon mehr oder weniger das Dorfleben und deckte seine modernen gesellschaftlichen und sozialen Probleme auf. Ausserdem ist bei Hronsky der Themenkreis bereits weiter, bereichert durch den Aufschwung der Zivilisation und die politischen Veränderungen, die sich nach dem ersten Weltkrieg ergaben. Während Kukucin mit Svätozar Hur- ban Vajansky (1847-1916) in der Zeit von 1370 bis 1925 die slowakische Prosa vertrat, führte sie Hronsky mit Milo Urban (1904) in der Zeit zwischen den beiden Weltkriegen und kurz nach dem zweiten Weltkrieg zum künstlerischen Höhepunkt. Der Höhepunkt im Schaffen J.C. Hronsky ist der Roman Josef Mak (1933), der in mehrere Sprachen übersetzt wurde. Die Handlung dieses Romans spielt sich ebenfalls im charakteristischen slowakischen Dorf während der Weltwirtschaftskrise ab. Hronsky schuf hier neue Typen. Seine Romanperspektive ist hier eher psychologisch als beschreibend; neu ist hier auch sein Stil. Der ganze Roman ist voll von interessanten Dialogen, die die Handlung mit siedenden Höhepunkten erfüllen. Er erfasst hier auch sehr bildhaft menschliche Leidenschaften und die dem Menschen angeborene Eigenschaft, in der sich urmenschliche und mystische Elemente verbinden. Die kommunistische Kritik wirft Hronsky vor, er habe in diesem Roman konterrevolutionäre Gedanken verkündet. Hronsky zeigte hier nämlich die für das slowakische Dorf typischen Eigenschaften: Demut, Bescheidenheit und Geduld. Das slowakische Dorf war nämlich nicht revolutionär eingestellt und wollte seine Probleme auf dem Wege einer vernünftigen Entwicklung lösen. Hronsky verliess die Slowakei im Jahr 1945 vor der Ankunft der sowjetischen Armeen. Nachdem er sich in Oesterreich, Deutschland und Italien aufgehalten hatte, wanderte er im Jahr 1948 nach Argentinien aus. Schon während seines Aufent> haltes in Italien schrieb er den Roman Andreas Búr Majster (1947), in dem er in die Romanhandlung die alte Sage des Schlosses von Bojnice einflocht. In Argentinien schrieb er das Buch « Zwei slowakische Amerikas » (Dve slovenské Ameriky - 124 [pageend126]1 1958), in dem er das kulturelle Leben der slowakischen Auswanderer in den Vereinigten Staaten und Argentinien würdigte. In Argentinien schrieb er auch das Buch « Die Welt auf dem Torf grand » (1959). Es ist ein überwältigendes Bild vom Aufstand in der Slowakei im Jahre 1944, als sich die kommunistischen Partisanen oft bestialische Verbrechen zuschulden kommen Hessen und als auch Massengräber Zeichen der stallnisti- schen Befreiung wurden. Ausserdem schrieb Hronsky im Exil auch andere Prosa, die bisher nur in Handschriften vorliegt. In den grossen Romanen « Andreas Búr Majster » und « Die Welt auf dem Torfgrund » erreichte Hronsky nicht mehr die literar rische Höhe seiner Arbeiten in der Heimat. Durch die lebendige Handlung und ihren Stil ragen auch seine zahlreichen kleinen Prosawerke hervor, die er im Exil schuf; in diesen beschrieb er schon manches Erlebnis aus seiner argentinischen Umwelt. Gerade diese Exilprosa zeigt Hronsky als einen Meister der künstlerischen Sprache, einen Meister der Dialoge und einen geistreichen Zeichner von Stimmungsbildern. Im Exil in Rom und dann vor allem in Argentinien zeichnete sich Hronsky auch durch sein anderes Talent aus; als Maler. Die Malerei war schon in der Heimat neben dem Theater seine zweite Liebe, aber künstlerisch widmete er sich ihr erst im Exil. In Argentinien schuf er mehrere Aquarelle, Oelbilder und Zeichnungen. In Lujan inspirierte ihn vor allem die mystischreligiöse Welt und in Bariloch die unglaublich schöne Natur. Während seines Aufenthaltes in Argentinien stellte er einige- male aus (in Buenos Aires, Lujan und anderen Städten). Der Erfolg wird schon durch die Tatsache bestätigt, dass er gut die Hälfte seiner Bilder auf den Ausstellungen verkaufte. Das bedeutendste Werk des Malers Hronsky ist der Zyklus « Das wunderbare Leben der heiligen Jungfrau von Lujan ». Es sind dies grosse Bilder, auf denen er seine Ursprünglichkeit, Frische, Farbigkeit und Dynamik zeigte. Diesen Zyklus bestellte ursprünglich der Präsident von Chile, aber nun soll dieses Werk in das Kloster der slowakischen Benediktiner in Cleveland kommen. Das Leben Josef Ciger Hronskys war im Exil ziemlich bitter. Er vertrug das argentinische Klima sehr schwer; aber am meisten zermürbte ihn die Arbeit in der Fabrik, in der er als Zeichner arbeitete. Hronsky war auch in den slowakischen kulturellen Vereinigungen in Argentinien sehr aktiv und war für zahlreiche slowakische Zeitschriften im Ausland tätig. Mit seinem Tod hat die slowakische Literatur einen ihrer fruchtbarsten und grössten Meister verloren. Dr. Imrich Kruzliak. 125 [pageend127]KAFKA’S JOURNEY THROUGH THE LABYRINTH OF THE WORLD I think relatively little has ever been said of Franz Kafka’s predecessors. If I remember rightly, I have so far come across only a mention of the affinity of his style with the realism of Flaubert and the debt his philosophical views owe to Kierkegaard’s existentialism and Freud’s psychoanalysis. A closer study of Kafka’s precursors must very soon lead to a deeper critical assessment of him, and then, if I am not mistaken, among many others one might also touch on Komenský as author of « The Labyrinth of the World ». I am quite aware that comparison of Komenský with Kafka might strike devotees of Komenský as a completely inappropriate belittling of his significance and on the other hand shock admirers of Kafka who lay so much stress on his literary pioneering and modernism. So I shall draw no comparisons. In any case it is impossible to compare without a common denominator, one cannot weigh without weights. For the moment I have no weights, so I shall only attempt to indicate where they might be found. First of all the purely superficial parallels. Although Komenský had not yet left his country, he already had to hide in it, for instance with Karel the Elder of Zerotin. Kafka, according to Pavel Eisner’s article « Franz Kafka and Prague », wanders in a Prague in which he is both a native and a foreigner. In the « Labyrinth » Komenský saw the whole world as a city, « of goodly and splendid appearance and exceeding broad », but which heaved and whirled sickeningly, and from which there was no escape because of the bottomless abyss around its ramparts. Kafka judges the whole world from the point of view of the artificial island of the Prague German ghetto, from which he can never free himself, however much he would like to. Komenský has at the western end of the city Ars Fortunae, which can only be reached through a series of wicket-gates labelled « Hypocrisy », « Flattery », « Force », « Deception », etc., and then only after being selected by Chance, the blind and deaf official of Lady Fortune. Kafka’s work is dominated by his Castle, whose innumerable officials are unapproachable for the unselected foreigner. The latter, if he is not helped by some woman, is refused admission without actually being rebuffed, and merely continues to wander around aimlessly — as an exile desirous of an immigrant’s visa loiters around the American consulate. 126 [pageend128]Komensky’s world is ruled by Queen Vanity, while in « The Trial » it is explicitly stated that « die Lüge wird zur Weltordnung gemacht ». Komensky’s arena is full of people. Some of them « gathered garbage and divided it among themselves; some dragged beams and boulders hither and thither, or pulled them up with winches and let them down again; some dug earth and carried it to and fro; the rest of the people diverted themselves with bells, mirrors, bladders, rattles and other toys; some even played with their own shadows, measuring, chasing and catching them ». Is not this the best possible description of the « incessant scurry » of the persecuted, rejected and self-centred people of Kafka’s world ? In the « Labyrinth of the World » Pate, the « furious old man », distributes cards to all new arrivals with orders to each what he is to do in the world; Kafka’s characters indeed carry these cards too, as can be seen from the flagellant’s anwer in « The Trial » : « Ich bin zum Prügeln angestellt, also prügle ich ». Komenský sees in what various ways people are disfigured : « There were many pimpled, scabbed and leprous, one had a pig’s snout, another a dog’s teeth, another an ox’s horns, another an ass’s ears, another basilisk’s eyes, another a fox’s tail, another a wolf’s claws ; I saw some with a peacock’s neck stretched high, others with an erect cock’s comb, some with hooves like a horse and so on, but most of them resembled monkeys ». Similarly Kafka’s work swarms with repellent insects, moles, mice and other animals, and even the hero of « The Trial » dies « wie ein Hund ». But it is far more difficult to find less superficial analogies. Komensky’s exile consists not only in leaving his beloved country, just as Kafka’s exile is not merely the German Jew’s sense of not belonging in Czech Prague. Max Brod says in his Epilogue to « The Castle », basing himself on a quotation from Flaubert, that both are exiles from the whole world in which neither of them feels « dans le vrai ». Neither of them is able to strike roots in this world. Gustav Janouch in his book « Conversations with Kafka » quotes Kafka as saying with regard to America that « wealth means dependence on the things we own, which must be protected by the acquisition of more property, which means fresh dependence » (how close we approach here to Gabriel Marcel !), and with regard to the Soviet revolution that « it will soon evaporate leaving behind only the sediment of a new bureaucracy » and that « the chains of tortured humanity are forged of red links ». We will realise that Kafka, in examining today’s labyrinth of the world, would deserve to have the interpreter turn angrily on him too : « And will anything please you in this world ? Feeble-brained man, you find blame in even the noblest things !» It is possible that his guide Vsudybud might 127 [pageend129]also sigh : « It seems that his mind smells of religion ! », which runs in interesting parallel with some of Kafka’s critics. Like Komenský, Kafka received from Fate at his entry into the world a label with the inscription, « Speculare » ; this means primarily that neither of them found a home in it. The speculations of both of them are pessimistic, even frightful. They both see our environment as covered with dust and dirt, if not rotten through and through. Somebody might protest that the pessimism of Franz Kafka is even more nightmarish than that of the « Labyrinth of the World ». But even in the latter the abysses are terrible. I find one of the deepest and blackest in this passage from the «Labyrinth», which has been I think little examined : when the pilgrim investigates the order of sages, he observes that by command of Queen Vanity the wisest of them were chosen to remove quarrels and strife from the world. However, not only did they not put anything right, they even started « great disorders » among themselves — so they soon scattered, and, as Komenský says, « the learned men returned to their arguments ». Komenský sees these quarreling wise men as including not only Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, the Pope and the Jesuits, but also the Calvinists, Luther, and — Hus. Just as Kafka was not at home among the Prague Jewish intelligentsia, Komenský was not quite at home in his Unity, which was not the Church he depicted in « The Paradise of the Heart ». In the « Labyrinth » Queen Vanity, passing judgment, is also called Wisdom, and the ins and outs of her complex hierarchy are at first left in a kind of darkness, in which finally not even Solomon, the wisest of men, can find his way, falling once more into the power of her « female regiment ». Even with Kafka we do not know what we are up against in his « Castle » : whether it is some kind of strange heavenly hierarchy or the old Austrian bureaucracy, the keys to which are held by all kinds of women with their « Beziehungen zum Schloss ». Both authors describe this with combined humour and horror. And over them both hangs that sword of Damocles, the terrible reckoning. If Komenský describes Death walking among the unheeding people in his world arena, Kafka says of the people involved in the trial that « ihre Sicherheit ist nur durch ihre Dummheit möglich ». The vision of the final reckoning always hovers over the heads of Komenský and Kafka : for the former it is the last judgment of the Christian, for the latter it is a permanent and eternal judgment, before which man finds himself without knowing how or why. At Komensky’s last judgment all man’s actions, even his inmost thoughts, shall stand revealed. « Es geht kein Akt verloren, es gibt bei Gericht kein Vergessen », 128 [pageend130]Kafka complains in « The Trial », while Komenský falls penitently on his knees before the inscrutable justice of God. Kafka similarly accepts in advance the verdict at the unfinished and never-ending trial in the conviction that « gegen dieses Gericht kann man sich ja nicht wahren, man muss das Geständnis machen ». This is of course the great difference between Komenský and Kafka. The last judgment is the grand finale of the world, and that is how Komenský was able to finish off his works. But Kafka has no last court of appeal, indeed the accused before his everlasting judgment can never approach it with his plea, and therefore his trials are logically unfinished and unfinishable. Because the last trump is still to come Komensky’s « Labyrinth » is, all in all, a work of hope; and hope is what Kafka, face to face with his permanent judgment, cannot have. Komenský the pilgrim can still push aside the spectacles of Deception and look beneath them to see how things are really shaping. Kafka can no longer do this. He is himself these spectacles, which, as is well known, are moulded of the glass of Supposition and framed in Custom. He is no longer an observer of evil, he is himself a part of it. The pilgrim of the « Labyrinth » can return to the private chamber of his heart, but the twentieth century pilgrim no longer has a heart and has nowhere to go. Komenský can still see the people under the animal masks. But Kafka sees many only as animals, perhaps as the revolting cockroach in the story « The Transformation ». Kafka’s God is far away, though he never denies his existence, as far away for instance as the Chinese emperor in the story of the Great Wall of China. Komenský can still see the whole city with its ramparts, while Kafka only suspects that somewhere in this Great Wall he is unable to circumvent there must be holes... Kafka’s God is remote, and that is because in the first place man himself is remote. Before Kafka could even start seeking God, he had to seek man. Komenský still had the whole man within him who was able to peer under the spectacles of Deception. That is why Komenský — like, for instance, Dürer before him — was fortunate enough to be able to see the evil in the world in allegorical form. For allegory is unthinkable without these spectacles which we can lift. Kafka could no longer use allegory, and he did not have to. Things are bad enough as they are. The horror of Kafka’s journeying through the Labyrinth of the World lies in his conservative realism, which has nothing hidden beneath it, and under which we must not look for anything. The furious old man Fate did not rule so strictly and implacably in Komensky’s time as do now those historical forces which have practically crushed the thinking individual. 129 [pageend131]In spite of all these differences there is a great similarity here between the « Labyrinth » and the work of Franz Kafka. I did not want to compare them, for I have already admitted that I have not found a common yardstick by which to measure both. But I think I have an idea of where it may be found : in the conscious faith of Komenský, and the unconscious faith of Kafka, in the fundamental importance of the primeval biblical fall of man, which gave rise to original sin. I think it is in this faith that Komenský and Kafka reach out to each other, across the gulf of several centuries which believed in the natural and original goodness of uncorrupted man, and which are branded with the name of Rousseau. Which is the greater myth, man’s original sin or his goodness ? Two twentieth century wars have shaken our faith in the goodness of man, and Kafka arrived with his work at a time when modern physics, built on the observer and conscious of the faults and shortcomings of his senses, clearly advocates beating one’s breast by looking for personal equations and reveals the deficiencies of the experimenting observer. Komenský, as is known, argued with Descartes about the close interdependence of science and religion, defending the point of view of Malebranche. Descartes won — but only until the twentieth century. Now once again the lord of science with its purely statistical laws is Chance, the official, whom the mathematician calls probability — which brings us once more to Komensky’s mercy of God and to the proximity of Kafka’s Father with his complex of psychoanalysis. And so it seems that admission of hereditary sinfulness and recognition of the irreparable errors of our senses and efforts was not only a feature of the long past Middle Ages, but will also be the standpoint of man in the emerging fourth atomic age. In any case you might read what T. E. Hulme said in his « Speculations », written in the days of Kafka’s creative period. In the end it appeared that sinful roan was nearer freedom than the man who was « naturally good ». According to Janouch’s book I mentioned earlier, Kafka once said that the Fall of Man was the best proof of man’s freedom. Which of course is a truth you will find in any Catechism for primary schools. As I am not familiar with much of the literature on Kafka, I do not know whether Kafka knew the « Labyrinth of the World », although it is more than likely that as an educated citizen of Prague he must have come across it. Petr Den. 130 [pageend132]BOOKS Count Paul Palffy de Erdöd : Abschied von Vorgestern und Gestern. — Schuler Verlag, Munich, 1961; 288 pages, illustrated. These memoirs of a « viveur » of Central Europe emerge like a pleasant little islet on which to take a refreshing breath in the flood of beastly earnest autobiographies by ponderous VIP-s who infest literary life in ever growing numbers. In spite of his long span of life, which bridges the worlds of Emperor Franz Joseph and the thermonuclear mushroom, Count Palffy does not want to teach us anything in particular; still, he is able to convey to us a message of gracious living, beautiful memories, and the way to wise resignation when nearing the end of everything. The Count, a descendant of the famous Hungarian palatine Nicholas Palffy, who went down in Central-European history as « the scourge of the Turks », and Maria Fugger (a daughter of the German merchant princes who played an important role in the dawn of capitalism), was well equipped with personal assets (exceedingly good-looking even in his seventies) and great wealth. He sailed merrily through six marriages, two world wars and umpteen political upheavals, and now lives seemingly unscathed in Bavaria with his sixth spouse and small son, about 35 years younger than his eldest who became an important businessman in America. His circle of friends included people like the Archduchess Elisabeth, the granddaughter of Emperor Franz Joseph and daughter of Crown Prince Rudolf, King Leopold of the Belgians, Michael Karolyi, the count who headed the Hungarian revolution of 1918, Bela Bartok, Ernest Dohnanyi, the Duke of Windsor, Churchill, the Maharajah of Kutch, Texan oil-magnates, famous writers (Louise de Vilmorin was one of his wives), actors and actresses, and finally nearly everybody who counted in European social and political life (Dr. Benes and Jan Masaryk included). He entertained numerous personal and paying guests on his Pud- merice estate in Czechoslovakia, in the fertile valley among the Eastern Carpathians which before 1918 belonged to Hungary, and has many heart-warming memories of people, game, and the beautiful countryside. He was a founder member of the CIC (not the famous American counter-intelligence corps but of the Conseil Internaci [pageend133]tional de la Chasse), and in this capacity he met Hermann Goering, the late but not very much mourned paunchy « Reichs- marschall » of Adolf Hitler, who received him in his Karinhall castle clad in olive green suede, light yellow boots, and with « the ornate dagger of the German hunters hanging from his tummy ». One of the most enjoyable chapters of the book is the one in which he describes Goering sitting in front of his miniature railway set up in the loft of the house, and playing with enormous gusto while rings with immense stones glittered on his fat fingers. Count Palffy had a soft spot for the Hungarian gipsies whom he knew very well, and he enjoyed their music so much that a whole orchestra accompanied him on his journeys all over the Continent. While he attended to his business the gipsies found employment in cafés and restaurants, and quite a few of them became famous. One of them, Lojzi Balogh, the excellent cymbalo player, settled in Paris where he is doing extremely well. Of his extensive estates the Count depicts Pudmerice, his seat, in the most glowing colours, and also Nagyfoedemes where he established a very modern farm during the war when that kind of capital investment did not look too promising. The estate was famous for breeding the beautiful Lippizaner horses and the equally well known Hungarian « mangalitsa » pigs. Count Palffy had to flee at the approach of the Russian army, and he was very wise to do so. He divined quite correctly that his good relations with the peasantry on his estates would be of no help to him with the rulers to come. He fled to Meran, to the house of a retired gamekeeper of his, where he spent the years until he married again. Now he is living—as he writes— « in a tidy little house surrounded by tall beech trees, and the merry laughter of my small son adorns the eve of my life ». Well done, and congratulations—who could really wish for or, for that matter, achieve more than that? We cannot agree, however, with the political conclusions of this otherwise delightful book. 1) It is not quite true that the present political chaos in Europe is caused by the thoroughly undeserved destruction of the late Austro-Hungarian monarchy. Some other, and surely more disastrous circumstances played their part as well. What about the semi-feudal state of affairs and the out-of-date economic system, for instance? Even members of the aristocracy in these countries must admit that not everything in the garden was lovely as far as the peasants and workers were concerned. 2) The destruction of the monarchy cannot be ascribed solely to the puritanical single-mindedness of Woodrow Wilson & Co. 132 [pageend134]Other forces were at work as well. Thomas Garrigue Masaryk and Dr. Benes, for instance, and other people who could not be kept at bay. 3) The Austro-Hungarian monarchy was very far from being an excellent example for a European Union. Such a thing could never be constructed on a feudal, ancient pattern. Nobody would know that better than a member of the late aristocracy. M.T. LINARDS TAUNS : Múzigais mákonis (The Perpetual Cloud). Poems in Latvian. — Published by Ziemelblázma, Sweden; 94 pages. Linards Tauns being essentially an urban poet, those of his poems which are centred on the town—or which make it a point of departure for other themes—constitute by far the major part of his most striking work. The image of the town is ever shifting. It can be the American town, but its outskirts also serve to evoke the poet’s childhood in Latvia and the small provincial towns there: with cobbled streets, with meadows or pumpkin-pickers on its periphery, with happily shouting and freely roaming children and freely scampering dogs, a town « like warm milk », sunny and peaceful. In the poem The Dream of a Town it obliquely implies also a town in Provence Where Vincent gathered suns, teashops, and wheat but its stones are ... older even than my remotest past lives. Pharaohs sleep in them, clasped by suns. It can be the town as such, a timeless town, any town of antiquity: In my breath The breathing of ancient statues... (A Street Never Seen Before) A street, seen by the poet for the first time, is Yet as dear to me, as familiar As if I’d been bom here, and lived here For centuries past. (A Street Never Seen Before). 133 [pageend135]A town he enters for the first time, welcomes him « like a woman waving her handkerchief, her lips waiting to be kissed»— But each and every house I passed Waved roofs and window-panes at me... « We meet again— Come, nestle on my breast! » (The Return). Remembrance is interchangeable. Man carries within him the seeds of remembrance from his former lives, and the stones of streets and buildings carry the memory of man’s past existences. The moment of recognition can spark off in either: man, or stone. Human life imparts life to stones, statues mingle their breath with that of humans, the cobbles of a street are alive with the touch of children’s bare feet (Walking in Streets), and the poet himself feels part of the perpetual transformation. After my death, its stones Will have burgeoned through me — Wheat fields. (A Street Never Seen Before) Everything is interwoven and inter-related— All things are One... But love the varying form by which flowers differ from eyes and clay is distinguished from lips. (All Souls’ Day) Linards Tauns loves « the varying form » with an all-embracing joyousness. He lays siege to the world with all his senses, and transmutes it into poetry. With all my senses I seise the world, I finger it, draw it into my lungs, I swallow it, drink it— In search of a song. (In Search of a Song). He is wide open and receptive to colour, light, sounds, scents —and even here there is reciprocity: « scents and sounds... fall round our necks and embrace us » (A Dog is Lying by the City Gates). The poet feels a particularly deep, interchangeable 134 [pageend136]relationship with flowers, vines, fruit gardens, fruit. The vividly conceived mutual experiencing of each other, the age-old reciprocal life-giving, the intermingling with each other, leads him to exclaim exultantly: 7 am southern gardens, I walk with fruit-pickers Into the towns, I pass in wine jars From mouth to mouth. (Suddenly in a Procession) The theme of joyful fusion with everything around him predominates in Linards Tauns’ poetry. Man and all things around him have been inter-related for centuries past, they all have knowledge of one another; there is no distinct border-line between them, they differ only through « the varying form ». The conception of time becomes arbitrary and artificial; the past and the future tend to be more immediate to Tauns than the present. Now and then, reading his poetry, one almost feels that he is sometimes impatient of his restricting human condition which prevents him from merging totally with the universal consciousness. Judging from his poems, Linards Tauns does not seem to be hemmed in by powerful personal ties, though he does speak of friends and, vaguely, of his « love ». He is not tied down by strong emotions that are kindled by close human relationships— there is a singular freedom from grief, passion or anger in his work. He has his own happy, assured, perpetual preoccupation: his own private vision of the world and of his place in it in relation to everything else. A highly sensitive and original poet, Linards Tauns is the poet of the streaming consciousness, of the streaming life in which. We come and go. No beginning, no end. Ruth Speirs. [pageend137]THE CASE OF NGHIEM-XUAN-THIEN About the time the readers of Arena began to enjoy the charming story, A Love Lost, in our thirteenth number, a letter charming story, A Love Lost in our thirteenth number, a letter reached our editorial office. It was written by the Viet Namese author’s daughter, Mue Nghiem-Trieu-Quynh who studies in Paris : «I think that you know about the events that occurred in South Viet Nam these weeks», she wrote. «Last Thursday, in a French newspaper, Le Figaro, I read a very bad news and a few days after, my mother and sister wrote to tell me what I already knew: my father has been arrested, on Monday, June 17th, at 9.30 p.m. as he was going to pay a visit to a friend. When he went past the ancient police station of the district, now a hospital (because the arrest happened quite near our home) some men from the inside rushed upon him and as he tried to shout for help, they strangled him, then pushed him into a car. Meanwhile, some policemen, on the opposite side, watched the scene very quietly. When my mother, warned by our neighbours, arrived, there was no policeman. She tried to have further informations about his arrest but the government never said a word. Other friends tried the same but the central police station said they did not know about the matter. If they want to make us believe that my father has been kidnapped by Viet-Cong (Communists) I think it is a coarse lie. I have written a letter to Appeal for Amnesty and my brother has just written a letter to the International Association of Lawyers in Geneva. I hope very much that you will help us to have news about my father, what is happening to him and if possible, to make him get out of the hands of these men who know but strength...» We immediately took up the matter with the Writers in Prison Committee of International P.E.N. David Carver sent the following cable on behalf of the Committee: President Ngo Dinh Diem, Presidential Palace, Saigon, Viet Nam. Disquieting rumours current here regarding Nghlem Xuan Thien. Most grateful receive news his situation. The cable was sent on July 2nd. On August 13, five weeks later, a letter came in answer: «In reply to your enquiry addressed to the Presidency, Saigon, regarding Mr. Nghiem Xuan Thien, I have to inform you that the named person has been arrested and is awaiting trial on a charge of conspiring against the internal security of the nation. 136 [pageend138]Yours faithfully. Phan-Van-Thinh, Counsellor, Embassy of Vietnam, London.» The kidnapping had become an «arrest». Almost two months had passed before it was admitted that Mr. Thien was to be charged. Thien’s son, Mr. Nghiem Phong Tuan who also lives in France, wrote on August 5: «About two weeks ago, the government let us know that my father is imprisoned in Chi-Hoa jail where he was already last time. This time it is under the charge of having been in the secret of the tentative coup d’état of November 1960 which is absurd since my father has never been worried about that till now. But my father has been tortured to admit that charge and he was very ill when my mother was allowed to see him on July 26th. On Saturday, July 27th, he appeared before the Military Court of Justice and there none of the other defendants whom he was confronted with knew my father as being one of their group. We hope that my father will be released very soon but we still fear that he could be murdered at any moment by the men of the government. In reality the kidnapping of my father has been ordered out of mere hate because of his brave opposition to the regime and has very close connection with the recent prosecutions of intellectuals and Buddhists as my father was a President of the Vietnamese Buddhist Association of which he is still a member. The government have been very embarrassed by the publicity made about my father having disappeared and they are at last compelled to admit that he is in their hands. I dare remind you that thousands of other intellectuals and Buddhists have disappeared too of whom nothing can be known except that they are tortured and some of them to death. I think that it is to protest against all those persecutions that Mr. Nguyon Tuong Tam, a Vietnamese writer we admire, poisoned himself lately. I believe that he did not die in vain. For my father, I thank you very much for your having intervened in his defence. Nothing could prevent him from having been tortured but the concern you have shown has contributed to safeguard his life.» We are glad to report that in consequence of the events of early November, Mr. Thien is now free and hopes to visit Europe next year. 137 [pageend139]INHAFTIERTE INTELEKTUELLE IN DER CSSR In Nummer 4 der « Arena » (Seite 135-137) wurde meine Studie über den inhaftierten tschechischen Dichter Josef Palivec gedruckt. Es war dies ein selbständiges Kapitel aus meinem vorbereiteten Buch « Zum Schweigen verurteilte Dichter ». In der Tschechoslowakei gibt es immer noch eine ganze Reihe von Intelligenzlern in kommunistischen Zuchthäusern inhaftiert, von denen ich nur Prof. Dr. Josef Beran, Erzbischof von Prag (während des ganzen Krieges im KZ), Prof. Dr. Karel Skoupý, Bischof von Brünn, Dr. Stanislav Zela (während des ganzen Krieges im KZ), Josef Kostohryz, František Krelina, Jan Anaztaz Opasek, Dr. F. Šilhán, Jan Dokulil, Ladislav Hlad, Dr. Miroslav Kučera, Vladimir Veselý, Prof. Dr. B. Ryba erwähnen möchte. Lediglich kommunistische Journalisten aus dem Kreise Rudolf Slansky wurden jetzt rehabilitiert. Dr. A. Kratochwil, AUFRICHTIGER RATSCHLAG AN ULBRICHT Auf der letzten Exekutivrat-Sitzung des Internationalen P.E.N. ln Brighton wurde u.a. eine Resolution gefasst zugunsten inhaftierter Schriftsteller in verschiedenen Ländern; dabei wurde Wolfgang Harich namentlich genannt. Dem Einwand des tschechischen Delegierten, man könne über diese Resolution nicht in Abwesenheit der ostdeutschen Delegation abstimmen, begegnete Paul Tabori, der Delegierte des Exil- P.E.N., mit der Bemerkung, man müsse einem Ertrinkenden auf alle Fälle einen Rettungsring zuwerfen, auch wenn der Besitzer des Schwimmbades zufällig abwesend sei. Die deutsche Ost-Delegation war nicht anwesend, weil die N.A.T.O.-Länder als Antwort auf die Mauer den Bewohnern der 138 [pageend140]Zone keine Visa gewähren, da das Regime sowieso nur ergebene Parteigänger ausreisen lässt. Der internationale P.E.N. hat jedoch allen Zentren auferlegt, bei ihren Regierungen zwecks Lockerung oder Umgehung dieser Vereinbarung vorstellig zu werden. In der Tat gibt es eine ganze Reihe Argumente für die Bewegungsfreiheit der Literaten. Frei miteinander reden und besonders sich ins Gewissen reden, ist immer gut. Etwas völlig Erstaunliches aber brachte die ungarische Delegation vor. Erstens konnte sie mitteilen, dass nunmehr alle inhaftierten Schriftsteller und Intellektuellen, auch Istvan Bibo, in Freiheit sind. Dann aber sagte der Delegierte Istvan Söter bei der Diskussion der Visum-Schwierigkeiten, er lade den Exekutivrat zu einer der nächsten Sitzungen nach Budapest ein, da entstünden für niemand Visumsorgen. Auf die Frage, wie es dabei den Exil-Ungarn ergehen werde, antwortete Söter wie folgt : « Ich bin ermächtigt zu erklären, dass wir aus voller Überzeugung die Literatur für ein Band zwischen den verschiedenen Völkern und den verschiedenartigen Schriftstellern ansehen, und dass alle P.E.N.-Zentren, und selbstverständlich auch das Exil-Zentrum, gleich warm willkommen geheissen werden.» Beifall ging durch die Reihen der Delegierten aus aller Welt, und es wurde beschlossen, spätestens im Herbst 1964 in Budapest zu tagen. So etwas hatte man noch aus keinem kommunistisch beherrschten Land gehört. Es ist klar, dass dieser Entschluss der ungarischen Regierung dem Regime Sympathie einbringt. Jedermann wird sagen: So unmenschlich kann es dort nicht mehr zugehen; das scheinen doch zugängliche Kommunisten zu sein! Und wirklich fragt man sich unwillkürlich, ob das Ungar rische Zentralkomitee nur aus Schlauheit so handelt, oder ob nicht wirklich «volle Überzeugung» dahintersteht. Man ist geneigt, Worten zu glauben, die sich mit solchen Taten auszuweisen vermögen. Und dies eben ist der dringende Rat an Ulbricht; Befreiung der inhaftierten Schriftsteller und Reisebewilligung. Und sollte wirklich der eine oder andere emigrieren: Wenn die Entlassung aus dem Gefängnis und die Gewährung der Bewegungsfreiheit aufrichtig gemeint sind, werden die meisten bleiben. Sie brauchen sich ja dann nicht mehr unsicher zu fühlen. Ja selbst wenn das alles nur aus Schlauheit gewährt würde — den Gefangenen ist es gleichgültig, mit welchen Hintergedanken sie entlassen werden. Wenn sie nur physisch frei sind. Aufrichtig oder schlau, gleichgültig. Den Beweis haben die Ungarn erbracht. Ein Dank dem ungarischen P.E.N. R. K.-B. («Die Welt», September 1963.) 139 [pageend141]Heinrich Heine Gedenktafel in Bagni di Lucca Der PEN-Club London (German Writers Abroad) hat am 25.9.63 in Bagni di Lucca eine Gedenktafel enthüllt. Diese Marmortafel wurde gestiftet von den durch Hitler aus Deutschland vertriebenen deutschen Dichtem und Schriftstellern. Schicksal und Gesinnung verbinden sie mit Heine. Anwesend waren vom PEN-Club London: Gabriele Tergit, Ossip Kalenter, David Luschnat. Nach einer Festansprache des Bürgermeisters von Bagni di Luca sprachen Ossip Kalenter und Pr. Cherubim (Massa) zum Thema Heinrich Heine in Bagni di Luca. Diese Reden waren alle in italienischer Sprache. In deutscher Sprache, der Sprache Heines, richtete die Sekretärin des londoner PEN- Clubs, Gabriele Tergit, einige Worte an die Freunde des Dichters. Das waren Italiener, deutsche Flüchtlinge aus Hitlerdeutschland, Franzosen und andere Europäer. Heines Geburtsland und Heines Geburtsort waren nicht offiziell vertreten. Offenbar wollen sie dort auch weiterhin Heine kein Denkmal errichten, wollen auch weiterhin an der Front des Schweigens teilnehmen, die seit mehr als einem Jahrhundert um einen der größten Dichter der deutschen Sprache sich herausgebildet hat. Warum ist das so? Gilt diese deutsche Abwehrfront Heine dem Juden? Heine dem Europäer? Heine dem Demokraten und Menschheits-Dichter? Oder einfach Heine dem Spötter, weil diese ernsten schwerblütigen deutschen Staatslenker Spott absolut nicht vertragen können? Niemand sei hier angeklagt. Es hat sich so ergeben mit der Zeit. Jeder handelt wie sein Nachbar und findet es ganz normal, dass Heine eben in Deutschland kein Denkmal haben kann. Alle singen Heinelieder und « Ich weiss nicht, was soll es bedeuten », als ob das Lieder wären, die ganz von selbst entstanden sind — deutsche Volkslieder eben! — Immerhin ist nun die Siegfried-Linie des eisigen Schweigens durchbrochen, hinter der sich Bundesregierung, Österreich und Sowjetzone samt allen ihren Dichterakademien, Kulturbünden und Schriftstellerverbänden verschanzt haben in Abwehrstellung. Ist durchbrochen worden vom PEN-Club der Dichter und Schrifsteller deutscher Sprache in London, der Flüchtlinge aus dem Dritten Reich Adolf Hitlers. Sie haben Heine, dem politischen Flüchtling die Treue bewahrt und betrachten ihn als einen der ihren. — Gabriele Tergit (früher Berlin) enthüllte nach einer kurzen Ansprache die Marmortafel für den Verfasser der Bäder van Lucca. DAVID LUSCHNAT. 140 [pageend142]COMMENT X have the pleasure of receiving Arena regularly and pass it around to several of the members of our Centre. The issue is then returned to me and kept on my shelves. Needless to say, we all find the review stimulating and very much worth-while. Many of the items are moving and all are thought provoking. It gives me much pleasure to have this opportunity of thanking you for the many happy hours I have spent with Arena. Stanley Foster, Hon. Secretary, Belfast. Centre of P.E.N. I read Arena regularly and in my opinion the magazine is good and well edited. I appreciate the work put into it, especially as the articles are in languages foreign to the editors Jozef Garlinski, London. I like Arena very much, the modest appearance and the interesting contents. In fact, from the many magazines I look through every month, Arena is the only one which I read from cover to cover. I have shown my copies to many literary people of various nationalities and so far the comments have been extremely favorable. A. E., California. CORRECTION We very much regret that a number of errors crept into Professor Hlavaty’s outstanding leading article in Arena No. 13. He has written us the following letter which we publish with our apologies: «My article has been unfortunately muddled up in such a way that in parts it does not make any sense and sometimes creates the impression as if I had written it carelessly. (1) «Morality» is a teaching concerning morals; it is therefore an anthropomorphic term just like «science» and «religion». I used the words «moral», «pure moral» as it was quite clear from the manuscript, in the sense of «universal» therefore in the non-anthropomorphic sense, in contrast to the anthropomorphic grades (science and religion) which are derived from it. (2) The sentence which begins with the words «For instance...» (Page 1) is not a definition although the introductory words hint that it ought to be one. 141 [pageend143](3) The second paragraph on page 1 should read: «To avoid any misunderstanding. I have to define the concept of religion as I understand it. In the field of science we recognize two principal branches—pure science and applied science. Equally, there is pure religion and applied religion. I shall consider chiefly the realms of pure science and pure religion etc.» (4) Page 12, line 18 should read: «In fact, if we accept that how could we explain the fact that apart from felines probably only man kills not just for survival but out of pure pleasure...» (5) I have not found in the article any mention of my feeling that, being a layman, I cannot mention apodictically, that what I have written is correct; that it is simply the «credo» of a layman...

Our subscription is still £ 1.— or $ 3.00.— annually and once again we ask those who have been receiving our issues for almost three years to let us have this sum by cheque or money order. These should be sent (drawn on a London bank, please!) to the special Arena account c/o Barclay’s Bank, 74, High Street Kensington, London W. 8., G.B;. Some of our friends have asked us about life-subscriptions and we have decided to be optimistic enough to set these at £ 20.— or $ 56.00. We hope there will be a good many of them. Our next issue is devoted to scholars of foreign origin in the United States and Britain and is edited by Prof. John Kosa of the University of North Carolina. It will be followed by an issue of « personal choice » edited by our Chairman, Ivan Jelinek. We expect to publish Albanian, Catalan, Chinese, Portugal and Yugoslav anthologies in addition to several special issues. One will be devoted to semantics which, in some form, is likely to be the theme of the International P.E.N. Congress in Oslo (June 1964); another to humour (which is being edited by K.G. Werner); still another to the film, TV and radio work of the exiles to be edited by Algirdas Landsbergis and Istvan Bokor. Kindly inform us of any change of address or any failure of the copies of Arena reaching you regularly. We must, by the way, apologise for Number 15 reaching our readers a little earlier than Number 14; this was due to a technical hitch beyond our control. NEWS OP THE P.E.N. CENTRE FOR WRITES IN EXILE Our Centre was well represented at the Rheims Round Table meeting of International P.E.N. Our official delegates were Algirdas Landsbergis, First Vice-Chairman of our New York Branch and Paul Tabori. In addition Ernest Halasz, K.G. Werner, Ladislas Gara, Mrs. Kathleen Szasz, Pavel Tigrid (and his charming wife Ivanka), Theodosya Lisiewicz and Peteris Aigars (as delegate of the Latvian P.E.N.) also represented the Centre and its German and French Branches. Dr. Otto A. Webermann, 147 [pageend149]our distinguished Gottingen member, was the delegate of the Estonian Centre. We hope to publish a detailed report of the discussions in an early issue. After six years of representing the Centre as Permanent International Delegate, Paul Tabori has resigned to devote his time and energies to the honorary secretaryship of the International Writers Fund. Our Centre is fortunate in having Pavel Tigrid, joint secretary of our Paris Branch, to succeed as the new Permanent International Delegate. Robert Kenedy has resigned as secretary of the London Centre. Ruth Speirs has agreed to becoming acting secretary until the next Annual General Meeting. The book exhibitions of exiled writers will soon open in Innsbruck, Brussels, Hamburg, Frankfurt a. M., Munich, Berlin and Vienna. Most of them will be organized under the auspices of our German Branch. Paul Tabori is visiting Portugal and Spain to meet some of the Centre’s members and discuss cooperation with writers in these countries in which no P.E.N. Centres have been established yet. Our German Branch has now completed its organisation and is working under the following officials: Tadeusz Nowakowski, President (Munich); Dr. Ernst Halasz, Vice-President (Berne); K.G. Werner, General Secretary) (Bad Nauheim); Zeltita AvotinarHesse, Treasurer (Aurich); Janos Bardi, Press Officer (Springer Verlag, Hamburg); Members of the Executive: Dr. Ivan Bankovsky (Frankfurt am Main), Denes Kovacs (Vienna), Dr. A. Kratochwill (Munich), Count Paul Palffy von Erdöd (Munich), Vladimir Stedry (Munich). 148 [pageend150]Notes and Reviews : Page 116 Janis Veselis........................................................
