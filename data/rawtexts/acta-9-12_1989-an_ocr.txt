[pageend2]CZECHOSLOVAKIA: HEAT IN JANUARY 1989 Compiled by Jan Vladislav in collaboration with Vilém Prečan Scheinfeld-Schwarzenberg 1989 [pageend3][pageend4]INTRODUCTION The reasonfor this special issue The exceptional events that occurred in Czechoslo- vakia and particularly Prague at the beginning of 1989 made necessary the exceptional character and size of this special issue of ACTA which takes up the entire year's output. The chronicle of the events in January and afterwards, together with the relative documents and many dramatic testimonies to them also constitute in their way part of independent liter- ature and joumalism, as well as of contetnporary historical documentation, i.e. the very areas covered by ACTA. And since these were texts which, at the time this present volume was being prepared, had no hope of being published either in Czechoslovakia, where there was the greatest interest in them, or elsewhere in the world, where they would also be worthy of attention, the editors thought it not only right but essential to provide a place for them in ACTA. In doing so we are fully aware that this represents a departure from the joumal 's established pattem. We regard this as an exception to the rule but one we' would be prepared to resort to again in the future should the circumstances so require. The fact is that the rehabilitation ofhistorical truth does not solely concem the past, however recent. It is also, if not above all, a matter of the present. It is not just a sort of. spontaneous development under the pressure of events, it is also, if not above all, the outcome of a deliberate and constant effort to estab- lish the historical truth without delay. In short, only by a systematic effort to portray real history and immediately to publish documents and testimonies about what is actually happening here and now can we counter the influence of all those Orwellian min- istries ofTruth created by the totalitarian systems and whose effectiveness we sometimes tend to underes- tirnate. Czechoslovakia 's versi on of that ministry has also displayed a rare talent for seeking out historical events where ther~ are none, and rejecting, suppress- ing and persecuting them where they have actually occurred. That was the case, for instance, several years ago after the publication of Charter 77. It was the case during the restless year of 1988 and again this year, when this lengthy development one may rightly term the democratic revolution reached one of its peaks in the events around the 20th anniversary of Jan Palach 's death. The historical significance of those events, marked above all by the determination of the new generations and their first conscious public involve- ment in society was obvious even to a distant ob- server by the second half of J anuary. Hence the idea arose back then to capture them without delay in as detailed and in-depth manner as possible through a 3 [pageend5]INTRODUCTION coherent series of documents, eyewitness accounts and other material such as was arriving in increasing quantities from Czechoslovakia and elsewhere. That, quite sirnply, was the genesis and intention of the present vol ume. The original plan, in line with its immediate practical purpose, was to limit it solely to the events that occurred during January 1989. However, in the light of developments and their ramifications we were obliged to pursue at least some of the main stories to their conclusion - i.e. up to the trials of the protagonists in the second half of Febru- ary and the appeal hearings at the end of March which confirrned those verdicts. That marks the end of our chronicle and documentation for the tirne being. What happened next will be, we hope, the subject of another publication. As far as ACTA itself is concerned, it will continue its existing activity as indicated in the prelirninary contents of the next issue, which can be found at the end of this volume. How the material is arranged This special issue has required far more work, space and, of course, time than the editors originally ex- pected. Consequently it is only appearing now on the anniversary of the events in question. The issue opens with commentaries by Vilém Prečan and Václav Havel, which are among the first attempts at identi- fying the wider connotations and underlying signifi- cance of the events. There then follows the text of the statement Just a Few Sentences whose publication and widespread endorsement represented a further phase of the developments foreshadowed by the sup- pressed demonstrations in January 1989. This introductory section is followed by a detailed, albeit far from exhaustive, Chronicle of Events, 4 which tries to give a day-by-day account of the events of the first quarter of 1989 and their repercussions at home and abroad. The most important section, how- ever, is that entitled Documents and testimonies even though it too could not hope to be exhaustive in view of the amount of material. It is a selection which seeks to provide as revealing a picture as possible not only of the overall shape of the movement and its various stages, but also its characteristic features. It therefore includes not only the main documents of the various civic initiatives and some typical reac- tions in the official press, but also immediate individ- ua! testirnonies given during the events and so far unpublished. In selecting both the Documents and Testimonies and the Chronicle, our choice was influ- enced to a certain extent by a concern for the level of knowledge and interest of the readership for which the English version of this issue is intended. Editorial Notes To help readers keep track of individua! events, within the Chronicle, references are given to other places in that same section (marked C plus a date) or to the televant parts of the section Documents and Testimonies (D plus a serial number). The documents and testimonies are printed in chronological order. They are marked with the initial D and numbered from 1 to 85, followed by the date and the place of issue, where this was not Prague. The date given is that of the original document; where the document was not dated - as in the case of testirnonies - an estirnated date is given in brackets. The date a docu- ment originated is not necessarily identical with the date it was made public. The Charter 77 Documents and other major pro- nouncements by the Czechoslovak civic initiatives [pageend6]are reprinted in full. In the case of testimonies, par- ticularly those telephoned to Radio Free Europe, improvised statements were edited and abridged where necessary, so as to avoid repetition and confu- sion. Where texts from the official press have been shortened this is indicated in the conventional way; their characteristic style and orthography have been preserved as in the original (e.g. the printing of charter with a lower-case initial letter, etc.). Factual errors and deliberate disinformation have been left without comment; in most cases the other documents place them in proper perspective. Interested readers will be able to find full versions of these and other materials from the same sources we ourselves used, i.e. the documents, statements and reports that circu- lated in Czechoslovakia; unofficial joumals and sa- mizdat publications, and from Radio Free Europe broadcasts; and finally from the official Czechoslo- vak press. As additional information we have included at the end of the volume a List of Czechoslovak Citizens charged and convicted during the first quarter of 1989 either directly in connection with the January events or as a result of civic activities during the previous year; a List of the Civic lnitiatives and a List of Periodicals mentioned in the text; and finally, a INTRODUCTION List and explanation of the abbreviations used and a List of Documents and Testimonies. In view of the amount of source material and the character of some of it, not to mention the lirnited time and opportunity available to work on this publication, one cannot exclude the possibility that certain inaccuracies or mistakes rnight have crept into the text. The editors will be happy to receive notification of any errors and will publish corrections where necessary. Jan Vladislav Postscript The unexpected tum of events in November and December 1989 has meant that this collection is appearing in quite different circumstances from those in which it was prepared. This does not alter in any essential way, however, its importance as documen- tation, which was its main purpose from the outset. Even in the new situation it is areminder ofthe events that played an important role in what we hope will enter European history as the Great Centra! European Revohition - the first revolution in which there will have been no violence or reign of terror on the part of the revolutionaries. 20th December 1989 5 [pageend7]Vilém Prečan DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION I. A hundred and forty years on, Marx and Engels's well-known pronouncement about Europe being haunted by the spectre of communism requires some modification: communist Europe is now haunted by the "spectre" of democracy. One can hardly deny that "democracy" is not only the key concept in the polit- ical vocabulary of those trying to sol ve in practice the number one issue facing that part of the world: i.e. the irreversible transcendence of the Soviet-style to- talitarian regime. It has become the most frequently used expression even of those who are trying to save the system. In three countries of the extemal Soviet empíre, Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia - also known as eastem central Europe-democracy is quite clearly on the march, although at a different pace in each of them. In Poland, the Apríl 1989 agreement - a mile- stone in the past forty years' history of that country - represents a major step towards renewing society 's inner sovereignty vis-a-vis the communist state and paves the way to a parliamentary democracy there (even though some may undoubtedly regard it as a snare prepared by the present communist establish- 6 ment in order to trap the democratic opposition into sharing in the regime's own demise and discrediting itself through abetting unpopular economic mea- sures). In Hungary, where the regime does not have a recent history of military rule a la Jaruzelski or Czechoslovak-style normalisation, it looks from the outside as if part of the ruling party leadership was borrowing ideas from the democratic opposition and preparing itself for a political contest under condi- tions of free elections and a multiparty system. (Per- haps Hungary most aptly fits Zbigniew Brzezinski's analytical observation about the possibility of win- ning over the communist elite to a more permanent system of national values.) But even in Czechoslovakia, which would seem to be a European leader in political inertia and where the ruling political establishment continues to resist any idea of dialogue with society and makes known in every possible way its opposition to any genuine shift or change, democracy's cards have been laid on the table. As a leading independent Czech commen- tator Milan Šimečka puts it: There is one thing we can be sure of. Things would be totally different here had our democratic political culture not been de- [pageend8]stroyed. Our only hope, if we are not to hit rock bottom, is to create it anew; it is the only idea that can lend meaning or purpose to our future. This idea was worked into a political programme in the "Democracy for Ail" manifesto brought out in autumn 1988 by the independent Movement for Civil Liberties. Václav Havel has called that manifesto the most important political card of 1988 as far as his country was concemed, in that the seemingly self-ev- ident truths it contained were set out in a single document, publicly, and as a basis for political activ- ity. For the fact is that the Manifesto is ap appeal for society to step into the political arena, seeing that the present rulers - those who are to blame for the moral crisis, the Jack of democracy, the limitations on our national and state sovereignty, and our economic and technological decline - are unwilling to abandon their totalitarian style of govemrnent. The manifesto explicitly challenges the legitimacy of the so-called leading role of the communist Party and asserts dem- ocratic pluralism as the fundamental political princi- pie. This means, according to Havel who was one of the Manifesto's signatories, that everyone has an equal right to compete for political power. * Can this march of democracy come under the head- ing of "democratic revolution"? This expression which surprises a lot of people and is not very fre- quent in Europe, has an optimistic ring to it and inspires hope and great expectations. Maybe too great, in fact. Even so, it is a functional enough term - with the following provisos: 1. "Democratic revolution" is used to describe the underlying trend of the times towards democracy, a DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION system based on spiritual, political and economic pluralism and mutual tolerance. 2. The democratic revolution has grown out of the gestation of elements of civil society which have gradually established themselves inside the totalitar- ian system, but which exist relatively independent of the totalitarian power structures. The democratic rev- olution comrnences the moment when that civil so- ciety advances the demand for changes in the system on the basis of democracy and freedom and formu- lates a political programme for achieving them. 3. The democratic revolution, whose progress is one of the fundamental or even key phenomena of the present time in societies under communist rule, is one of the least violent revolutions in history. Cars are not set on fire in the name of democracy, nor bombs exploded. It is not a revolution that rallies the masses beneath banners with demagogie slogans. Its advocates are staunch opponents of violence and civil war. They are open to compromise and to ideas of national or social reconciliation that would break the existing chain of violence which is inherent in Communism. But the era of democratic revolution is one full of violence and suffering, of course. The threat or actual use of violence varies from country to country and comes from those currently in power - the party of guardians of the status quo and its police, its crack units, and in certain cases, such as in Czechoslovakia, its terrorists from the ranks of the sec ret police posing as incensed members of the public. The democratic revolution of the nineteen eight- ies, which is our topic here, has its historical forerun- ners or portents. The Kronstadt Mutiny of 1921, the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, the Prague Spring of 7 [pageend9]DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION 1968, the Solidarity era of 1980-81 (and to a certain extent even the thaw under Khrushchev) all had something in common, in spite of their individua} characteristics and particular historical contexts: they all expressed society's desire to attenuate, limit and finally eliminate the totalitarian nature of the communist system. One distinguished antecedent, possibly the key initial step in the direction of the democratic revolu- tion, was the "moral revolution" which served as the bas i s for the dissidence of the 1970s: the new concept of human rights emergent from the critique of com- munist totalitarianism, the cultivation of citizenship, the implementation of the principle oflife in the truth, independent culture and samizdat. The achievements of the moral revolution, often ignored or even ridi- culed by advocates of "realpolitik", are now becom- ing plain to see and are being re-assessed as civil society enters the arena as a self-assured and sover- eign political partner or opponent of the existing political establishment. The democratic revolution we are now witnessing differs from its predecessors in that it is taking place in the period of "the terminal crisis of communism" of the "progressive decay and the deepening agony both of its system and of its dogma", to quote Zbigniew Brzezinski. The crisis is of such magnitude that it cannot be solved by means of piecemeal rem- edies while leaving the system intact: the belief in the irreversibility of the communist system has been shaken to its foundations. The democratic revolution is a response to that crisis while being at the same time one of the factors of the further deepening of the crisis, above all because it points to a radical solution that goes to the heart of the matter. 8 The question is sometimes asked whether the re- forms undertaken or planned by the present commu- nist establishment are not in fact part of the democratic revolution. To my way of thinking, these are two phenomena which differ in many respects, particularly in terms of their aims, but cannot be entirely separated from each other. The democratic revolution in the Soviet bloc in the eighties has its own authentic roots and sources of inspiration. It is not derived from any socialist ideol- ogy, nor from any discussion about socialism, whether true or false, unsullied or sullied. Nor is it an offshoot of Gorbachevism, even though its dyna- mism is - in different ways, depending on the country - indirectly influenced by it. The goal of the demo- cratic revolution is not a further attempt to square the circle: i.e. to modemise the communist system and make it more efficient while retaining its essence. The aim is to do away with it once and for all. The democratic revolution seeks not "democratization" but democracy - free from any further misleading adjectives like "people's" or "socialist". It does not advocate "glasnost" but free speech. It counters the idea of socialist pluralism with a programme of free- dom, spiritual, political and economic pluralism, and the emancipation of citizens and civil society from the state. The democratic revolution 's sources of inspiration are not primarily remembrance of a democratic past, even though efforts to draw inspiration from all the spiritual and political roots of democratic thought do play an important role in each of the countries. It derives its legitimacy from the universa} applicability of human rights and it substantiates its arguments with an open analysis of the contemporary situation [pageend10]in the individua! countries of the Soviet bloc, an analysis devoid of any socialist phraseology. The democratic revolution is therefore also a re- action to those societies' fo rty or more years' experi- ence of communist totalitarianism - whether called "socialism", "existing socialism", "socialism with a human face" (orwithout)-and particularly in the last two decades, since the failure of the !atest attempt at reform on the basis of so-called revisionism. Equally it is the outcome of the experience of prosperously functioning democratic systems in Europe and North America, not to mention the successful transition to democracy in Spain, Portugal and elsewhere. In this respect, the global contexthas seen a positive change. The democratic ideal, scorned and ridiculed in the inter-war years, and even as late as the fifties, is now more favourably placed than at any time this century. * We talk about a "general" or "overall" crisis of com- munism, but apart from its general features, it also displays very specific characteristics in individua! countries. As far as Czechoslovakia is concerned, it is fair to say that no communist party in any other country of the Soviet bloc ever managed to lose moral prestige, confidence and legitimacy in the eyes of society to the same extent as the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. Twenty years of "normalisation" used it up well and truly. Even its last remaining weapon of any power, the - until recently - much- vaunted "consumer and social guarantees of social- ism", is losing in effectiveness in the face of reality. With a certain exaggeration, one might say that the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia has written it- self off as a political force capable of generating an alternative to the present establishment. DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION Apart from a small circle of people who still entertain 1968-vintage reformist illusions, no one in Czechoslovakia believes that the Communist Party [of Czechoslovakia] is capable of any sort of "re- newal" or that it embodies any sort of hope for the future. Distrusted and rejected by society, particu- larly the younger generation, and lacking any intel- lectual base, it is not capable of following even the Soviet, Polish or Hungarian examples. And whereas people - not so long ago they were called the "silent majority" - are losing their fear, the establishment is beginning _to fe~l threatened. They are now so isolated that they must instinctively know in themselves that their fate is sealed. Being unable to produce from their midst an alternative political elite - even as a stop-gap measure - capable of initiating a dialogue with society, they are merely treading water, and they regard each additional month they manage to survive as a success. Meanwhile they go on making one mistake after another and strength- ening the solidarity and activity of the civil society. In the course of 1988 we witnessed more social movement in Czechoslovakia than at any tirne during the previous twenty years; that trend has continued non-stop. People 's determination to assert their civil rights is manifesting itself in every possible way: peaceful demonstrations and rallies that have taken place despite threats from the highest places and in spite of the danger of police terror and subsequent judicial persecution; the growth of independent citizens' initiatives, with petition after petition being launched since the beginning of this year. These have gained the signatures of thousands of people from the so-called "official structures", in other words, the cultural, artistic and academic establishment in sup- 9 [pageend11]DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION port of people described by government leaders, in parliament and in the mass media as "provocateurs" and "enemies of socialism". This eruption of social activity in the form of civil disobedience is by no means economically motivated - the result of a radical decline in the standard of hving. It is above all people 's reaction to twenty years of lies and humiliation, and their own conformity. It is a chain-reaction sparked off by a yearning for a healthy public life, for plain speaking and for the undistorted truth about what everyone can see with their own eyes. The most actively involved are young people who find the official clichés and lies intolerable. There are no taboos as far as they are concerned. They are not burdened with ideology, nor does the past weigh on them. They have no sentimental attachment to social- ism. They are often surprisingly well- informed, since modem communications media open their ho- rizons to the entire world. And they feel that it is their future - literally their whole li ves - that is now at stake. In addition, the broad current of "civil disobedi- ence" continues to attract the growing support of many members of what is now the older generation - those who backed a laser when they went along with the restored order and now look as if they want to bum their bridges after years of living a lie, years of conformity and dissimulation. And they will un- doubtedly be joined even by certain timeservers who forged themselves cosy "collaborationist" careers at the beginning of "normalisation" and who now, as they feel the ship beginning to founder, will want to be on the "right" side again. An important factor in the political destabilisation of the regime are developments in neighbouring 10 countries: Hungary, Paland - and the Soviet Union. These have done much to alter the political climate in the country by fostering the impression of an overall historical trend, boosting people's self-confi- dence, and strengthening society 's awareness of the inevitability of change while acting as a catalyst in bringing it about. The regime 's stability is also being eroded - in a number of respects- as a result of the end of jamrning of Radio Free Europe in rnid-December 1988. Its prompt news reporting from within Czechoslovakia, which is heard throughout the country, combined with the growth of activity on the part of the indepen- dent solidarity committees and groups, including those oflonger date and a whole number of new ones, has served to attenuate the fear of persecution as immediate retaliation for each and. every expression of civic courage. People realise that persecution can- not be an anonymous matter any more and they are no longer isolated individuals at the mercy of the regirne. Another encouraging factor, in this respect, is the growth of intemational solidarity combined with a general interest in Czechoslovakia. * In spite of all the optimism with which we may speak about the present "democratic revolution", despite the fact we can feel it in the air, and although histor- ical analysis indicates that a democratic solution is the only logical outcome, we remain sceptical. Things could still go wrong. The democratic revolu- tion need not achieve its ends and its victory might be postponed. There are numerous reasons for such doubts and they have all been analysed. No one can know just how far the metropolis of the Soviet empire will be prepared to let democratic [pageend12]developments in eastem central Europe go. There is no way of estimating the price it will be prepared to pay at any given moment, which priority will prevail, which loss will be considered the lesser of two evils. But there is an even more fundamental question: what are the chances of a democratic revolution in the Soviet Uni?n itself? Or more to the point: among the Russians themselves? Caught in the throes of "perestroika's" insoluble dilemmas and their fevered pursuit of their own political identity, will the Rus- sians have the time or the opportunity to understand the demand for sovereignty of the nations of the extemal empire? The Soviet threat - obviously enough - is not, of course, the only barrier to a victorious democratic revolution in the eastem central European countries. The communist regimes in those countries may well have come into existence as satellites of the Soviet superpower, but they keep themselves alive by their own efforts, using their own resources, and in their own interest. In Czechoslovakia, since J anuary 1989, the whole country, not just a narrow circle of dissi- dents, has been aware of the sort of brutality that can be expected from the so-called "forces of order". And the entire democratic world must have realised how powerless it was when confronted by a single isolated situation, when it was not yet even an immediate question of survival for the communist establish- ment. I refer to the political leadership's decision to imprison the country's greatest moral authority and one of the spiritual leaders of Czechoslovakia's dem- ocratic revolution: Václav Havel. However - as Timothy Garton Ash has convinc- ingly demonstrated - the system of power and the interests of the nomenklatura are not the only factors DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION inhibiting the transformation of the communist sys- tem into a liberal democracy with a mixed economy. There are also the interests, attitudes and fears of many of the ruled. In each of the countries in ques- tion, so many problems have accumulated, particu- larly in the economic sphere, that they appear virtually insurmountable. It is impossible to predict the role that might be played by the fears and uncer- tainties of the labour force who will bear the main burden of consequences for overcoming economic stagnation and backwardness. For the most part, the Czechoslovak workers remain silent; fear of their possible reaction is a further source of inertia within the communist leadership. There are, of course, sources of hope, and these too have all been identified and analysed. On the one hand, the Soviet superpower is preoccupied with itself and on the other, the leading Westem democra- cies now have a better grasp of the situation in eastem central Europe. The greatest source of hope is the progress made by civil society within the crisis-tom communist systems: the spiritual, political and pro- fessional/occupational emancipation of individuals and groups, new kinds of civic solidarity, the discov- ery of new forms of freedom of expression and organisation. More and more capable and willing people are emerging from anonymity, and therein lies the true hope of the process of the democratic revo- lution. * Czechoslovak optimists and pessmusts alike are agreed on one thing: that the existing system is inex - orably doomed. They only differ in their estimates of how long it will take. The optimists count in months, the pessimists in years. The optimists add: Our mo- 11 [pageend13]DEMOCRATIC REYOLUTION rale is excellent, the only worry we have is the thought of our friends in prison. Only because of them does the time factor matter. Otherwise there would be no need for haste. The regime's delaying tactics will tum against them in the end, because the longer they put off tackling the country's pressing problems, the more difficult it will be to use piece- meal or half-hearted solutions. However, as yet neither the optirnists nor the pes- simists have any idea of when or how the stalemate situation in which the political leadership finds itself will end. It could well be that Czechoslovakia's path to democracy will substantially differ from the Polish or Hungarian versions. May 1989 Fina! version of a text prepared for the Democratic Revo- lution Conference held in Washington D.C. on 1st and 2nd May 1989 by the National Endowment for Democracy. II. During 1989 the pace of the democratic revolution in the countries of eastem centra! Europe has substan- tially increased. The evolution from a totalitarian regime to a democratic system based on spiritual, political and economic pluralism has received re- peated boosts. When we come to evaluate 1989 and we find a moment to reflect on the events with which it started we will discover just how much has become reality in eastem Central Europe - things inconceiv- able only a year ago. Several factors have helped speed up the pace of developments. The democratic revolution is taking 12 place against the background of the general (and final) crisis of communism, one which cannot be solved by means of piecemeal modifications on the basis of the existing system. For the first time in forty years, the fateful mechanism of unsynchronised phases when systemic crises would occur isolatedly in one or other of the countries (e.g. in Czechoslova- kia in 1968 or in Poland in 1980) no longer applies. For although the crisis of communism displays dif- ferent features in different countries and the transi- tion to democracy assumes different forms in each of them, fundamentally, it is the same historical trend occurring more or less simultaneously. Systemic changes are also taking place in the Soviet Union which, moreover, has actually endorsed the principie of non-interference and the right of each country in the bloc to adopt its own course. It is even conceiv- able that it will accept the eventuality of individua! states opting out of the Warsaw Pact military alliance. Poland and Hungary are presently in the forefront of this open-ended drama. In my view, developments in Poland, and specifically the Communist Party's abdication of its monopoly of power coupled with the transition to a democratic system have been deter- mined by three events: theround-table agreements of April 1989; the Sejm elections in June and the cre- ation of the coalition govemment headed by non- communists and including only a minority of communists. Since May, Hungary has seen the symbolic funeral of Imre Nagy and his associates organised as astate ceremony of national reconciliation; the democratic changes in the constitution; the change in the country's official name; the foundation of the social- democratic party; the on-going changes in the lead- [pageend14]ership of the ruling party that have even led to the creation of a new party with hopes of holding its own in free elections; the removal of fences on the Hungaro-Austrian borders; the overruling of bloc solidarity in the case of East German refugees; and the promise to hold free elections in the coming year. There has been a quite unexpected and sudden turn of events in the German Democratic Republic. For the first time in 35 years we are seeing a public reckoning of the damage caused to society by the domination of the Communist Party. Developments over the past fortnight leave us in no doubt that things cannot be limited to a temporary opening ofthe val ve of public criticism and self-criticism and consequent cosmetic changes. On the contrary, the German Democratic Republic has also been caught up in the whirlwind of the democratic revolution. Ata time of such developments in Central Europe, Czechoslovakia, seen from outside, looks like the last island of Brezhnevism in eastern Centra! Europe. lndeed, in a sense, Jakeš' Czechoslovakia does sit rather like a wedge between Poland and Hungary. Conditions in Czechoslovakia certainly constitute an enormous obstacle to the intensification of co-oper- ation among the democratic forces of the entire re- gion, as well as to solving common or similar problems and facing up to the task of widening co-operation with the democratic forces of the East- em European nations: the Ukrainians, Baltic coun- tries and the Russians. It is not hard to imagine the possibilities that would be opened up were a govem- ment of national confidence to take power in Prague in place of the present government of national dis- grace. DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION I hasten to point out, lest I be misunderstood, that I too believe that society in Czechoslovakia has woken up and is already beginning to lose patience. I have no wish in the least to demean the progress made by civil society in that country over the past year and a half along the road to liberation and self-emancipation. Czechoslovakia is also on the way to a democratic revolution. Let me try and sum up briefly: 1. In spring 1987 there were still only two perma- nently functioning civic initiatives in existence: Charter 77 and the Committee for the Defence of the Unjustly Prosecuted (VONS). By the end of 1988 a whole network of independent initiatives had been created with their own information system able to influence the public through their own samizdat- press (such as Lidové noviny) and with the help of foreign-based radio stations. There has not just been an increase in the numbers involved in these civic initiatives, there has also been a marked politicization of their prograrnmes, to the extent of demanding ét share in political power. A whole number of policy statements by the civic ini- tiatives or statements by their representatives have rejected the principie of the so-called "leading role" of the Communist Party as being incompatible with the principie of citizens' equality and the codes of civil and political rights. The Manifesto of the Move- ment for Civil Liberties entitled Democracy for Ail does not deal with socialism or its improvement but instead has put forward for debate the principie of a democratic system based on political and spiritual pluralism, a mixed economy and mutual tolerance. 2. Extremely visible evidence of society's awak- ening, was provided by the street demonstrations of 13 [pageend15]DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION August and October 1988 and the Palach Week in January this year. In addition, since then there have been the demonstrations in August (which took place even though certain independent initiatives failed to adopt a categorical or unified stance towards them and some even counselled against them) and on 28th October. And they have all taken place in the face of threats and despite the consequences in terms of police harassment and brutality, arrest, deterition, convictions and penalties in the form of fines or imprisonment. 3. An important sign of the growth in active citi- zenship and the fact that people are overcoming the fear that until recently paralysed almost the whole of society have been this year's large-scale petitions. The first of them - a sort of dress-rehearsal - was the petition by members of the arts world in January- February in protest against the police brutality during the attempts to commemorate Jan Palach and in favour of Václav Havel 's release. The second major petition in 1989 got under way at the end of June and is still in progress. In spíte of a campaign against it in the official media and the persecution of many of its signatories, the statement entitled Několik vět /Just a Few Sentences/ has been signed by 37,000 citizens up to now. This is excep- tionally significant in not being an anonymous enter- prise. Supporters all supply their names in the knowledge that they will be made public. This cam- paign has been spearheaded by people who so far have been most manipulated and whose livelihood is most at stake since they depend more than any others on official contracts, namely, actors and the entire world of stage and screen. The petition has been accompanied by major acts of individua! courage 14 such as the statement by the Slovak actor Milan Kňažko who returned his "Distinguished Artist" award, or the statement by the conductor of the Czech Philharmonic, Václav Neumann, who was then joined by the entire orchestra - after a democratic ballot - refusing to co-operate with Czechoslovak Television and Radio in protest against the discrimi- nation of artists for asserting their citizenship. 4. The aforementioned petitions extended to many areas of the so-called official structures. At.the same time, things started to move within the writers' or- ganisations; cultural and literary journals started writing more freely and openly about previously taboo subjects, and a debate was initiated about re- turning to the public those parts of Czech and Slovak literature which have so far been silenced or ignored. Over the past few months, moves in the direction towards a more active involvement in civic affairs have been seen in the foundation of the Club of lndependent Intelligentsia and the !atest protests against the detention of two editors of the indepen- dent news magazíne Lidové noviny and in favour of the journal's legalisation: by 1st November a petition had already gained 200 signatures among joumalists on official newspapers and journals and members of the editorial boards of publishing houses. Even in official organisations there have been overt signs of dissent from the previous policy of recognising "the leading role of the Party". This includes the Czecho- slovak People's Party in which a "renewal wing" has been formed, and a process along similar lines can be observed within the Czechoslovak Socialist Party. More and more people in cultural institutions and the mas s media are throwing off the shackles of self-cen- sorship, and censorship is no longer entirely reliable. [pageend16]I will give one typical example out of many. A few days ago, on 27th October, Prague 's Realistic Theatre put on a dramatic compilation about the nineteen-six- ties entitled The way we experienced it using texts by Václav Havel, Milan Kundera and other banned or long silenced authors. On lstNovember, the Socialist daily Svobodné slovo published a half-page review which praised the production and did not omit a single author's name. 5. Another important factor in stimulating society's progress towards a renewal of spiritual and political plurality is the growth in influence of the Catholic Church in Slovak and Czech society. A petition calling for religious liberty and culminating in the demand for the separation of Church and State was signed in 1988 by 600,000 believers. The Cath- olic Church came out with a programme for a ten- year period of spiritual renewal aimed at turning the church back towards society and its needs. Hand in hand with this is the growing authority of Cardinal Tomášek who has twice this year spoken out in support of the citizenry and its rights and demands vis-a-vis the communist regime. The first occasion was in January when he protested to the Prime Min- ister against the police brutality during Palach Week. The second was on 4th August in an open letter to government leaders and Czechoslovak citizens in which he described the petition "Just a Few Senten- ces" as a means for citizens to assert their share of democratic responsibility and lil which he offered to mediate in helping bring about an open dialogue between citizens and the government. * Spearheading the social movement whose individua! components I have set out above has been an upsurge DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION in youth activity. Young people started to come into the fore in the setting up of many civic initiatives and they have been most prominent in demonstrations. It is_ above all young journalists who entered the mass media at the beginning of the eighties who have rebelled against newspeak in the press. I realise, naturally, the limits of civic activity in Czechoslovakia. Everything I have mentioned as new gains of civil society over the past two years is still insufficient to change attitudes at the top of the political establishment where they are still deter- mined to maintain their own monopoly of power, not to countenance any change, not to permit freedom of expression and assembly, but instead to continue to use the police and judiciary to persecute the more open expressions of civic courage and break up dem- onstrations with police truncheons. Itfalls outside the scope of these brief comments to attempt an analysis of the reasons why the social dynamic in Czechoslo- vakia has so far failed to make any greater headway with the workers or why other strata of the population remain sceptically on the sidelines. The reasons are many and most of them are typically Czechoslovak. To a great extent it is the outcome of the evolution that occurred after the failed attempt to change the system in 1968 - when society was literally on the verge of self-emancipation - after the great uprising that ended with the capitulation of the leaders, as well as millions of private capitulations. Twenty years of normalisation has also left a fatal mark on the Czechoslovak Communist Party. Its leadership is entirely in the hands of people installed by Brezhnev. The Communist Party has lost political and moral prestige and in the eyes of the majority of the population it has written itself off as a political 15 [pageend17]JUST A FEW SENTENCES force capable of generating an altemative to the present establishment, among other reasons, because it has lost any intellectual base. The present political stalemate in the country is without doubt depressing for the majority of the domestic opposition; on the other hand, for many it represents a challenge to examine their own weaknesses and shortconůngs. I would only recall a truism that applies to the entire history of mankind: mass upheavals that overthrow govemrnents are not made to order and seldom do they occur at moments when they are most needed. They are seldom predict- able. They are frequently the outcome of a momen- tary stimulus which need not even be particularly important. It is enough for it to occur at a moment when people 's patience is exhausted, when they have ceased to be afraid and started to gain hope. Nobody knows how near such a moment is in Czechoslova- kia. However, what is certain is that the moment JUST A FEW SENTENCES The first months of 1989 provided further clear evi- dence of the fact that although the present Czecho- slovak leadership pays frequent lip-service to the words "perestroika" and "democratisation", in prac- tice it is resisting in an alrnost desperate way every- thing that helps create democracy or is vaguely renůniscent of it. lt disnůsses the citizens' petitions and initiatives which have not been officially organised from above. It rejects them as "coercion". It condemns 16 has come when everyone in that country is con- fronted by the question of what to do: not tomorrow but now, for themselves and for their own future of freedom. * In these past days I was very encouraged by the news that one section of the demonstrators in East Berlin on 30th October decided to make their way to the Czechoslovak Embassy and protest against the bru- tality of the Czechoslovak police during the demon- strations in Prague on 28th October. And it was nice to hear that our East German friends from the New Forum remembered Prague in recent days when they declared that the Prague Spring will be fol- lowed by a Prague Summer. Of that I too am firmly convinced. From a talk given on 3rd November 1989 at the opening of the international serninar on Centra! Europe in the Polish city of Wroclaw. altemative political views as "anti- socialist" or ''hos- tile". It disperses peaceful rallies. lt refuses to let the public have any say in the drafting of new legislation. However, these same months have also shown that the citizenry is breaking free of its lethargy and increasing numbers are finding the courage to ex- press their yeaming for social changes. Thus the movement within society is coming into increasing conflict with the inertia of the regime, [pageend18]social tension is rising and the threat of open crisis looms large. None of us wants such a crisis. We therefore call on our country's leadership to realise that the time has come for genuine, thorough- going changes in the system, and that such changes will only be possible or viable if they are preceded by truly free and democratic discussion. However, the first step towards any meaningful change - whether it be be a new constitution or economic reform - must therefore be a fundamental change in the social clirnate of this country, restoring to it the spirit of freedom, trust, tolerance and plurality. In our view this requires: 1. The irnmediate release of all political prisoners; 2. The lifting of restrictions on freedom of assem- bly; 3. An end to the outlawing and persecution of various independent initiatives which should at last be recognised by the government as they have long been by the public, i.e. as a natural component of public life and a legitirnate expression of its hetero- geneity. At the same time, no restrictions should be placed on the creation of new civic movements, including independent trade unions, associations, and clubs. 4. An end to all forms of political manipulation of the mass media and cultural activity of all kinds, including the abolition of covert censorship, whether preliminary or subsequent, and their opening up to free debate; the legalisation of media autonomous of the official structures; 5. Respect for the just demands of the all religious believers; JUST A FEW SENTENCES 6. That all impending and existing projects perma- nently altering our country's natural environment and thereby affecting the life of future generations, be submitted forthwith to experts and the general public for thorough discussion. 7. The initiation of a free discussion not only about the nineteen-fifties, but also about the Prague Spring, the invasion by the five Warsaw Pact states and the subsequent "normalisation". It is regrettable that whereas in certain countries whose armies inter- vened at that time in Czechoslovak developments real discussions are beginning to take place, in our · country it is still a major taboo, solely in order to protect the positions of those people in the political and state leadership who are responsible for the twenty years' decline in all spheres of life in this country. AU those who agree with this statement may indi- cate their support by adding their signatures. We call on the government not to treat this state- ment in the way it has been accustomed to treat uncongenial views in the past. Otherwise they will inflict a fatal blow to the hopes that motivate us: the hopes of a genuine social dialogue as the only possi- ble way out of the blind alley in which Czechoslova- kia now finds itself. The statement Just a Few Sentences was made public simultaneously in Czechoslovakia and abroad on 29th June 1989. lt was published with the followed afterword: "This statement, which recently originated in Prague and is permanently open to further signatures by all Czecho- slovak citizens irrespective of occupation, has been signed as of today (29.6.1989) by almost 1800 Czechoslovak citizens. 17 [pageend19]TESTING GROUND On 29th June this statement was submitted to the Czecho- slovak News Agen~y (ČTK), as weU as other agencies and the mass media. Signatures can be handed or sent to existing signatories or to the following addresses: Václav Havel TESTING GROUND Whereas in their various ways (and with all sorts of understandable difficulties) Poland, Hungary and the USSR are trying to transforrµ a communist-style totalitarian system into something more democratic, the Czechoslovak leadership is resisting this trend tooth and nail. Admittedly it, too, vehemently pro- fesses "perestroika" and "democratisation". The fact is, however, that it is changing nothing, or counte- nancing only minorchanges-forced on it, moreover, by pressure "from below". As a policy it quite under- standable, to say the least. This leadership was in- stalled by Brezhnev's tanks. Anti-reformism became its ideological justification and the buttressing of the totalitarian system its daily practice. Naturally they have no wish to change this all of a sudden for fear that they rnight saw through the branch they are sitting on. Though long decimated, silenced and fragmented, society is slowly beginning to lose patience. Aroused by what is happening in the neighbouring countries and disgusted at the governmenťs inability to solve the mounting problems, it is beginning to arouse itself. People are showing increasing interest in pub- 18 Stanislav Devátý, Revoluční 312/1285, 760 01 Gottwaldov Václav Havel, Engelsovo nábřež í 78, 120 00:Prague 2 Jiří Křižan '. Navrátilova 16, li O 00 Prague 1 Saša Vondra, Trojanova 1, 120 00 Prague 2 lic aff airs, seeking out truthful information and losing their fear of speaking their minds. As a result, even the "dissidents" -i.e. people involved in the indepen- dent initiatives (of which the oldest and best known is Charter 77) who are prepared to express them- selves freely regardless of the persona! consequences - are ceasing to be just some kind of isolated handful of suicidal maniacs who might enjoy the tacit admi- ration of the public but could not expect any visible help from it, as was for years the case. As fear of the state police has dwindled so has fear of dissidents. The spontaneous independent demonstrations in August, October and December of 1988 and the subsequent January demonstrations in 1989 and ev- erything that has ensued since provides clear evi- dence of this movement. When I heard huge crowds with my own ears shouting "Long live the Charter!" or "The Charter will win!", and when later, after my retum from four months in prison, I saw a video of throngs of young people shouting "Release Havel!" I felt the most extraordinary mixture of emotions: alongside my deep emotion and astonishment I also felt a kind of satisfaction. I suddenly realised that the [pageend20]years of onerous efforts by the "suicidal maniacs" in question, efforts which had cost them many dozens of years in prison, had not been in vain after all, and were at last beginning to pay off. It was not solely as a sign of respect for the Charter's years of efforts that the slogan '.'Long live the Charter!" pleased me. It was above al! because it expressed an ever deeper yeaming for freedom that uses the Charter as a sym- bol that makes a good slogan and one that leaves no one in any doubt about the attachment to freedom of those who shout it. Another big change is the fact that for the first time in twenty years thousands of well- known artists, performers and academics employed in the official structures and therefore having every reason to be cautious have found the courage to speak out publicly. Not only did they protest against the actions of the police in January, they actually signed their protests jointly with those feared "dissidents" who for years had been slandered by the state. For the time being this social awakening has cul- minated in the statement entitled Just a F ew Senten- ces. This is no longer a mere defence of society against a specific case of tyranny, but instead a pos- itive political statement on the part of society. lts signatories warn the govemment that the only way out of the blind alley in which Czechoslovakia finds itself today - and indeed the pre-condition for any democratising changes in the system - is to effect a fundamental alteration of the social climate. In the words of the statement, it is necessary to restore to it "the spi rit of freedom, trust, tolerance and plurality". The statement puts forward a number of sirnple de- mands that are easily fulfilled but which would foster such a climate. The statement bases itself on the entirely logical argument that if changes in the sys- TESTING GROUND tem are not to be temporary, piece-meal, inconse- quential or half-baked, they must first of all be dis- cussed in a businesslike manner and conditions must be created to enable such a businesslike discussion to take place. Just a Few Sentences has already been signed by thousands of people, from well-known actors to un- known workers, from representatives of independent initiatives to rank-and-file communists, from catho- lics to former communist leaders. The collection of signatures is continuing throughout the republic in spite of an extremely speedy and violent rebuff on the part of the regime which, according to its twisted Stalinist logic, has dubbed this peaceable call to dialogue "an attempt at confrontation". For the moment no one knows what will happen next. Perhaps this regime which has decided on con- frontation will unleash a fresh wave of repression in an attempt to intirnidate society once more (which, however, it will have increasing trouble in doing). Maybe it is just its initial terror-stricken emotive reaction and common sense will eventually prevail even within its ranks so that there will be hopes at last that Czechoslovakia also will take the path of a free nation-wide debate leading to reform. Anything is possible at this particular moment in tirne. Never in the past twenty years has the situation been as wide open as now. I am not writing this as a juicy titbit about some small insignificant country, but as someone who is aware that - whether we like it or not - for many different reasons (including geo-political considera- tions) what happens in this country invariably in- volves more than just ourselves. We are a country where, from the earliest tirnes, various European - 19 [pageend21]TESTING GROUND and most recently global - conflagrations have most frequently originated (but also ended!). Since time immemorial, we have been a crossroads for every spiritual and political current imaginable, where, in consequence, European history is both "ravelled" and "unravelled". We are a country where on more than one occasion the fate of many other countries was sealed or where their destiny was unwittingly foreshadowed. Maybe the same still applies. Maybe Czechoslo- vakia - without any real wish to - will once more hold the key to and determine the fate of the enor- mous movement we are witnessing in the Soviet bloc and with it the whole of Europe 's hopes for a better future. Maybe this small - and, to some eyes, unin- 20 teresting - country will once more become a "testing ground" where we shall find out what is really going on: whether the communist world sincerely wants to change its spots and give humanitarian values prior- ity over questions of power and prestige, as Gorbachev prornises - or whether, at this historical crossroads the aspiration for freedom and human <lignity will have to give way at the last rninute to the dubious ideal of a monolithic empire with its system of all-powerful satraps. And it is not inconceivable that the fate of Just a F ew Sentences will provide the first convincing clue as to how this test is proceeding. Written 3rd July 1989 for The Independent [pageend22]CHRONICLE OF EVENTS JANUARY Monday 2nd January In Document No. 1/89, Charter 77 announced that its new trio of spokespersons would be Tomáš Hradílek, Dana Němcová and Saša Vondra, taking over from Stanislav Devátý, Miloš Hájek and Bohumír Janát. Representatives of a number of independent initiatives: The Czech Children, the John Lennon Peace Club, the Independent Peace Association and the Community of Friends of the USA, informed the interior affairs department of the Prague 1 District National Committee that a brief ceremony of remembrance for Jan Palach was to be held at Wenceslas Square at 2 p.m. on 15th January 1989. (D 1) (A leaflet circulated in Prague from the beginning of January in which these initiatives urged people to take part in the ceremony of remembrance on 15th January and in a national pilgrimage to Palach's grave on 21st January. See also D 6) Friday 6th January The act of remembrance on Wenceslas Square was banned by order of the Interior Affairs Department of the Prague City Council. (See D 5) Sunday 8th January Charter 77 issued Document No. 2/89, "Horrifying incident in Michalovce", drawing the attention of the Czechoslovak public and the relevant government authorities to the case of 37-year-old agricultural engineer Jozef Babjak who died suddenly on 23rd December.1988, the day after he was wrongfully arrested by the police and subjected to hours of savage beating. The autopsy found interna! bleeding into the stomach, intestines and the right kidney and heart-failure as a result of ischemia. Monday 9th January Václav Havel issued a statement concerning an anonymous letter he had received that morning. Its author had informed him of his intention to immolate himself at Wenceslas Square on the eve of the anniversary of Jan Palach's death. Václav Havel's statement was broadcast by the foreign radio stations, Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and the BBC.

Houska, thereby confoming the ban on the ceremony of remembrance. (See C 6th January) Representatives of the independent initiatives issued an appeal for a national pilgrimage to Jan Palach's grave in Všetaty. (D 6) The mother of Jan Zajíc, the student who burned himself to death on 25th February 1969, appealed to the author of the anonymous letter about the planned self-immolation to change his mind: "You have no idea what a terrible blow it is for those who gave birth to you, saw you grow up, taught you love for your neighbour, built all their hnpes on you and then stood over the grave of all those dashed hopes with the words: I'll never, ever see you again." (See D 63) Czechoslovak police raided the studio of sculptor Olbram Zoubek and took away Jan Palacťs death mask. The sculptor was subjected to an hour-long interrogation, allegedly in connection with the intended self-immolation · of the author of the anonymous letters to Václav Havel and Dana Němcová. Charter 77 issued Document No.3/89, addressed to the Secretariat of the Federal Assembly and the office of the Czechoslovak Prime Minister in connection with the Boeing 747 disaster at Lockerbie, requesting the Czecho- slovak government to take measures to prevent the use of Czechoslovak-made Semtex explosives for terrorist operations. 22 [pageend24]CHRONICLE JANUARY Thursday 12th January In an article under the headline "It was sheer recklessness", the Communist Party daily Rudé právo presented the official line on the events of twenty years earlier and on Jan Palach's sacrifice.

(D 8) The Prague City Prosecutor issued a warning to Václav Havel under Article 2, Sect. 3 of the Law on Prosecution. The warning stated that Havel had been found to be "one of the persons who, during the second half of 1988, took part in the organisation in Prague and elsewhere of an illegal movement whose aim is to destabilise the state power," and that this activity "constitutes a criminal offence under Article 1 of the Penal Code". (See D 23) The Prague Masaryk Association issued a statement about the news of the intended self-immolation on the anniversary of Jan Palach's death.

For our nations, 1989 is starting as a year of hope. On 15th January, our hearts and our thoughts wil} be with the people of Czechoslovakia." Večerní Praha joined the press campaign against Charter 77 and the other independent initiatives with a diatribe entitled "Quo vadis, Charter!"

Niemczyk, had a meeting with Charter 77 spokesperson, Saša Vondra, and Charter 77 signatories Jiří Dienstbier, Václav Malý and Martin Palouš. The ninety-rninute conversation dealt chiefly with the question of human rights in Czechoslovakia, and cases of unjust imprisonment, specifically those of Ivan Jirous, Petr Cibulka, Eva Vidlařová and Independent Peace Association members Tomáš Dvořák and Hana Marvanová. Other topics discussed included the overall state of Czechoslovak society, the status of independent groups, the conclusions of the Vienna CSCE follow-up meeting, and the possibility of according Czechoslovakia most- favoured-nation status for a one-year trial period. 23 [pageend25][pageend26]CHRONICLE JANUARY Saturday 14th January Under the title "Their goals are irnrnoral" the daily Mladá fronta printed an article reflecting the attitude adopted by the official Soviet press agency TASS to the planned ceremony of remembrance in honour of Jan Palach. (D 12) Representatives of Polish-Czechoslovak Solidarity Miroslaw Jasinski, J. Pinior, Petr Pospíchal and Anna Šabatová issued a protest against the large-scale operation organised by the GDR State Police in Leipzig over the period 12th-14th January 1989. In the course of the operation, activists of three independent citizens' initiatives - the "Life Initiative Group", "Justice Working Group" and "Sign of Conciliation" - were arrested, charged and held on remand. The apparent motive was the public rally being planned for the aftemoon of 14th January in Leipzig by the GDR Civic Renewal Initiative to mark the seventieth anniversary of the assassination of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, and also to call attention to the violation of fundamental human rights in the GDR. Sunday 15th January Charter 77 drafted Document No.4/89 entitled "ln memory of Jan Palach" (D 13) which was intended to be read out by the actress and Charter 77 signatory Vlasta Chramostová at 2 p.m. at Wenceslas Square. The police operation against the ceremony of remembrance prevented her from doing so. (See below) According to eyewitnesses and foreign reporters, the police and members of the People 's Militia started closing the access streets around Wenceslas Square during the previous night and morning, so that by 1.30 in the aftemoon the square was entirely sealed off. But even though several representatives of the independent initiatives were arrested on their way to the square thereby preventing the peaceful ceremony of remembrance being held at the intended spot, a spontaneous demonstration took place at Wenceslas Square and in the surrounding streets, which was brutally dispersed by the police and People's Militia. (D 14; see also D 16-21 and following). According to Arielle Thedrel, the correspondent of the Parisian daily Le Figaro, two thousand police were deployed in operations against the demonstrators. Prague gave the impression of a city under siege and was tumed into an arena for a demonstration of police strength: truncheons, police dogs, water cannon, tear gas and even armoured personnel carriers. Jan Palach's sacrifice was also cornrnemorated in the Northem Bohernian town of Chomutov where a symbolic plaque bearing his name was fixed to the cemetery wall in the early hours of the moming. However, the chairman of the local council had banned any cerem ony of remembrance. Throughout the day, a force of 20-30 plain clothes and uniformed policemen carried out identity checks on anyone approaching the cemetery. None the less, a few young people managed to lay flowers and light candles near the wall in question, but they were irnrnediately arrested. The police then removed the plaque. In Chomutov itself at least fourteen persons were arrested but 25 [pageend27][pageend28]CHRONICLE JANUARY were released that evening after questioning. A number of Charter 77 signatories were arrested in other parts of the region. Monday 16th January Rudé právo printed a ČTK report which constituted the official version of Sunday's events at Wenceslas Square and in the neighbouring streets. (D 15) Two further eyewitnesses, M. Šašek and Jiří Hanzelka gave accounts of what had happened at Wenceslas Square the previous day. (D 16) Vlasta Chramostová and Libuše Šilhánová issued a protest statement about Sunday's events, addressed to the Czechoslovak govemment and Communist Party. (D 17; see also C 21st February) The Democratic Initiative group sent a letter to the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly, protesting at media comments about Jan Palach and at the savage police treatment of citizens trying to honour his memory. (D 18) The Czechoslovak independent initiatives thanked the Latvian People's Front for its telegram on the 20th anniversary of Palach 's death and paid tribute to its efforts to achieve democracy and the Latvian people 's right to self-deterrnination. They invited the Front to send representatives to Prague for direct talks. The letter was signed by representatives of Charter 77, the Committee for the Defence of the Unjustly Prosecuted (VONS), the Czechoslovak section of Czechoslovak-Polish Solidarity, the Community of Friends of the USA (SPUSA), the Czech Children, the Movement for Civil Liberties, the Czechoslovak Helsinki Committee and the John Lennon Peace Club. Protests against the brutal police treatment of demonstrators in Wenceslas Square were voiced by the entire world press, including the dailies of the Westem Communist Parties - even the French ť Humanité. A further spontaneous demonstration took place on Wenceslas Square during the aftemoon, provoked by a brutal police assault not only on a several representatives of independent initiatives who came to lay flowers at the St Wenceslas monument, but also on thousands of citizens who happened to be walking through the city centre at the time. (See D 20-21 and D 69) During and after the demonstration, the police arrested a number of citizens, particularly the representatives of the independent initiatives, including Václav Ha\;'el. (See D 21 & 23) Under the title: "Hait the troublemakers", the Prague evening paper Večerní Praha published an "open letter" reminiscent of the Stalinist campaigns of the fifties, in which "313 students, teachers and employees of the Pedagogical Faculty of Charles University" protested against aUeged "activities of the troublemakers who are banking on unrest, schisms and systematic provocation". (D 19) 27 [pageend29][pageend30]CHRONICLE JANUARY Tuesday 17th January Rudé právo published an article headed "The aim is clear: to stir up unrest. Exploitation of J. Palach 's tragic death". That article and the accompanying ČTK report were the official interpretation of the events at Wenceslas Square on 15th and 16th January. (D 20) Charter 77 issued its Document No. 5/89 addressed to the govemments of the states taking part in the Vienna CSCE meeting. The document reported and commented on the Prague events of the previous days, and concluded with a list of those representatives of the independent initiatives arrested. It was signed by Tomáš Hradílek, the only Charter spokesperson still at liberty. (D 21; see also D 39) Charter 77 Document No. 6/89 announced that the group of Charter 77 spokespersons and other Charter 77 activists would hold a hunger strike on 22nd January "in protest against the continued unlawful imprisonment of a number of Czechoslovak citizens for political and religious reasons, as well as in protest against the detention of representatives of Charter 77 and other independent initiatives, and of individua! citizens who wanted to pay a tloral tribute to the memory of Jan Palach on 15th and 16th January".

(D 34) The same issue included a piece under the title "The General Prosecutor's view" setting out the official "legal" interpretation of the Prague demonstrations, which were allegedly "inspired by a foreign ideo-subversive campaign and organised by interna! illegal structures" and hence "the organisers and instigators of the unpermitted demonstrations and similar pressure tactics, provoked with the aim of destabilising state power, pursued out of hostility to socialism and manipulated with the intention of undermining and destroying the political foundations of the Republic" must expect "vigorous penal sanctions". In a letter to the Czechoslovak Prime Minister, Cardinal Tomášek expressed his attitude to the events of the previous days, emphasising that the citizens' demonstrations had not been provoked by foreign radio stations but by the regime's shortcomings in preceding decades. (D 35; see also C 27th January) In a letter from Leningrad, signed by Valery Tyerekhov, the north-westem branch of the bemocratic Union voiced its solidarity with the independent initiatives in Czechoslovakia and its support for the Palach commem- orations at Wenceslas Square.

The January events and the Party leadership 's attitude to them was dealt with particularly in a passage published under the subheading "Who is seeking to undermine our perestroika? Why and how?". (D 58) Forty-two students at the Comenius Evangelical Theological Faculty sent members of the Federal Assembly a letter in which they protested against the unrestrained assaults by para-military units in October 1988 and January 1989, and also against the way these events were reported in the media. (D 59) At the same time, a notice was put up in the faculty appealing for concern and care for prisoners, and mentioning by name Petr Cibulka, Ivan Jirous and Eva Vidlařová. The daily newspaper of the Hungarian Patriotic National Front Magyar Nemzet published an article on "the political, economic and moral crisis" in the Eastern European countries. The article concluded that the only solution was a "division of power", citing the example of Poland and indirectly criticising not only the GDR but also Czechoslovakia, as a country "where a distinguished writer is persecuted and 'perestroika' is rejected out of hand". Sunday 12th February Six hundred and seventy specialists at seventy academic institutes, and in particular, branches of the Academy of Sciences in Prague, Brno and Bratislava, addressed a letter about the January events to the Czechoslovak Prime Minister, Ladislav Adamec, in which they spoke of the unwarranted intervention of police units against rallies in memory of Jan Palach and "the lack of scope to comment publicly on the leadership of our society and, if need be, criticise it", which is "one of the causes of the economic, social and political crisis in which our country finds itself'. In response to this petition, the Prague and Bratislava secret police started to tour the different institutes in search of its authors and organisers. 42 [pageend46]CHRONICLE FEBRUARY In a letter to the Communist Party General Secretary, Catholic writer and theologian Dr Josef Zvěřina emphatically rejected that part of Miloš Jakeš 's speech of 9th February, in which he had spoken of "illegal church structures" and "certain church leaders who exploit the religious feelings of the believers among aur citizens in an anti-socialist direction" (See D 58). He requested the leaders of the Comrnunist Party and State to "put an end to religious discrimination and insults" and thereby make it easier for believers to engage in "conscientious work for the benefit of our society". Monday 13th February British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe told the Czechoslovak deputy Foreign Minister Jaromír Obzina that the Czechoslovak authorities' actions violated the agreements reached at the CSCE talks in Vienna. According to a ministry spokesman, the Foreign Secretary chiefly expressed concem about gaoled dissidents, and in particular, Václav Havel. Tuesday 14th February The Presidium of the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly adopted an edict "in the interest of protecting public order" which raises the custodial penalty stipulated in Article 156a of the Pena! Code (obstructing a public official in the performance of his duty) from 6 months to one year. The same edict also considerably increases the penalties stipulated in Article 6 of the law on rnisdemeanours (No. 150/1969). In addition, a rider was adopted to that legislation whereby "anyone who drafts, or assists the drafting and dissernination of printed materials whose content harms the socialist state's concem for maintaining public order", comrnits a misdemeanour. This edict of the Presidium of the Federal Assembly, which came into farce on the day of its promulgation, represents a further restriction on free speech and freedom of assembly. (See C 15th and 17th February and D 62 and D 83) Wednesday 15th February A plenary session of the Czechoslovak Helsinki Committee (CzHC) endorsed the proposals submitted by members of the US Congress (see C 3rd February), the Czechoslovak Democratic lnitiative group (Demokratická iniciativa) and others, that the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize be awarded to Václav Havel. A special comrnittee, comprising Eva Kantůrková , Emanuel Mandler, Dana Němcová and Vlasta Chramostová, was set up to act as a clearing-house for statements of Czechoslovak citizens in support of Havel 's nomination. The CzHC also criticised the edict on public order adopted by the Presidium of the Federal Assembly on 14th February, on the grounds that it stepped up the repression of those who organise or take part in peaceful demonstrations. (See C 14th, 17th and 18th February and D 62) The CzHC urged members of the Federal Assembly to withhold ratification of the Presidium's edict and thereby annul it. (See also D 83) 43 [pageend47]FEBRUARY CHRONICLE The CzHC received from its Polish counterpart a copy of a letter to the Polish Prime Minister calling on him to request an explanation from the Czechoslovak govemment about the police interventions in Prague and Všetaty during the period 16th-21st January. As reported in Rudé právo the Czechoslovak Prosecutor General, J. Krupauer, announced that 55 persons would be brought to court in connection with the January events in Prague on charges of "riotous conduct, opposition to state power and attacks on public officials". Preliminary hearings had now taken place in 46 of the cases, and 17 of them (including that of Václav Havel) would be the subject of criminal proceedings. ''The procedures of the prosecution services", declared the Prosecutor General, "are entirely consistent with Czechoslovak judica- ture." Thursday 16th February The Czechoslovak citizens' petition about the events of 15th-21st January (see D 53) had gained a further 1266 signatures. A detailed report with a list of the latest signatories was sent to the Federal Assembly, the President, the Prime Minister and others. (D 60) The Movement for Civil Libertíes issued a statement entitled "Paths to democracy in the wake of the January events". (D 61) The Intemational Association for the Defence of Persecuted Artists (AIDA) called for the immediate release of Václav Havel. In a statement, it declared that in the light of the progress made in the human rights field in other Warsaw Pact countries, Czechoslovakia risked finding itself isolated as a result of the arbitrary imprisonment of defenders of civil liberties. AIDA's members include the writer Siegfried Lenz, the theatre directors Ariane Mnouchkine and Patrice Chereau, the actors Yves Montand and Michel Piccoli, and the film director Ingmar Bergman. The Serbian PEN Club sent a letter to the Czechoslovak Writers' Union protesting against the arrest of Václav Havel and other Czechoslovak writers, artists and intellectuals, and expressing solidarity with the detainees. Friday 17th February The presidia of the Czech and Slovak National Councils approved and promulgated edicts conceming offences against measures to reinforce public order. The purpose of these riders to the edicts adopted by the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly on 14th February, was confirmed in a Rudé právo commentary on 18th February: ''The need for these new legal provisions arose out of the recent operations of anti-socialist groups, which had stepped up their disruptions of public order and citizens' safety in the centre of Prague. The public response in the media 44 [pageend48]CHRONICLE FEBRUARY and at workplaces to those acts of incitement is incontestable evidence that the overwhelming majority of citizens disagrees with them and demands the adoption of the most effective measures to reinforce public order." A petition by 551 Czechoslovak citizens was published demanding the release of Eva Vidlařová, actress and stage manager with Brno's "Theatre on a String", held on remand since 19th December 1988 because of her activity as a member of the Committee for the Defence of Petr Cibulka, Dušan Skála a Jiří Štencl. Eva Vidlařová was originally charged with the offence of abetment, which she allegedly committed by organising protests in the form of hunger strikes and petitions, and "influencing witnesses". Her charge was subsequently altered to one of obstructing the enforcement of an official decision, an offence carrying a maximum sentence of five years' imprisonment. Her request for release from custody was refused on 1st February. (See C 9th March) Saturday 18th February Nine Czechoslovak independent initiatives sent a letter to governments of the Helsinki signatory states "and to friends at home and abroad", in which, inter alia, they drew attention to the repressive legal edicts adopted by the Presidium of the Federal Assembly. (D 62; see also C 14th, 15th and 17th February and D 83) The Czechoslovak Helsinki Committee (CzHC) wrote to the Federal Assembly setting out its attitude to the legal measures to protect public order adopted by the Assembly's Presidium on 14th February. The CzHC expressed its belief that these measures were contrary to the spirit and letter of the Helsinki agreements; they served to step up repression instead of assisting a political solution to social problems. Sunday 19th February Charter 77 issued its document No.15/89 headed "Reflections on Jan Zajíc's sacrifice" to mark the forthcoming 20th anniversary of Jan Zajíc's self-immolation. (D 63) Monday 20th February According to a report issued by the independent East European Information Agency (VIA) a standing inter-de- partrnental commission had been created within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Headed by a deputy to the Minister, its purpose was to organise campaigns of disinformation against the independent initiatives. Although intended chiefly for foreign consumption, some of its material was also likely to be used in Czechoslovakia. The commission was to remain permanent session. In a letter to Václav Havel, Slovak author Ivan Hoffmann, one of the publishers of the independent magazine Fragment-K, explained the Jack of solidarity from the Slovak cultural community and sharply criticised the cultural situation in his country. (D 64) 45 [pageend49]FEBRUARY CHRONICLE Tuesday 21st February Following a trial conducted by magistrate Helena Hlavatá, the Prague 3 District Court sentenced Václav Havel to nine months' unconditional imprisonment in the second (i.e. harsher) penal category. He was found guilty on the two counts on which he was charged, i.e. incitement, which he was alleged to have committed by inviting people via foreign radio stations to take part in the ceremony of remembrance in Wenceslas Square on 15th January, to mark the anniversary of Jan Palach's self-immolation; and obstruction ()fa public official in the performance of his duty, that he was supposed to have committed at Wenceslas Square on 16th J anuary by failing to heed a police order to leave the area. Václav Havel immediately lodged an appeal against his conviction. The Prosecutor asked for leave to consider. Václav Havel made a concluding statement before the verdict was delivered. (D 66) The trial of Václav Havel was attended by three of his relations; the rest of the public (200-300 persons) were present in the court house or stood outside the building. (D 65) Also admitted to the court proceedings were press correspondents from TASS, Associated Press, Rudé právo and Czechoslovak Radio. However, the magistrate banned all note-taking. The parallel trial of Jana Petrová et al., which opened the same day, was attended by the correspondents of Reuter and Voice of Arnerica. Other agencies, viz. Agence France Press, the Hungarian Press Agency and the New China News Agency were refused permission to attend the trial proceedings. Apart from joumalists, the two trials also attracted observers from a number of foreign and intemational organisations, including the Intemational Helsinki Federation for Human Rights, the Fédération Intemationale des Droits de l'Homme (FIDH), the Swedish PEN-Club, the Swedish Writers' Union, the British peace campaign END, and the British civil liberties organisation Charter 88. None of them was adrnitted to the courtroom. Only the FIDH representatives managed to gain entry, but they were ejected two hours later. Legal proceedings were initiated against Charter 77 spokesman Tomáš Hradílek on charges of incitement and damaging state interests abroad. He was alleged to have committed the offences on 17th January when he sent Party and State authorities a statement condernning police operations against demonstrators in Prague, and on 1 st February, when he sent an open letter to the Communist Party General Secretary reacting to an interview given by Miloš Jakeš to West German television. On 22nd February, Tomáš Hradílek was arrested and his home was searched in his absence. After questioning him for several hours, the interrogator made an application for him to be taken into custody. The application was turned down by the Prosecutor and Tomáš Hradílek was released, although charges against him were not dropped. This was the first occasion in the history of Charter 77 that all three spokespersons faced legal proceedings at one and the same time. (See also C 8th March) Police interrogator Captain Špirk initiated legal proceedings against former Charter 77 spokesperson Libuše Šilhánová, and the actress Vlasta Chramostová, also a Charter signatory, on charges of approving of a criminal act and assaulting "a state official" and "the official of a public organisation". The alleged grounds for these 46 [pageend50]CHRONICLE FEBRUARY charges were that on 16th January, Šilhánová a Charamostová had written and dispatched to party and state authorities a letter "which expressed support for an officially-banned mass demonstration by illegal structures, organised at Wenceslas Square during the afternoon of 15th January", and "falsely accused state and party authorities of abusing their prerogative, and blatantly violating civil rights and citizens' freedoms". (See D 17) Both women were released pending trial. (See also C 20th March) Catholic activist from Brno, Dr Radomír Malý, wrote to the Czechoslovak ProsecutorGeneral protesting against Václav Havel 's conviction and requesting him to annul the verdict. Failing this, he asked to be indicted also, as he was responsible for actions similar to those for which Václav Havel was prosecuted and convicted. (D 67) A demonstration in protest against the trial of Václav Havel took place at 3 p.m. at the Main Square in Krakow, organised by the Confederation for an Independent Poland. The march was headed by the Czechoslovak state flag and demonstrators carried banners with the slogan "Release Václav Havel" as well as the names of the organisations involved and of the independent trade union Solidarity. The Committee to Norninate Václav Havel for the Nobel Peace Prize made public a letter from a group of citizens - chiefly working people from the Klatovy area - who were among the first to support the nornination. (D 68; see also D 71) Wednesday 22nd February At the Prague 2 District Court, it was the second and final day in the trial of Jana Petrová, member of the lndependent Peace Association, Ota Veverka, Charter 77 signatory and member of the John Lennon Peace Club and the Community of Friends of USA (SPUSA), Dana Němcová, Charter 77 spokesperson, David Němec, Charter 77 signatory, Jana Sternová, former Charter 77 spokesperson, Petr Placák, a representative of the Czech Children group, Stanislav Penc Jr., a member of the John Lennon Peace Club, and Dr Saša Vondra, Charter 77 spokesperson. Ail the defendants in the case were arrested on 16th January. Since then, Jana Petrová and Ota Veverka had been kept in custody, while the others were released on 24th January pending trial. At the opening of the trial, Dana Němcová was comrnitted to a separate hearing, as she was still receiving in-patient hospital treatrnent for a back condition aggravated by the conditions of her arrest on 16th January. Unlike the trial of Václav Havel, normal judicial procedures at these hearings were continually infringed. The magistrate for Prague 2, Dr Antonín Těšík, misrecorded the proceedings and twisted witnesses' statements, directing that they be so recorded. He also led witnesses to make statements detrimental to the def endants. He repeatedly denied counsel perrnission to speak, refused to correct the record, ejected Ota Veverka 's mother from the court merely for making an "unseemly" face, etc. Only one relative per defendant was allowed to attend the proceedings. The judge overruled a defence application to call Václav Havel as a witness. 47 [pageend51]FEBRUARY CHRONICLE The court found Jana Petrová, Ota Veverka, David Němec and Jana Sternová guilty of riotous conduct for having laid, or attempting to lay flowers by the St Wenceslas monument on 16th January, and thereby causing a riot. Jana Petrová and Ota Veverka were also found guilty of assaulting a public official by allegedly swearing at policemen. The following sentences were imposed: Jana Petrová: 9 months' unconditional imprisonment in the first corrective category; Ota Veverka: 12 months' unconditional imprisonment in the second corrective category ( this being his second conviction); David Němec: 6 months' imprisonment, suspended for three years, and a fine of 4,000 Crowns; and Jana Sternová: 4 months' imprisonment, suspended for one year. (D 69) The other three defendants - Saša Vondra, Petr Placák and Stanislav Penc - were found not guilty as charged, but instead guilty of a misdemeanour against public order and each sentenced accordingly to a two months' imprisonment suspended for two years, and a fine of 2,500 Crowns. Jana Petrová and the Prosecutor immediately lodged appeals. The other defendants applied for leave to consider. Ota Veverka's application for release from custody pending appeal was overruled by the trial magistrate. (At the appeal hearing on 4th April, the Prague Municipal Court upheld the verdicts. The cases were dealt with in a purely formal manner and the court ignored the objections of defendants and defence counsel. Presiding Judge Dr Jan Rojt apparently fell asleep during the hearing. On 19th June, Jana Petrová was conditionally released by the Chomutov Regional Court after serving half her sentence.) Agroup of French intellectuals signed a petition describing the conviction of Václav Havel as a scandalous attack on democratic rights and demanding "his immediate release, the quashing of the verdict, and the cancelling of criminal proceedings against all those in Czechoslovakia facing prosecution for voicing their beliefs". The first fifty signatures were already available only hours after the verdict on Václav Havel and the collection of signatures continued throughout that night. Signatories included deputies to the National Assembly, writers, journalists, actors, lawyers, activists ofthe Human Rights League, members ofthe organisation "SOS Racisme", Socialist and Communist politicians, etc. Thursday 23rd February Rudé právo published a lengthy article under the headline "Who is Václav Havel?" whose very title and content directly recalled the slander campaign against Václav Havel and Charter 77 which was initiated in the press at the start of 1977 and revived on several occasions since - most recently in connection with the January demonstrations. (See D 10) Continuing in the same vein, this latest article in the Communist Party daily sought to discredit Václav Havel chiefly by means of insinuations about the activities of his family - particularly his father Václav and uncle Miloš (proprietor of Lucerna-film and the Barrandov Film Studios) - during the Nazi occupation. (See D 32 and D 73) Another article mentioned - for the first time in the Czechoslovak official press - the titles of a number of Václav Havel 's writings, including Anatomy of a Reticence, Politics and Conscience, Long-distance interrogation, etc. 48 [pageend52]CHRONICLE FEBRUARY Charter 77 signatory František Stárek, a joint publisher of the independent magazine Vokno, was arrested in the Eastem Bohemian town of Česká 1řebová, where he is employed as a boilerman. During a search of his home, police took away various items of equipment, including a typewriter, computer, duplicator, cameras, and tape recorder, as well as books, joumals, photos, manuscripts, and the magazine's library and archive. In 1982, František Stárek was prosecuted for his activity in the field of non-conformist cul ture and sentenced to 32 months' imprisonment. On this occasion, he was first summonsed for a public order misdemeanour but this was then altered to a criminal charge of incitement. (On 3rd April, František Stárek's common-law wife Iva Vojtková was charged as an accessory to incitement. On 26th June, the Ústí nad Orlicí Regional Court sentenced František Stárek to 32 months' imprisonment in the 2nd corrective category. It also ordered the sequestration of the confiscated materials and imposed a two year period of protective surveillance following completion of sentence. Iva Vojtková was also found guilty as charged and sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment, suspended for two years.) The Association of Slovak Writers and Artists Abroad issued a declaration condemning the verdict on Václav Havel and all convictions of citizens for exercising their rights since the demonstration of Bratislava catholics of 25th March 1988. (D 70) The Committee to Nominate Václav Havel for the Nobel Peace Prize announced that it had received further expressions of support-from citizens in Benátky nad Jizerou, Kropáčova Vrutice and Prague. (D 71) Friday 24th February Among the many reactions to Václav Havel 's conviction in the world press, the Viennese daily Kurier published an article by the President of the Intemational Helsinki Federation for Human Rights, Karl Johannes von Schwarzenberg, entitled "Not just a crime - an act of folly". (D 72) Charter 77 issued its Document No.17 /89: "Statement on the case of British writer Salman Rushdie", condemning as an act of state terrorism the "death sentence" passed on the British author by Ayatollah Khomeini and other Iranian leaders. In a letter to Mikhail Gorbachev, the Czechoslovak Democratic Initiative called on the Soviet leader to "act as the leading proponent of a democratic reform programme also in relations with Czechoslovakia, and speak out in defence of Václav Havel and other persons wrongfully imprisoned". The letter was signed by Bohumil Doležal, Martin Litomiský, Emanuel Mandler, Ilja Storoženko, M. Svoboda, Karel Štindl, Eva Štolbová and S. Trávníček. 49 [pageend53]FEBRUARY CHRONICLE Saturday 25th February National Theatre player Josef Kemr sent a letter to Rudé právo responding to its article of 23rd February, "Who is Václav Havel?" in which he offered his persona! reminiscence to offset the slanders about the writer's uncle Miloš Havel. (D 73) Severa! hundred people demonstrated outside the Czechoslovak Embassy in Ottawa against the police violence during the January demonstrations in Prague and the prosecution of many of those who took part in them. Canadian MP D. Kirgol declared that the Prague regime was crudely violating the pledges it had made when it signed the Concluding Document of the CSCE follow-up meeting in Vienna. The Polish section of the PEN Club sent a telegram to President Husák appealing for the release of Václav Havel and expressing grave disquiet over the fate of "an illustrious colleague". The Warsaw theatre Teatr Powszechny gave a revived premiere of Václav Havel's one-act plays Audience and Protest attended by Polish Prime Minister Rakowski and Solidarity leaders Bronislaw Geremek and Adam Michnik. At the end of the performance, Adam Michnik addressed the audience. Sunday 26th February Charter 77 issued its Document No. 18/89, supporting the nomination of Václav Havel for the Nobel Peace Prize. Arguing that peace was not a matter solely for governments and politicians, but also for citizens, and that it was therefore inseparably linked with efforts to win respect for human rights, "the Nobel Prize ought to be awarded above all to those who - outside the bounds of their own profession, and often at great persona! risk - contribute towards the goal of achieving greater justice and human <lignity on the planet". Monday 27th February Charter 77 signatory and one-time spokesman Jiří Dienstbier sent a letter to representatives of independent initiatives in Europe and the USA proposing the nomination of Václav Havel for the Nobel Peace Prize. (D 74) Tuesday 28th February In its Document No. 19/89, Charter 77 thanked the organisers of a demonstration called for 2nd March in Budapest to protest against the imprisonment of Václav Havel and other Czechoslovak activists. Asking them to support Václav Havel 's nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize, it recalled the names of some other political prisoners and stressed that solidarity with the unjustly convicted was important in practical as well as moral terms. (D 75) Olga Havlová also sent a message of thanks and greetings to the Budapest demonstration. (See C 2nd March) 50 [pageend54]CHRONICLE MARCH Slovak writer ť.ubomír Feldek protested against the conviction of Václav Havel and requested that his statement be appended to the minutes of that day 's Prague session of the Committee of the Czechoslovak Writers' Union. (O 76) End February The newly-founded Peace Activists Defence Committee sent a statement of its aims to the Czechoslovak state leadership, the Czechoslovak Peace Comrnittee, Cardinal Tomášek and the media. (D 77) MARCH Wednesday 1st March In its Document No.20/89, Charter 77 reported on a meeting between eight representatives of the unofficial initiatives and the Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen who was on an official visit to Czechoslovakia. During lunch at the Embassy, the Minister informed his guests of the official protest tabled by the Danish Government against the actions of the Czechoslovak police in January and the subsequent trials. The Czecho- slovak guests spoke about the overall situation in the country, the activity of the independent movement and individua! cases of political imprisonment. The talks lasted two hours and were the first contact made with independent groups in Czechoslovakia by official representatives of the Kingdom of Denmark. On behalf of the Czechoslovak section of Polish-Czechoslovak Solidarity, Petr Pospíchal and Anna Šabatová joined with Charter spokesman Saša Vondra in sending a message of solidarity to members of the Polish "Freedom and Peace" movement then holding a hunger-strike in Sopot to protest against discrirninatory practices in the allocation of travel documents in Poland. In their letter they stressed that the Polish government was "duty-bound to respect the provisions of the Intemational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, guaranteeing freedom to leave a country and retum to it", and that this applied to "governments of all states that endorsed that Covenant, including the govemment of Czechoslovakia". Nonetheless, the authors declared, sirnilar discrirni- natory practices also existed in Czechoslovakia. The Czechoslovak Communist Party weekly Tribuna continued its campaign of defamation against Václav Havel in an article entitled, "What Václav Havel is 'fighting' for". After repeating the usual slanders about Václav Havel's family (see D 10, D 32, C 23rd February and D 73) the article concentrated on his social commitment, interpreting it in the spirit of the Stalinist notions of the nineteen-fifties whereby all critically-minded represen- tatives of Czechoslovak culture - in this case Václav Černý, Bedřich Fučík, Václav Havel, etc. - are simply agents of foreign interests as part of an intemational anti-communist conspiracy. 51 [pageend55]MARCH CHRONICLE Thursday 2nd March In its Document No. 21/89, Charter 77 alerted the President of the Republic to the "grave circumstances damaging both relations within our society and the interests of our Republic abroad", namely, the regime 's aggressive and provocative handling of January's peaceful ceremony in memory of Jan Palach at Wenceslas Square and the subsequent trials and convictions of Václav Havel and seven other citizens in February. (D 78) In Budapest, some 1500 people took part in a demonstration in solidarity with Václav Havel and other Czechoslovak political prisoners. Four hundred demonstrators immediately signed a petition supporting the proposal for Václav Havel to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. (See C 28th February a D 75) Saturday 4th March Ata congress of the European Women's Union (Unione Europea Femrninile), organised in Rome from 1st to 4th March by the Italian Christian Democrats, the Intemational Milada Horáková Committee was set up to assist women persecuted by the present Czechoslovak regime. Sunday 5th March Twenty Soviet and German writers and academics signed a declaration expressing grave concem about the imprisonment of Václav Havel. "We are firmly resolved to speak out loudly in defence of Václav Havel," the letter concludes, "because in doing so we also defend ourselves." (D 79) Monday 6th March A delegation of the Intemational Helsinki Federation (IHF), headed by its President, Karl Johannes von Schwarzenberg, visited Czechoslovakia but was unable to have talks with Czechoslovak leaders. In a letter to Premier Ladislav Adamec, the IHF President expressed disappointment and protested against escalating human rights violations in Czechoslovakia. (D 80) In its Document No. 1/1989, the Czechoslovak Social Defence Initiative condemned attempts by the Czech govemmenťs Secretariat for Church Affairs to manipulate candidates for theological studies. "The authorities are trying to create the impression that they do not interfere in any way in the process of selecting students for the theological faculty. In point of fact they exploit the adrnissions procedure in order to manipulate prospective clergy in an insidious and shameless fashion and make them comply to an alien political doctrine. Such compliance, however, must inevitably have damaging effects on their conscience." 52 [pageend56]CHRONICLE MARCH Tuesday 7th March The Paris-based Fédération internationale des droits de l 'Homme (Intemational Ruman Rights Federation - FIDH) which has consultative status with the UN and the European Council of UNESCO and whose members include the Czechoslovak Committee for the Defence of the Unjustly Prosecuted (VONS), published a special issue (No.291) of its week.ly Lettre about the trial of Václav Havel. The report of the trial was compiled by Roland Kessous, former prosecutor general at the Paris appeal court, who was mandated by FIDH to attend the trial. However, the Czechoslovak authorities prevented him from accomplishing his mission. According to a report in the Austrian daily Die Presse, the distinguished Austrian painter Max Weiler had cancelled all future exhibitions in Czechoslovakia. Following a successful exhibition in Brno, his pictures were dueto go on display in Bratislava from 5th March and in Prague from 20th April. However, as soon as he leamt from the press about the gaoling of Václav Havel and the others, the artist sent a telegram from Mexico - where he was setting up an exhibition - calling off the further showings. ["Iťs as if it happened to myself. They are our people and the only way they'll know we stand by them is by the way we react."] Wednesday 8th March Charter spokesperson Tomáš Hradílek, indicted on a charge of incitement and damaging the Republic 's interests abroad (See C 21st February) was informed of the outcome of the preliminary hearing. The hasty conclusion of the investigation was proof of the authorities' determination to bring him to trial by the end of March or beginning of April. (At the main hearing on 4th and 5th April, the Přerov district court found Tomáš Hradílek guilty of attempted incitement and attempting to damage the Republic's interests abroad, and sentenced him to 13 months imprisonment suspended for two years. In his final statement, the Charter 77 spokesperson denied the charge of hostility towards the Republic, which, he said, was levelled at anyone who criticised the Communist Party's monopoly of power now that it had lost its intellectual and moral authority and was unable to act as the vanguard of society. Both defendant and prosecutor appealed against the verdict. Some one hundred of Tomáš Hradílek's friends were present in the courthouse and the trial was also attended by representatives of the US and Canadian embassies. (At the appeal hearing on 19th May, the Ostrava Regional Court upheld the verdict.) Thursday 9th March The Jihlava district court found Martin Jirous and Jiří Tichý guilty of incitement, an offence they allegedly committed by drafting a petition holding the authorities responsible for the sudden death of 35-year-old political prisoner Pavel Wonka on 26th April 1988. Ivan Jirous was sentenced to sixteen months' imprisonment in the 2nd (harsher) corrective category, Jiří Tichý to six months' imprisonment in the 1st corrective category. Both defendants appealed against the verdicts. During the trial, which was openly political, the prosecution failed to 53 [pageend57]MARCH CHRONICLE refute the petition 's individua! allegations. The defendants acknowledged their authorship and asserted their right to express their views on past and current events. Present at the trial were representatives of the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights Jeri Laber, Gerald Nagler and Karl Johannes von Schwarzenberg, the official Committee of the Czechoslovak Public for Human Rights (Dr A. Klimeš), and Czechoslovak press and television. (On 24th April, the Brno Regional Court upheld the verdict.) The trial of Jaromír Němec and Pavel Dudr, indicted in September 1986 on charges of sedition, ended in Kroměříž (Moravia) after three days of hearings. The grounds for the prosecution was that in the 1980-85 period the two defendants had assembled and duplicated literature allegedly hostile to the state and socialist system and made them available to a large number of people. The publications in question included the samizdat Informace o Chartě 77 (Information on Charter 77) and Informace o církvi (Information on the Church) and the emigré joumals Listy and Svědectví, as well as individua! articles or books such as Karel Čapeťs essay, Why I' m Not a C ommunist, Alexander Solzhenitsyn 's Not living a lie, Václav Havel' s essays and plays, Jaroslav Seifert' s poetry, Bohumil Hrabal's fiction, and religious literature. The court found both defendants guilty as charged and sentenced Jaromír Němec to eighteen months' imprisonment suspended for three years, and Pavel Dudr to twelve months' imprisonment also suspended for three years. It was also ordered that both defendants should forfeit property confiscated from them, including typewriters, a duplicator, paper and other technical equipment. Friends of the accused were allowed to attend the trial without hindrance. (According to a Committee for the Defence of the Unjustly Prosecuted (VONS) report of 10th May, the sentence was confirmed when both the prosecutor and Pavel Dudr withdrew their appeals and Jaromír Němec failed to lodge an appeal in tirne.) The Brno Regional Court ordered the release of Eva Vidlařová from custody after she had spent almost three months on remand. However, she continued to face charges of frustrating the irnplementation of an official decision, on the grounds that she had allegedly interfered with the investigation of Petr Cibulka's "illegal activity". (See C 17th February) (On 5th April, the Brno Municipal Court found Eva Vidlařová innocent of charges, dueto lack of evidence. The verdict was confirmed by the Brno Regional Court on 2nd May.) Sunday 12th March Charter 77 issued its Document No. 22/89 in the form of a statement about the Danube hydraulic project addressed to the Czechoslovak Government, the Czech and Slovak rninistries of the interior and the environment and the group of experts from Czechoslovakia and six neighbouring states then meeting in Prague. The document called for the entire project and progress on its construction to be re-evaluated in the light of the the report subrnitted by the official ecological section of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences in January this year, "on the basis of negotiations within an international commission made up of supporters and opponents of the project assisted by experts from the three states concerned." In the Documenťs view, the relevant authorities should, in reaching 54 [pageend58]CHRONICLE MARCH a decision, "feel a sense of responsibility for the environment and future generations, instead of the megaloma- niacal, environmentally-harmful and destructive notions of yesteryear." The Charter 77 spokespersons, together with a group of Charter signatories and supporters, marked the twelfth anniversary of the death of Jan Patočka, one of Charter 77's founders, by laying flowers and a commemorative ribbon on his grave. The ceremony was observed by officers of the State Security. An hour Jater, only the flowers remained on the grave, the ribbon with Charter 77's name on it having been removed. Monday 13th March Charter 77 issued its Document No.23/89 "Another game with marked cards", highlighting provocative operations whereby certain citizens had received anonymous letters urging them to send donations of money to so-called "Social initiatives of democratic activists (SIDA)", and fill in their names and addresses on the enclosed payment slip. The bank account involved was actually that of a fund administered by the Ministry of Health to assist the fight against AIDS (SIDA in French). "However, if donations to assist the fight against AIDS may be sent anonymously, as the press informs us, it is tantamount to self-denunciation to write one's name on the envelope supplied," the Document stated. The Charter 77 spokespersons sent independent groups in Hungary a telegram on the occasion of celebrations to mark the restoration of the Hungarian National Holiday on 19th March. (See also C 19th March) · A worker at the TOS machine-tool factory in the Prague district of Hostivař was arrested at work for having drafted a petition protesting about the recent police violence. The petition, signed by 38 members of the official trade union was in response to a call for workers to sign an official petition condernning the actions of the independent groups. The author of the petition was released after being charged with incitement. Sirnilar incidents occurred in other Prague factories. (In a letter to the Comrnittee for the Defence of the Unjustly Prosecuted (VONS) dated 10th May, a group of 68 employees at the TOS plant in Hostivař, mostly manual workers, announced that they were collecting funds to assist the families of indicted activists, as an expression of their "solidarity with all those who are not indifferent to the fate of our nation".) Wednesday 15th March The Masaryk Association issued a statement to mark the 50th anniversary of the Nazi occupation of Czechoslo- vakia calling for the country to take the initiative in achieving a consistently humane solution to the remaining legacies of the Second World War: "The fiftieth anniversary of that fateful 15th March 1939 affords an opportunity to do so. And in view of the overall significance of Masaryk's work, including his attitude to the role of the German nation, we are duty-bound to do so." 55 [pageend59]MARCH CHRONICLE Rudé právo published most of a speech by Michal Černi'k, Chairman of the Czech Writers' Union, to a meeting of the union 's members, in which mention was made of the need to reintegrate certain "neglected" authors and works into official culture, according to the criteria of "Marxist-Leninist principles of socialist artistic creation". A petition originating in the Ostrava region was sent to the Federal Prime Minister at the beginning of February. Signed by 78 blue-collar workers, it voiced support for the Initiative of those who work in the arts (see D 44) and called for the release of Václav Havel and other political prisoners, as well as for an authentic dialogue between government and society. Copies of the petition had been sent, among others, to the regional daily newspaper Nová svoboda which tried to pillory the petition's organisers by publishing their names and full addresses. In fact this enabled many other citizens, mostly manual workers, to lend their support to the action. Thus, even though several sheets of signatures were confiscated, by 15th March the petition had been signed by a total of 272 persons. Thursday 16th March In Strasbourg, the European Parliament unanirnously adopted a resolution condernning the verdicts against Václav Havel and other Czechoslovak citizens as an action contravening the international agreements signed by the Czechoslovak government. The text of the resolution was tabled jointly by the Socialist, Christian Democrat, Liberal, Democratic Alliance and Communist parliamentary groups. (D 81) In Bonn, the Bundestag unanimously passed a resolution condemning the persecution of Czechoslovak human rights activists in general, and in particular the sentences passed on Václav Havel, Jana Petrová and others. The resolution was tabled jointly by the Christian Democrats, Social Democrats, Free Democrats and the Greens. (D 82) The State Security carried out a series ofhouse searches as part of an investigation into an alleged case of sedition "committed by a person or persons unknown" who drafted and distributed a petition by activists of the Community of Friends of the USA (SPUSA). The petition, signed by 430 citizens, which called for the release of political prisoners, respect for fundamental freedoms and the democratisation of society, was sent to the Federal Assembly on 31st December 1988. The name of Stanislav Devátý was given as guarantor for the signatures' authenticity. The offending petition had been used as an excuse to harass various independent initiatives, above all SPUSA, but also the editorial team of the new independent journal To and the student magazine Revue 88, resulting in extensive house searches in the Moravian towns of Brno and Znojmo, during which the prototype issue of Revue 88 was confiscated. The police also searched the home of former Charter 77 spokesperson Stanislav Devátý, who was arrested and charged with sedition, partly for having organised the above-mentioned petition, partly for having co-authored the letter sent by SPUSA on 2nd February to the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly (see D 54). Following his arrest, Stanislav Devátý commenced a hunger strike. (After a thirty-day hunger strike, Stanislav Devátý was 56 [pageend60]CHRONICLE MARCH released on the order the Brno regional prosecutor. However, he was subsequently arrested on suspicion of a public order misdemeanour during the May Day demonstration in Prague and detained on remand on 6th May and he again declared a hunger strike in protest. On 19th May, the Brno regional prosecutor upheld his appeal against the detention order and three days later he was transferred from the Thomayer Hospital in Prague to a hospital in Gottwaldov, although criminal charges against him were not dropped.) Police in Brno also carried out a house-search at the home of Charter 77 signatory Petr Pospíchal, who is also a member of Committee for the Defence of the Unjustly Prosecuted (VONS) and Polish-CzeclÍoslovak Solidarity (PČSS) . Petr Pospíchal was charged on 22nd January 1987 with subversion of the Republic because of his acti vity in PČSS and his involvement in the publication of Informace o Chartě 771 (lnformation on Charter 77). In spite of the fact that no action had been taken in his case since his release from custody in April 1988, Petr Pospíchal was none the less informed after the house-search that criminal charges against him were still pending and he was liable to be detained on remand once again since he was continuing his "illegal activity" of stocking independent publications. The charges against Petr Pospíchal were potentially the most serious of all recent politi cal prosecutions, since he could face a possible prison sentence of 3-1 O years if convicted. Friday 17th March After a two-day trial before the Prague 1 District Court, Independent Peace Association activists Hana Marvanová and Tomáš Dvořák were found guilty of attempted incitement. The grounds for Hana Marvanová's prosecution were that she collected and copied out materials of an alleged anti-socialist nature. Tomáš Dvořák was charged with having gathered allegedly anti-socialist materials and distributing a leaflet advertising a demonstration on 28th October 1988, the day of the (re-instituted) National Holiday. Both defendants were sentenced to ten months' imprisonment suspended for two and a half years. The prosecutor lodged an appeal against the verdict; the defendants made no application. Some eighty friends of the accused crowded into the courthouse, but only a few of them were admitted to the courtroom. The trial was also attended by representatives of the Czechoslovak Peace Committee, the Committee of the Czechoslovak Public for Ruman Rights, and journalists of the Czechoslovak press. (At the appeal hearing on 3rd May, the Prague Municipal Court confirmed the sentences. At the end of the proceedings, the two defendants were released after over six months in custody.) Sunday 19th March A general meeting of the Hungarian Union of Free Democrats thanked the Charter 77 spokespersons for their greetings on the Hungarian National Holiday and expressed support for the proposal to award Václav Havel the Nobel Peace Prize. It also protested against the verdicts passed on him and other activists, including Hana Marvanová and Tomáš Dvořák, as well as against the forthcoming trial of Eva Vidlařová and the arrest of Stanislav Devátý. 57 [pageend61]MARCH CHRONICLE Monday 20th March Eight independent initiatives sent a letter to members of the Federal Assembly calling on them not to ratify the legal measures adopted by the Assembly 's Presidium on 14th February, which would effectively cancel them. (D 83; see also C 14th, 15th, 17th and 18th February and D 62) A group of 236 Czechoslovak citizens sent a letter to Comrnunist Party General Secretary Miloš Jakeš, Federal Prime Minister Ladislav Adamec, police investigator Captain Špirk and the public prosecutor for Prague 1, ex.pressing their "endorsement of citizens' participation in the banned ceremony of remembrance which the independent groups sought to organise at Wenceslas Square in the aftemoon of 15th January 1989". According to the letter's signatories, in suppressing the event "the state authorities and party bodies abused their authority and flagrantly violated citizens' rights and civil liberties". The letter's signatories also voiced their solidarity with Libuše Šilhánová and Vlasta Chramostová. Since they had done the very same things for which those two activists had been indicted on a charge of "assaulting astate official" (see D 17 and C 21st February), they too should be charged with the offence in accordance with the constitutional principie of equality before the law; if not, charges against Libuše Šilhánová and Vlasta Chramostová should be dropped. (On 1 Oth April, the Prague 2 District Court sentenced Libuše Šilhánová and Vlasta Chramostová to three months' irnprisonment suspended for one year. Their concluding statements to the court were greeted with applause from the public in the courtroom. At the appeal hearing on 26th May, the Prague Municipal Court confirmed the sentences.) Tuesday 21st March During the 13th joint meeting of the two chambers of the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly, Parliamentary Deputy V. Štáfek intervened in the debate on the Foreign Minister's report, and in connection with the alleged "broad anti-Czechoslovak campaign" being waged by the West in the wake of the Vienna CSCE meeting Czechoslovak independent activists as traitors and Václav Havel as a provocateur and an enemy of socialism. In the case of Václav Havel, a panel of judges at the Prague Municipal Court, Dr Novotný (Chairman), Dr Buriánková and Dr Korbař, considered the appeals lodged by the prosecutor, the defendant and the defendanťs relations. The prosecutor Dr I. Salač demanded a higher prison sentence and the imposition of a substantial financial penalty, while Václav Havel and his relatives called for an acquittal. The Municipal Court overtumed the verdict of the Prague 3 District Court (see C 21st February, D 65 and D 66>". As at the earlier hearing Václav Havel was found guilty of incitement, but his presence at Wenceslas Square on 16th January was no longer found to constitute the offence of obstructing a public official in the performance of his duty, but instead a public order misdemeanour. In addition, the original sentence of nine months' irnprisonment was reduced slightly to eight, and under a less severe penal regirne. In his concluding statement, Václav Havel pointed out that he had been convicted solely for the views he held - and which he did not conceal - and he appealed to the judges to 58 [pageend62]CHRONICLE MARCH demonstrate in a practical way their proclaimed independence. (D 84) The decision of the court was final. A part from closest relatives, the hearing was attended by representatives of the Czechoslovak media, the TASS press agency, the Hungarian news agency MTI, the ltalian ANSA and the lnternational Helsinki Federation for Human Rights. Several hundred citizens demonstrated their solidarity with Václav Havel by thronging the courthouse. (D 85) On the same day, several thousand citizens of different religious persuasions and none answered the call of the independent initiatives to express their solidarity with Václav Havel and other political prisoners by attending church services that evening. Same two hundred people observed a 24-hour hunger strike in protest against Václav Havel 's conviction. (Pressure at home and abroad led to Václav Havel 's conditional release from prison on 17th May on a decision of the Prague 4 District Court after he had served half of his sentence; the rest of his sentence was deferred for a probationary period of 18 months.) Friday 24th March The Vyškov District Court sentenced Dušan Skála (35), Charter 77 signatory, Community of Friends of USA member and publisher of the literary journal Host, to fifteen months' imprisonment suspended for four years after he was found guilty of conspiracy to commit incitement. Dušan Skála was held in custody from 27th October to 22nd December 1988, before being released pending trial, for attempting to duplicate the independent bulletin Informace o Chartě 77 (lnformation on Charter 77) and keeping a collection of the independent Prague monthly Lidové noviny. (At an appeal hearing on 27th April, his sentence was reduced to one year's irnprisonment suspended for two years). Human rights activist Jaroslav Popelka (33) from Brno was arrested and charged with a public order rnisdemean- our for having distributed leaflets advertising a demonstration at which a debate would take place on the departure of the Communist Party leadership and the creation of a "green party". Jaroslav Popelka was convicted on several previous occasions for leaflet campaigns, most recently on 22nd December 1988. He had been released from prison on 24th January 1989. (On 4th April, he was sentenced by the Brno Municipal Court to four months' imprisonment in the first corrective category. At an appeal hearing on 27th April the sentence was confirmed.) Sunday 27th March Charter 77 issued its Document No.24/89 addressed to independent groups in Paland, thanking them for their expressions of solidarity with persecuted human rights activists in Czechoslovakia and voicing its opinion that "the activity of independent groups is becoming a substitute for control mechanisms, including the free expression of public opinion which are an essential component of every democratic political system," and that "in Paland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, the Soviet Union, the GDR and elsewhere, these groups are playing a major role in democratising the public life of our countries". 59 [pageend63]MARCH CHRONICLE Monday 28th March Charter 77 issued its Document No. 25/89 dealing with the educational system. Recalling that it had already highlighted in previous documents the overall negative state of Czechoslovak education as well as various specific problems, it emphasised that the critical situation that now existed was the outcome of a series of half-baked reforms at a time of growing dehumanisation, ideologisation and bureaucratisation in education. At the same time, it argued, current concepts of education and schooling were undemocratic since they failed to respect not only "the natural structures of human society" but failed even to fulfil the basic conditions that would allow young people and all citizens to form their own picture of the world. Many practices were at total variance with different intemational agreements. It was therefore necessary to initiate a public debate about education and the educational system and an open and unprejudiced exchange of views, particularly in light of the fact that by signing the Concluding Document of the CSCE meeting in Vienna, Czechoslovakia had pledged among other things "to encourage in schools and other educational institutions consideration of the prom o ti on of human rights and fundamental freedoms". 60 [pageend64]D1-D2 DOCUMENTS AND TESTIMONIES Dl 2nd January 1989 From the representatives of independent citizens' initia- tives to the interior affairs department of the District National Committee for Prague l On 16th January 1969 Jan Palach, a 21-year-old student at the arts faculty of Charles University, burned hirnself to death at Wenceslas Square in Prague. Palach's sacrifice was regarded then as a supremely stirring deed, as an attempt by that young man to halt our nation's renuncia- tion of the ideals of freedom and democracy, and it is in that spirit that we recall it today.

At 2 p.m. on 15th January 1989, the eve ofthe anniver- sary of Palach 's action, we intend to gather at the statue of St Wenceslas to lay flowers and hold a brief ceremony of remembrance in order to recall Palach's undying appeal which we are neither able nor willing to ignore.

I fully understand that a sense of hopelessness and a feeling that there is no way out might 61 [pageend66]D2-D3 lead someone even now to decide to arouse their fellow citizens through an extreme act. None the less I believe it to be the wrong course of action. lt is an appalling tactic never to be repeated. After al!, before his death, Palach himself appealed to his friends to try to understand his action as a plea for a life of dignity, and something not to be repeated. You appear from your letter to be an intelli- gent and courageous young man. lt is precisely people like you that we need here among us, to strive in your daily work to improve life for al! of us. Remember that the first major work of T. G. Masaryk, the founder of democratic Czechoslovakia, was a book about suicide, in which he sought to demonstrate that the abandonment of God and of higher moral ideals and their transcendental origins leads to loss of respect for human life, and hence to suicide. If we wish to act in accordance with the moral imperative that transcends us, we cannot abandon life, however Johy and noble our purpose, but must accept its burden and Jive to struggle for a better world. That was the ethical motivation for Charter 77, for which you declare your support. Charter 77 is an appeal for people to Jive: to Jive as self-respecting and dignified citizens; to Jive in truth. I beg you to look at it that way too, and not to take your planned course of action. Corne with us on 15th January to pay your respects to Palach 's memory, but don 't bring any fuel with you. There are not many of your sort and we need you here with us. You're bound to have relations and friends. However much your death rnight serve as an appeal to society, you would be causing them a grief which that fact could not efface. Think of them as well. I would also like to take this opportunity to issue an appeal to the authorities in Czechoslovakia: Ail of you who hold power in our country and decide its fate, pay heed to this Jetter and realise at long last that the situation is grave. If you don't want a young man to resort to this desperate act, start behaving sensibly at last. Don't spoil the brief ceremony of remembrance on 15th January at 62 Wenceslas Square through a show of police force. You won 't dissuade this unknown person from his planned action that way. On the contrary, you will_provoke hirn to it. We are more likely to discourage him than you will. Therefore do not prevent us from attending the ceremony at Wenceslas Square. If his life matters to you, then act sensibly. And not only that. Initiate at long last a sincere dialogue with society. The situation is graver than you think, so don 't go on putting of dialogue until the worst comes to the worst and it will be too late. Realise that even though this society is capable of enduring lengthy humil- iation, its patience isn't endless. (Statement broadcast the same day by Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and the BBC. Ed.) D3 9th January 1989 Dana Němcová 's statement on the anonymous letter about the planned suicide by self-imrnolation Today, 9th January, I received a letter that differs in wording and handwriting from the one sent to Václav Havel. It is what the two letters have in comrnon, however, that terrifies me. While comrnending Charter 77's activity and voicing support for us, the writer has opted for a course of action, which, as he acknowledges, is entirely inadmissible in our eyes. I am horrified at the thought that there might actually exist a group of young people ready to emulate Jan Palach's action. I believe that the present epoch demands an entirely different approach to reality: first and foremost, ongoing and consistent civic action for the victory of good. There is nothing good about suicide. It is the slaughter of one of the fundamental human rights, the right to life. Only while I am alive can I work for the good of others. Suicidal demonstrations as a way of put- ting pressure on the regime are inadmissible in my eyes. It would not achieve the ends assumed by the letter's author, namely, "to arouse the citizens of our country from [pageend67]DOCUMENTS their social and political passivity and naivety". On the contrary, it would, in my view, set quite different wheels in motion. I believe that Charter 77, whose efforts, accord- ing to the letter, are worthy of support, would suffer a severe blow. The repercussions would seem to me such a trap for all those working with civic courage for non-vio- lent remedies through dialogue, that it is hard to dismiss altogether the disturbing thought that it might be an act of provocation on the part of circles hostile to the Charter. lf, however, we are indeed dealing with one or more flesh-and-blood individuals I beseech them as a mother of grown-up children not do it. Don 't destroy yourselves - or us. A life of daily work is a more worthy sacrifice than that which you contemplate. The sort of work I mean I will explain to you when you emerge from your menacing anonymity, you who describe yourself as "Torch No. I". So far you have succeeded in unsettling the wrong people, i.e. us Chartists. Did you really think we could stay silent? At least for the time being let metry and persuade you this way. I reject your suicide - as you yourself describe your proposed action - on principie and beg you yet again to give up all thought of it. More light we do need, autodafés never. (Statement broadcast the same day by Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and the BBC. Ed.) D4 10th January 1989 Statement by the Movement for Civil Liberties: Jan Palach's challenge. Twenty years ago, Jan Palach, a student, bumt himself to death at Wenceslas Square. It was not suicide but self-sac- rifice. It was a last-minute bid to arouse his fellow-citizens and above all to take issue with the growing defeatism of the country's leaders, and protest against their betrayals. The message of Jan Palach 's action was not "Go and immolate yourselves", but "Go and defend yourselves": D3-D4 fight to defend your human <lignity and freedom, despite the difficulties and even at the cost of retreat. At the tirne, he won the minds of the Czechs and Slovaks and for a short while they were once again the determinedcommunity they had been in August 1968. The country's leadership, however, had no wish to understand Palach 's sacrifice and consummated their betrayal just a few short months after his death. But even many of those who, at Palach 's funeral, pledged themselves not to bend the knee again nor let lies hold sway over them, soon recanted those resolutions. However, for all of us the action taken by Jan Palach, and after him Jan Zajíc, was both painful and tragic. Moreover, the feeling at the time was that the sacrifice of those two young men was in vain. However, now that our society is gradually reviving itself once more - unerring proof of which were last year's successive mass demon- strations - it is clear this was not the case. This reawaken- ing would have been out of the question had many Czechs and Slovaks, both known and unknown, not remained true to their word and had they not gone on living and working for the past twenty years in the spirit of Jan Palach 's freedom call. Freedom exacts a price. Jan Palach and Jan Zajíc were not alone in paying with their li ves: Jan Patočka and Pavel Wonka did likewise. The price is paid - in the form of imprisonment and discrimination - by al! those who have worked publicly for moral and social renewal. Jan Palach 's appeal speaks to us across the years. It speaks to people from all walks of life, irrespective of age or social group. It speaks most directly, however, to the younger generation, young workers and students. Jan Palach 's appeal continues to be a source of moral and social inspiration to young people studying - as he once did - in various parts of higher education. We recall yet again that Palach 's message was not "Go and die", but "Go and do what you yourself can towards moulding your own and the nation's life in the spirit of 63 [pageend68]D4-D6 truth, both perceived and experienced. Help restore mean- ingfulness to our common destiny once more through your courage to act. Go in renewed hope that the govemment of your affairs will return to your own hands. Go, for your moment is nigh."

D5 11th January 1989 The independent initiatives' attitude to the banning of the Jan Palach remembrance ceremony Last week, as representatives of five independent initia- tives, we informed the District National Comrnittee (ONV) for Prague 1, that on 15th January at 2 p.m. we would meet for a brief ceremony in memory of Jan Palach by the statue of St Wenceslas at Wenceslas Square. Since it is a brief act of remembrance and not a demonstration or public assembly we are not bound to announce it by law. We reiterated this fact when we formally appealed against the unjustified ban issued by the Prague 1 ONV. In that appeal we stated that we stood by our original pian. On 10th January our representatives had talks with Dr Martin Houska, head of the interna! affairs department of the Prague National Committee, who pressed us to give up our idea of holding the ceremony. He also suggested that the meeting might take place elsewhere. Negotiations were due to continue today, 11th January, but Martin Houska told us by telephone that in view of the attitude of the authorities further talks were pointless, and that the authorities were maintaining their negative stance towards the meeting at Wenceslas Square. After careful consider- ation we have decided to hold the meeting at the place and 64 DOCUMENTS time originally agreed. Concerning the anonymous letters sent to Václav Havel and Dana Němcová by a man who alJegedly intends to irnmolate himself on that"spot, we do not rule out the possibility that this might be an act of provocation intended to discredit the independent move- ments in Czechoslovakia. If, however someone realiy does have suicidal intentions as announced in the letters, the cancelling of the ceremony of remembrance would only indicate to hirn that he was the focus of public attention and it could, on the contrary, encourage him to carry out his pian. We consider that what Dana Němcová and Václav Havel have said about those letters is a makes their position quite clear and should be sufficient to dis- suade the writer from his deplorable purpose.

We appeal to all our fellow- citizens who would like to pay tribute to Jan Palach 's memory to join with us in a national pilgrimage to Všetaty - where Jan Palach was born and is buried - on Saturday 21st January 1989. At 2 p.m. on that day, representatives [pageend69]DOCUMENTS of the independent initiatives intend to lay flowers on his grave. It is a whole-day pilgrimage, however, with no particular organisational framework, and citizens will take part as individuals on their own behalf. The pilgrirnage is intended as the culmination of a number of ceremonies of remembrance being planned to mark the anniversary of Jan Palach 's death. We hope that all those who cherish the memory of Palach's self-sacrifice will demonstrate their feelings by taking part in this pilgrimage.

Things were moving towards their conclusive defeat and departure from the public scene. No gamble was too great for them therefore. It was just the atmo- sphere in which to provoke an act that shocked society to D6-D7 the core - the attention-seeking attempt by the student, Jan Palach, to commit suicide by self-immolation. If we are to recall the circumstances of that event we need to go back at least to November 1968. At that time a meeting of the Centra! Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia adopted a resolution indicating that the greatest threat to the Party and society came from the Right. That meeting enabled the Marxist forces to erect a barrier to any further anti- socialist moves and unite around a basic approach which society - exhausted by endless crises - welcomed by and large. This could be seen in activity, the retum of social calm and public reaction. It was also confirmed by the meetings of Party branches that immediately followed the Centra! Committee session. Such a situation did not please the leaders of the anti- socialist and counter-revolutionary forces. In their efforts to hold on to at least some positions, they therefore started to organise one action after another as a way of bringing pressure to bear. One of these was the struggle to get Josef Smrkovský elected Speaker of the Federal Assembly, in spite of regulations stating that one of our three main constitutional leaders had to be of Slov ak nationality. Then there was the attempt to prevent the publication ofTribuna which, as a v,oice of the bureau for the adrninistration of party work in the Czech lands, was intended to smash the right-wing monopoly in the media, and in fact fulfil the demand for social dialogue, about which the anti-socialist forces always had so much to say. Thirdly there were the strikes by students and school pupils aimed against the alleged renewal of censorship, in other words, the decision to use legal means to defend our constitutional function- aries and the functionaries of friendly states from persona! slanderous attacks in the press; to prevent the propagation of racism, fascism and anti-communism and attacks on the socialist system. Various illegal organisations were also set up, whose programme was dosely modelJed on that ofthe dissolved Club of Uncommitted Non-Party-members [sic], K-231, 65 [pageend70]D7 etc., with the aim of re-constituting a counter-revolution- ary platform. Those organisations also included the neo- Trotskyite "Revolutionary Youth Movement", so called, in which a range of different views was represented but whose members agreed on one thing - changing the political order. Around that period a student group was also formed, which would seem to have drawn the bulk of its membership from the Faculty of Arts of Charles Uni- versity. Under the influence of appeals from various right- wing publications, members of those groups and other individuals tried to foment actions which - by the use of shock tactics even - would bring people on to the streets. In the end some of them, led on by irresponsible provoca- teurs, were even ready to sacrifice their most valuable possession - their li ves. In mid-January 1969, the students in higher education were preparing a general students' strike which the lead- ership of the Slovak Students' Union refused to support. Faced with the efforts of students, particularly from the Prague Arts Faculty, the leadership ofthe Union ofHigher Education Students admittedly sought to avoid confronta- tion of any kind but endorsed the strike appeal none the less. The aim was supposedly "to defend the mass media". In that atrnosphere of tension the misled students de- cided on a senseless and tragic act - the attempted suicide by Jan Palach, a student at the Arts Faculty. Under the manifest influence of political provocateurs, in the after- noon of 16th January - actually in the final moments of the student strike- Palach soaked himself in a combustible liquid and set hirnself on fire. In a conversation with a friend he admitted that he had been "forced" into the action. He left on the spot a letter in which he declared himself to be one of a number of "volunteers" supposedly ready to act likewise. That very day the presidium of the Union of Higher Education Students examined Palach's action and de- clared it to be "an expression of political protest without any ulterior motive". There was a danger, however, that 66 DOCUMENTS someone else from the ranks of the aforementioned "vol- unteers" would emulate Palach - just as senselessly. For that reason President Ludvík Svoboda went on television that evening and warned most persuasively against any further similar action. Even Jan Palach, whose life the best doctors were trying to save at that very moment, regretted his action before he died. It took place, none the less, and it proved a godsend for the forces of anti- socialism. But their efforts to exploit Palach 's funeral in order to organise a mass anti-socialist demonstration came to nothing. Even so, his action led a further seventeen people, mostly of the younger generation, to attempt suicide in the course of the next ten days. Also pointlessly wasted was the life of eighteen-year-old Jan Zajíc. Seventeen-year-old, men- tally unstable Blanka Nacházelová left behind a letter in which she mysteriously hinted at the existence of a group, which she said she had joined, and which had incited her - in common with Jan Palach - to commit suicide. That case also received considerable coverage in the media at the tirne, as did a number of others committed under the influence of alcohol, insane jealousy, family quarrels, etc. The ineffectual Party leadership of the time lacked the stamina to tackle those demonstrations head on. In al! events, the resignation of A. Dubček from the post of First Secretary of the Centra! Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia proved imperative. * Twenty years on, those same forces, often represented by the selfsame names, are making a fresh attempt to stir up trouble. In mid-January they are intending to organise a memorial rally in memory of Jan Palach - as the Westem broadcasting stations have been reporting for some tirne. These are the selfsame forces who brought our country to the brink of disaster twenty years ago and who were to blame for such persona! tragedies as the tragedy of Jan Palach. It is hardly surprising that the relevant municipal authority turned down the application to hold a public rally. There are even people, particularly from the ranks [pageend71]DOCUMENTS ofthe so-called "dissidents", who are threatening to repeat the reckless stunts of twenty years ago. They seem not to realise the enormous responsibility they are taking on themselves. Arnošt Bak, Marie Boudová, Jaroslav Kojzar D8 12th January 1989 Václav Havel 's second statement on the anonymous letter of 9th January We clearly have no evidence to show that this letter is a red-herring or dirty trick or to prove, on the contrary, that it is authentic and was sent by somebody who really intends to commit this act. At first I was inclined to think it was genuine. I had several reasons for thinking so. I receive a lot of letters, some of which are blatant provo- cations, while others are from people sympathetic to Char- ter 77. The letter in question seemed to belong more to the latter category, which is why I considered it bona fide. Since then, however, the signs would increasingly suggest that the opposite is trne. I have learnt, for instance, that at the beginning of January, before the letters appeared, the police indicated to a certain person in the course of an interrogation that there was a possibility somebody might follow Palach's example and attempt to immolate them- selves at Wenceslas Square. Furthermore, the whole mat- ter has proved remarkably handy as pressure to prevent the ceremony of remembrance taking place. At that first interrogation, the police had expressed an interest in the matter itself. By the time of the subsequent interrogation, their main purpose was to force the cancellation of the ceremony of remembrance on the grounds that if it did not take place, the person in question would not have any opportunity to carry out their threat - which is patently D7-D8 nonsense. There is some kind of campaign under way and this moming's Rudé Právo carries an article which states that the dissidents are actually to blarne for it, that they were actually to blame for Palach's death and that things are starting again. There is something else that is rather typical: as soon as I got the letter I rang Czechoslovak Television and spoke to Macháček who is in charge of news broadcasts. I put him in the picture and asked him if there was any way of television putting out a news item appealing to the person not to do it. He expressed great interest and took my number so he could caU me back. I've not heard anything from him since. However, they read out on television part of the article from today's Rudé Právo. There are increasing signs, therefore, that the whole thing is a put up job. I repeat, none the less, that we have no proof either way, which is why we have to take the letter at face value and do whatever we can. If it is indeed a put up job, then it is an extremely irresponsible one. Not because it might discredit Charter 77 or the other independent initiatives - nobody with any sense is going to be duped by such naive propaganda these days - but for reasons of more pressing concem. It was obvious that we would react to such a letter and make the whole matter public in order to issue an appeal to the person. That, of course, meant that it might provoke some emotionally unstable individuals or psychopaths to try something of the kind even though it had never occurred to them before. If it really is a question of dirty tricks then it is playing with fire in a most irresponsible way. But for the moment we don 't know. The police were here this moming and I' m supposed to be ready at one o'clock for them to take me to the Public Prosecutor's. I've no idea what they want with me, but iťs likely to have something to do with al! this. So I might be slightly the wiser after my talk with him. (Abridged version of a telephone message broadcast by Radio Free Europe. Ed.) 67 [pageend72]D9-D10 D9 12th January Statement by the Prague Masaryk Association During the past few days Prague has been buzzing with the news that another student is ready to imrnolate himself on the 20th anniversary of Jan Palacť s voluntary death, and that several other young people might be ready to do likewise. The members of the steering comrnittee of the Prague Masaryk Association are unable to confirm the truth of this news but nevertheless they consider it their duty to urge and beg them in the name of the spiritual and ethical legacy of T. G. Masaryk not to undertake these or similar steps. Desperate acts cannot serve as a precept for thou- sands of mothers, fathers and children. They may well rouse people from their apathy, but they do nothing to encourage hundreds of thousands of people to take action, which is what is needed so much. ln fact, it very often weakens their resolve. Such deeds do not inspire action. On the contrary, they could well reinforce people 's pas- sivity. Remember, dear young friends, the abuse heaped on Masaryk both during his lifetime and since his death, how critics on both the Left and the Right used to take him to task. But no one ever denied his extraordinary courage. Should you also wish to demonstrate your courage you could take to heart the form which his courage assumed. Masaryk stressed on many occasions that radical exploits are not the best option in the struggle for democracy and the ideals of freedom. (He sharply condemned, for in- stance, the creation of a legend out of the suicide of Colonel Švec of the Czechoslovak Legion). He used to emphasise that suicide tends to be the expression of an immediate mental crisis, not a solution to problems. On many occasions throughout his life he would reiterate that it is is often easier to die for some idea) than to work with perseverance and patience and to assist other people suf- fering in a similar way. Masaryk certainly recognised that 68 DOCUMENTS there were causes for which people must even sacrifice their li ves, but they must never provoke their own deaths. You are well aware, friends, that an attempt was made in 1988 to restore Masaryk's position of honour in our national life. Taking that as our starting point, we cal! on all of you to engage in the unassuming task of reviving democracy in accordance with Masaryk's plain appeal: Don 't fear and don 't steal. The struggle for humanitarian ideals was an arduous one even during Masaryk 's lifetime. It is an arduous one now and will continue to be an arduous one in the fu ture. The Czech and Slov ak nations have need of your courage, determination and effecti ve commitrnent. They not only need high ideals, they also need you to get your hands dirty, as Masaryk used to say. Jiří Doležal, Dr Josef Hanzal, František Kopecký, Dr Karel Kučera, Prof. Milan Machovec, Dr Anna Masaryková, Herberta Masaryková, Dalibor Plichta, Jana Seifertová, Dr Vladimír Šalda, Dr Vladimír Tvrz D 10 12th January 1989 Večerní Praha: Quo vadis, Charter! Over the recent period a handful of organisers of anti-state and anti- socialist campaigns in our country have been using the western media in order to stir up passions once again and disrupt the efforts of conscientious people to solve the day-to-day problems of our capital city. They don 't even shrink from exploiting such a tragic and sense- less action as Jan Palacť s death twenty years ago. They go to such lengths in their cynicism that they are indirectly instigating a similar action, as can be seen from the wide- spread publicity given to the anonymous letter received by Mr Havel and which, in his concern, he entrusted to the "Free Europe" radio station. The editors of Večerní Praha have received a whole number of telephone calls and [pageend73]DOCUMENTS letters, the overwhelming majority ofwhich condernn this gamble which "Charter 77" and other illegal groupings of their ilk have resorted to. We therefore wish to acquaint you with the textofthe anonymous writer's letter and with one of the letters received by the editors. (Editorial note: This is followed by the text of the anonymous letter to Václav Havel, alongside a facsimile; a letter from a "reader", V. Janovec CSc; and the following comment:) The cynical "invitation" by the Chartists and other "patriots" of their ilk through the intermediary of Mr Havel who combines the roles of persecuted "fool" and fighter for human rights, and about whose family it is well known that in the Lucerna, which they owned, they cre- ated a cover office for the Gestapo in which they mixed with informers, is all too transparent to be taken seriously by Prague citizens, young or old. The "invitation" to Wenceslas Square contains not a speck of humanity, it is moral blackmail. It is obvious to everyone who !oves life and honest labour that such assemblies CANNOT BE PER- MITfED OR COUNTENANCED as they are flagrantly at variance with the interests of honourable and honest peo- · ple. We know that they are very well paid, organised and have outside support. There is one aim and one aim only- to disrupt and cast doubt upon reconstruction, demo- cratisation and complicate the process of implementing new thinking in intemational relations. Every conscientious citi- zen of our socialist republic must utterly reject these trans- parent and unfeeling gimmicks. D11 14th January 1989 Slovak writer Hana Ponická to the author ofihe anony- mous letter received by Václav Havel and Dana Němcová My dear fellow-citizen, you who in recent days informed Václav Havel and another well-known personality of your DJ0-D11 wishes and of precisely when and where you intend to spend this Sunday - you see, an odd reticence actually prevents me from saying what it is you intend. But as you yourself make clear, you are actually appealing to all of us with confidence - you are addressing us, as Dominik Tatarka would say. First and foremost your words are directed at the people in the forefront of the movement for human rights and dignity, and a better way of life in our country. Your action is also directed at the rest of us-those of us who support them. You have tumed to us, and I for one believe that your motives in doing so are entirely norma!. In your despair you want to speak to people you like, and understandably you are anxious to know what they - we - will tel1 you. What I want to tel1 you is that you pro bab ly don 't know how things were twenty years ago and you don 't fully appreciate what it is you want to repeat. lt was dreadful, truly dreadful. At the same time, though, it was something really magnificent, and un- repeatable - something that never ever be repeated again. Above all, things were quite different from the way they are now. There were no hopeful signs anywhere on the horizon and the squares were still filled with the stench of tanks. Nowadays there are hopeful signsatleast. The horizon is brightening. There is work for us to do, possibly stren- uous work even, as we continue the efforts we have made so far. If you go, we who endured what happened twenty years ago, who had to endure it with the full awareness of adult people, will have to endure this as well, and will have to continue on our way without you. We won't reproach you for it. We shall reproach ourselves for having lacked the wisdom, courage, energy and concem to have kept you with us, to have persuaded you to have gone forward with us. But don't think, my dear, that your decision will serve to shift those who don't want to move. Nothing on earth will shift the cynical or the stupid. The only thing you will move are our hearts and souls, the hearts and souls of those to whom you now tum, whom you address. I don 't know what else I can say to you. 69 [pageend74]D12 - D13 D 12 14th January 1989 Mladá fronta: TASS comments on rabble-rousing appeals in ČSSR. Their plans are immoral In a commentary yesterday, TASS press agency's political commentator Alexander Kondrashov reflected on the rab- ble-rousing appeals that have made their appearance in Czechoslovakia. ''Two weeks have already passed", he writes, "since the melodical chimes of the astronomical clock on the Old Town Hall consigned 1988 to history. That »double eight« year, one fu]] of round anniversa- ries in Czechoslovak history failed to confirm the fore- casts of emigré circles and local sceptics who had been predicting dramatic events and upheavals for the coun- try." "No, last year went down in history as the year when restructuring in Czechoslovakia got under way, a year of major decisions for developing the socialist economy's potential and extending democracy in the life of society. But it would seem that the unfulfilled hopes of the devo- tees of drama and upheaval have proved too great a strain. They are Jess than happy with the failure of their plans to disrupt the norma! life of the country during last year's anniversary days. They have dreamt up a new jubilee: the twentieth anniversary of the suicide by immolation of Prague student Jan Palach, which they would like to mark by a repetition of that tragedy." "It is hard to know how seriously to take the plans made for 15th January and the envisaged suicidal immolation at Wenceslas Square intended as a political protestaccording to an anonymous letter circulating in Prague." "The crux of the matter lies elsewhere, in the squalid attempts by the entirely non-anonymous instigators of such pemicious deeds to squeeze political capital out of them. However much the representatives of the anti- so- cialist group »Charter 77« deny their involvement in the immolation plans, their connection with it is more than obvious. 70 DOCUMENTS "The planned suicide attempt might well be no more than a false alarm, of course, a cunning manoeuvre aimed at attracting the attention of the public and the Westem press once more. But whatever the truth of the matter, it is immoral, to say the Jeast, to use a young life as a political football and stir up anxiety and confusion among people in order to further one's own political ambitions and objectives." "It should also be recalled that Jan Palacťs tragic suicide was not his own choice by any means. It is a weU-known fact that Palach was promised that he would bum »with a cold flame«, like the sort fakirs use in their performances. The swindlers who conned him into suicide were only counting on an explosion of passion and emo- tion in the country. It would seem that the present handful of organisers of anti-socialist activities in Czechoslovakia have similar aims in mind. They could not care in the least that a barbaric act of this kind is fundamentally at odds with the human rights and freedoms that they love talking about so much." D 13 15th January 1989 Charter 77 Document No. 4/89: In memory of Jan Palach On this spot, twenty years ago, Jan Palach, a 21-year-old student at the arts faculty of Charles University, bumed hi mself to death. So died a young man about whom we still know so little since he was in no way exceptional apart from the fact that he took extremely seriously the vows that people in this country had made just a short while before. He offered his life as a sacrifice to remind us of what we had committed ourselves to. He died in order that as many of us as possible should hear his message. He wanted us to grasp what was reaUy happening to us, to see what we were really doing and hear [pageend75]DOC UM ENT S what we were really saying at that time of concessions that were described as "inevitable", compromises that pur- ported to be sensible, and manoeuvring that many liked to think was astute. The awareness was fading that there is something that must remain whatever the pressure, some- thing fundamental that cannot be bartered and without which human life loses its inalienable dignity. Jan Palach died, and for a moment we were all dumb- founded. People lined up in their hundreds of thousands in the streets of the Old Town in order to pay their respects before his coffin as it lay in state in the Carolinum. It was something fundamental that united us all - but it was not enough, as the past twenty years have shown. The foul tide of lies that Jan sought desperately to hold back with his body, has yet to recede. It is quite likely that a time of manoeuvring, compro- mise and concessions is again on the horizon. We are all aware that a consensus on what is of greatest importance for our people and society will not be achieved here ovemight. We might then be tempted to think that nothing of the kind even exists. For that reason it is not untirnely to recall Jan Palach 's total sacrifice. Let us therefore try to imagine that moment when he summoned up his courage for what he was going to do, and the next moment when, close by the bronze statue of the patron saint of Bohemia, he reminded us in a terrifying way of those things that must bind us together if we are not to perish as a human community. Let us try and fix our eyes on that fire for a moment, let us make an effort to remind ourselves that there really does exist something that could not be bartered then, and cannot be bartered now or in the future: something that makes people people, precisely because it transcends them, something which, in a healthy society, unites them. One cannot stare long at such a flame. Its glare should make us lower our eyes and tum our gaze inwards. Jan Palach 's sacrifice is not just a matter of history. It remains a vibrant appeal to all of us who realise the debt D13-D14 we owe. Let us then start to repay that debt from this moment onwards. In bowing before his memory let us brace ourselves and take courage. Tomáš Hradílek Dana Němcová Saša Vondra Charter 77 spokespersons (This Document was intended to be read out on 15th January 1989 at 2 p.m. at Wenceslas Square in Prague. The police prevented it. Ed.) D14 (15th January 1989) Several eyewitness accounts of the 15th January demon- stration An unnamed witness: At about half past one a group of some twenty people were arrested in Mánes Street - essentially those who had organised the ceremony of remembrance. Some of the original thirteen people who signed [the announcement sent to the Prague l local authority] were absent, while some additional people were there instead - Rudolf Battěk, Eva Kantůrková and others. They had flowers and memorial bands and they were still carrying them when they were arrested and driven way. As Wenceslas Square was closed, the ceremony of remembrance took place in Čelakovský Gardens. Václav Havel, Vlasta Chramostová and Libuše Šilhánová took part. They laid the only bunch of flowers they had and Vlasta Chramostová declared that since the organisers of the ceremony had been arrested, it could not go ahead. At that point the bystanders sang the National Anthem. lt is hard to say how many there were because the police started to push them up to the top end of the gardens. Wenceslas Square remained closed. Václav Havel: Since yesterday, the whole of the Prague city-centre has been filled with members of the People's Militia dressed in a kind of grey uniform. There were literally hundreds 71 [pageend76][pageend77]DOCUMENTS of them, as well as plenty of uniformed policemen, of course. Overnight, access points had been blocked, or various kinds of railings had been placed ready to block them, so that by two o'clock the whole of Wenceslas Square was effectively closed. The representatives of the independent initiatives were due to meet at one-thirty before going with flowers to Wenceslas Square where the ceremony of remembrance was to take place. But they were al! arrested in Vinohrady shortly after one-thirty and taken away - some twenty people in all. People started assembling in al! the streets leading on to Wenceslas Square, but there is no way I could estimate how many there were. Vlasta Chramostová and I were supposed to meet up with the main body of representatives only after they had left Vinohrady for Wenceslas Square. When they failed to arrive and people came to tel1 us they had al! been arrested, we went to Wenceslas Square and looked for the most convenient place in the vicinity of the Museum. But the ramp up to the Museum and all the surrounding area was entirely closed. Everywhere there were masses of cars, Black Marias and buses full of police. Even so, there were crowds of people, at least in those places we could see. But we haven't the faintest idea of what went on further down Wenceslas Square or in the neighbouring streets. It was impossible to find out anything, as al! the arcades, subways, pavements and so on had been closed. Nevertheless at the place where we eventually stood - alongside the Federal Assembly - there must have been several hundred people, at least. There, just after two o'clock, when we had already learnt that the others had al! been arrested, Vlasta Chramostová informed the cluster of people around us what had happened. Libuše Šilhánová laid her wreath on a small patch of lawn and people started of their own accord to sing the National Anthem, without being asked to. It had scarcely ended when a large bus arrived and a lot of police leaped off it and started pushing back the crowd as they did in other places too. At this present moment the Federal Assembly building is no 014 longer accessible and the same is more or less true of the Museum. They have similarly pushed the crowd back out of the street called "Victorious February" or "People's Militia", or some such. We are at present in Vlasta Chramostová's apartment near Čelakovský Gardens where we at least have a view of the gardens and part of the Museum. So far we have no idea of what happened elsewhere at Wenceslas Square, at least, not at this precise moment: namely, just after three o'clock. Jiří Dienstbier: I made my way to the Museum, or more precisely, the Parliament, because it was impossible to get into Wenceslas Square from Jindřišská Street. There were some five hundred people by the Parliament building according to my reckoning. But there was no way of getting into Wenceslas Square. So Libuše Šilhánová laid her bunch of flowers on a patch of grass by the Parliament and people sang the National Anthem, after which a bus- load of uniformed police arrived and started forcing us back from the Parliament in the direction of Vinohradská Avenue. Jiřina Šiklová: I saw Vlasta Chramostová starting to speak, but at that moment a bus-load of policemen arrived and started shouting, "Disperse, in the name ofthe law!". But people answered them, "In the name of what law?" That particu- lar confrontation between them and the people was full of banter. Then they wanted to take away the bunch of flowers but no one felt like going to pick it up. The police didn 't want to either, but there was someone in civvies in their bus, and so it was that "civilian" who picked it up in the end. Ali that now remained of it were a few yellow, fallen forsythia tlowers. Vlasta Chramostová: There's nothing to add really. We were so absolutely outnumbered by the police and People 's Militia - thaťs something new I think, the Militia in those grey-green 73 [pageend78];T 111" [pageend79]DOCUMENTS uniforms, hundreds and hundreds of them the whole length of the square and al! around - that there was just nowhere I could have delivered the address that had been prepared. On top of that there was the din from the motorway, so we just stepped forward and I simply told the people that our friends - the representatives of the citizens' initiatives - had been arrested as they were on their way with their flowers. In situations like that, as everyone can appreciate, speeches are inappropriate. But we still had our "power of the powerless" and were each able to pay our own private tribute to Jan Palach 's mem- ory. People applauded and started to sing the National Anthem. By then someone had tipped off the police and a detachment of them arrived in a bus and started pushing back that whole crowd of people by the Parliament. A similar operation would seem to have been mounted in al! other possible places, but at this particular moment it is impossible for us to say what happened or where. Iťs awfully depressing, but most of all it is a perfect illustra- tion of the extent of their hypocrisy. At the very same moment they are doing something like that at Wenceslas Square - in a besieged city centre - they are signing some agreement or other elsewhere. They are just schps of paper, no more than scraps of paper. Iťs a disgrace. Petr Uhl: The first I saw of it was at Můstek which was cordoned off with two sets ofbarriers and several rows of militiamen who were shoving people back into the neighbouring streets. Afterwards, in Štěpánská Street some youngster waved a wreath bearing a ribbon with the word "Nezapomeneme" (We shall not forget). People started to clap and sing the National Anthem, but at that moment they were attacked by white-helmeted riot police. This led to a number of incidents, not too serious at first but later extremely brutal. I myselfhelped a man to his feet. He was well over seventy and along with some others we argued with the policeman to let him go. Shortly afterwards, however, I saw that same policeman - a swarthy six-foot D14 huli< of a fellow - dragging him to a bus. I personally saw about nine arrested people in that bus. Further incidents and arrests took place in front of the Hotel Alcron. Then I managed to get to Vodičkova Street where a water-cannon was advancing on the crowd. Even though we were al- ready leaving - I was leading away an elderly lady - they continued to advance on us and started spraying people, drenching many of them. I saw with my own eyes cases of blatant brutality. In Vodičkova Street an ambulance slowly passed by my at a point where there were two old ladies with head injuries. Václav Benda: Unfortunately it is too early yet for any exhaustive sum- mary or even assessment of the events. There are two reasons for this. Firstly a whole number of friends have been arrested and others have had theirphones cutoff, and in view of the nature of the events, it is very hard to construct a complete mosaic from individua! fragments. The second, and more important reason is that the events are still continuing. It is quite likely that they have far from finished yet and it is already about a quarter past six. An hour ago, a column of special units drove through Charles Square below the window of our apartment. It included about six water-cannon and several hundred members of the special crack force in buses and those enormous police Black Marias. They raced off somewhere in the direction of Vinohrady, their beacons flashing. In other words, the situation is still developing, butl'll try anyway to give you some kind of preliminary assessment. l'11 start with the differences between the situation that arose on 28th Octo- ber and today's events. The differences are to be seen in the attitude of the authorities. A new development is the deployment of the so-called People's Militia which are an armed section or para-military organisation of the Communist Party and were used to reinforce the police units. In addition, accord- ing to reliable eyewitness reports, there was much greater use of various kinds of technological support, such as 75 [pageend80][pageend81]DOC UM ENT S armoured personnel carriers with water- cannon, and it is also likely that more of the special riot police units were deployed. There was also a difference in the tactics of the police. On the one hand they did what they could to prevent the formation of any larger groups of people, and as soon as any crowd formed, they immediately attacked · and dispersed it. In several instances, they didn 't even bother very much about issuing orders to disperse. Basi- cally speaking they just attacked without warning. An- other point that most of the witnesses agree on is that the police and, in general all the security units deployed, all acted with far greater brutality than on 28th October. Apart from the methods already used on that earlier occasion, what has been new this time, for instance, has been that police cars have been driving full pelt at crowds, even in the narrow streets of the Old Town, where it is extremely difficult to get out of the way. There have been cases of demonstrators being very savagely beaten. Furthermore, the special units have never attacked at walking pace, but always on the run, as a result of which accidents and injuries have been more likely to occur in the retreating crowd. So far we have no specific information about casual- ties, but in view of the fact that ambulances have been frequently arriving at the scene of conflicts, it is likely that people have been injured. I have no news about our own ceremony of remembrance. What is certain is that the group of activists who were supposed to lay flowers and wreaths on the spot at Wenceslas Square where Jan Palach bumt himself to death twenty years ago, were arrested before they got there. Since then, a number of substitute events have taken place. I've learnt, for instance, that flowers were laid in front of the Faculty of Arts where Jan Palach was an undergraduate, in other words on the square that was supposed to be renamed after him, but continues to bear the name ofRed Armymen Square. (Abridged from reports telephoned to Radio Free Europe. Ed.) D14-D16 D 15 16th January 1989 Rudé Právo: ČTK report PRAGUE (ČTK, zr) - At Wenceslas Square in Prague on Sunday, several groups of anti-socialist elements at- tempted to comrnit an act of incitement which had been prepared over a lengthy period by Westem subversive centres and some Westem radio stations - particularly Free Europe and Voice of America - in co-operation chiefly with the leaders of so-called Charter 77. They sought to rnisuse the anniversary of the senseless suicide of the student J. Palach to stir up anti-socialist emotions and disrupt public order in the capital, even though the authorities had banned such an event. Members of the public order units of the Public Secu- rity dealt forcefully with the trouble-makers and their planned stunts, whose holding they prevented. Ninety-one of the most acti ve disturbers of the peace were brought in by the police. Members of the People 's Militia - called in at the request of labour collectives - helped maintain order and calm in the city centre. * As reported by Czechoslovak Television calm reigned in the city streets by 5 o'clock. D 16 (16th January 1989) Further eyewitness accounts of the 15th January demon- stration M. Šašek: I took part in Sunday 's ceremony of remembrance for Jan Palach at Wenceslas Square. Brutal police intervention pushed our group of several hundred people into 77 [pageend82][pageend83]DOCUMENTS Jindřišská Street with the help of dogs and truncheons. Severa) armoured personnel carriers, buses and cars be- longing to the police were parked in the street making it difficult to get through. Extreme violence was used be- cause the crowd was unable to move fast enough and people were virtually defenceless against the truncheon blows. People could be seen lying on the ground as soon as we entered Jindřišská. An elderly lady hobbling along by the railings had had her brooch knocked off by a policeman 's truncheon. I retrieved it from beneath his feet and retumed it to her, but she was in such a shocked state she was not even aware of her loss. To my left across the street, about twenty metres from the comer of Wenceslas Square, someone was lying beaten on the ground. The people nearby were shouting for an ambulance to be brought. I tried to edge my way through but it was impos- sible because of the denseness of the crowd and the truncheon blows raining down on us. Many of the falling, hobbling and jostled people had lost their shoes. What was particularly appalling was that the IJOlice deliberately battered old people. Ladies in their seventies collapsed under the blows of bully-boys young enough to be their grandsons. In short, it was cruel and disgraceful. What is one to make of it all? The Vienna accords, the "common European home", a "zone of trust", these are the banners under which people on Sunday lay beaten on the ground, punished for having gone to honour the memory -of Jan Palach, a man - contrary to the secret wishes )of the powerful - who has gone on living although he sacrificed his life for us twenty years ago. And that is something that the memory censors have not forgiven him - or us. Those censors took their task very seriously. Like many other eyewitnesses I saw how several participants in the demonstration had the films taken from their cameras before they left Wenceslas Square. And seeing that I have decided to take this step I would like, in the light of yesterday's events, to put the following question to those who set in motion the present lunacy. Can a ceremony of D16 remembrance be a reason to hunt people down like wild beasts, for them to be beaten indiscriminately and then to be arrested after al! that? Think it over, Gentlemen! JiN Hanzelka: We still can 't get over the shocking events that occurred on 15th January at Wenceslas Square and in its vicinity. What sort of a pretty pass have we come to now, for goodness sake? On the one hand there is the mass media with its repeated distortions, fabrications, and half truths which speak disrespectfully ofhuman life and insult a fine human being who sacrificed himself so that the weak might revive their human dignity. On the other, there is shocking violence against those who did not ignore Palach 's voice, even after twenty years' enforced silence. You know I'm afraid that we have got to a point in our society where it is no longer a question of an event, of one single event, or one skirmish. I regard 15th January at Wenceslas Square as a warning at the eleventh hour. When a society as traditionally moderate and patient as our own starts publicly demanding its natural right to competent and moral govemment, as well as to be shown a truthful picture of its past and present, and clairns, above all its lega! right to participate in decision-making about what will become of a1i of us, for the regime to respond with the help of water-cannon and dogs is not merely the action of bullies and fools, it is an expression of extreme desper- ation and displays a total lack of social responsibility. In our traditionally democratic society, violence won 't Jast Jong as a substitute for convincing argument. Even so, 15th January proves to me that the time has come for us to start seeking positive remedies and solutions and before it is too late. Everyone now believes that the era of delays, pretence, buck-passing and fear of solutions is over. (Abridged from reports telephoned to Radio Free Europe.

We saw and heard what your use of armed force did to the independent initiatives' intended ceremony to commemorate Jan Palacťs action. It need not have been anything but a simple wreath-laying and a brief address. But you had to go and antagonise, shock and incense thousands of citizens with your armed might, in a totally mindless fashion. You are all lying when you describe them as "groups of hostile elements", and when you choose to film only the most off-putting and unprepossessing individuals. The great majority were dedicated, critically-minded citizens of all ages and occu- pations, who also included parents with young children. They came there to bear persona! witness to what hap- pened twenty years ago. You could have allowed the commemoration to pass off calmly. Instead you attacked those people with water-cannon, tear-gas, armoured cars and men wielding truncheons. For several days pre- viously, you had broadcast all sorts oflies, permitting only your yes-men to speak and concealing our real attitudes to Palach 's action. And when we demonstrated our sincere concem to prevent an entirely anonymous individua! car- rying out his threat, you vilified us as usual. In fact your are lying at this very moment in Vienna as - all smiles and bonhomie - you sign with one hand what is undoubtedly an important human rights document, while with the other you are preparing to suppress every manifestation of free thought and free speech. If you continue in this way, and if the Czech and Slovak lands continue to be ruled by backward-looking bureaucrats, incapable of running our affairs, promoting our Jegitimate democratic demands and responding to acute social needs, then in this country, even a document as significant and promising as the one signed in Vienna won't be worth the paper iťs printed on. But we D17- D18 intend to do everything in our power to see that that doesn 't happen, and trust that other citizens will support our efforts. We don 't want to Jive under such a govemment or party. We want the chance to choose new and enlight- ened leaders and representatives who will genuinely rec- ognise our fundamental freedoms - above all, freedom of expression, assembly and association - in the spirit of the Helsinki Accords and this !atest agreement in Vienna. We are sending this statement to the Prime Minister, Ladislav Adamec, and the General Secretary of the Com- munist Party 's Centra! Committee, Miloš Jakeš, as well as to the mass media. Perhaps other citizens might also Jike to express their views on the events of 15th January. Vlasta Chramostová, Libuše Šilhánová D 18 16th January 1989 The Democratic Initiative writes to the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly Ladies and Gentlemen, When the undergraduate Jan Palach sacrificed his life twenty years ago for the future of the Czech and Slovak nations, · he was issuing an urgent appeal to his fellow citizens to work for freedom and democracy. His action continues to speak clearly to us today. It is the moral duty of each of us to make an effort truly to comprehend his legacy, and to act and live in his spirit. By treating Palach's action with extreme disrespect on the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of his voluntary death, the official media in the country are thereby displaying an aversion to the freedom of their own nation. And the harsh treatrnent meted out by the police to those Czechoslovak citizens trying to pay public tribute to Palach 's memory is yet again proof of the sorry fact that the authoritarian regime against whose creation Jan Palacťs self-sacrifice was a protest, is still with us and continues to impede attempts at free 81 [pageend86][pageend87]DOCUMENTS speech and freedom of action. Within a Europe which is on the way to a higher level of freedom, democracy and international co-operation the Czechoslovak state is thus a flagrant anachronism and an ever growing burden on its own citizens. lt is absolutely vítal that the Czechoslovak state and party authorities should at last take steps to initiate the fundamental democratisation of our state. We demand: 1. the retraction of the Communist Party Document "Lessons of the crisis developments in 1968" and the withdrawal of comprornised individuals from the politi cal life of the Republic, 2. an end to politically-based career privileges, with a view to implementing true equality of citizens before the law; 3. the institution of thoroughgoing democratic reforms in the political and economic spheres; 4. the release of all prisoners of conscience. We present the above demands on the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the death of Jan Palach. D 19 16th January 1989 Večerní Praha: Hait the troublemakers We request you to use the authority conferred on you in regular elections and all available means to halt the activ- ities of the troublemakers who are gambling with unrest, schisms and systematic provocation. If they want to re- main bere, they have to unconditionally obey the laws - which are administered by legitimately elected represen- tatives of the people. lndeed over the past few days it has been shown that these people will even stoop so low as to exploit young people's inexperience. Their appeals for "self- sacrifice" in Palacťs traditions are grotesque and inhuman. However they are ready to do anything to frus- trate and jeopardise the efforts of the people - industrial and agricultural workers, other employees, and ourselves, D18-D20 teachers, students and other employees in higher educa- tion.

D20 l7thJanuary 1989 Rudé právo: The aim is clear: to stir up unrest. Exploita- tion oj Jan Palach's tragic death PRAGUE (From our own correspondents) -As we have reported already, several groups of anti-state elements attempted to stir up trouble at Wenceslas Square on Sun- day 15th January by exploiting the senseless suicide ofthe student J. Palach. Monday saw a further similar attempt at incitement. We wrote about the circumstance that led a student from the Faculty of Arts of Charles University to make that senseless gesture ending in his unnecessary death in our article "It was sheer recklessness" in Rudé právo of 12th January. We also reported that the same elements, even represented by the sarne narnes on many occasions, were preparing to hold "a remembrance rally in memory of the student Jan Palach" in the centre of Prague. The department for interna! political matters of the Prague 1 district National Comrnittee rejected the application signed by a few dissidents. Meanwhile public opinion was outraged by the letter to one of the "dissidents" that "on 15th January 1989 in the afternoon a human toreb will once more flare up alongside 'the horse' in Wenceslas Square". The authorities therefore took the necessary precau- tions. On Sunday, People's Militia from the Prague enter- prises helped to ensure order in the city centre alongside officers ofthe National Security Corps (SNB). ln spíte of 83 [pageend88][pageend89]DOCUMENTS this, however, the provocateurs tried to hold a demonstra- tion in the vicinity of the statue of St Wenceslas according to a preconceived script - to provoke an atmosphere of unrest at al! costs. What happened on Sunday? Just before two in the aftemoon a group of some' 300 people formed in the centra! reservation of Wenceslas Square. When called on to clear the area they reacted with whistling and insults aimed at the officers of the Public Security (VB) and the People's Militia. The law enforcement units acted quickly and decisively to expel these knots of people into Vodičkova, Jindřišská and Opletalova Streets. They also intervened elsewhere in the city centre, including Red Annymen Square. Frankly speaking, it was not a pretty sight. In an attempt to attract attention, at the fiTSt appeal for calm, a grown-up man threw himself on the ground and started thrashing about with his legs. A little girl about five years old on her father's shoulders was obviously intended to serve as a shield for his "self-defence". Agroup of youngsters clearly regarded their participation as great fun and when these hooligans took to their heels and disappeared down ar- cades and passage-ways they inconsiderately knocked over onlookers. That was how several elderly citizens came to be injured. By early evening calm had been restored in the centre of Prague. Ninety-one citizens were brought to police stations. Some of them have been charged with offences. Many of those taking part in the unauthorised demonstra- tion were no strangers to such anti-socialist behaviour. * On Monday 16th January several groups attempted to commit an act of provocation in the same place. They chose for their purpose the period before four o'clock in the afternoon, when Wenceslas Square was at its fullest. The disorderly behaviour created a great deal of inconve- nience and unpleasantness for city travellers and shoppers D20 in the centre of Prague. Once more the forces of law and order were obliged to intervene. So much, then, about the events in Prague. At the beginning of January, three men visited the unsuspecting tenant of the cottage in which Palach 's family used to Jive at Všetaty in the district of Mělník. They came to request "permission" to place a plaque in memory of Jan Palach on the front of the house. The 75-year-old woman turned them away, referring them to the local authority. So the "delegation" sent to Všetaty by Prague dissidents knocked at the door of council chairman Josef Jindra and council clerk Milan Klaška. However the officials in question showed no sympathy for the uninvited visitors. The latter therefore resorted to threats: "You don 't have to be elected next time", they declared in a blackmailing tone. After further discussion, the "delegation" - who didn't even know how to introduce themselves properly - left the Všetaty council offices empty-handed ... We interviewed the two officials several days later. "We don 't know much about the Palach family any more. The mother died in 1980 after selling the house. The father died before his son committed his tragic act. There is no one from the family living in the neighbourhood any more. We have other, more operative concems," declared mu- nicipal council clerk Milan Klaška. Vlastimil Bradáč, Michal Podzimek, Karel Walter * ČTK issued the following report about the above-men- tioned acts of incitement on Monday: Severa! groups of anti-state elements sought to con- tinue Sunday's trouble- making activities at Wenceslas Square under the pretext of the anniversary ofJan Palach 's suicide. The provocateurs defied repeated appeals from Public Security officers and committed breaches of the peace by their aggressive behaviour. The entire blame for this lies with the ringleaders of the so-called independent structures, including Charter 77. In the interests of ensur- ing the order and security of Prague citizens and visitors 85 [pageend90][pageend91]DOCUMENTS to Prague, Public Security officers were obliged to take vigorous action against those elements. In accordance with Czechoslovak laws and on account of their flagrant and repeated violation and failure to comply with the appeals of state authorities, some of the organisers of the acts of incitement were arrested. D 21 17th January 1989 Charter 77 Document No. 5/89: To the governments of the countries involved in the process of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe Ladies and Gentlemen, You have just signed a document in which all the partici- pants in the Helsinki process pledge to avoid "all actions inconsistent with the provisions of the Fina! Act and other documents of the CSCE" and "acknowledge that any such act would jeopardise their mutual relations and would be an obstacle to the development of co-operation among them." In Prague, on Sunday 15th January, a massive deploy- ment of police, using armoured personnel carriers, water cannon, tear-gas and dogs, broke up a peaceful demonstra- tion by Czechoslovak citizens in honour of the memory of the student Jan Palach who bumed himself to death at Wenceslas Square twenty years ago as a waming against the continuing demoralisation of society in the wake of the invasion of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact troops. A group of representatives of different independent initia- tives who wanted to place flowers on the site of his act were arrested by the police. Special riot police units and the People 's Militia continued throughout the city centre that evening, dispersing, beating up and using water can- D20 - D21 non to drench thousands of citizens wanting to take part in the ceremony of remembrance. The police injured many of them, seriously in some cases. There was a repetition of these police tactics the fol- lowing day, Monday 16th January. But whereas on the Sunday they had been able at least to pretend that Wenceslas Square had been closed to forestall the possi- bility of a new human torch being ignited at Wenceslas Square - as had been threatened in a (probably fake) anonymous letter - on the Monday they deliberately pro- voked their own intervention. When several representa- tives of different citizens' initiatives laid flowers near to the statue of St Wenceslas - without calling on other citizens to join them - the police arrested them on the spot. The police then closed off the city centre and again used water-cannon, tear-gas and armoured personnel carriers to disperse the thousands of citizens who happened to be passing through at the time. It was actually the police brutality that first caused many of them to voice Ioud protests. The savage treatment meted out to peaceful citizens and the arrest of fourteen representati ves of inde- pendent initiatives and other members of the public was therefore a show of strength and a deliberate political act. Although the Czechoslovak authorities were obliged by intemational developments to sign the Vienna docu- ment, in reality they are making every endeavour to pre- vent any evolution towards democracy, and blocking all efforts to develop a free and independent intellectual climate and civic initiatives. Over the past three months, they have stepped up their attacks on independent groups, with the arrest of young activists of the lndependent Peace Association, two of whom, Tomáš Dvořák and Hana Marvanová, still remain in custody. Also on remand are Petr Cibulka who faces a possible ten- year prison sen- tence for distributing independent literature, Eva Vidlařová, who attempted to defend him, and Ivan Jirous, who faces five years in prison for a petition he organised accusing the authorities of responsibility for the death of 87 [pageend92][pageend93]DOCUMENTS the political prisoner Pavel Wonka. Augustin Navrátil, the author of a petition, signed by over half a million people, calling for religious freedom and the separation of Church and State, is still the subject of a compulsory psychiatrie order. Czechoslovakia is nót alone in its open attacks on the Helsinki process. The authorities in the GDR are pursuing a deliberate policy of treating activists of independent citizens' initiatives as criminals and forcing them to emi- grate, such as on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the murder of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht. The independent groups stressed that "freedom always means freedom to dissent" and protested against the banning of Soviet films and journals. Just before the Vienna docu- ment was signed, about a hundred people were arrested in Leipzig, eight of whom are still in custody, charged with harming the State order, for which they could receive prison sentence s of up to five years. During the week prior to the signing ceremony in Vienna, the Bulgarian author- ities jailed seven activists of the independent Society for Human Rights, among other reasons because they gave interviews to Western radio stations. And the human rights situation in Romania is notorious. These examples show that we are seeing the emergence of a de facto group of govemments which oppose the positive changes in eastern Europe as well as rapproche- ment throughout Europe which is fostered most actively by the Helsinki process. If these positive developments are to continue then there can be no ignoring or even tolerating those governments which regard the documents they hyp- ocritically sign as worthless scraps of paper. Whether the signing by 35 states of a document whose clauses some of them neither observe nor have any obvi- ous intention of doing so, will nevertheless help to stimu- late an improvement in the human rights situation, only time will tel1. Maybe the decision to sign a document at the end of the follow-up meeting in Vienna rather than have the talks collapse will turn out to have been justified. It will demand not just patience, but also determination. D21-D22 When you assess the situation in Czechoslovakia, I beg you to bear in mind that the police units were deployed not against a frenzied mob but against people taking part in a ceremony of remembrance, and that Stanislav Penc jr., Jana Petrová, Saša Vondra, Jana Sternová, David Němec, Dana Němcová, Ota Veverka and Petr Placák are being held in custody along with Josef Žáček, Marek Ptáček, Václav Kratochvíl, Jitka Vavříková, Jiří Fiala and Václav Havel not for planting bombs, but for laying flowers. Tomáš Hradílek - Charter 77 spokesperson N.B. Charter 77 spokespersons Dana Němcová and Saša Vondra are currently held in custody. D22 (17th January I 989) Furthereyewitness accounts ofthe events of 15th and 16th January Unnamed witness: I managed to get out of the metro at the lower exit of Můstek station just after 2 p.m., the upper exit of Můstek i5tation and the whole ofthe Museum station being already closed . by then. We arrived in the thick of it. A police cordon of special VB units had just started to push back the people who had assembled at the pedestrian zone of Wenceslas Square. People shouted slogans. A screeching police loudspeaker was spewing forth incomprehensible commands, most likely declaring the assembly to be ille- gal and calling on people to disperse. At least half of the people present are under the impression that they are witnessing the making of a film about the end of the Austro-Hungarian empire. However, the water cannon tells them they are wrong. The police start spraying in every direction: at parents with children on their shoul- ders, at the. drunks and old gaffers from the nearby refresh- ment rooms, at people just coming up out of the metro and having no idea of whaťs going on. A whole number of 89 [pageend94][pageend95]DOCUMENTS people are thrown to the ground. White-helmeted riot police units with long sticks start running around. They lash out indiscriminately at people. The crowd flees in all directions into the neighbouring streets - Na příkopě, Na Můstku and 28. října. We stay put. The riot police units run past us. The People's Militia occupy the area cleared. A Czechoslovak Television cameraman under police pro- tection deliberately selects a shot of a group of about three "punks", "running ofť' in our direction. They are the only punks I've seen here. Otherwise the majority are people in their thirties. A few are of the older generation. There are not many students. "Whaťs the way to the metro?" an affable old gent asks us. We explain to him whaťs going on. He nods his head and says: "Thaťs fine. I came from Brno specially." We make our way out of the square and go down into Rytířská Street, but even there they are already lining up the water-cannon. We move on to Havelská. The streets are full of people. People shout slogans and sing. The Old Town Square is hermetically sealed. A police car starts to drive down Havelská at full pelt, its siren wailing, straight into the groups assembled there. There is little space to get out of the way. A water-cannon drives down Havelská systematically spraying in all directions. Those who can, flee into the subways. People open house-doors and let us in. As soon as the water- cannon is gone, from every entrance, passageway and subway such enormous num- bers of people emerge that Havelská Street is filled once more, right down as far as the Coal Market. I look around me. I come across people I know and we start talking to strangers. An atmosphere of warmth and friendship pre- vails and so far there is a touch of good humour in it all. One truly seldom meets somany pleasant individuals on the street at once. There is an agreeable atrnosphere of freedom over all. Every so often a group of people appears, fleeing from the truncheons. Utter confusion reigns. We try to make our way through to the junction in front of the Máj department store. It is bursting with people. D22 Slogans and singing. The trams stop. Water-cannon and truncheon-wielding police are already at work. "Ge- stapo!" shout the people and start to flee. We press our- selves behind the columns in front of the Children's Bookshop and wait to be sprayed by the water-cannon. The lad at the controls, scarcely in his twenties, takes careful aim and then apparently decides that we are not worth the dose. The water-cannon are constantly breaking down. On the other hand, the violence of the riot police units is clearly escalating. On Národní Avenue we stop by a hot-dog stall. A column of police speeds by. Twenty armoured Avia lorries, four water-cannon, two armoured personnel carriers. Their sirens are unable to drown the blood-chilling whistling that greets their arrival wherever they go. We set off down Spálená in the direction of Charles Square. A crowd of about five thousand people emerges from Vodičkova Street shouting, "Czechs, come andjoin us!" Some old fellow shouts from a window: 'Td come and join you, but I can 't walk any more. March in my place, lads!" Some people wave from their windows and applaud. The throng turns up towards Žitná Street but there is no way back to Wenceslas Square through Štěpánská Street. It therefore turns back along Ječná in the direction. of Charles Square. The traffic is at a standstill. At the junction in front of the Engineering Faculty the National Anthem is sung. Iťs amusing to see how quickly people join in. But here come the water-cannon again. The special units start hurling tear-gas grenades. Most of them are tossed back. A Volga car covered in strange antennae starts to drive down the middle of the street leading an armoured Avia torry with uniformed photo reporters. A grandma at least seventy years old has just got down from a tram. She takes a breath of the tear gas and starts to vomit. I lead her away. A squad of of the strong-arm units runs past. They look as if they've just been let off the leash - roaring and beating anyone. After a while they return. I stop one of them and ask him if he is not ashamed. The youngster 91 [pageend96][pageend97]DOCUMENTS Jooks riled and starts to breathe deeply. He looks else- where, he doesn't understand me. Heis scarcely twenty years old. The water-cannon sends a jet of water into the metro exit. People get off the trams and are beaten to the ground with truncheon blows. I help a gentleman to his feet, obviously a pensioner. Heis lacerated and has no idea whaťs going on. A group of evidently Russian tourists has been hit by a jet from the water-cannon. They are crawling on all fours looking for their fur hats. The women are crying and have smudged shadows round their eyes like mirnes. I go over and treat them and think to myself what a good idea it was to have brought some bandages. I return to Wenceslas Square. It looks as if the police have declared war on everything li ving and moving in the the town centre. I meet a middle-aged couple, both with nasty head wounds. I stick close to the wall and edge forward. We stop an ambulance which takes them away. The loudspeaker on Jungmann Square squawks something about "dispersing". But there is nowhere to go. Entrances to both lines at the Můstek metro station are closed and there is also no entry into the Museum station. The trams from Charles Square are not yet running. People are wandering about like sheep. They discuss the situation with a few norma] policemen. The uniformed police curse the incompetence and aggres- siveness of the special units even more than I do. The militiamen stand there in a daze. By now even they respond to people's questions without aggression. The centre of Prague is battle-swept. I witnessed unheard-of brutality, unhoped-for solidarity, a steel-grey sky tom asunder and angels crying for shame. I saw the assailed, the battered, the uncomprehending. I saw violence breed violence. The govemment of this country has declared war on alJ its citizens without distinction. The effort of lying has proved too much for it and - true to its nature- it has started to mete out the same treatrnent to all. Therein I suddenly saw enormous grounds for hope. The lie is played out and the cards are on the table. No D22-D23 Jonger is every citizen of this state merely a potential enemy in the eyes of those in power, each of them is now a real enemy who can 't be tamed solely by means of the press, a few consumer crumbs and the promiscuity of the . personal file. Our citizens now need a taste of truncheons and tear-gas to assist their political consciousness. It is not only in tenns of their scale and the numbers of participants that the demonstrations of 15th and 16th January exceed such earlier events as 28th October. lt is not only in terms of the unprecedented brutality which the Czechoslovak govemment appended as a bloody seal of its legitirnacy and bona fides on the dead letter of human rights agreements. In spite of those thousands of militia- men one breathes more freely on the streets of Prague. I don 't delude myself that after it the majority of the nation will suddenly shake itself out of the paralysis of the past twenty or forty years. Iťs just that what has happened cannot un-happen. Thousands of people have tom down the invisible barrier of fear which the totalitarian regime erected in order to keep them apart. Every human commu- nity - and its doesn't even have to pray together - repre- sents a mortal threat for totalitarian rule whose aim is to sever all living communications, relations and discourse. So however insignificant they may look from the outside, the event.s of the last two days give us grounds for hope in my view. (Abridged from a Radio Free Europe broadcast; Ed.) D23 17th January 1989 Večerní Praha: They are taking leave of their senses Those to blame for yesterday's inconveniences to the capital's inhabitants * Continued troublemaking * Prosecutor's waming to the ringleaders was not enough * Prague citizens deplore actions of anti-social elements Prague (vp). Following Sunday's acts of incitement by a group of anti-state elements, Prague inhabitants have cat- 93 [pageend98][pageend99]DOCUMENTS egorically voiced their demand that the stirring up of destructive emotions and trouble-making should not hap- pen in the capital. The provocateurs, however, refused to respect the views of the respectable citizens of our city or its existing legal code, and yesterday once more disturbed the peace with their aggressive behaviour. Under the pretext of the anniversary of Jan Palach 's suicide, groups of trouble-makers tried to stir up unrest in the centre of Prague and by their insubordinate behaviour they halted the traffic and disturbed the public order. Their behaviour contravenes the decree issued by the Prague City Council which extends the quidelines regarding the conservation of monuments in the capital, and directly disrupted city life and citizens' safety. Despite repeated police appeals to disperse, they went on with their acts of inci tement. In the interest of ensuring the safety of Prague inhabitants and visitors to Prague, officers of the special units of the Public Security Corps were obliged to deal forcefully with those elements. The entire blame for yesterday's troublemaking activ- ities lies with the instigators of the so-called independent structures, including the so-called Charter 77. In accor- dance with Czechoslovak laws and on account of their flagrant and repeated violations and failure to heed the appeals of the authorities, the following were arrested: Stanislav Penc, b. 28.2.1970, of Vycpálkova 972, Prague 4; Jana Petrová, b. 16.9.1966, of Dobruška, Rychnov 411; Alexandr Vondra, b. 17.8.1961, of U zámečnice 4, Prague 5; Jana Sternová, b. 5.3.1921, of Heřmanova 3, Prague 7; David Němec, b. 29.5.1961, of Ječná 7, Prague 2; Josef Žáček, b. 26.5.1951, of Janáčkovo nábřeží 51, Prague 5; Marek Ptáček , b. 19.6.1970, of Hradešínská 10/1956, Prague 10; Danuška Němcová, b. 14.1.1934, of Ječná 7, Prague 2; Václav Kratochvíl, b. 20.11.1946, of Pod Karlovem 7, Prague 2; Otakar Veverka, b. 27.8.1956, ofNa hřebenech 2, Prague 4; Jitka Vavříková, b. 17.4.1951, of Bellušova 1826, Prague 5; Petr Placák, b. 8.1.1964, of Chelčického 6, Prague 3; Jiří D23 Fiala, b. 10.1.1937, of Kunčíkova 4, Prague 4, and Václav Havel, b. 5.10.1936, of Nábřeží B. Engelse 78/2000, Prague 2. Those arrested are among those who are con- stantly trying to obstruct the peaceful development of our socialist society, and seek out every possible pretext for anti-state activities. However they cannot say they were not warned. As early as 12th January this year, at 1.30 p.m., a prosecutor's warning was issued to Václav Havel under Article 2, section 3 ofthe law on prosecution as formulated in decree 20/1970 ofthe Collection ofLaws. The warning states inter alia: "It has been ascertained that you are one of the persons who took part during the second half of 1988 in Prague and else.where in organising an illegal movement whose aim is to destabilise the state power and cornmit flagrant attacks on the fundamental attributes of society and the state system enshrined in the Constitution and Legal Code of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. This activity of yours constitutes a criminal offence under Article 1 of the Pena! Code ... " Further: "We warn you that any continuation ofyour anti-society behaviour which has been ascertained by the Public Security authorities and its substance cornmunicated to you, will render you liable to prosecution." A similar warning was served on Václav Benda. The other instigators of the acts of incitement are also known. Although we know about them, know where they live and what their names are, not all of them are in employment any more, for instance (sic), and every right- thinking person must wonder what they are trying to achieve with their behaviour. Our society has adopted a prograrnme of restructuring and democratisation with which all honest people are in agreement as they want a better life in our country. A life based on creative work and a socialist path of development. Prague people have expressed their resolute attitude to these events in letters and telephone calls we have re- ceived at the editorial offices. Protest against the incidents 95 [pageend100][pageend101]DOCUMENTS and incitement that have violated public order and over- stepped the bounds of the law has also been voiced by employees at the ČKD Tatra factory in Smíchov in this (sic) petition which they sent yesterday to the Chairrnan of the Central Trade Union Council Miroslav Zavadil. The petition states that the behaviour of anti-society-oriented groups is in blatant contradiction with what our workers in the factories strive forevery day-namely, to strengthen and fortify our economy through honest and conscientious work and thereby raise the standard ofliving and reinforce social certainties. The workers and technical staff in our workplaces therefore demand that the strictest measures be taken against those who take part in these acts against public order - in the spirit of Gottwalďs slogan: We won't let them subvert the Republic. D24 18th January 1989 Rudé právo: Essential measures to keep the peace PRAGUE (ČTK, zr) - On Tuesday, 17th January, several groups of hooligans again tried to disrupt public order at Wenceslas Square. The public order units were again obliged to take the necessary measures to ensure the peace. The acts of incitement have been condemned by the Czechoslovak public at large. Forthright protest has been expressed by the employees of the ČKD Tatra factory in Smíchov in a petition to the Central Council of Trade Unions. In it, they declare that "the behaviour of the anti-society-oriented groups is in blatant contradiction with what our workers in the factories strive for every day - narnely, to strengthen and fortify our economy through honest and conscientious work and thereby raise the stan- dard ofliving and reinforce soci al certainties". "The work- ers and technical staff in our workplaces", the petition continues, "therefore demand that the strictest measures be taken against those who take part in these acts against D23-D25 public order- in the spirit of Gottwalďs slogan: We won 't let them subvert the Republic." Protest has also been voiced by members of a workshop at the Svit factory in Gottwaldov under the leadership of Miloslav Vyoral. "We love our capital city and our work. In our view what we need above all is peace and calm, not disruption which anti-socialist elements have tried to cause in Prague on repeated occasions. We fundarnentally disagree with them and support vigorous action to restore calm and order." Condemnation of the acts of incitement has also come from members of the Socialist Labour Brigade of C shift at the bar rolling-mill in the Klement Gottwald New Steel Milis at Ostrava-Kunčice, as well as from students, teach- ers and other employees of the Pedagogical Faculty of Charles University in Prague, and members of various Socialist Labour Brigades, and other employees at the Tesla production sector at Holešovice in Prague, and many labour collectives in other places in the ČSSR. D25 18th January 1989 Letter to the govemrnent from former Communist Party rnembets This is the fourth day, twenty years after the death of Jan Palach, that brutal attacks by the authorities against citi- zens of different ages and outlooks have taken place at Wenceslas Square and in other parts of Prague. Many people have been injured or arrested. There are deep- seated reasons for these clashes. One thing is clear: people are unhappy with the way they are govemed. The situation is assurning a confrontational character. That is no way to solve our problems, however. As con- vinced socialists we appeal to the authorities to end their use of violence against citizens arid immediately release all those arrested. Start a sincere and meaningful dialogue with society straight away. 97 [pageend102][pageend103]DOCUMENTS Jiří Dienstbier, Jiří Hájek, Miloš Hájek, Marie Hro- mádková, Milan Htibl, Zdeněk Jičínský, Vladimír Kabrna, Vladimír Kadlec, Erika Kadlecová, Luboš Kohout, Vladimír Kolmistr, Rudolf Slánský, Václav Slavík, Věnek Šilhán, Václav Vrabec Guarantor: Václav Slavík, U smaltovny 11, Prague 7. D26 18th January 1989 Report by the lndependent Peace Association on talks with a cabinet representative During the moming of 18th January 1989, three represen- tatives of the Independent Peace Association (NMS): Pavel Jégl, Jiří Pavlíček and Tomáš Tvaroch visited the offices of the Czechoslovak Cabinet in order to negotiate with the Prime Minister, Ladislav Adamec, about the abnormal situation which has arisen in the centre of Prague as a result of the unwarranted and unjustified action by officers of the Ministry of the Interior, as well as about the defamation of the independent initiatives in the media, particularly Večerní Praha, and about the arrest of fourteen citizens at Wenceslas Square on Monday, 16th January and their likely commitment to prison. The NMS representatives were referred to the special adviser to the Cabinet Secretariat Dr Javornický on the grounds that the Prime Minister was engaged. In the course of talks lasting some twenty minutes, the NMS representatives made the following statement: "We con- demn the actions of the National Security Corps (SNB) and People 's Militia at Wenceslas Square last Sunday. The ceremony in memory of Jan Palach would have passed off peacefully and not disturbed public order. However what dismays us even more is that the police have continued inexplicably to be deployed even now, on days for which no ceremony of remembrance has been planned, and when D25-D26 the victims are innocent passers-by on their way home from work or people out shopping. What has been hap- pening at Wenceslas Square over these past days has been provoked by the police themselves. Tension is running extremely high, which is why we have preferred to ap- proach official representatives personally instead of send- ing a letter, and why we request an immediate end to attacks by the police on citizens crossing Wenceslas Square. If the situation continues to develop as at present then the lives and health of citizens will beat risk." "At the same time, we wish to point out that a similarly tense situation is being created in Všetaty near Mělník, where Jan Palach is buried and where a nation-wide pilgrimage to his grave is to take place. It is our wish that Saturday 's event in Všetaty should pass off peacefully and that citizens should not be unlawfully prevented from exercising their manifest right to lay flowers on the grave of someone they esteem and feel deeply about. Further- more, we must also express our categorical disapproval of the indiscriminate attacks made in the media, particularly in Večerní Praha, on people active in the independent initiatives, without the latter having any opportunity to defend their point of view or attitudes in the media." "We therefore request the opportunity to express our points Óf view. ln this connection we are appalled by the publication of the names of activists arrested on 16th January, which would seem to suggest that official circles are trying to stir up people's anger against those activists, encouraging the public to express its hostility towards these activists. However, we believe that the publication of these activists' names has had the opposite effect. We deplore the arrest and probable committal to prison of our friends and demand their release." "At a time when our country is supposed to be in the process of democratisation, we find it hard to credit what we have witnessed over the past few days." The Special Adviser to the Secretariat of the Govern- ment Presidium, Dr Javornický, took careful note of what 99 [pageend104]D26-D27 he had been told by the lndependent Peace Association representatives and promised that the views of the NMS, which had been formulated as an appeal to the Prime Minister, Ladislav Adamec, to take personal action to ease the exceptionally tense situation in Prague, would be passed on that very day. D27 (18th January 1989) Eyewitness accounts of the demonstration of Wednesday 18th January Unnamed witness: Between four and five in the aftemoon, the top half of Wenceslas Square was gradually filling with people. Sur- prisingly, the police didn't interfere. Individually patrol- ling police officers merely asked people politely to leave a lane clear for vehicles. The crowd of several thousand people shouted slogans like: "Freedom!", "Ruman rights!", "Free elections!", "Better brains!", "Who's the guilty party?", "Release Havel!", "Long live Havel!", "We want to Jive like people!", "Long live the Charter", "We aren't 'elements'!", "Everybody here!", "This is no spectacle", "Czechs, come and join us!" "We're only a handful! " "Show us the 'elements'" "Long live Dubček!" "Masaryk!" "Gorbachev!" "Keep cool!", "Same place tomorrow", "Bring flowers tomorrow!" After six o'clock, a spontaneous, surprisingly concili- atory and, one might even say, businesslike, exchange of views between the demonstrators and plain clothes police officers (Cpt. Koutecký of the Security police.) There was an entirely improvised and very fine speech delivered by a man who introduced himself to bystanders as Ivo Bosák, a believer, by occupation a stoker and a supporter of Charter 77. What he said was appealing and constructive and had a placatory effect. In essence what he said was: "Basically speaking, our demands are as follows: we want to live a life of freedom and <lignity in accordance 100 DOCUMENTS with our country 's democratic traditions. We are not ad- vocates of violence; I personally am a Christian. We make the following demand: let those people who have been running this country incompetently for the past twenty years and got it into its present sorry state depart from the scene and let their places be taken by new, more qualified people, capable of running our affairs and enjoying our confidence. Let the govemment respect human rights and civil liberties. Let an atmosphere of mutual understanding prevail, a readiness to listen to each other, a willingness for dialogue. The Czechoslovak Republic is the concem ·of all of us. Our unity is our stren.gth. Let us behave in a dignified way; there could be provocateurs in our rnidst. We mustn 't play into their hands. Let us not repay violence with violence. We must not irnitate their behaviour. Let us stand unwaveringly by our just cause." Martin Palouš then read out Charter 77 Document No. 5/89 (Charter 77's letterto the Helsinki follow-up meeting in Vienna recapitulating the events surrounding the Palach anniversary in Prague) before briefly addressing the assem- bly. The gathering then sang the National Anthem and started calmly to disperse. Tomáš Tvaroch: I have just got back from a magnificent demonstration at Wenceslas Square that took place between four and seven o'clock. After what happened on Sunday, when it was planned to commemorate Jan Palach 's death and the po~ lice and People's Militia hermetically sealed off Wenceslas Square and special units hunted down bystand- ers; after what happened on Monday and Tuesday when the police for some unfathomable reason deliberately pro- voked clashes with citizens, most of whom had nothing to do with the ceremony of remembrance for Jan Palach and were just on their way home from work or were out shopping - after all that I assumed that something of the same kind would occur today too. And at three o'clock, things looked that way as well. The top half of Wenceslas Square was occupied by heavy contingents of uniformed [pageend105]DOCUMENTS police and plain clothes officers, and about five minutes after sitting down on a public bench at the top of the square I had my papers checked by a uniformed officer. I came back to the square more or less by chance around five o' clock and couldn 't believe my eyes. The top half of the square was thronged with knots of people - with police in attendance - shouting slogans and engaging in debate. There were shouts of"Long live the Charter", "The Char- ter speaks for us", "Long live Václav Havel", "Release Havel", "Release the political prisoners", "A plaque for Palach", "Where are your 'elements'?", "We aren't crim- inals", etc. People were behaving with great courtesy and consid- eration, exchanging impressions and opinions. If someone started to speak and people at the back couldn 't hear, those in front made an effort to convey the gist to them. About half an hour later the throng around the statue of St Wenceslas started to move off in the direction of Můstek, as a sort of march along Wenceslas Square. People sang the National Anthem and chanted the above- mentioned slogans. Some ten minutes later, however, I noticed the police in the top half of the square trying to divide up the column, so we made our way back to St Wenceslas. It was about then that Martin Palouš climbed up on the edge of a flower-urn and read out Charter Document No. 5 ad- dressed to the participants of the Vienna Follow-up Meet- ing. He was followed by a man who introduced himself as Ivo Bosák, "a stoker, a Christian and a supporter of Charter 77". Ivo Bosák had previously protested that the demon- stration was being filmed by an officer of the Interior Ministry, Koutecký. In the course of the discussion that developed both men, in the hearing of many witnesses, decided that the following day - Thursday - they would meet again in the Blaník bistro to continue the exchange of views. Ivo Bosák then spoke for about a quarter of an hour off the cuff about our country's problems and universa! issues such as freedom, and concluded with an appeal to his D27 listeners to disperse quietly and re-assemble at Wenceslas Square at five o'clock the following day. The discussion would then take place at eight o' clock in the Blaník bistro. People listened to his speech in rapt silence, and in general the consideration and self-restraint displayed by the people at Wenceslas Square was truly remarkable and impressed me a great deal, since I regard it to be an extremely promising factor for the future. The same can also be said of the way the demons'tration ended when there were just a few shouts of "We're going!" and people really did disperse in complete calm. A whole number of people came to shake Ivo Bosák by the hand and thank him. Some of them even offered him a room for the night so as to avoid any possible conflict with agents of the Interior Ministry. But he refused the offers, saying that he had done nothing for which he should hide, and should they actually prevent him from taking part in the discus- sion at eight o'clock, then others could no doubt stand in for him. Ail in all, I found that early evening at Wenceslas Square extremely auspicious and encouraging and it helped counteract somewhat the disagreeable experiences of the previous days. I would really like to see things continue in this spirit and when people meet again at Wenceslas Square as they pian, I hope that everything will pass off as it did today, without police interference. Martin Palouš: The assembly al! of sudden tumed into something like a quick-fire debating circle - a kind of Hyde Park in Wenceslas Square. The speakers, that unknown fellow from Prague, and the police, al! stood on a raised area while the rest listened. And that unknown person then started to deliver a very fine and constructive speech, albeit entirely of the top of his head. There was a certain pathos in his style, but his words were truly compelling and had something of the sermon about them. When he came to introduce himself, he said he was a server at one of the Prague churches. Then I was called on, as a former 101 [pageend106]D27- D28 Charter spokesperson, to read the !atest Charter 77 docu- ment that reacts to the events surrounding the Palach anniversary. I therefore stepped up also and read out the whole text, even though it is fairly lengthy, and then said a few words on behalf of Charter 77. That more or less brought things to a close. At the end of the rally people sang the National Anthem and then dispersed while the police looked on quietly and unobtrusively. The senior officers present made no move to interfere. When it started to become clear that the brutality of the previous days was not going to occur, people began all at once to liven up and what I'd describe as a joyful atmo- sphere started to prevail. People were overjoyed at being able to meet together and express their views out loud. It seemed to me as if alJ those ideological cobwebs which our press had started to spin around it al! had suddenly dissolved. People said so in so many words: "We aren 't 'elements', we are here as Czechs, as patriots who want to do something." What was remarkable was how every- one, including the young people, spoke in a positive and constructive manner. It all looked quite joyful and clearly purposeful to my eyes. (Abridged from reports telephoned to Radio Free Europe. Ed.) D28 19th January 1989 Rudé právo: A determined stand on acts of incitement Prague City Council calls on citizens to distance them- selves from the troublemakers * The Presidium of the Municipal Committee of the National Front in Prague supports the Je gal measures of the authorities necessary to ensure law and order PRAGUE (ČTK) - Severa! bodies and organisations im- mediately commented on the acts of incitement by anti- socialist elements in Prague's Wenceslas Square which continued on Wednesday. 102 DOCUMENTS Following a consultation with the chairmen of local national committees in Prague districts 1-10, the Council of the Prague City National Committee (NVP) discussed the report of the Chief of Police for Prague and the Centra} Bohemian Region about the prevention of acts of incite- ment by anti-state elements in recent days. It also dis- cussed many letters and suggestions made by Prague citizens during personal visits to National Committee offices, in which disapproval was expressed with the actions of the troublemakers. Not only do those irrespon- sible elements obstruct the process of restructuring and the development of socialist democracy in our city, they also disrupt respectable Prague citizens and inconvenience their daily li ves. Blame for these illegal actions which Prague has wit- nessed over recent days rests fairly and squarely with the so-called Charter 77 and other unlawful organisations and their spokesmen. The Council of the Prague City National Committee (NVP) values the determined action of the police farce and the people's militia, as well as of all those who helped ensure law and order in the city in recent days. · The Council assures the citizens of Prague that with their co-operation it will use all its lega] authority to prevent acts of incitement disrupting the life of our city, and have the culprits brought to justice. It also appeals to citizens to distance themselves from the actions in question, to take measures themselves in their own neighbourhoods and workplaces, as well as in the affiliated organisations of the N ational Front, to set up a mirror to those who disrupt the life of the city through their acts of incitement and give Prague - the capital of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic - a bad reputation throughout the country and elsewhere, and to actively contribute towards law and order in the city. * At its meeting, the presidium of the munici pal committee of the National Front in Prague studied the statement of [pageend107]DOCUMENTS the NVP Council on the acts of incitement by anti-state elements in Prague in recent days and declared full support for it. It noted that a large number of upright citizens belonging to the political parties and public and special interest organisations affiliated to the National Front, as well as different work forces in Prague have conveyed to the municipal and centra! authorities their vigorous con- demnation of those acts of incitement which have been instigated by a group of people hostile to socialism on the instruction certain western media. The people of Prague expressed their rejection of attempts to obstruct the pro- cess of restructuring and democratisation of our society by violating law and order (sic) at a mass rally on 27th October last year at which they paid tribute to the seven- tieth anniversary of the creation of an independent Czechoslovak state. We call on all citizens of Prague to show restraint and thereby assist in the maintenance of calm and order. In particular, we appeal to parents and teachers, foremen, and senior of:ficials responsible for the economy to explain to their children, pupils and colleagues the need to observe the principles of peaceful coexistence in our capital city and the danger that people face from dangerous provoca- teurs. The presidium of the municipal committee of the Na- tional Front in Prague endorses all legal measures taken by the authorities necessary to maintain the peace and law and order in the city and directed against those who break the law and organise incitement. Let us al! do our bit to ensure that life in our city goes on in such a way as to favour the development of every- thing contributing to reconstruction and democratisation and a happy life for our fellow-citizens, the statement declares. * The Presidium of the Prague Trade Union Council de- plores the acts of incitement instigated in the recent period by the so-called independent structures including the so- D28 called Charter 77 -with major assistance from undesirable centres of subversion. This condemnation of anti-state activities is also con- demned (sic) by a large majority in our factories, plants and other organisations. We are expressing the opinion of our trade unionists who demand that the peace and order should not be infringed in our capital city, since it is absolutely vita! for implementing the momentous tasks flowing from the re- construction of society, for the work and recreation of the people of Prague and their life as a whole. We endorse the determined measures taken against the troublemakers by the security units together with the People 's Militia. We forcefully demand that the instigators of these acts of incitement should bear full responsibility for their actions. * At a joint meeting, the defence and security committees of both chambers of the Federal Assembly heard a report by the Minister of the Interior of the ČSSR, František Kincl, about the measures taken to maintain order in recent days, particularly in the capital city of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, Prague. They adopted a resolution in which, as elected repre- sentatives of the people, they express total support and appreciation to the officers of the Public Security Corps and People's Militia for the determined action and their efforts to maintain order and prevent the sowing of unrest in current developments in Czechoslovakia. They trust that the authorities involved in the prosecu- tion will take determined action in the spirit of valid legislation against provocateurs, organisers and ringlead- ers of the disturbances. Riotous behaviour continues PRAGUE (From our own correspondent) - As the public has been informed, since Sunday 15th January the centre of Prague has been the scene of continued acts of incite- ment and riotous behaviour disrupting public order and 103 [pageend108]D28-029 complicating the life of inhabitants in that part of the city. Again on Wednesday a crowd of some one thousand people assembled in the late aftemoon at the top of Wenceslas Square, disrupting the usual flow of traffic. Once more the purpose of the unauthorised assembly was evident from the slogans that were shouted, attacking the socialist system and its leaders. The instigators of those actions are intent on destabilis- ing our society and putting pressure on the socialist state. It is clear for all to see that these provocative attempts at confrontation with the state power coincide with the clos- ing session of the Vienna follow-up talks of the Confer- ence on European Security and Co-operation. D29 (19th January 1989) Eyewitness accounts of the 19th January demonstration An unnamed witness: There have clearly been hundreds of instances of brutality and sadistic treatment meted out by the police in recent days to unarmed citizens peacefully trying to commemo- rate Jan Palach. The most brutal attacks, however, were on Thursday 19th January. A cordon of police isolated a group of people assembled on the central reservation in Wenceslas Square from the rest of the crowd and then each demonstrator was set upon by three, four or even five uniformed policemen wielding truncheons. The police threw them to the ground and beat and kicked them, before forcing them, with their arms twisted up their backs, into side streets, kicking them all the while. They made them stand there with their hands above their heads facing the parked cars while they beat them across their legs, backs and heads to shouts of, "So iťs freedom you want!" After checking their papers, they drove them off to various police stations where they made them stand for hours on end in corridors or in meeting rooms. The slightest protest 104 DOCUMENTS or even talking would lead to beatings or manhandling. And all this took place beneath a large sign on the wall saying: "A cool head, a warm heart and, above all, clean hands. Dzherzhinski." After interrogation many of those arrested had to wait many more hours for their release, and before they leamt if and when they would be summonsed. People who had been taken to Opletalova Street reported that they saw lying on the ground amidst the parked cars a boy about twelve years old who was being brutally kicked by police- men. That same day, at Můstek, an disabled news-vendor was savagely beaten. He is a well-known figure, with paralysed hands and a severe speech impedirnent, who can scarcely drag himself about and sells Večerní Praha in the metro vestibule. Elsewhere at Můstek, a crowd formed round some policemen who were beating a man lying on the ground. When people started shouting that these were Gestapo tactics, the policemen tumed on the bystanders and started to lay into them with their truncheons, seizing some of them and pushing them into police cars. Those arrested included a sixteen-year-old lad who was on his way from the metro to his dancing class. The police were clearly targeting the youth. One of the Black Marias contained only boys and girls aged from 14 to 16. After a considerable tirne they were driven away and made to get off the bus somewhere they didn't know. There they were made to run between two lines of police- men who beat them with their truncheons. Then the girls were taken one side and the boys were made to strip naked and stand up against a wall with their arms held out. The police officers then beat them savagely all over their naked bodies to shouts of "So things are so bad in Czechoslova- kia, are they?", "We'll show you Gestapo tactics", etc. etc. In the end, they were taken to the police stati on in Lazarská Street where they were made to sign something that made no sense to them - most likely a confession of some kind - and they were informed that they would be charged with riotous conduct and slander of the Republic. [pageend109]DOCUMENTS The boy who got caught up in it on his way to his dancing class is now at home confined to bed in a severe condition, his mouth lacerated from the kicking he re- ceived and his back covered with wheals caused by the truncheons. For fear of possible repercussions, his parents are scared to seek either medical treatment or lega! assis- tance. Such reactions are not unusual among ordinary folk. The police, who foster them by they way they treat people, count on such reactions. And youngsters have not merely been the object of physical attacks in the recent days, they have also been singled out by news broadcasts, the press and television. They seemingly count on the likelihood that out of fear and ignorance young people will not seek legal assistance. Youngsters can easily be used as evidence of confused ideas and iťs not difficult to label them as criminal elements. Jiřina Šiklová: I arrived at Wenceslas Square around five o'clock. The square was packed - from the top end down almost as far as the Zlatá husa hotel below Jindřišská Street. I managed to get up as far as the group opposite the Blanfk bistro where the planned discussion was originally supposed to take place. A discussion was already going on within the group. Professor Milan Machovec spoke, followed by Jaroslav Kolafa, but I didn't hear their speeches, only the statement by the representative of the John Lennon Club. Tomáš Tvaroch of the lndependent Peace Association spoke next. Slogans were chanted, the most frequently repeated being "Long Jive the Charter!", though I also heard "Release Havel!", "Release political prisoners!", "Long live Gorbachev!", "Gorbachev is watching!", "The world is watching!". Once or twice someone shouted "Bring back Dubček!". Interestingly enough, they were mostly youngsters. There were older people there, too, but the overwhelming majority were of the younger genera- tion. And they all behaved in an orderly fashion, even with courtesy and willingness, such as when signatures were being collected on the spot to a resolution calling for the D29 release of political prisoners. What I also found surprising was the absence of any slogans that might have been misinterpreted. For instance people chanted "Who is to blame?" and followed by the rejoinder: "WE know!" -but no actual names were mentioned. At about quarter past five, a police announcement boomed out from a loudspeaker on the comer of either Krakovská or Štěpánská Street: "Disperse, citizens, your demonstration is unauthorised. Disperse or you will place yourselves at risk." The announcement was repeated sev- eral times during the next five minutes, after which the strong-arm squad appeared: the are the fellows in white helmets that get out of blue police wagons -they 're known in Prague these days as "Jakeš's smurfs". They advanced from two sides, from Krakovská Street and the big grocery store Dům potravin, and I must say that there was a fundamental difference between the behaviour of the uni- formed SNB policemen and the riot police units. The SNB officers reprirnanded people and even shoved them around, but they didn't beat them up. The strong-arm squads lashed out in all directions and I had the feeling that they roared as a way of inciting each other. People - where I was, at least- started to clasp each other and shout "Unity is strength!", but they were understandably uneasy and in the end retreated before the crack units. I personally saw some of the strong-arm squad beating a one young fellow in a white jacket until his face was covered in blood from a head wound; two men dragged him away, appar- ently unconscious. At that moment another white-jacketed youngster rushed up and started shouting at the assailant, so they took him away as well. They put the first lad in an ambulance and arrested the other. It was only then that people starting shouting "Fascists!" at them. If it hadn't have been for treatment like that, they, would have never shouted such things. By the Dům potravin, I saw something that was new to me. A police bus was standing there and those arrested were being made to stand in a way I only knew from 105 [pageend110]D29 - D30 Ruzyně prison, i .e. legs a part and hands above their heads, palms against the side ofthe bus. There were tenor a dozen of them stood like that along the side of the bus. Thaťs about all. (Abridged from reports telephoned to Radio Free Europe. Ed.) D30 20th January 1989 Rudé právo: We won't let them subvert aur Republic This week, there has been riotous behaviour in the centre of Prague. The slogans that have been chanted at Wenceslas Square attacking the socialist state, its govem- ment and the Communist Party, prove that these were anti- govemment demonstrations. Behind these demonstra- tions are not only the political has-beens of 1968-69 but also new anti-socialist groupings relying on the political and material support of the forces of reaction in the NATO countries, particularly the USA. Over these past days, Rudé právo, along with the rest of the daily press, radio and television, has been explain- ing the background and context of these disturbances, timed to coincide with the closing session of the Vienna talks. The pretext for Sunday's acts of incitement at Wenceslas Square was a rally to mark the twentieth anni- versary of the senseless and tragic death of the student Jan Palach. It followed lengthy planning abroad, particularly by the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe. Those radio stations publicised and in fact instigated appeals for a repeat of similar senseless acts. Moreover our people also drew attention to this aspect of "co-ordinated co-op- eration" between the American radio stations and the so- called charter. Even some "chartists" distanced themselves from that act which raised a tide of public opinion against its ring- leaders. Professor Milan Machovec, for instance, re- quested Rudé právo to print what he said. This was a warning against any recklessness. 106 DOCUMENTS The instigators of the anti-state exercise did not take into account the fact it had been banned, nor reasonable arguments, and tried to stir up unrest. They brought loud- mouths and hooligans with them to Wenceslas Square and claimed that they represented public opinion and disap- proval of the political orientation of our state. A lot of youngsters also came there who had no political experi- ence at all, most of whom have entirely abstract or naive ideas about the words they repeated, parroting the instiga- tors of the disturbance - words such as freedom, democ- racy, etc. It is a fact that should give many adults - including parents, youth leaders and teachers - food for thought. Even 13- and 14-year-old pupils tumed up at the de- monstration. As some of them declared, they came there because it was supposed to be a "sensation" or "fun". The instigators weren't at all interested in "sensation" or "fun", however. Furthermore this is bome out by the fact that the "charter" also summoned to Prague many of its supporters from outside the capital. Almost 50% of the active participants in the acts of incitement were not from Prague. For some time now it has been increasingly obvious that the anti-socialist forces and their Westem sponsors are deliberátely aiming at a confrontation with the Czechoslo- vak socialist state and attempting to establish some form of opposition within the socialist state, and gradually to win a share first of political power and then of decision- making about the very nature of the syslem, while plan- ning revenge for February 1948. ln recent days, a whole number of bodies and or- ganisations have taken a stand on the acts of incitement by anti-socialist forces in Prague. They include the Centra! Committee of the Socialist Union of Youth (SSM), the Czechoslovak Union of Anti-Fascist Fighters, the presid- ium ofthe Prague Trade Union Council, and others, as we have reported in the press (sic). On Thursday, meetings of local branches of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia [pageend111]DOCUMENTS took place in every district of the capital. Their opinion was unanimous: put a determined stop to the anti-socialist escapades and their ringleaders. The state authorities, the Centra! Committee of the National Front and the editorial board of Rudé právo are receiving petitions from labour collectives from our fac- tories and many other workplaces and parts of our home- land: Let us not allow anyone to disrupt our process of reconstruction and democratisation and exploit it for anti- socialist ends. Our socialist society and our political system create enormous scope for a broad, democratic assertion of the pluralism of interests and opinions of all social sectors and of all interest associations and political groups of working citizens. However, socialist pluralism has nothing in com- mon with the creation and functioning of anti-socialist structures, nor will it have. Power in this country belongs to the working man. He fought for it and won it in difficult battles, and socialism was his choice. It is inadmissible for our society to return the the conditions of the bourgeois republic. It is entirely out of the question. There are no two ways about it - whether they like it or not! Quite rightly we have heard anew in recent days the words: We won 't let anyone subvert our Republic! D31 20th January 1989 Cardinal František Tomášek writes to Czechoslovak 0 Prime Minister Ladislav Adamec Dear Prime Minister, Allow me to express on my own behalf and on behalf of the Catholic people, our satisfaction that Czechoslovakia has also endorsed the conclusions of the Helsinki Follow- Up Meeting in Vienna which ended a few days ago. The agreements signed there will have economic and political repercussions not only for our state but also for a large part D30-D32 of the world, and we therefore welcome them. We have noted with particular interest those parts of the agreement that give concrete form to the commitments of the partic- ipating states, including the Czechoslovak Socialist Re- public, regarding civil liberties, and within their framework, the explicit right to the full development of the religious life of believers and churches. The time has come for an end to inequality. We look forward to a thorough reform of Czechoslovak law in order to irnple- ment scrupulously the undertakings accepted in Vienna and Helsinki. Even more irnportant for the relations be- tween believers and states is that the authorities should strictly respect these undertakings. In this connection, I note with regret that the measures taken by the police against peaceful assemblies in Prague on 17th January and other days, have seriously shaken the confidence of be- lievers, in common with a large section of the population. Brutal violence cannot suppress our citizens' desire to enjoy the measure of freedom which has become an accepted feature of twentieth century life. I fear that curbing dialogue between citizens and government will provoke a confrontation prejudicial to all. In the name of Chrisťs Gospel from which our national culture and the culture of Europe derive, I request you: ''Take the path of direct díalogue between State and Church, and all citizens - without delay!" Yours faithfully, František Cardinal Tomášek, Archbishop of Prague D32 20th January 1989 Eva Kantůrková writes to Václav Havel 's wife Olga Dear Olga, If Václav was free he could defend himself. But since he has been committed to prison again, it is up to us who know, love and respect bim, to assume his defence. I hope 107 [pageend112]D32-D33 that the following experiences of my family will help counter the vile slander that the Havel brothers - i.e. Václav's uncle and father - were somehow collaborators with the Gestapo during the German occupation. I don't know where Večerní Praha gets its information (v. Večerní Praha of 12th January 1989 in its article "Quo vadis Charter!") I myself was only a child during the war, which is probably the reason why I have an indelible memory of the people who helped my persecuted parents in some way. My father was the joumalist Jiří Síla, quite a well-known and respected figure in the history of Czech joumalism, who, having been an editor of the pre-war communist weeklies Haló noviny and Tvorba, was unable to find work during the occupation. To prevent him being sent as forced labour to Germany, Mr Miloš Havel, the founder and proprietor of Barrandov Studios (i.e. Václav 's uncle), provided him with a living for several years by pretending he was a script-writer. In this way he protected not just him but a whole lot of other Czech writers who were banned from publishing. Suffice it to mention Jan Drda among many others. And his sponsorship was gen- erous and simple-hearted and not patronising in any way. Those who slander Václav's uncle should take a look at the output of the Barrandov studios during the entire period of occupation, and even in the worst periods of the Heydrich era. The Havel studios produced The Grand- mother - now the classic film versi on of Božena Němcová's novel, and just recently the televisi on here broadcastPantáta Bezoušek another of Havel 's patriotic productions. It looks as if some people are prepared to stoop to any lie in their attacks on Václav. And it is because there are some people who are inclined to believe them that I am writing you this letter, Olga. Like the majority of people in this country, I want to see justice done and Václav released from prison along with the other friends. With best wishes, Yours sincerely, Eva Kantůrková 108 DOCUMENTS D33 (20th January 1989, Bratislava) Miroslav Kusý: The Czechoslovak "enemy image" ( ... ) The title of the editorial in today's Rudé právo is identical with the slogan that kicked off the campaign against the Charter in the spring of 1977. "We won't let them subvert our Republic", the title reads. Even the argument is the same, viz: we are anti-state, we are directly supported by NATO, particularly the USA, everything we do is planned by the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe. The thing is that the regime can sling as much muck at us as it likes. And we have to put up with it and not say a word. As far as the courts and the mass media are concemed we cease to exist here at home the moment we try to protest or demand that our points of view on matters be published. We try to explain our views in samizdat but that is totally outweighed by the resources available to the regime. ( ... ) Unlike the Soviets, the Hungarians and the Poles, there is no opposition here - says the regime. And, as the afore-mentioned editorial in Rudé právo (and the Bratislava Pravda) boasts, there never will be. As far as the regime is concemed it is entirely a matter of a lunatic fringe. We are just frustrated careerists and saboteurs. And believe it or not, the State Security have even come up with a technical term for us: agents of the "IDCs" - IDC standing for ideovo diverzné centrály (centres of ideolog- ical subversion). "Just look at who they write and broad- cast for!" lt's a well-wom argument, one that Novotný once used against Husák, when the latter published his criticisms of the erstwhile regime in Der Spiegel for want of an altemative. See, now he's shown his true colours! roared Novotný, thumping the table. There's another favourite argument. With what relish our newspapers go on and on about the class origins of someone like Václav Havel. Just look, they say, here you have a typical example of the sort of people we are dealing with. He comes from a family of capitalists, large entre- [pageend113]D33-D34 Laying flowers in memory of Palach is a shameful act of incitement in your eyes. You dispatch your water-can- non against people even before they reach Wenceslas Square and beat them up with truncheons even before they have a chance to speak at the square. No matter what, you always go at it like a bul! at a gate, whether iťs the candle-light prayer vigil of Bratislava catholics, the Jan Palach remembrance or the Czech Children 's "Hyde Park". You treat them all as if they were all-out counter- revolutionary operations - anti-govemment uprisings. At a time when the military dictator Jaruzelski is inviting Polish opposition leader Lech Walesa to the round tahle, and the centra! committee of the Polish communist party is legalising political and trade union pluralism - and hence opposition per se, you just keep going full pelt towards confrontation in your uncompromising, thick- headed Stalinist way. Hasit ever occurred to you how one blast from a water-cannon can transform a crowd of ordi- nary, discontented citizens into active and determined opponents of the regime that dispatched it? (Abridged version of a Radio Free Europe broadcast. Ed.) D34 21st January 1989 Rudé právo: Communiqué from the presidium meeting oj the Communist Party's Centra[ Committee and They threaten ... PRAGUE - At its Friday meeting, the Presidium of the Centra! Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslo- vakia dealt with a number of matters related to domestic policy, including the situation which arose in Prague in connection with attempts to hold anti-state demonstra- tions. It valued the stand of communists, members of other political parties and those without party affiliation who had striven to maintain calm and order. It expressed sup- 110 DOCUMENTS port for the forces of order and the People's Militia, paying tribute to their political awareness and their high level of discipline. In this connection, it stressed the enormous importance of developing political activity among the broadest sections of society, in particular the young. It underlined that the acts of incitement should be seen as part of attempts by subversive elements at home and abroad directed against the socialist state, its foreign and domestic policies, and against the perestroika in our soci- ety. It steadfastly rejected attempts to destabilise our soci- ety and fully supported the measures being taken by state and party authorities to guarantee law and order in accor- dance with the Constitution of the ČSSR and the laws of our country which apply to all citizens without exception. ( ... ) They threaten ... On Friday, the editors of Rudé právo received dozens of anonymous telephone threats. They were also received on the emergency telephone number 158. The threats were directed against the Prague police. The anonymous callers said that if the authorities did not allow the demonstrations at Wenceslas Square on Friday to pass off without inter- ference fire-arms would be used. There was also a man 's voice who issued the following waming: "if a film is screened in the Blaník cinema on Friday aftemoon the place will be blown up". These are unquestionably threats from the organisers and instigators of the events at Wenceslas Square. Some upright and decent citizens who gave an inter- view to Rudé právo in which they condemned the hooli- gans and demanded calm and order for their work have also become the targets of anonymous threats. One of the women told us in distress how an unknown voice abused her over the telephone and threatened her friend whose views we also published. 'Tel1 her that we 'li find her and do something terrible to her. She 'li never forget as long as she lives. Have you got the message?" [pageend114]DOCUMENTS That is what some of that anonymous throng are like. There is only one possible response to such threats, and that is to repeat: "We won 't let them subvert our Repub- lic". And those who go as far as to threaten their fellow- citizens with physical violence can expect not just con- demnation but also fitting repercussions. Jan Jelínek D35 2lstJanuary 1989 Letter from Cardinal František Tomášek to the Czechoslo- vak Prime Minister Ladislav Adamec Dear Prime Minister, In connection with the citizens' demonstrations at Wenceslas Square over recent days and their repression by the police I have been approached by believers among our citizens to express my point of view on these events and try from my side to pour oil on the troubled waters of citizenry and the authorities alike. I regard it to be my duty as a citizen of this state and a representative of the Catholic Church to submit the following statement and request to you: It is not true that the demonstrations at Wenceslas Square in recent days were provoked by foreign media and that the demonstrators were unruly citizens who had been led astray. On the contrary, the cause s of those events must be sought in the shortcomings of the state leadership over the past decades. There is no need to repeat once again all the events of the recent past which have shown that Czechoslovak citizens do not en joy complete freedom and that they are deliberately manipulated by the regime into doing - blindly and contrary to human dignity-only what is explicitly permitted or ordered and not demanding those things pertaining to the fundamental purpose of human life. The desire of our citizens over these past days to pay peaceful tribute to Jan Palach on the anniversary of his death - to a young man who loved and defended freedom D34-D36 and sacrificed his life in the hope that his fellow citizens would real ise the price of freedom - is a true reflection of the views of our country and its longing for complete freedom. In using violence against those demonstrations by freedom- loving citizens the police not only contra- vened our existing legislation, they also acted contrary to human decency. The police thereby exceeded their author- ity and damaged the repu tati on of our country at home and abroad. Prime Minister, I am writing to you as the supreme representative of our state and state executive with the urgent request that you use your authority to direct the security forces to end their violent interference with the freedom of expression of ordinary citizens and give greater heed to the people 's just demands. The elimination of our country's economic shortcornings requires a high level of committedness on the part of our citizens and that is unthinkable without social and legal security and an improvement in the moral climate. As a representative of the Church, which has an experience of such questions going back alrnost two rnillennia and which has a deep awareness of the mentality of the nation and the human individual, I believe that I am qualified to express an objective standpoint. František Cardinal Tomášek Archbishop of Prague D36 (21stJanuary 1989) Eyewitness accounts of the national pilgrimage to Jan Palach 's grave in Všetaty Emanuel Mandler: We left Prague at a quarter to two from Vysočany station. There was a group of uniforrned policemen standing around but they didn't check our papers. We arrived at Všetaty at about a quarter to three, by which time the entire 111 [pageend115]D36 station was surrounded. We were immediately detained and taken to a local state farm by Avia trnek in which we were kept waiting in the yard watching them drive off groups ofthose who had arrived before us. I waved to Eva Kantůrková, among others. I have no idea where she was being taken - home, I trust. An hour Jater, they came and selected a number of us, including Dr Čarnogurský, Litomiský, Doležal and myself, and took us to a kind of waiting room. Some time after five-thirty, they took me. off for interrogation, the purpose of which was clearly intimidatory - judging from the way they treated me, at least. Immediately afterwards they put us in a car and drove us off in the direction of Prague. They dropped us off in groups; I was dropped in Brandýs. A bus was due at that moment so I got back to Prague without a hitch. However at the time I was leaving, Martin Litomiský was still in interrogation, so I have no news of what happened to him. All in all I can say that - from wh~t I could gather - the people who came to Všetaty all behaved with great <lignity, which is what I expected from people who came to pay tribute to the memory of Jan Palach. (Abridged from a report telephoned to Radio Free Europe. Ed.) From a letter to Professor Zdeněk Dienstbier, Head of the Institute of Biophysics and Nuclear Medicine and Chair- man of the Committee of the Czechoslovak Public for Human Rights and Humanitarian Co-operation, from Prague resident Vladimír Treml: On Saturday 21st January 1989 I, in company with many other passengers set off by train from Prague-Vysočany station where a large contingent of uniformed police car- ried out identity checks on people as they arrived. We were even kept under surveillance in the train, and police patrols were deployed along the track at intermediate stations. At 12.35 we arrived at Všetaty where we got off the train and were obliged to walk past a cordon of policemen while being filmed. We were then immediately searched and arrested by uniformed police officers assisted by members of the People's Militia, State Security officers and dog- 112 DOCUMENTS handlers. Our identity cards were confiscated and within the very station precincts we were loaded on to waiting police vehicles - Black Marias - and driven off under police surveillance to buildings belonging to the State Farm at Všetaty. They kept us waiting in the Black Marias for about an hour. We were not allowed to leave the vehicles, which were so full that some people had to stand the whole while. Meanwhile other vehicles arrived bring- ing more detainees. A police officer then cal led each of us out by name and we were led off to a room under close guard. About half an hour later a police officer again called us out by name and handed us back our identity cards. We were then made to climb aboard a Black Maria waiting for us in the yard, under the pretext that we were being taken off for further interrogation. We left Všetaty guarded by five police officers and were dropped at a lonely spot on the outskirts of some village, with orders to find our own way home by the shortest route. After walking some distance, we discovered we were on the outskirts of Čelákovice. Our group included a number of senior citi- zens for whom this was a gruelling and stressful situation. Having heard Czechoslovak Television 's report about Všetaty on my return home I can no longer stay silent, although I doubt whether the Committee of the Czecho- slovak Public for Human Rights and Humanitarian Co-op- eration of which you are Chairman will take an appropriate stand and condernn the distorted and menda- cious reports given out by our media and the unlawful and unconstitutional treatrnent of citizens by certain state au- thorities. I protest against such treatrnent and since the system chooses to treat me this way I intend to alter my attitude to the system. I apologise for bothering you with the matters set out above, but I do so among other reasons because I am an employee of your Institute and I would like hereby to forestall any possible false interpretations of my actions from other quarters. [pageend116]DOCUMENTS Eyewitness account oj Karel Koutský jrom Prague: On Saturday 21st January, I travelled with a friend to · Všetaty where we wanted to visit Jan Palach's grave. We went by rail, but as soon as we got off the train the police caught us and checked our papers. They wanted me to show them what I had in my knapsack. As I was reluctant to obey and told them "you have no right", I was dragged off to a bus where about five policemen were standing. I was made to stand leaning against the side of the bus with outstretched arms and my legs apart, and they searched me like a common criminal. They then made me show them my knapsack in which I had a camera, a New Testament, persona! religious photographs and a book. I had nottaken these things with me deliberately (apart from the camera); I always have them with me. They confiscated everything (apart from the book). They took me off for questioning, and after twenty min- utes they retumed only my camera. They also asked me questions of a purely persona! nature. They then took us off by hus to a spot the other side of Stará Boleslav. Eyewitness account oj Luděk Marks: It started to get dark before five o'clock. We continued walking along the main road and it was already dark by the time we got to Všetaty. At the bend before the level crossing we could make out a group of people and a VB patrol car. We intended to leave the roadway and skirt the level-crossing, but one man - a civilian in a blue nylon jacket wearing black leather gloves - ran after us and ordered us to stop because he was from the police. When my friend asked him to show us his identity card, he did so, but it was too dark to see it properly. He ordered us to follow him and started walking towards the level crossing where a number of police officers and another plain clothes man were standing. The latter also took part when the uniformed officers started interrogating my friend Petra. The plain-clothes man who had arrested us, grabbed me by the top of my lapels and pulled me one side. He asked me what we were doing in Všetaty, and if there D36 hadn 't been "enough of it already" that week. When I failed to answer questions about my part in the demonstra- tions at Wenceslas Square from 15th to 20th January, he punched me in the stomach and threatened further vio- lence. Meanwhile the police officers and the other plain clothes man were searching my friend 's bag. I understood from what they were saying that they were looking for candles. They ordered me to tum away from them. I overheard one of them saying: "Don 't dirty your hands on her". About ten minutes Jater they took hold of us and dragged us off in the direction of the village. They were particularly brutal in their treatment of Petra. Two officers held me by the arms and under my arm-pits. I stopped and Jooked towards the group surrounding Petra. One of the officers dragging me away shouted: "What are you wrig- gling for?" and called to the others "He 's squirrning". He forced me over to the police car and took out a pair of handcuffs. The plain clothes man who had arrested us then came over. After saying "Don't put those on him", he punched me in the left eye with full force. I blacked out and fell to the ground. The one who wanted to put the handcuffs on me started to pull me to my feet and beat me over the back with his truncheon. Two officers then hauled me off in the direction of the group that was leading away Petra and another pedestrian. (He had been stopped shortly after us and had told them he was going to Všetaty to visit a certain Mr Mysliveček.) We were taken to the local police station and ordered to stand in the corridor facing the wall. There were some 15 to 20 other detainees with us. Shortly afterwards, the plain clothes man who had previously attacked me rushed out and roared at me: "If you assault a police officer again, 1'11 make mincemeat of you!" I started to realise how they were trying to frame me. Ali the detainees, including Petra and the man arrested with us, were told to come into the orderly room. I re- mained in the corridor alone. StB officers walked by me with comments like "Thaťs that Marks fellow", "He's notorious". I was told to follow one of them who would 113 [pageend117]D36 interrogate me. I was mostly questioned about the incident at the Jeve! crossing. Half an hour Jater I was driven away by the prosecutor in attendance to the regional prosecutor's office in Mladá Boleslav, where I was inter- rogated by the examining magistrate Zdeněk Rohan on suspicion of having assaulted a public serv ant. After being cautioned, I filed a complaint. The examining magistrate and the prosecutor, who was present throughout the inter- rogation, then took me off for a medical examination. The doctor chiefly examined my left eye, which still bears evidence of violence. He gave the examining magistrate and the prosecutor copies of his medical report. I was then released, at about 11.30 p.m. Three days after my arrest I received at my permanent address a notification from the Mladá Boleslav prosecutor's office that I was being sum- monsed on a charge of assaulting a public servant. The grounds given read as follows: "On 21.1.1989 at approx. 17 .30 hrs. at Všetaty, Mělník district, while being brought in by a VB patrol composed of Lt. Zahorajko and Sgt. Tesař, he swung his fist at Lt. Zahorajko with the intention of hitting him. The blow did not fall, however, as Lt. Zahorajko dodged in time." Eyewitness account of Leoš and Michaela Mayer from Liberec: On Saturday 21st January, we went to Všetaty to pay tribute to the memory of Jan Palach. After getting off the train and walking about two hundred metres, we suffered an unprovoked attack from a terrorist gang offive men in civilian clothes. They jumped out of a car that had over- taken us and stopped, and started tearing the Independent Peace Association badges from our clothes, as well as an anti-nuclear badge. When we protested, they pushed my wife and me roughly against the car, ripping the right !apel of my coat in the process. They then proceeded to search us on the spot, dragging the bags off our arms and tipping their contents out on the muddy ground. We had food with us for the whole day in two glass jars, one of which they broke. They confiscated some forty photos of art objects 114 DOCUMENTS of different genres, an exercise-book with a German word- list, a letter from Vokno and a report on the political prisoners Hanka Marvanová, Tomáš Dvořák, Ivan Jirous, Petr Ci bulka and others. They twisted my wife 's arms and forced her over the side of the car. When I protested against this treatment, they threw meto the ground saying: "You little shit, whinge as well, will you?" They punched me several times in the shoulders and back as I lay on the ground. One of them also kicked me in the knee, injuring me slightly. I was then told, with a torrent of abuse and insults, to get up and pick up my things. As I stood up I received a further blow in the stomach. In my bag there were also my wife's knitting things that she had brought with her for the journey. When they saw it she was asked: "What ďyou need your knitting with you for, seeing as you 've only come here to make a fucking nuisance of yourselves? Haven't you got time enough to do it in Liberec?" They then put us in the car and drove us to a local farm building which the police had tumed into a temporary interrogation centre. After showering us with coarse abuse such as "Another peep out of you, you bastard, and 1'11 rub you in this here mud", they handed us over to the uniformed police with instructions that we were not to talk to each other. After interrogation, they retumed almost everything that had been quite unlawfully confiscated, except for the badges and the report on political prisoners. After keeping us waiting several more hours in some office, and making two unlawful videos of us (during both video sessions, they filmed my wife by holding her by the hair and turning her head towards the Jens, as she refused to be filmed) they drove us off with a dozen other detainees and dropped us at various points in the region. Ali access routes were closed with police road-blocks and patrol-cars. After driving us about 12 kms., they dropped the first of the detainees, with a child of about ten. Ten or fifteen kms. further on, they wanted to drop me off with three other people, but without my wife. Both of us vehemently [pageend118]DOCUMENTS refused this. Their reaction was to try and force me off the bus, which they didn 't manage to do. One of the uniformed men twisted my wife 's arms behind her bac k and forced her face into the back of the seat in a painful way. Every- one in the bus protested violently against this, after which they left us alone. They then started abusing everyone in the bus, cursing and insulting us all in the nastiest way: "You'll be stealing next." We took great offence at that remark and when we protested they shouted, "Shut your mouths! Shut up!", etc. At the next stop, about ten kms. further on, they decided to have mercy on both of us and threw us off the bus. The nearest railway station was Kolín, about 25 kms. away. We were therefore abandoned in the middle of fields without any means of transport or money. · (From the samizdat publication Palachův týden {fhe Palach Week/, the fourth section of which is devoted to testimonies about the events of 21 st January. Ed.) D37 22nd January 1989 Charter 77 Document No. 8/89: Statement about the Jan- uary events On 15th January 1989, representatives ofCzechoslovakia signed the Concluding Document in Vienna. In doing so, they pledged, among other things, "to respect the right of their citizens to contribute actively, individually or in association with others, to the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms" (principie l 3e) and "to facilitate direct contacts and communication among those persons, organisations and institutions, within and between participating States, and remove, where they exist, lega] and administrative impedirnents inconsistent with the provisions of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe" (principie 26). Over the past week, police units assisted by the People 's Militia have been brutally dispersing peaceful D36-D37 gatherings of citizens at Wenceslas Square in Prague. Even prior to then, certain representatives of the regime and a section of the press had initiated a campaign of lies and slander against the independent citizens' initiatives. They have been insinuating, and even openly asserting, that the leaders of the citizens' movement are seeking to drive young people to suicide. They write about "tele- phone threats" to place bombs in "a cinema", "a depart- ment store" and elsewhere. Someone is even supposed to have threatened to use firearms. The issue of Rudé právo for 21st January claims that they are "unquestionably threats from the organisers and instigators of the events at Wenceslas Square". The paper does not divulge the real organisers of those provocations, but instead accuses the independent initiatives, and chiefly, Charter 77. Then, in a manner reminiscent of the fifties, the paper goes on to allege that the citizens' initiatives are directed from "hos- tile centres" abroad-thereby voicing its rejection ofbetter intemational relations and showing disrespect to Czechoslovakia's partners in the Helsinki process. A second, more moderate, propaganda ploy takes the line that "provocative actions impede the process of re- structuring", that demonstrations do not solve anything, that "we will accept discussions, but will not tolerate the unconstructive fomenting of hysteria". Let us first of all summarise the facts. Neither Charter 77 nor any of the other citizens' initia- tives organised any demonstrations. Representatives of five initiatives agreed that on 15th January at 2 p.m. they would lay flowers on the spot where, twenty years ago, Jan Palach sacrificed his life as a warning against creeping capitulation and the progressive demoralisation of Czechoslovak society, i.e., the very situation that indeed came about and with which we are still saddled. There was to be a short ceremony of remembrance at Wenceslas Square attended by a few dozen friends. In addition, the independent initiatives invited their fellow-citizens to commemorate Palach by laying flowers on his grave in 115 [pageend119]D37 Všetaty on 21st January 1989- individually, and at a time oftheir own choosing. In other words they did not organise any mass demonstrations at the cemetery either. lt would seem that those elements of the regime who feel threatened by the positive developments in several countries of Eastem Europe, and by the improvement in intemational relations - reflected also in a revival of civic awareness in Czechoslovakia - apparently decided to take this opportunity to launch an offensive against the inde- pendent initiatives. They rejected all further talks on alter- native ways ofhonouring Palach's memory. The situation was aggravated by the letter announcing that another human torch would be lit on 15th January. One option would have been to treat it as provocation. But the possi- bility could not be ruled out that someone had really · decided to undertake that desperate act. It had to be prevented. And since Czechoslovak Television tumed down Václav Havel 's offer of an appeal, he made use of foreign radio stations. Accordingly, on 15th January, the regime had a pretext for closing Wenceslas Square. This was not the case on the subsequent days, however. On the Monday, it exploited the fact that some representatives of the citizens' initia- tives - who had been held in custody the previous day - laid wreaths by the statue of St Wenceslas. Since the citizens in question had not made their individual inten- tions public they can hardly be accused of organising a demonstration. Photographs of their arrest prove that the only other people present were passers-by. Immediately afterwards, hundreds of policemen, supported by armoured personnel carriers and water-cannon, burst on to the square, which was being used by thousands of pedestrians as usual at that time ofday. On Tuesday 17th January, following· yet another invasion of Wenceslas Square by police units, the public, and particularly young people, were justifiably incensed by . the authorities' behaviour. As a result, slogans were shouted condemning violence, and demanding freedom, democracy and the 116 DOCUMENTS release of those arrested. The slogans included: "Write the truth!", "Stop your lies!", "Long Iive Charter 77!", "Long live Havel!", "Human rights!", "A new govemment now ! ", "Bring back Dubček!", "Gorbachev is watching ! ", "Palach lives!", etc. On Wednesday and Thursday, thou- sands of people assembled quite spontaneously to discuss the situation. Let us emphasise that in spíte of the brutal police intervention, especially on Thursday 19th January, when many people were injured, the demonstrators be- haved calmly and with <lignity. They did not attack the special strong-arm units, did not throw stones, did not damage any public property. On the contrary, when those fleeing the water-cannon knocked over litter bins, they stood them up again and put back the litter. Can such behaviour truly be described as "unconstructive foment- ing of hysteria"? In the circumstances, the brutality employed by the forces of order was not only unjustified, it was deliberately targeted at passers-by at Wenceslas Square. It would seem to have been an attempt not only to intirnidate all expres- sions of independent thinking but also to foster the feeling in ordinary people that the regime can do what it likes with them. The regime 's actions are tantamount to an open attack on society and on the evolution towards democracy within the systems based on the crumbling Stalinist model. They are also a blow to intemational rapprochement. The latter can only be achieved if human rights are accepted as commonly shared civilised values. N one of the independent citizens' initiati ves in Czecho- slovakia advocates violence. On the contrary, they all seek dialogue. We do not want the regime 's leaders to goad society to an explosion that would not only sweep them away, like Gomulka or Gierek, but also harm society as a whole in the long run. Ever since it came into being twelve years ago, Charter 77 has been proposing to the powers- that-be just such a peaceful dialogue about how to bring our country's political practice in line with the intema- tional human rights covenants. However, their reaction [pageend120]DOCUMENTS has been nothing but slander, persecution, police harass- ment arid imprisonment. The independent initiatives' readiness to compromise was proved just a few weeks ago when they agreed to transfer a demonstration to mark the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights from the city centre to Škroup Square, and by the calm and dignified way it was conducted. Similarly, the lndependent Peace Association asked the Mayor of Prague to allocate them a hal! to which they might transfer the discussion sessions which they hold on the last Satur- day afternoon in the month at Wenceslas Square. Their request was refused. Violence in. place of dialogue is therefore the monopoly of the regime, or rather, those of its leaders who are responsible for the lamentable state of Czechoslovak so- ciety. We therefore demand that they resign at long la~t and make way for politicians capable of initiating a soci- ety-wide dialogue. We demand the dismissal of all those officials respon- sible for the unjustified and brutal behaviour of the police and People's Militia towards peaceful gatherings of citi- zens. Chiefly this means the Federal Minister of the Inte- rior and the chief of police for Prague and Centra! Bohemia. In the absence of a dialogue, not only is a democratic transformation of society unthinkable, it is equally impos- sible to solve today's most pressing economic and social problems. B ut if there is to be a dialogue, all those arrested must be released forthwith and al! charges against them dropped. There must be an end to the campaign of lies in the media. It means the opening up of the press to genuine debate as well as the registration and legalisation of inde- pendent groups and journals. We are ready to put forward the names of people to take part in a constructive televi- sion debate with representatives of the authorities. With a view to allaying tension and paving the way for dialogue, we request the city authorities of Prague and the munici- palities of al! places where citizens so wish, to make D37-D38 available public premises or halls where everybody may freely express their views and discuss the way forward for Czechoslovak society. Charter 77 is not a political organisation capable of proposing political blueprints. What it can offer is the experience of plurality in action and of dialogue between different political convictions, social attitudes and spiri- tual outlooks. It can offer this experience as a modest contribution towards the society-wide dialogue which is sorely needed. Tomáš Hradílek - Charter 77 spokesperson N. B. Charter 77 spokespersons Dana Němcová and Saša Vondra are being held in custody. D38 23rd January 1989 Rudé Právo: They went away disappointed VŠETATY (from our correspondents) - On Saturday af- ternoon, the instigators of the subversive rallies in connec- tion with the anniversary of J. Palach's senseless tragedy, tried to organise a further stunt, this time at Všetaty in the district of Mělník. It was intended to hold some sort of demonstration rally at the local cemetery near the Palach family grave, attended by representatives oftheembassies of certain NATO countries (Canada, USA, Great Britain, etc.). American radio stations started inciting listeners to take part in the event several days previously. Therefore the council of the local National Committee in accordance with the opinion of citizens requested the police to take preventive measures to safeguard public order in the lo- cality. No more than 200 people arrived in Všetaty during Saturday from different parts. The ringleaders' ambitions were thwarted and order was not disrupted in the locality. We interviewed some of the participants on the spot: what interested us above all was why they had come to Všetaty. 117 [pageend121]D38-D39 Šimon H., an 18-year-old grammar-school student from Prague: I am here by chance (?); my parents had gone to the mountains, so I just came to see what was going on. Naturally I knew about the event beforehand. Petr J., a 17-year-old vocational school student from Prague: I was at Wenceslas Square on Thursday where there were a lot of policemen. Thaťs where I heard about Všetaty. My mates and I thought we'd go and have a look - just from a distance, which is why we went on foot from Neratovice. Iťs silly that Palach killed himself. I think it was misused. Vojtěch M., a 17-year-old vocational school student from Prague: We came to see if the police were going to intervene like in Prague. Our parents know nothing about it, I only told Grandma. I think there should be more freedom here. For instance, if I wanted to go on television l'd need a permit (?). Jiří K., a 35-year-old manual worker from Prague: I went for a day out with my son to Tišice. The pub there was closed and we were planning to have our lunch in Všetaty. We started to walk there along the railway line. I knew there was something in the offing. In fact it was said there' d be tanks out all around. Pavel L., a 17-year-old apprentice from Mělník: I couldn 't care less about whaťs going on here. I only came out of curiosity. Petr K., a 35-year-old civil engineer from Turnov: I came to lay some flowers. Whaťs wrong with that? Ev- eryone has his own views and should have the right to voice them publicly. I see no harm in that. Pavel S., an 18-year-old manual worker from Ústí nad Labem: A few of us came, the locals from the pub. We wanted to see it. The State should be more just. Like when I work and someone else doesn 't, he gets the same as me, or more, even. Rudolf M., a 25-year-old specialist from Ústí nad Labem: I believe that glasnost should apply to everything. We have censorship here, and that is why I have come to 118 DOCUMENTS see what is happening. (Censorship was abolished in the ČSSR in 1968, Rudé právo editors.) Josef R., a 16-year-old apprentice from Ústí nad Labem: I came to see my cousin; ifmy Dad finds out I've been here 1'11 get a belting. He says that only loonies go to events like this. More people like that came to Všetaty. The motives for their trip and their views were often the same. Most of them - or so they say - were in Všetaty and taking part in similar events for the first time. What they knew of Palach was either little or biased. But that is what the organisers wanted- to entice as many uninformed people as possible, just like them, so as to be able to present their views as the voice of public opinion. But other people came apart from them, including the organisers themselves. One of them was brought personally in a car belonging to the West German TV station ARD. They all left together - disap- pointed. * As the West German DPA press agency maintained on Sunday, according to their information from "charter" sources, some sort of "protest march" was going to be organised from Loreto Square to Prague Castle. That "march was a flop", the agency announced. We checked out the riews in other quarters. It was true: the "march" did not take place.

( ... ) 119 [pageend124]D41-D42 D41 24th January 1989 (Petřvald) Letterfrom workers in Petřvald (N. Moravia) to the Com- munist Party's Central Committee Dear Comrades, When we talk about new thinlcing, public information and restructuring, as we now do every day, we also have in mind the right to inform and the right to receive accurate information. However, when a situation arises such as last week's demonstrations at Wenceslas Square in Prague, and the media berate it as a stunt by a handful of anti-state elements organised by the so-called Charter 77, financed by the West, it is quite logical that ordinary citizens should seek the answers to a whole number of questions that incomplete reporting of this kind brings to mind. Who are Charter 77, for instance? Where did they come from, where are they going and why has there been no statement from them so far in the media about the serious accusation that they are anti-socialist in character. In the Soviet Union, for instance, certain long-standing so-called dissi- dents such as A. Sakharov have been given an opportunity to express themselves - to put it simply, they have become constructors of perestroika. We are not trying to say that, like in the Soviet Union, the same goes for most of those people, but we have no doubt that they include a good number of constructively-minded persons. And even if in certain cases their views were not constructive, we do not believe that this fact will subvert the Republic. On the contrary, it will strengthen it, because the wavering and easily influenced citizens who joined those convinced opponents of the present govemment at Wenceslas Square will be able to clarify their views by such a confrontation of ideas. As young citizens, we realise how little we know for sure about the nineteen fifties, for example, or about 1968, Jan Palach, and, of course, about the activity of people connected with Charter 77. ln school, we didn't leam about who T. G. Masaryk was, and we were already adults by the time we first celebrated the founding of the 120 DOCUMENTS Republic. There is a good deal we want to know. But when we talk about new thinking we certainly don 't have in mind public information as it used to be. What we mean above all is the opportunity for all citizens - i.e. including Charter 77 - to be accurately informed and to inform others. We don 't believe that citizens or Chartists shun such opportunities. We are educated nations, so correct views are bound to emerge. Spealcing for ourselves, we do not believe that views emerging in such a way would obstruct our honest work for the socialist future of our country. The undersigned workers at Tesla Petřvald, Karviná district. Rostislav Němčík, Miroslav Katolický, Petr Faltýnek, Dalibor Nevřivý, Zdeněk Papučík, Petr Vidlař, Stanislav Helma, Miroslav Ondruš, Josef Březanský , Luboš K v och D42 26th January 1989 Report by the independent East European Information Agency (VIA) On 26th J anuary 1989, there was an official conference at which govemment spokesman Miroslav Pavel provided a statistical account of the week of demonstrations in Prague. The identity of 1406 persons was checked, 516 were arrested, 13 were fined, 130 were charged with misdemeanours (carrying maximum penalties of 3 months' imprisonment and fines of up to 5000 crowns), 79 have been charged with riotous conduct, and three are on remand: Václav Havel, Jana Petrová of the lndepen- dent Peace Association and Ota Veverka of the John Lennon Peace Club. In addition, 16 people are in medical care, two of them with serious injuries. The numbers of arrested would seem to refer to those held for at least a day [pageend125]DOCUMENTS in a remand cell, those held for several hours after their arrest are not included; 397 arrests were originally an- nounced for Sunday 15th January and Thursday 19th January alone (see Mladá fronta for 21st January). An estimated 400-500 people - al! those who arrived by train -were arrested on 21st January in Všetaty and prevented from visiting the cemetery containing the um with Palach 's ashes. The number of those arrested and detained for several hours certainly exceeds a thousand. The most brutally suppressed demonstration last week was on the Thursday; on the Friday, the number of demonstrators was significantly lower - some one thousand people - and there were very few instances of violence. On 25th January the following were released on the order of the Prague 1 court, which upheld their appeal against the prosecutor's remand order: Dana Němcová and Saša Vondra, two of the three Charter 77 spokesper- sons; Charter 77 signatories Jana Sternová and David Němec; Petr Placák of the Czech Children group; and Stanislav Penc of the John Lennon Peace Club. Jana Petrová of the Independent Peace Association and Ota Veverka of the John Lennon Peace Club and the Commu- nity of Friends of the USA, remain in prison, having had their appeals refused by the same court. The eight are all charged with riotous conduct, an offence under Article 202, Sect. 1 of the Pena! Code and face sentences of up to two years in prison. On 24th January, they were all in- formed of the outcome of the preliminary hearing. The substance of the charge in each case is that they laid flowers, or attempted to, near the statue of St Wenceslas on 16th January whereby they allegedly provoked a riot. Jana Petrová and Ota Veverka face a further charge of assaulting a public servant, an offence under Article 156, Sect. 2 ofthe Pena] Code, which they allegedly committed by addressing insults at advancing policemen. Eye-witnesses deny, however, that they said anything of the sort. On 22nd January, the prosecutor ordered the release of Luboš Holeček, Josef Žáček, Marek Ptáček, Jiří Svoboda D42-D43 and Lubomír Jaroš who were also originally remanded on charges of riotous behaviour. Instead of hearing the out- come of the preliminary hearing as they also were due to on 24th January, they were informed that their cases had been handed over to the N ational Comrnittee to be dealt with as rnisdemeanours. Jiří Fiala and Jitka Vavříková, who were also named in media reports as being among the arrested organisers of the Monday demonstration, have probably also been released. Václav Havel is due to hear the outcome of his preliminary hearing on 27th January. A number of independent activists were held for 48 hours for questioning. They include Martin Palouš, Martin Věchet, Václav Malý (whose home was searched), Jaroslav Šabata, Petr Pospíchal, Jiří Štencl, Rudolf Bereza, Tomáš Hradílek (Charter 77 spokesperson), František Melichar and Stanislav Devátý. The last named managed to evade police patrol s at Všetaty on 21 st January and throw a wreath of flowers and a crown of thoms over the fence towards the spot where the um with Palach's ashes is placed. D43 26th January 1989 Statemént by members of the Movement for Civil Liber- ties The regime in Czechoslovakia is in astate of crisis, taking the form of chronic economic stagnation and the persis- tence of undemocratic conditions. This situation was also reflected in the massive repressive operations against cit- izens wishing to honour the memory of Jan Palach, as well as against others who happened to be at Wenceslas Square in Prague. The depth ofthe social crisis can also be gauged from the fact that the regime deployed not only the regular police against the demonstrators but also riot police units, and for the first time, in defiance of the Constitution, the Communist Party's own para-rnilitary units, the People's Militia. The units involved used truncheons, water-can- 121 [pageend126]D43 non, tear-gas and annoured personnel carriers. We could mention numerous examples of violence and brutality against young and old that we witnessed on the streets of Prague during those days. The public was not officially given any specific details of the brutal attacks, but it is known that many injured people had to seek medical treatment. Severa! hundred citizens were arrested by the police, and dozens of them remain in custody charged with riotous conduct and public order offences, including leaders of the independent citizens' initiatives who now join the ranks of those de- tained since last year. Citizens are aware of these facts from their own experience. News of these facts travels by word of mouth from one end of this country to the other, as well as abroad. And it does so in spíte of the lies and distortions of official propaganda with its hackneyed ar- guments about subversive centres running these events from the West. In actual fact, however, it was a deliberately orches- trated confrontation with citizens for which the regime is to blame. The independent citizens' initiatives wanted nothing eise but to pay peaceful tribute to the inspiring sacrifice made by Jan Palach when he burnt himself to death twenty years ago. On Sunday, 15th January, the representatives of the independent citizens' initiatives wanted to lay flowers by the statue of St Wenceslas and on Saturday 21st Janmqy a national pilgrimage was due to take place to Jan Palach's grave in Všetaty. The or- ganisers were prepared to ensure that these ceremonies of remembrance pass off in calm and dignity, as was the case of the rally on Škroup Square on 19th December last year. We are convinced that had it not been for the police intervention, both ceremonies would have taken place in a calm and orderly manner. What actually happened in Prague and Všetaty during the period 15th-21st January was a senseless war, waged by the security services against peaceful citizens. As a result of that unprecedented display of brutality, civil 122 DOCUMENTS liberties and human rights were ruthlessly trampled on. It happened in the very week when the Concluding Docu- ment ofthe CSCE meeting was ready for signing, at a time when Europe as a whole is seeking paths to mutual under- standing and peace, a time when the totalitarian form of govemment is becorning an anachronism. Admittedly the Czechoslovak leaders continue to tahle their proposal for the creation of a "zone of confidence, co-operation and good-neighbourly relations on the line of contact between the Warsaw Pact and NATO states", but in their own country they are continuing to deepen the gulf between govemment and citizens. We are becorning a curiosity in Europe. In Czechoslovakia, different views are answered with truncheons, water-cannon and imprisonment. The appa!Iing events of last week will not discourage our continued efforts in favour of democratic rules of co-existence. With a view to ourcontinued progress in this direction, we make the following demands: 1. Release forthwith all remaining citizens arrested in the week of 15th-21st January, and all other political prisoners. 2. Set up a commission of the Federal Assembly and Czech National Council to investigate all circurnstances surrounding the preparation and deployment of security forces against citizens in Prague. By what right was the People's Militia used against the people? Who gave the order for this unbelievably reckless course of action and the beating up of citizens who had comrnitted not the slightest act of violence and were merely exercising their constitutional right to express their opinions? The units and individuals responsible must be identified and punished. 3. The attitude adopted by the authorities to the events of l 5th-21 st January afford no meaningful prospects. The efforts made by the representatives of the independent citizens' initiatives to negotiate with the Prague City C!;mncil in order to ensure the peaceful conduct of the ceremony of remembrance and avoid confrontation came to nothing because of the rejection of a possible agree- ment, and the political leadership decided on a course of [pageend127]DOCUMENTS brutal repression. However, to treat people like enemies of the state and society merely because they express, in a constitutionally acceptable way, views different from the official ideology, arnounts to an attempt to preserve a monopoly ofpower. Stop think.ing and acting in this way. End your lying and hate-filled propaganda in the mass media and allow objective information about the actual situation in the country. 4. We are convinced that there is only one meaningful and hopeful way of ending the present overal! crisis and creating a stable society capable of developing in har- mony: namely, the path of negotiation and dialogue. None of the representatives of the critically-rninded groups seeks to advance the cause of society through confronta- tion. However, if we are to achieve the situation we desire, the powers that be must change their irrational attitude towards the independent citizens' initiatives and the polit- ical groupings that are coming into being. The representatives of the citizens' initiatives are ready for a dialogue on an equal footing.

Appendix: 63 sheets with 692 signatures Text: On 16th January 1989, Václav Havel was arrested at Wenceslas Square along with other participants in the ceremony of remembrance to commemorate Jan Palach. We, who know Václav Havel as an outstanding drarnatist and person of honour, are perturbed and affronted by the manner in which the media have treated the event. As workers in the field of culture we firmly believe that the existing social problems cannot be covered up, let alone solved by means of calumny, imprisonment and violence. We therefore urge the Czechoslovak authorities to enter into dialogue, the need for which they themselves empha- sise. Naturally, a precondition for such a dialogue is the release.ofVáclav Havel and all those wrongfully arrested, as well as truthful public information. D45 27th January 1989 Letter from sixteen Czechoslovak citizens to Andrei Sakharov Dear Mr Sakharov, As we are occasionally informed by our media, changes are taking place in your country that one may qualify reservedly as at least a partial attempt to overcome the worst excesses of the Stalino-Brezhnevite system of con- trolling and manipulating people. The new men at the helm of the Soviet govemment are concentrating their 123 [pageend128]D45 efforts on analysing and condemning the crisis phenom- ena and crimes of the preceding era, now described in your country as a period of stagnation. Soviet citizens leam from the pages of the official press shocking information about the cynical devastation and moral decay of their own society in earlier years. A cautious debate has been initi- ated about so-called blank pages of history. A certain number of political prisoners have retumed from concen- tration camps. You yourself, as a well-known and Jong persecuted champion of human rights have even entered the public arena of political activity. Although the frag- mentary nature of the the information available to us and our own justified scepticism mean that we are very cir- cumspect in assessing the true purpose of present Soviet developments, we none the less welcome everything that helps alleviate the lives of your fellow citizens and pro- mote greater freedom and human dignity in your country. We are sorry -to inform you that we are witnessing an entirely opposite trend in Czechoslovakia. ln spite of the noisily proclaimed democratisation of society and recon- struction of the system, the present ruling elite, which has been in power for twenty years now, is engaged in tuming the clock back to the darkest days of fifties terror and reviving the annihilatory practices of the nineteen-seven- ties. The goveming clique which arrogantly made itself a synonym for socialism, peace and progress in general is now openly and unashamedly asserting its deterrnination · to ignore the catastrophic national crisis which it created and reject al! possible dialogue with society. lndepen- dently-rninded and free-speaking citizens are automati- cally labelled enemies and they are assigned just one partner - the politi cal police. In connection with the recent anniversary of Jan Palach who immolated himselftwenty years ago at Wenceslas Square in protest against the creeping lethargy and demoralisation of society in the wake of the Warsaw Pact occupation of Czechoslovakia, the wave of repression has reached it highest peak so far. Even prior to the anniversary date, the official Czechoslo- 124 DOCUMENTS vak press unleashed a sordid campaign to scandalize and besmirch selected individuals from the independent citizens' initiatives, on the basis of the crudest fabrica- tions. You hardly need us to explain to you the purpose which such "arrest warrants in newsprint" serve and that there is no means of defending oneself publicly against them. Likewise we trust that you have heard about the subsequent events in Wenceslas Square where, for an entire week, the police, with extreme brutality, beat up and arrested scores and hundreds of peaceful citizens calling for freedom and democracy. The aggressiveness of some of the police actions and the demonstrative brutality of their operations give one grounds to believe that the Czechoslovak authorities have decided on some kind of ''fmal solution" to the human rights question in our coun- try. With the signatures beneath the Concluding Document of the Helsinki follow-up conference in Vienna not yet dry, the machinery of repression and intimidation is in full swing here. There has been a sharp rise in the number of political prisoners. Out of al! of them we should at least mention rhe art historian Ivan M. Jirous .and the music publicist Petr Cibulka who have been in prison since October 1988 an account of their cultural and social activity; the actress Eva Vidlařová, imprisoned for show- ing solidarity with Petr Cibulka; the lawyer Hana Marvanová and technologist Tomáš Dvořák - two young activists of the Independent Peace Association; and fi- nally, Václav Havel, Jana Petrová and Ota Veverka whose offence consisted in laying flowers near the statue of St Wenceslas where Jan Palach burned himselfto death. We could go on enumerating these cases for much, much longer and there would still be a risk that we had forgotten someone or that there are some we have not yet heard about. The ossified and incompetent regime is waging an inexorable war against the nation, employing massive terror in the process. Why are we actually approaching you with al! this? We would like to ask you to inform your country 's public of [pageend129]DOC UM ENT S this situation, since they are so far dependent on the false and distorted reports given in the official Soviet media which essentially rely on Czechoslovak sources and iden- tify totally with them. We are depicted in your media as enemies of perestroika and democracy, which is actually an intriguing distortion of the facts. Not merely is the Soviet leadership reluctant, for some unknown reason, to distance itself from a legacy as infamous as the August 1968 intervention, it even refuses at least to stand one side neutrally as we try to come to terms with it ourselves. lt is a baffling phenomenon and one that seriously undermines the credibility of perestroika and glasnost as ways out of overcoming totalitarian hatred. How, for instance, can one take seriously the spectacular removal of signs with the name of Leonid Brezhnev from Russian street comers when the very circles who organise this performance either ignore or even support something far worse: the bankrupt totalitarian regime imported by tank to the heart of Europe by the selfsame Leonid Brezhnev twenty years ago.

D46 29th January 1989 VONS Statement No. 897: Suppression of demonstrations - 15th-21st January 1989 Each aftemoon from 15th to 20th January 1989, sponta- neous demonstrations of citizens took place in and around Wenceslas Square in Prague. They were suppressed by the combined force of the police (VB and StB), the Interior Ministry's special units, and the People's Militia. The forces of repression acted with varying degrees of brutal- ity, their most indiscriminate and cruel treatment of dem- onstrators being on Thursday 19th January. Defenceless D45-D46 and unresisting citizens were subjected to savage and unlawful treatment not only in the square and a large area of the city centre; such treatrnent continued when detain- ees were brought in to various police stations. Similar indiscriminate treatment was meted out by the police to citizens who travelled to Všetaty on 21st January to visit Jan Palach 's grave. On 26th January 1989, govemment spokesman Miroslav Pavel announced that in the course of the events at Wenceslas Square, 519 person s were arrested, 79 of whom have been charged for riotous conduct under Article 202 of the Penal Code; 96 have received summonses for misdemeanours and 130 for petty offences. According to his statement, 16 people are receiving medical treatment, 4 of them for serious in juries. The govemment spokesman did not reveal how many defenceless people had been beaten by the armed guardians of public order. We are also unable to provide such details as we have only fragmen- tary information and it will be hard for us ever to obtain a complete and accurate picture of the brutalities committed by the police and para- military units during the week of 15th-21st January 1989. We are therefore publishing at least the information so far available to us - apart from that given in our individua! communiques. John Bok, of Březinova 7, Prague 8, has lodged a complaint against the police officer who, at 1 a.m. on 16th January 1989, in the interview room of Bartolomějská Street police station, insulted him in a crude manner, throttled him, forced him backwards over the back of a chair and threatened to kill him. At 2.30 p.m. on 14th January, John Bok had been beaten with truncheons at Wenceslas Square and savaged by police dogs. After being taken to Bartolomějská Street police station, he was kept waiting almost ten hours before being interrogated. Ivo Miiller, of Čimická 223/104, Bohnice, Prague 8, has also lodged a complaint in which he declares that on 15th January 1989 he was attacked in Republic Square in Prague by police officers who injured his shoulders and 125 [pageend130]D46 back so severely that he was granted sick leave. After arrest he was taken in a bus along with other detainees to the area of Přfbram (circa 30 kms. S. of Prague, trans.) where the police dropped them off one by one without returning their identity cards. We know that several such buses left Prague in different directions, and that in some cases beatings even continued en route. Soňa Louženská (21) of Kostnické náměstí 8, Prague 3, submitted a report to the regional police watch-commit- tee in Prague about the events she witnessed during the night of 19th January. In her report, she describes being part of the crowd that was forced out of Wenceslas Square into Vodičkova Streetaround 7 p.m. During thatoperation, police officers beat with truncheons anyone they encoun- tered, dragged people off tramcars, and even beat up an elderly man who was peacefully going to get on a tram. Soňa Louženská was pulled out of the crowd along with several others and they were al! taken in handcuffs to Bartolomějská Street police station and hustled into a basement room. There, and subsequently in other areas of the building, the police constantly shouted at the detain- ees, insulting them, and from time to time kicking and beating them. The detainees were then forced to stand astride facing the wall with their hands above their heads. They were forbidden to tum their heads or move in any way, and anyone who did so was immediately beaten. Young males between the ages of 14 and 20 were sub- jected to the most savage treatment. Soňa Louženská ended up in a room where there were about 20 chairs in three rows. There she was made to sit for four hours without moving while threats were continually hurled at her. During that time the male detainees who had pre- viously been standing in the corridor were brought in a few at a time. They were in their underwear, and carrying their clothes. Soňa Louženská insisted on being taken to the station commander, but the police officers laughed at her and shouted ''There 's no one in command here today ! " She was released after being questioned and photographed. 126 DOCUMENTS On 19th January, at Bartoloměj ská police stati on, David Vítek (16), of Březinova 7, Prague 8, in the com- pany of other detainees, was made to run from the car right up to the second floor of the building along a cordon of policemen who beat them as they passed. He was made to stand naked in the corridor leaning with his hands touch- ing the wall. On 19th January, Miroslav Jirec from Karlovy Vary saw thirty-three arrested persons at the police station in Školská Street in Prague 1 being subjected to hours of degrading treatrnent and beatings, some of them forced to stand facing a wall from six in the evening to three thirty the next moming. Miroslav Jirec witnessed how one of the persons under arrest, Václav Ernest, insisted on being released on the grounds that he had been arrested by mistake on his way home from work to Wenceslas Square where he lived. The policeman took him up to the first floor from where a cry was subsequently heard. Václav Ernest came back with his sleeve tom and spitting blood. From tirne to time he would have intermittent fits of hysterical laughter and weeping. Because he was unable to stand, the police handcuffed him to the window bars. Another of those under arrest fainted after interrogation and was Jater taken away in an ambulance. Miroslav Jirec himself,. who suffers with his legs and back, was made to stand up against the wall for over three hours, even though he informed the police of his medical condition. We have many testimonies about the behaviour of the forces of repression at Wenceslas Square in the afternoon of 19th January. The police and shock troops completely sealed the top half of the Wenceslas Square, where a large number of people had assembled. Ail access ways were closed so that when the order to disperse was given, no one could obeý it. The police then started savagely beating defenceless people who had no means of escape. Hence the assertion that the police action was designed to achieve order and clear the square is clearly fabricated. [pageend131]DOCUMENTS Leoš and Michaela Mayer from Liberec travelJed to · Všetaty on 21st January to pay tribute to Jan Palach's memory. As they got off the tra in they were set upon by a number of men in civilian clothes who pushed them around. In the process they twisted Mrs Mayerová's arms and threw Mr Mayer to the ground and punched him. They then emptied out their bags into the mud. Thereafter, the Mayers were taken to the local co-operative farm building where they were interrogated by the police. The couple were then illegally filmed, in the course of which Mrs Mayerová was held by the hair and her face was forcibly tumed towards the camera. EventuaIJy the Mayers were loaded with twelveotherdetainees on to a bus, from which detainees were dropped at intervals of several kilometres. During the joumey, the police insulted .lhem and sub- jected them to physical violence. Mr and Mrs Mayer were put down in the midst of fields, some 25 kms. from Kolín. Petr Holeček, born 26.3.1962, residing at Nad olšinami 29, Prague 10, travelled to Všetaty on 21st January from Vysočany station where many policemen were deployed, carrying out identity checks on passengers and taking some individuals away. At Všetaty station, a cordon of policemen stood along the entire length of the train. Ali passengers were photographed and filmed. Three buses and several police vehicles stood at the station exit. The arriving citizens were stopped within the station precincts and searched by the police. They were then driven off by bus to the main building of the local co-operative farm for interrogation. Petr Holeček was savagely beaten up by police officers in the station lavatory, so that he suffered a broken nose and other injuries thatrequired his subsequent hospitalisation in Prague at the surgical department in Londýnská Street. After interrogation, alJ detainees were once more loaded on to buses and driven off to distant destinations. From the bus it could be seen that Všetaty was entirely cordoned off with all-terrain vehicles patrol- ling the fields and police road-blocks on all access roads. D46-D47 In connection with the suppression of the spontaneous demonstrations in Prague, the police picked up the follow- ing people from their homes or workplaces and detained them for 48 hours: František Melichar from Prague, who was imprisoned in the fifties for political reasons, Martin Palouš, a Charter 77 signatory, also from Prague, and Martin Věchet from Trutnov. In Brno, Charter 77 signa- tory Petr Pospíchal was detained by the police and driven to Znojmo, where he was held for 48 hours in a remand centre. In the course of questioning, the police interrogator threatened to shoot him. Charter 77 signatory Jiří Štencl (18) from Litovel was taken by police to a remand centre at Bruntál, where he was beaten unconscious. Charter 77 signatory Jaroslav Šabata from Brno was held for 48 hours in a remand cell at Hodonín. Charter 77 spokesman Tomáš Hradílek from Lipník nad Bečvou was taken to the remand centre in Přerov . Rudolf Bereza from Ostrava was also held for 48 hours. We assume that other citizens were also detained although they did not take part in any demonstra- tions. D47 29th January 1989 (Moscow) Message from Yelena Bonner, Andrei Sakharov, Larisa Bogoraz and Lev Timofeyev to the heads of state attending the Conference on Security and Co- operation in Europe We have learnt from the Western media and private sources that a campaign has recently been unleashed in Czechoslovakia against activists of the movement for democratisation of that country. Peaceful demonstrations have been broken up and their participants beaten up and arrested. Many of those arrested face possible trial and imprisonment. In the same period, official spokesmen have been speaking cynically about the inadequacy of the measures taken and the government is threatening a fur- ther escalation of violence. One would think that such a blatant violation of the human rights agreements just 127 [pageend132]D47-D49 reached in Vienna would arouse protests from official figures in all the countries involved in the talks on Euro- pean security and co-operation. So far, however, not only does the government-controlled media in the Soviet Union fail to condemn the actions of the Czechoslovak authorities, but its reporting ofthem supports the violence and slanders that society 's democratic movement. ln this con~ection, we feel it necessary to voice our concern about such a blatant violation of the Vienna accords. We believe the events in Czechoslovakia and the manner in which they are reported in the Soviet press merit specific attention at the Paris meeting in May on the human dimension of the CSCE. Yelena Bonner, Andrei Sakharov, Larisa Bogoraz, Lev Timofeyev D48 29th January 1989 (Roxbury, USA) Arthur Miller: Where is thefuture? (On the imprisonment of Václav Havel) Václav Havel is imprisoned again! I feel a particular sorrow at this news, a feeling that goes beyond Havel 's torment. But I am not hopeless. I am old enough to remember the impression, which no one used to question, that Czechs were our contemporaries, with very similar concepts of the future and modernity, of progress and morality. Now I cannot recognize Czechoslovakia. What kind of government repeatedly imprisons one of its most talented and honest sons? My mind halts at the doorway of this kind of justice, and I think the same is true of ninety-nine percent of the people who contemplate this new travesty. I happen to have been visiting Prague very soon after Jan Palach's self- immolation, an extremely complex act of affirmation and despair. I recall Czechs asking me whether I thought he had done a useful thing, or whether 128 DOCUMENTS it was merely one more futile gesture, perhaps even an explosion of egotism doomed to be washed down the memory hole of our age. In view of Palach 's suffering it was impossible at the time to deny its sublimity, but as the years passed the political utility of his action has ceased to be the point, at least for me. What became far more important was the manifest authenticity of his human identity as expressed.in his sacrifice. What other creature on earth could have imagined for himself the beauty of a future of freedom and justice to the point of self-immola- tion in its cause? The puff of smoke that for a short moment drifted over his lovely city was a monument far more solid than stone or steel, immeasurably more enduring, for man was born to freedom, it is his right at birth, in life and death. The new arrest of Václav Havel and the continuing harassment of other people dedicated to a free Czechoslo- vakia is simply an attempt to call back the smoke that Palach sent billowing into the sky. It cannot be done. The atoms of that swiftly passing shadow are mixed in the air we all breathe, they lie in the snows of the mountains and they cannot be called back, anymore. And so my despair transcends Václav Havel's anguish; it rises from the mindless waste that this vain act entails, from the barren repetitiousness of its ultimate futility. His jailers are catching at smoke, throwing a net over a cloud. The world knows that the fu ture is in Havel 's cell and the past is outside. D49 30th January 1989 Letter from students at the Academy of Creative Arts (AMU) to the presidium of the Centra! Committee of the Socialist Youth Union (SSM) concerning the events at Wenceslas Square and the SSM's statement of20th Janu- ary 1989 In recent days, the citizens of Prague have witnessed rallies by thousands of people at Wenceslas Square. Many [pageend133]DOCUMENTS of us passed through the square at the time those rallies were in progress, on the way to cultural activities, the cinema, or the Metro. Many of us witnessed - either directly or indirectly - what happened at those rallies purely out of professional curiosity, connected with our course of study. After the Centra! Comrnittee of the SSM issued its statement - published in Mladá fronta of 20th January 1989 - a li vely debate about those events started among students of the Academy of Creative Arts (AMU). At the request ofthe rank-and-file membership, the AMU SSM comrnittee held a meeting and mandated the faculty comrnittee of the SSM to organise special members' meet- ings from which there emerged fundamental disagreement with the statement of the SSM's Centra! Comrnittee. As humanistically-minded people we are unable and unwill- ing to endorse the actions of the security forces that we witnessed at Wenceslas Square. We believe those actions to have been in striking contradiction with the ideals of our nations and the ideology of the socialist republic. As students of the arts we are taught in the spirit of authentic humanitarian relations between people and nations with- out discrimination. For us, this attitude is a matter of honour and moral conviction. When we enrolled at our arts schools we pledged to the Czechoslovak people and state that: " ... With creative humility, while aiming for the highest standards, we shall perfonn and strive to work in a spirit of ethics, human sensibility, and human dignity. We will prevent the creation of and support for works propagating licence, violence, exploitation and enslave- ment, as well as manifestations liable to sap people 's moral fibre." (The academic oath.) lt is not our intention in this letter to comrnent on the legality or otherwise of the aforementioned gatherings. However, it strikes us that the fact that people took part in those demonstrations was a sign that they, and particularly the youth, are overcorning their indifference to civic issues, even though in some cases they attended the demonstrations merely out of natural human curiosity. Where we do take issue with the D49 statement, however, is when it maintains that this was a headstrong act of hooliganism or vandalism - anarchy, even. The youngsters involved neither caused material destruction nor indulged in violence. The inappropriate intervention by the Interior Ministry's units created stress- ful situations. We therefore demand that this be taken into consideration when people's behaviour is assessed and that no action be taken against citizens. The question of how people should be able to express their differing views is now becoming an urgent issue. We are of the view that the problems that led citizens to take part in those rallies could be solved another way without transgressing Czechoslovak laws, and without it leading to accusations of wishing of overthrow our system and state. The existing programrnes referred to in the SSM statement are pro babi y not flexible enough to be able to tackle the problems which have accumulated. No time must be Jost in drawing les- sons from this fact nor in tackling society's problems. We are in favour of democratisation, but democratisation is not an empty expression. It means something specific, which we would li.ke see put into practice. And our repre- sentatives and elected leaders should above all be aware of this fact. We request that the views expressed here be regarded as an attempt to improve the social climate at a time of ongoing refonns. As part of the ongoing dialogue in the media we request the publication of our views in full. (The text of this statement was approved at a special membership meeting of the faculty branch of the Socialist Youth Union held at the Academy of Film Art on 27th January, at the Academy ofMusic on 30th January and the Academy ofDramatic Art on 26th January 1989.)

To date, over 700 people employed in the world of culture here have voiced_ their support for him. Their numbers are growing daily, and they range from academics to songwriters, and from actors and directors to philosophers and writers. But the authorities go on keeping Havel in prison regardless. Our thanks goes out above all to all those of you who Jive here under the present conditions and have registered your solidarity with Václav Havel and your protest against the reprisals already suffered or still risked by those who took part in the tributes to Jan Palach 's memory at Wenceslas Square in January. Thank you for your under- standing. You have voiced your rejection of violence and declared that you know Václav Havel to be someone quite unlike the picture painted of him in our country's official media. In doing so you have also encouraged Václav Havel 's companions who were arrested and charged either for what they did not do, or for doing what was their moral and ci vic duty. Our thanks go not only to well-known figures, but also to those many citizens who made use of one of the names 130 DOCUMENTS and addresses unlawfully published in the press in a way not intended by the authorities and expressed their encour- agement to us personally, either by letter or phone. Olga Havlová, Ivan M. Havel D51 (Early February) Václav Havel writes from prison I am deeply moved and encouraged by the expressions of solidarity that I have heard about. What I consider most important is that even artists and academics employed in the official structures have supported me. lt is important not just for me but above all because it is evidence of a growing spirit of freedom and civic dignity within our society. D52 1st February 1989 Letter from the Czechoslovak Helsinki Committee to the Polish Helsinki Committee Dear Friends, lt was a pleasure to receive your letter of 25th January 1989. Thanks for your solidarity. We think it is a very good idea of yours to take steps to achieve an international solution of the human rights situation created in Czecho- slovakia by the authorities. These steps are urgently re- quired, among other reasons because at least three representatives, Václav Havel, Jana Petrová and Ota Veverka have been held in prison since 16th January. We think it extremely important that the new scope offered by the international monitoring mechanism established by [pageend135]DOCUMENTS the Vienna Concluding Document of the CSCE is being used and fully support this approach. We would also ask you to infonn the Vienna secretariat of our federation of these steps, and either via them or directly, the Helsinki committees in al! countries, so that the individua! Helsinki committees and the Intemational Helsinki Federation as a whole might adopt a similar approach if they so wish. · We would also like the Helsinki committees to support the proposal to include the question of the Czechoslovak state authorities' flouting of the CSCE Fina! Act on the agenda of the May CSCE meeting in Paris. This proposal has been tabled by four Soviet citizens: Larisa Bogoraz, Yelena Bonner, Andrei Sakharov and Lev Timofeyev (the latter being the president of the Soviet Helsinki Commit- tee). We welcome support for both these proposals: the Polish and the Soviet, not only from individua! Helsinki committees but also from other civic initiatives, particu- larly in those countries where Helsinki committees have not yet been established. Yours sincerely, The Czechoslovak Helsinki Committee Dr Jiří Hájek, Chairman, Kosatcová 11, 106 00 Prague 10 Appendix: 1. Letter from four Soviet citizens 2. Our Committee's reply to Moscow At the same time, the Czechoslovak Helsinki Comrnittee also sent the following request to the Secretariat of the Intemational Helsinki Feder- ation for Human Rights: a) that they should invite the individua( Helsinki committees to support the activity of the Polish and Soviet committees; b) that in those countries where Helsinki committees do not exist (e.g. France, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, etc.) they should ask other human rights organisations or initiatives (e.g. Amnesty Intemational, FIDH, etc.) to support the Polish and Soviet proposals. (Editorial note) D52-D53 D53 2nd February 1989 Covering letter to the Petition by Czechoslovak citizens conceming the events of 15th-21st January 1989, ad- dressed to the Czechoslovak authorities The Federal Assembly of the ČSSR, the President of the ČSSR, Dr Gustav Husák, the Federal Prime Minister, Ladislav Adamec, the Committee of the Czechoslovak Public for Human Rights and Humanitarian Co-operation, ČTK, the editors of Rudé právo In mid-January, officers of the Interier Ministry and other anned units committed repeated assaults on the peaceful civilian population. A number of citizens have felt impelled to express their feelings on public issues, particularly in view of the fact that they are confronted every day with the Czechoslovak media's insulting cam- paign of disinformation about the aforementioned events which were the most blatant - albeit not isolated - exam- ple in the recent period of how the observance of law in our country has deteriorated. A large number of com- plaints about the behaviour of police officers and People 's Militia have been sent to the editorial boards of newspa- pers, radio and television, as well as to higher inspection authorities of the Govemment, the Communist Party and the trade unions, along with requests for explanation and redress. However, the authors of those communications have neither had their views published nor received any truthful replies. As a result, a petition has spontaneously originated setting out how a considerable section of the public views the situation and requesting certain measures to solve it. Some of the sheets of signatures are being forwarded as they are received to the highest Czechoslovak authorities or the Committee of the Czechoslovak Public for Human Rights; some are being held by a number of volunteers who are establishing a list of the signatories to be sent to the aforementioned authorities and acting as guarantors of their authenticity. The wording of the petition varies in 131 [pageend136]D63 minor details, due evidently to different individua! reac- tions to the events. The following is the most frequent versi on of the text: In accordance with our right of petition enshrined in the Constitution of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, - we protest against the brutal assaults comrnitted in the recent period by police (VB) and security police (StB) officers against innocent citizens; - we demand the immediate release and exoneration of all persons unlawfully arrested in connection with the events in Prague during the period 15th-20th January 1989; - we emphatically repudiate the campaign of lies con- ducted by the Czechoslovak media concerning those events; - we call for an immediate investigation of all unlawful actions and criminal offences committed by officers of the Interior Ministry on those and other occasions, as well as a factual public account of the results of those investiga- tions and just punishment both of the culprits and those officials responsible for the police violence; - we resolutely demand the initiation forthwith of an open nation-wide dialogue on the causes of the state of economic and social decline which Czechoslovak society has sunk into in recent decades and on ways to halt and overcome it. Only then might webe able to take seriously the official slogans about "restructuring", "new thinking" and "the process of democratisation". Only then might it be possi- ble to believe that the signature ofthe ČSSR 's representa- tive on the Concluding Document of the Vienna CSCE Meeting is not merely an attempt to deceive world public opinion. Prague and Czechoslovakia, January 1989 (There follow _the names, occupations, addresses and signatures of the petitioners.) 132 DOCUMENTS By 31st January 1989, the petition had been signed by at least 2101 persons, but it is quite likely that there are many more that we do not know about. Prom the occupational details supplied by most of the signatories, the social composition ofthe petitions' supporters would be roughly as follows: Manual workers: 22% 462 Artists 15% 315 Students and apprentices 9% 189 Technicians 8% 168 Technical professions 8% 168 Civil servants 6% 126 Pensioners, housewives 5% 105 Cultural workers and journalists (half of the latter being media employees) 5% 105 Doctors and health workers 5% 105 Scientists 4% 84 Service employees 3% 63 Libera! professions 3% 63 State employees 1% 21 Clergy 0.7% 15 Managerial staff 0.3% 7 Others · 5% 105 Prague 80% provincial towns and urban districts 9% small towns 6% rural 5% These data are only a rough guide, partly because more and more citizens are coming forward to sign the petition all the time. If possible, we will record and publish any eventual changes in the percentages given here. Evidently, the petition 's signatories are not a "pressure group", but simply decent citizens sharing a concem that Czechoslovak society should develop along positive li nes.

A list of 636 signatories was previously sent on 27th January to the Federal Assembly, the office of the Presi- dent of the Republic and the ČTK press agency. D54 2nd February 1989 (Gottwaldov-Zlín) Letter from the Comrnunity of Friends of the USA to the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly Ladies and gentlemen, We recently sent you a wide-ranging petition signed by 430 Czechoslovak citizens. In it we pointed to the discrep- ancies between citizens' constitutional rights and in- stances of lawlessness which have now reached an intolerable level in our society. We asked you to grant a number of requests that we still regard as essential pre- conditions if Czechoslovak society is to become a truly democratic system. These included the release ofpolitical prisoners, respect for freedom of association, freedom of speech and freedom of the press; an end to discrimination against activists of the independent initiatives and the misuse of the media for the purpose of lies, slander and incitement against all those people who act in accordance with their conscience and convictions. D53-D54 Those were the main demands set out in our petition. We trusted that you would pay due attention to our re- quests and respond to them in a manner appropriate to a civilized country with an advanced lega! system. And the response came. Thousands of policemen and members of the Comrnunist Party 's illegal troops used the tribute to Jan Palach 's memory as an excuse to invade the streets of our capital city and, with unconcealed hatred, prescribed for the peacefully assembled citizens a new version of an old remedy: a dialogue, yes, but only with our truncheons, dogs, tear gas, armoured personnel carri- ers and water-cannon. A six-day offensive against the civilian population ensued, culminating in the hysterical police occupation of Jan Palach 's grave in Všetaty. It was accompanied by a campaign of lies, slander and witch hunts in the mass media against selected individuals or groups of citizens. The numbers of political prisoners rocketed and hundreds of citizens have been charged. The witch hunts and slander campaigns continue. It looks as if the regime has decided on the final liquidation of every- thing originating spontaneously at the grass roots, every- thing that clamours for freedom and democracy. It would be naive to suppose that all of you who sit in the government or Federal Assembly are totally unin- formed about the current wave of violence and repression in our society. The official media have brought us reports of declarations in which you identify yourselves fully with the brutal behaviour of the police and People's Militia during the peaceful gatherings at Wenceslas Square in Prague. We don 't intend to judge anyone. One may merely deplore your attitude. The fact is that we profoundly believe that violence and terror will never succeed in suppressing people's natural yeaming for freedom and justice. And neither truncheon blows nor imprisonment will blunt this belief. After the massacre at Amritsar, Mahatma Gandhi declared: "I cannot maintain any respect or favour for a govemment that has gone from one evil to another in order to protect its imrnorality. I have therefore 133 [pageend138]D54-D55 made so bold as to propase non-co-operation which en- ables those who wish to have no connection with the government to do so. The latter must then, without vio- lence, compel the government to alter its ways and rectify its misdeeds." Should you decide, however, to pursue further your futile policy of violence and prolong the unjust imprisonment of Petr Cibulka, Tomáš Dvořák , Václav Havel, Ivan Jirous, Hana Marvanová, Jana Petrová, Eva Vidlařová and many other citizens, we shall be obliged to embrace Mahatma Gandhi's above-quoted idea. In such a case, civil disobedience would be the only possible response to the immoral polici es of the authorities and the only way for people to assert themselves as citi- zens. In view of the seriousness of our declaration, it would be better if you regard this as an open letter.

And the Soviet playwright Shatrov is wrong ( unless it 's just subterfuge) when he makes out in his play "Dictatorship of Conscience" (being performed at the Workers' Theatre in Zlín 1) that communisrn is a noble idea that merely needs purging of evil; thaťs impossible - it is evil. 134 DOCUMENTS I didn't go to Wenceslas Square that day because l'd have certainly rushed into something and got myselfkilled by them in the process. They say that people were shouting "fascists" and "Gestapo" at them. No way! They are not brutal because they have lost their nerve or got out of control. They're not "fascist-like". They are separate and autonomous species in whom bestiality is born and bred - and manipulated. So next time you should shout "com- munists" at them and they won't take offence-in the same way that a pig won't take umbrage if you call it one (according to Klement Gottwald). Moreover, they're not bestial only when they're beating people up, they're that way all the time: when they 're holding meetings, exchang- ing opinions, lecturing, educating or broadcasting. And this !atest display is only a practical demonstration of their own words. "We have the leading role", they say ex cathedra, and anyone who denies it gets a walloping - thaťs one thing they're agreed on. It goes without saying that if you're "leading" something you have to give it a whack. So there you have it. With its back to the wall on account of its own actions, communism has given up its century-old scholarly flirtation with Hegel and ended up battering people: iťs in its philosophical genes. And when the latter combine with the biological genes of North Moravian2 thuggery, communism "puts forth a scarlet flower". They always were beating somebody, of course, only they used to do it secretly or behind closed doors, unbe- known to other people or counting on their debased a ware- ness. In that respect, the recent events have been a move away from darkness towards the light. And thaťs not all the government has been doing to assist us: after twenty years of suppressing information about every manifesta- tion of civic dissent it has also made room in the media for Charter 77 and other groups, and given publicity to certain worthy names. It has at last fired young people 's interest in Jan Palach! With the very worst of intentions, Rudé právo published the rhapsodic programme of the Czech [pageend139]00CUMENTS Children: though its text must have charmed many of the paper's readers as it bubbled like a forest spring amid st the surrounding verbal sludge. There's one real poser I don't have an answer to yet. Where did they manage to find so many thugs, both uniformed and otherwise? Who trained and directed them? And when we've seen the back of the present stopgap govemment, what will we do with somany moral defectives? The idea of a "common European home" is currently germinating both West and East, and the first basic legal instruments are tentatively laying the founda- tions of a more humane order within it. When that home is eventually set up, actions which are the product of a criminal disposition will be brought to trial. No doubt thousands of those indicted for cruel ty in the performance oftheir duty will try to use the oldNuremberg alibi: "I was only following orders". It would therefore be worth the effort to get the following clause inserted in a future European lega) code: All those who obey orders contrary to humanity shall forfeit their civil rights.

Ed.) D56 6th February 1989 (Paris) Letter from the Paris-based lntemational Committee for the Support of Charter 77 to the French President Frarn;:ois Mitterand Dear Mr President, In Prague, on 9th December last year, you met the play- wright Václav Havel, the defender of human rights in Czechoslovakia. This world-renowned author was ar- rested on 16th January and is still in custody, facing a possible prison term of up to two years. Mr Havel 's 055 - 057 offence is to have laid flowers in memory of the Czech student, Jan Palach, who bumt himself to death in Prague twenty years ago in protest against the prevailing lack of freedom in his country. We appeal to you, Mr President, to avail yourself of your high office to rernind the Czechoslovak government ofthe pledges made by itin the field ofhuman rights when it signed the Helsinki Final Act, pledges renewed only recently at the follow-up conference in Vienna. The arrest and imprisonment of Václav Havel and other peaceful supporters of the independent citizens' initiatives are a major obstacle to the construction of a common "Euro- pean home", a concept also endorsed by the leaders of the Czechoslovak state. Yours respectfully, France de Nicolay, Secretary ofthe International Commit- tee for the Support of Charter 77 D57 10th February 1989 Joint Charter 77 / Helsinki Committee Document: "Our attitude towards the Vienna document". (Charter 77 Doc- ument No. 11/89; Czechoslovak Helsinki Committee No. 40/89) To the President of the ČSSR, the ČSSR Federal Assem- bly, the ČSSR Government, the Czechoslovak Committee for European Security and Co- operation, the Committee of the Czechoslovak Public for Human Rights and Hu- manitarian Co-operation, the lntemational Helsinki Fed- eration for Human Rights In common with all other citizens seriously concemed about events here at home and abroad, we welcome the successful conclusion of the Vienna CSCE Meeting. We 135 [pageend140]D57 concur with the Czechoslovak representative when he declared on 17th January 1989 that the Concluding Doc- ument was "the outcome of positive determination, real- ism and new approaches to the problems of today's world". It is a major contribution to the overall process of overcoming world tension, and reviving awareness ofthe reality of a community of nations. It is also a challenge to the latter to co-operate in the construction of a common European home. What lends the document its particular emphasis and dynamics is what is described in its text as the "human dimension" of the CSCE, in other words, the new provisions on human rights and fundamental free- doms, as well as the clauses concerning the development of and support for human contacts and relations within the framework of European co- operation. All participating states reiterate that respect for human rights and funda- mental freedoms is an essential factor for peace, justice and security, necessary to ensure the development of friendly relations and co- operation in Europe and throughout the world. Similarly, in the spirit of the well- known principie of the Helsinki Fina! Act that individuals have the right "to know their rights and duties and act upon them" it accords the exercise of that right an active role in the process of détente, confidence- building and the cre- ation of an atmosphere of security and co-operation in Europe. Not only states and their authorities, not only official institutions and govemmental organisations, but also ordinary citizens and their associations may be active and legitirnate partners in that process. Everything that was acknowledged in that respect in Madrid in 1983 was confirmed categorically in Vienna. Participating states pledge to recognise, respect, and directly encourage such initiatives, eliminating all obstacles to their activity and guaranteeing their freedom to express their views on prob- lems of the Helsinki process, particularly conceming its human dirnension. Thus, together with the other provis- ions conceming freedom of belief, minority rights, and official arbitrariness, the participating states (i.e. includ- 136 DOCUMENTS ing our Republic) are creating a common concept of European co-operation: co-operation between legitimate states and their fully-fledged citizens. All the provisions in the document are worded as an expression of the com- mon determination of all participating states, and each of them accepts those provisions as pledges not only to their negotiating partners but - in the human dimension - to their own people, to each of their citizens. Speaking on behalf of the govemment, the Czechoslovak Foreign Min- ister assured the participants in the talks that "the ČSSR has always been among those countries working for the consistent fulfilment and creative evolution of the Helsinki process" (v. Rudé právo of 19th January 1989). However, the reality and experience of many years, and in particular what happened in Prague at the very moment that speech was being delivered in Vienna, serve to de- value those assurances. If the Czechoslovak administra- tion and leadership wish in future to rank among those who consistently fulfil the principles and commitments of the CSCE, these words must be accompanied by and give rise to clear actions. Those of our citizens who are follow- ing the Helsinki process may note with a certain moral satisfaction that a whole number of proposals and sugges- tions have been put forward both within the Charter 77 framework and by individuals, even if this satisfaction is tinged with regret that so far they have been ignored by the relevant authorities. All the more forcefully, therefore, do they now demand the fulfilment of the pledges and promises set out in the Vienna CSCE document. 1. Above all, it is a comrnitrnent to publish in the forseeable future complete texts not only of the latest CSCE document but also the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (not published here since 1968), and the lntemational Human Rights Covenants, as well as the legal norms goveming human, civil, economic, social and cultural rights. 2. Knowledge about human rights should be effectively incorporated in teaching curricula and educational pro- [pageend141]DOCUMENTS grammes at all levels, as well as in extra-mural education and the programmes of the mass media. 3. In line with the appeal contained in the Vienna Document, the Czechoslovak government ought to revise its existing reservations about the Intemational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In particular, it should a) in accordance with article 41 of that Covenant, recognise the competence of the Human Rights Committee set up under that Covenant; further, it should accept and discuss com- munications from other parties to the Covenant concern- ing shortcomings in its application here; and b) sign the optional protocol to that Covenant, concerning the right of citizens to make direct approaches to that Committee. 4. Since, with their ratification on 23rd March 1976, the Covenants became a part of our legislation, it would be necessary, a) to ensure that interpretation of the respec- tive provisions of our legislation always comply with the Covenant; b) to revise those provisions which directly contravene both the Covenants and the conclusions and pledges of the CSCE (particularly as regards our criminal law, where discrepancies are most flagrant). 5. It is necessary to revise the legal code and the respective administrative regulations and practice in line with the pledge to respect citizens' rights to work for the implementation of CSCE commitrnents, particularly in the human rights sphere (in the human dirnension of the CSCE), to associate together to that end, to establish mutual contacts within their own country and within the framework of the community of CSCE states, as well as to remove all obstacles to that activity and ensure freedom of oral and written expression (including in the press) concerning CSCE matters. 6. The credibility ofCzechoslovakia's efforts at imple- menting the Helsinki process was seriously undermined by the brutal actions of the authorities during the period 15th to 21st January 1989, at the very moment when the document - which among other things-commits its signa- tories to prevent, prohibit or punish "cruel, inhuman or D57 degrading" treatrnent of people by national authorities - was being signed. We request the constitutional authorities to join with representatives of Charter 77, VONS and the Czechoslovak Helsinki Committee in an investigation into the course of those days' events in Prague and their repercussions, in order to determine responsibility and draw the necessary conclusions. There must also be a halt to the prosecutions and other discriminatory measures against all victims of the recent repression. A truthful account ofthe investigations must be published and, in the spirit of the afore-mentioned pledge in the document, steps must be taken to prevent any recurrence of such phenomena. Such steps could be taken without delay and at no great cost. Their outcome, particularly in the light of the forthcoming Conference on the Human Dimension to be held in Paris in May and June of this year, could favourably affect those negotiations. Charter 77 and the Czechoslovak Helsinki Committee reiterate that their representatives are ready and willing to provide details of the above proposals and take part in talks about them, as well as about other possible steps towards implementing the princip les and provisions of the Vienna document. They will be considering further possi- ble measures towards fulfilling the conclusions, princip les and provisions of the CSCE before submitting further proposals in this connection. They believe that itwould be fully in accord with the spirit of the document and of the statements made by different participating states, includ- ing our own, if the authorities charged with its implemen- tation were finally to initiate a practical, constructive and fruitful dialogue with those who have long been dealing with the matters in question and wish to assist in solving their problems and tasks. On behalf of Charter 77: Tomáš Hradílek, Dana Němcová, Saša Vondra - spokespersons On behalf of the Czechoslovak Helsinki Committee: Jiří Hájek - Chairman 137 [pageend142]D58 D58 11th February 1989 Rudé právo: We are relying on all honest people. From the speech given by the General Secretary of the Czechoslo- vak Communist Party Miloš Jakeš on 9th February at a meeting with top media executives ( ... ) Another key issue in the present phase is the activisa- tion of anti- socialist forces and various groups that are trying to create and act as an opposition. Their actions have widespread support and assistance in the West. The radio stations, Radio Free Europe, Voice of America and others play a direct role in their organisation. A new phenomenon in the activity of anti-socialist forces is the transition from covert operations to attempts at open con- frontation, including the encouragement of psychological pressure, intimidation and even psychological terror against people who remain firrn in their support of social- ism and have publicly condemned their activities. The recent period has also seen attempts to organise and mis- use petitions, particularly among cultural workers and other groups of intellectuals. Attempts are also being made to exploit young people's Jack of experience, and even their confusion. And nowadays the actions of the anti-so- cialist forces are even supported by various criminal ele- ments. The tactic of the illegal groups is to cal! into question the State 's right to take action against those who violate the Constitution, the laws and public order. Nor can one ignore the activity of illegal church struc- tures, and even of some church leaders and their attempts to exploit the religious feelings of a section of believing citizens in an anti-socialist direction. There is a fundamen- tal need for us to counteract these attempts by the consis- tent irnplementation of our policy towards the churches and believers, the absolute majority of whom make an honest contribution towards the development of our soci- ety. There is also an upswing in activity by certain erstwhile leaders of political parties from 1968 who are seeking to 138 DOCUMENTS organise a so-called "Club of Socialist Renewal". They purport to be pioneers of restructuring and are trying to rehabilitate themselves and the policies they pursue. Nor is it a coincidence that during January's acts of incitement the anti- socialist forces even tried to misuse the negotiations regarding the Concluding Document of the Vienna follow-up meeting. The activity of these forces provided the opportunity for a fresh campaign against Czechoslovakia, the Party and socialism by certain polit- ical circles in the West, even though there are also some realistic attitudes· there. Our position is unequivocal: we have signed the Con- cluding Document; we took an active part in its drafting; and we will implement it. Its text will be published here in an extensive print run. However, in keeping with the Fina! Act of the Helsinki Conference we cannot allow attempts to disturb the sovereignty of our State such as those made by certain western political circles and media. Public opinion about the activities of the anti-socialist forces and illegal groups is categorical among the over- whelming majority of citizens. They condemn their activ- ity and demand law and order and conditions for calm and creative work. They want to continue in the spirit of the line already traced out, namely, restructuring and democratisation. We will not be deflected from this course. This is the unyielding stance of the leadership of the Party, National Front and Govemment. We must take every opportunity to find a more effective solution to problems which have a whole number of subjective causes, in addition to objective circumstances - problems which hostile forces seek to exploit. This concems our economy, first and foremost, such as the stabilisation of the market, the implementation of economic reforrn, and a thorough fulfilment of the decisions we have taken. At the same time, it is necessary to conduct a combative dialogue with all those who are in favour of socialism, with the exception of overt enemies. We must win over all honest people and work with former mem bers of the Party, [pageend143]DOCUMENTS who by and large contribute to the development of social- ist society. It is also necessary to win over those citizens who are being manipulated and do not have a clear stand- point. We must foster people 's persuasion that the path we have embarked on is the right one, that we are capable of fulfilling our tasks and coping with the problems we encounter. The political approach does not imply, of course, that we shall tolerate illegal activities, public order distur- · bances, threats to the safety of decent people, or allow the latter to be harassed or terrorised on the pretext of democ- racy. Whenever legality is infringed this approach must be adopted promptly and unswervingly, irrespective of those involved. This is a matter for the state and the appropriate authorities, and not the business of pressure groups." ( ... ) D59 11th February 1989 Message from the students of the Comenius Evangelical Theological Faculty to the Czechoslovak Federal Assem- bly Dear Deputy, Book of Proverbs, 31, 8-9: Open thy mouth for the dumb, In the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction. Open thy mouth, judge righteously, And plead the cause of the poor and needy. Like many of our fellow-citizens, we are angry about the unrestrained assaults by para-military units on 28th Octo- ber 1988 and during the period 15th to 21st January 1989, as well as about the unobjective reporting of the entire affair by the media. We believe that those events were the logical outcome of the deepening demoralisation of our society. It is a crisis that affects the very roots of our nations' existence. As Christians, we believe that God is the supreme authority, D58-D60 and it is above al! from that position that we must protest when the state becomes an instrument of lawlessness. We have no other option today, therefore, but to condemn the violence that occurred as well as its official justifications. We are convinced that there can be no solution to the situation created without the active involvement of all citizens. We therefore appeal to you to use your authority to support a solution to the present crisis. lt is necessary, first and foremost, to prevent any victimisation of those who availed themselves of their constitutional right to express their views. Action must be taken to assess the degree of responsibility of specific individuals for the violence com- mitted. Please be assured of the sincerity of our intentions and take seriously what we have to say.

D60 16th February 1989 Czechoslovak citizens' petition - further signatories On 2nd February 1989, a petition by Czechoslovak citi- zens was handed in to the Federal Assembly ofthe ČSSR, the President of the Republic, the Federal Prime Minister, the Committee of the Czechoslovak Public for Human Rights, ČTK, and the editors ofRudé právo, with a request that it be published. So far this has not happened. How- ever, on 15th February, an addendum to the petition was 139 [pageend144]D60-D61 sent with a second request for its publication. The text reads as follows: To The Federal Assembly of the ČSSR , the President of the Republic, the Prime Minister of the ČSSR , the Cornmittee of the Czech oslov ak Public for Human Rights and Humanitarian Co-operation, the Prosecutor General Re: Further signatures to the Czechoslovak citizens' petition conceming the events of 15th-21st January 1989 On 2nd February we informed Czechoslovakia's su- preme authorities and the ČTK press a9ency about a petition by citizens reacting to the January events in and to the overal! situation in Czechoslovak society at the present time. We wish to draw your attention to the fact that as of 15th February 1989, a further 1266 persons, at least, had appended their signatures, bringing the total of signatories to a minimum of 3367. In terms of social stratification, the increase has been above all in the manufacturing sector, i.e. among techni- cians and manual workers, as well as among scientists. The proportion of artists has dropped markedly, since, from all reports, it was chiefly they who were responsible for this particular citizens' initiative. The present compo- sition is therefore as follows: Manual workers Artists Technical professions Technicians Students and apprentices Civil servants Pensioners and housewives Cultural workers and joumalists Scientists Doctors and health workers Teachers and social workers Service employees Liberal professions Others 140 23% 12% 10% 10% 8% 6% 5% 5% 5% 4.5% 4% 4% 2.5% 1% 774 404 337 337 269 202 168 168 168 152 135 135 84 34 DOCUMENTS In terms of demographic stratification the representation of Prague inhabitants has fallen markedly in favour of citizens of other towns: Prague 64% Provincial capitals and Urban districts 23% Small towns 9% Rural 4% According to reliable sources, more and more citizens are signing the petition. Should there be any substantial change in the numbers or the social stratification of the signatories we will once more endeavour to make these known. We believe that in view of the scope of this initiative and the content of the petition, the latter may be regarded as a "citizens' suggestion", and for this reason we are also forwarding a copy of our communication to the Prosecutor General of the ČSSR. We vouch for the authenticity of the signatures entered on the attached list. We ask you to acknowledge receipt of this communication and take the necessary steps to pub- lish it, along with our previous letter.

D61 16th February 1989 Statement by the Movement for Civil Liberties: Paths to democracy in the wake of the January events Just a few short weeks have passed since the January events. It is clear none the less that they represent an important milestone in our most recent history. For an [pageend145]DOCUMENTS entire week people from Prague and other parts took to the streets of the capital where they were beaten, assailed with water-cannon, armoured personnel carriers and police dogs and risked persecution at the hands of the police, the authorities and the courts. In so doing, the thousands and tens of thousands who took part were voicing their forth- right rejection of the regime's efforts to maintain them as a silent and passive mass. Their protests reflect society's growing determination to decide its own future. More and more people are un- willing to look on in silence while their lives, the li ves of their children, and the fruit of their work are manipulated by a regime that feels responsibility to no one. The public rejects the malicious campaign waged against the demon- strators, the citizens' initiatives and all manifestations of independence. Even a considerable number of employees in the fields of culture and learning have joined with industrial workers, entire workforces and students in call- ing for freedom of expression and voicing support for al! those unjustly imprisoned. In particular they have come out in support of the writer Václav Havel. A sirnilar stand has been taken by the representative of the Catholic Church, the Archbishop of Prague, Cardinal František Tomášek. In spite of this manifest evidence of society 's politi cal emancipation, the official media are continuing their un- scrupulous campaign of lies and calumnies against those who demonstrate civic courage and seek a way out of society's crisis. A particularly sorry chapter in this whole campaign is the exploitation of extreme reactions to the social crisis. There is no way we can determine the reli- ability of the reports of terrorist threats put out in recent days. We have no idea who is behind those provocations or the terrorist attack in Ústí nad Labem. What is certain, however, is that the regime is exploiting them to blacken and discredit the different independent citizens' initia- tives. It is hardly necessary to emphasise yet again that terrorist methods of all kinds are entirely incompatible D61 with our ethical and political principles and at variance with the declared principles of al] the other citizens' ini- tiatives. On the contrary, it is the authorities which reject dialogue and instead provoke violence. It is they who employing brutality against citizens. At the same time they are deliberately dramatising the situation and fostering a climate of confrontation within society. The !atest lega! measures adopted do nothing to improve the state of public order or protect citizens' rightful interests. Instead they have brought the country to the brink of a state of emergency. In the face of the current profound crisis we declare once again that we are advocates of nation-wide dialogue as the only possible means of restoring confidence and initiative within society. Without such confidence or a determination on the part of the majority of our citizens to take part in putting our affairs to rights and implementing fundamental political and economic reforms, we will be- come a country without a future. We will be overtaken by a disaster, the nature and extent of which can already be gauged. There can be no exclusions from a nation-wide dialogue. One cannot exclude the citizens' initiatives, which were working for a constructive dialogue long before it became an official slogan. One cannot exclude from it the churches, the social organisations, economic managers at all levels, the new government or, of course, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. Ladislav Adamec 's govemment came into office on a platform that acknowledged the state of the Czechoslovak economy to be considerably worse than had previously been officially assumed, and that this had deep-seated historical causes. This throws new light on the many critical voices who for years on end drew attention to the erroneous concepts and dubious practices within the life of society. Notwithstand- ing, the political leadership continues to display an unwill- ingness to learn from its own mistakes and just keeps up the same old inane monologue, impervious to any alter- native opinion. It is an aberrant policy whose harmful- 141 [pageend146]D61 - D62 nes sis realised not only by the general public but also by many Communist Party members and officials. The dramatic backdrop to this stagnation are the fun- damental changes taking place in the Soviet Union, Po- land and Hungary. Our country's political leadership is taking a conspicuous stand against those trends. Out of fear for their own status they are resisting radical changes and becorning in the process the main protagonists of Stalinist concepts in Eastem Europe. The ramifications of this represent a major threat to the process of détente which the Vienna CSCE meeting pushed ahead in such a remarkable fashion. We wish to point out most eamestly the responsibility bome at this present time by the top political leaders in this country. For many of them, the weight of their pasts, their own part in the deepening stagnation and in fostering Brezhnevite conceptions of "really existing socialism" lead them to fear for their own positions. Hence they are afraid of direct talks with ourcountry's citizens. They have become accustomed to using repression as a means of tackling trickier situations and they are now clearly at a loss. Before they start pointing the accusing finger at the middle ranks of officialdom, they should start to consider their own responsibility. In the circumstances, we feel bound to press the fol- lowing demands: 1. We call for the resignation of those members of the political Ieadership who, though responsible for the pres- ent state of society, continue to limit scope for dialogue and block fundamental political and economic change. 2. We call on the Deputies of the Federal Assembly, to recognise their responsibility towards the people and re- fuse to ratify the legal measures adopted by its Presidium on 14th February 1989 which reinforce existing repressive lega! powers against citizens. 3. We urge that citizens' rightful demands and the requirements of public order be met not by the restriction of fundamental civil rights or the adoption of emergency 142 DOCUMENTS lega! provisions and further repressive measures against citizens, but on the contrary by action on the part of the country's political leadership, govemment and legislative bodies to respect civil rights, above all by guaranteeing all citi;zens and independent initiatives freedom of assembly, freedom of association and freedom of expression. The recognition and guarantee of those civil rights and free- doms is an essential condition for the involvement of citizens in the process of political and economic change, as well as in public affairs and in the social dialogue - the all-embracing, open debate about the path to democracy.

A large section of Czechoslovakia's ar- tistic and academic community - some three thousand personalities - have signed two petitions calling for their release and supporting all the victims of the January events in Prague. Protest was also voiced by Cardinal Tomášek, as well as a number of trade-union and youth or- ganisations, and many other Czechoslovak citizens. At the [pageend147]DOCUMENTS same time, a whole number of different solidarity actions are being organised abroad in support of all the victims. There are so many new ones emerging all the time that it is impossible for us to thank al] the groups and individuals whose concern has been aroused by recent developments . in Czechoslovakia - quite legitimately so in view of the fact that while the Concluding Document of the Vienna talks was being signed, the centre of Prague saw a display of violence of a kind not witnessed since 1969. All of us here sense that the evolution towards greater security, confidence and co-operation is being seriously jeopardised. We have additional, substantial grounds for believing so. In Vienna, the Czechoslovak government pledged, in accordance with Principie 13, to develop its laws, regulations and policies in the field of civil, political and other rights and fundamental freedoms and implement them in order to guarantee effective exercise of these rights and freedoms. Less than a month Jater, on 14th February 1989, the presidium of the ČSSR, in the presence of the General Secretary of the Communist Party, Miloš Jakeš, adopted a legal measure which at a stroke increases two-fold the Jeve] of penalties that can be incurred by participants in totally peaceful public assemblies of the English "Speakers' Corner" variety. Moreover it also in- cludes a clause that has horrifying implications in terms of legal and political culture. This new legal provision states that "anyone who drafts, or assists the drafting and dissemination of printed materials whose content harms the socialist State's concern for maintaining public order" will receive a prison sentence of up to 6 months or a fine not exceeding 20,000 crowns. Take note: there is nothing here about specific people actually disturbing public order on the street or elsewhere. The threat of a six-month prison-sentence now hangs over anyone who puts out a text offending the rulers of the day, as well as over anyone who assists them or passes the text on. Vague regulations about "harming the State's concern for maintaining public order" can be applied without difficulty to all independent D62 publications, petitions, statements or tracts. And that reg- ulation, which is Czechoslovakia 's own peculiar way of implementing the Vienna accord, was printed in bold on the title page of the official newspapers. Another pledge that the Czechoslovak government made in Vienna was to prohibit cruel, inhuman or degrad- ing treatment of citizens and that it would take effective legislative, administrative, judicial and other measures to prevent and punish such practices. Shocked by the January events, the public here is demanding that the culprits be brought to book. And what is the outcome? On 21st February, it will be not the ruffians who are dueto be tried, but those who have been seeking to protect their fellow citizens from violence and tyranny: Václav Havel, two of the current Charter 77 spokespersons, Dana Němcová and Saša Vondra, former Charter 77 spokesperson Jana Sternová, a representative of the lndependent Peace Asso- ciation Jana Petrová, a representative of the Czech Chil- dren Petr Placák, Charter 77 signatory David Němec and two founder members of the John Lennon Peace Club Otakar Veverka and Stanislav Penc, Jr. Their crime? Want- ing to lay flowers by the statue of St Wenceslas in the afternoon of 16th January. That is the main reason, Ladies and Gentlemen, why we are approaching you once more. It is not our intention to plead the cause of our indicted friends. They do not need it. What might have escaped attention, however, is the profounder international aspect of these trials. lf in any other participating state there was a resumption of perse- cution against people of great moral authority, the Helsinki community would regard it as a danger signal. The fact that the present Czechoslovak leadership has chosen to ignore so blatantly not only public opinion at home but also the protests of the intemational community is also a danger signal. It creates the danger that the practice of signing agreements and not implementing them will go on as before. The forces of Stalinism, the forces of yesteryear, are not surrendering. And it would be 143 [pageend148]D62-D63 foolish to underestimate their supranational links and ties of co-operation. Arthur Miller wrote that "the future is in Havel 's cell and the past is outside". Iťs beautifully put, but iťs a humiliating thought. Can we really allow our fu ture - and yours- to languish behind bars? Those who gaoled Václav Havel and his fellow-detainees count on getting away with it again. They assume that the momentary protests will die away and they will have their own way once more. Let us join in showing them that this time they are mistaken.

The last thing I hear Is your cowardice It screams in the fields DOCUMENTS It roars in the towns It whimpers at the crossroads It yells in fear of death And doesn't realise that death is a waming and a Iure From church-towers the death-knell tolls For nation and country In the name of your life I bum Jan On 25th February 1969, a little more than a month after Jan Palach's death, Jan Zajíc, a 19-year-old student at the College of Railway Engineering from Vítkov in the dis- trict of Opava, bumed himself to death at Wenceslas Square in Prague. His action, like that of Jan Palach, was motivated by a love of the truth. Both of them sought to stirnulate people to protest against lies and injustice, as well as against self-seeking acquiescence. Even by then, Jan Zajíc's death was overshadowed by the name of Palach and its irnpact was dulled by normalisation's continued advance. Twenty years on, the anniversary of Palach's self-immolation was the sign for an entire week of spontaneous demonstrations unprece- dented in Czechoslovakia since normalisation. We believe that we all owe much to the memory of Jan Zajíc. A young man who decided to sacrifice his life in order to arouse his fellow citizens from their growing lethargy ought not to be forgotten. Let us try, at least now - twenty years on, to react to Jan Zajíc's action. Not demonstratively this time, but al! of us in our own locality and as each of us sees fit. It depends on each one of us how things tum out in this country. All around us, we see lies and injustice. We are all witnesses of irresponsible, foolhardy and careerist decision-making. Let us refuse to put up with it. When they are made singly, appeals, complaints and protests can [pageend149]DOCUMENTS be hushed up. When they come in their thousands - when all those affected by an unjust decision will raise their voices in protest, it will be impossible to hush them up, ignore them or misrepresent them. Let us wake up to the fact that our countryside is not devastated by official decrees, but by ourselves, when we implement those de- crees. Let us remember that power, according to our Constitution, belongs to the people, not the governing authorities. The fact that, for fear of unpleasantness, we unprotestingly carry out each and every order, no matter ťrom whom, or we fail to speak out even when we know something is bad or harmful, makes us authors ofin justice and wrongdoing. No one can do it for us. If we sit around waiting for someone else to -do something about our la- mentable situation then we 'li wait for ever. lť s not true that individuals can have no influence on affairs. Ap- proach your elected representatives at every level of rep- resentative authority from local councils up to the Federal Assembly of the ČSSR. They are not our lords and mas- ters. They are supposed to be the administrators of our country anťl the trustees of our common property. Cali attention to every injustice and refuse to be fobbed off. In our daily lives we all encounter many things we do not agree with. Let us refuse to be silent. Let us criticise, let us seek and suggest remedies of benefit to all concemed. Our countryside, our economy and our society are in a deplorable state. Let us try to change and remedy matters. It depends on us, first and foremost. Let us not be afraid to sacrifice a quiet life and our creature comforts. Let us not seek refuge in anonymity. After all, Jan Palach and Jan Zajíc had the courage to sacrifice their dearest possession - their li ves. At the end of his farewell letter, Jan Zajíc wrote: "Let my torch enkindle your hearts and light up your minds. May my torch Ught the way to a free and happy Czecho- slovakia." Let us try to heed his call. Tomáš Hradílek Dana Němcová Saša Vondra Charter 77 spokespersons D64 D63- D64 20th February (Bratislava) Letter to Václav Havel from the Slovak writer Ivan Hoffmann, one of the publishers of the independent mag- azíne Fragment-K Dear Mr Havel, One of these days, and we all hope it will be soon, you will be back amongst us again, and I can imagine with what emotion you will read the list of those who signed their names to appeal s for your release. Every one of those who overcame their indifference to public matters or their fear ofthe regime and its hysterical reactions, and bravely took part in this act of solidarity linked their destinies with your own. By openly expressing their rejection of the status quo, hundreds of cultural workers became artists and moral authorities in the eyes oftheir nation. For a cultural worker is not necessarily synonymous with being an artist. The first describes a way of making a living, the second implies an intrinsic involvement in the fate of humanity. Ali the same, when the moment comes for you to read the names of those well- known and lesser known artists I would sooner not be present. The fact is that I could not fail to notice something that will probably escape your attention, namely, the lack of support you received from my Slovakia. I would be ashamed. And it is out of shame that I am writing to you. To say that people in Slovakia are more frightened than people in Bohemia or Moravia would probably be an over-simplification, After decades, here, as elsewhere in Czechoslovakia, fear is deliberately incorporated into the lives of citizens, who are constantly aware of their depen- dence on the state bureaucracy and the regime, In such an atmosphere one cannot condemn fear. It is something nonnal, lt is my belief, however, that there is another, more serious, reason for the unwillingness of the majority of Slovak cultural workers to join with their Czech col- 145 [pageend150]D64 leagues. I refer to the state of Slovak culture. It gives me no pleasure to say it, but it must be said. In Bohernia and Moravia, there has always been ten- sion between genuine culture - authentic even at the price of persecution or interna! emigration - and state-run cul- tural activity, with its dearth of real personalities and truth. No such tension exists in Slovakia .. Maybe at difficult moments of Czechoslovak history Slovak state-run cul- tural activity has looked a bit less contemptible than elsewhere in the Republic; but the price is enormous: the absence of any free parallel cultural activity. (I can apolog- ise personally to those Slov ak artists who depart from that rule, as they can be counted on the fingers of one hand.) And therefore, whereas in Bohemia and Moravia, it can happen that officially-recognised artists feel the need to associate with those deprived of official recognition who represent what is best in Czech and Moravian culture, in Slovakia, those working in culture have no one to relate to or emulate. Riddled with comprornises, abjectly vacil- lating between the permitted and the tolerated - when not actually serving the dominant ideology - Slovak culture therefore does not have the same capacity to perceive its goal, transcend itself and speak out in support of the persecuted. As I write to you I have in mind an idea to which you frequently return: the notion that freedom is indivisible, that one cannot be free in a society in which others suffer. Creative freedom is sirnilarly indivisible. One cannot cre- ate freely while that right is denied to others. It ismy belief that the tragedy of Slovak culture lies precisely in its inability to realise this basic truth. There are reasons for this inability, of course. The goal of Slovak culture is not self-emancipation in the truth, but at best creative self-ful- filment, trade in artefacts. Art here rejects the idea of a programme, it wants no truck with ethics or morality. It only wants to be itself, both in subject-matter and content. Slovak cultural workers view people's relationship with reality (and their own work) only horizontally, without 146 DOCUMENTS any thought for its transcendental implications. That is why they are incapable of doing anything that rnight jeopardise their incomes, status, or monopoly. I am always hearing the view expressed that only the output counts: only those pictures and sculptures that go on exhibition, only those books published by the state. They alone assure their cteators' survival. It pains me to reflect on the worth of creations which owe their existence to their authors' silence about the fate of others: works which do not reflect their creators' conscience but instead a cold-blooded com- prornisě with political realities. In Bohernia and Moravia, culture is capable of being the voice of the nation, its backbone, its poverty. It can reflect its poverty or its glory. That is' not the case in Slovakia. I always find it embar- rassing to hear people seriously assert that the way in which Czech and Moravian artists protest against repres- sion and bureaucratic tyranny cannot be transferred to Slovakia. I am afraid that it is the bitter truth, however. There are just no Slovak artists (again apart from the honourable exceptions) capable of responding to the no- tion of solidarity and shared responsibility for the fate of freedom in Czechoslovakia. There is no one to heed the idea of freedom's indivisibility. Quite simply, Slovak cul- ture is not the conscience, backbone or glory of its nation. DearMr Havel, it would be a serious omission ifl failed to tel1 you that the rnissing signatures of Slovak cultural wotkers are compensated for elsewhere. Your fate and the fate of other politi cal prisoners in this country, as well as respect for human rights is a matter of grave concern to Slovak Christians. They hold you in deep spiritual esteem and their prayers go with you. This is fundamental in my view, because it is only they, who, through their daily concern for their suffering neighbours, will sanctify this undistinguished country. They alone will continue to make the necessary sacrifice in order that this country should not disgrace Europe indefinitely. And although, for want of an alternative, I signed the Czech artists' petition for your release, I am pleased to say that in my prayers I [pageend151]DOCUMENTS can be part of the powerful spiritual current focused on you from Slovakia. One part of that current, moti vated not by professional camaraderie but love, is the message from Dominik Tatarka, a Slovak writer close to you in spirit, who, for the past twenty years has not enjoyed professionaJ solidarity here in Slovakia. A few days ago we were sitting at the side of the bed to which he is now permanently confined, his disease-ridden body totally enfeebled. He breathed with difficulty: "I fancy sitting down at my typewriter and typing a couple of letters." "Who would you write to, Dominik?" Martin Šimečka asked him. "To Václav Havel and the Voice of America." Yours sincerely, Ivan Hoffmann D65 21st February 1989 Ivan Havel on Václav Havel's tria} It has been a very hectic day here in Prague, with two closely-observed triaJs taking place, as welJ as several others in different magistrates' courts. Ali of them were related to the events of Wenceslas Square. Václav 's tria! was open to the public but there were only twenty or so places in the courtroom. In addition, there was an ex- tremely complicated system for issuing passes, so none of us could be sure of getting in. In the end we were admitted, namely, Václav's wife Olga, myself as his brother, and my wife. Apart from us there were a few foreign reporters, e.g. Associated Press. I am able to report, that by and large, the proceedings - except for the verdict - were, generaJly speaking, con- ducted properly. Testimony was heard both from prosecu- tion and defence witnesses, and their statements were recorded accurately. It should be pointed out, however, D64-D65 that about an hour into the tria!, the judge banned the taking of notes, and Jater issued a further waming to that effect. The trial commenced with the inctictment, which Václav was alJowed to comment on. Basically he declared that he did not feel guilty of anything with which he was charged, and on some points told the court precisely why. He was charged on two counts: firstly, that he allegedly incited people to take part in the ceremony of remem- brance for Jan Palach on 15th January and since 9th January had used foreign radio stations for the purpose. In this connection, they called one interesting witness who had apparently declared during the preliminary investiga- tion that he was at Wenceslas Square on 15th January. At the tria] however, he stated that he had not been there at all, and when he was asked if he knew something was to take place, he said, yes, but he had known about it since December, and not from my brother via Radio Free Eu- rope. Most of the witnesses were calJed in connection with the second charge, i.e. that on 16th January, Václav took part in laying flowers at Wenceslas Square. Those giving evidence also included a plainclothes police official who had been tailing him the whole time. But Václav was only a spectator and stayed on the pavement before walking down Wenceslas Square on his way home. His entire route was scrutinised in detail at the tria! and his testimony essentially tallied with those of the witnesses, except on one important point: whether or not he heard the order to disperse, and whether or not he obeyed it. Various records of his previous trials and convictions were also brought in evidence, i.e. the triaJ with Omest et al. in 1977, and the VONS tria! of 1979. This was later used as an aggravating circumstance when deterrnining the sentence. The Prosecutor was the next to speak. Basi- caJly, he just restated the indictment and tried to substan- tiate each of its points. The Prosecutor was followed to the stand by Václav 's advocate, who analysed the indictrnent point by point and demonstrated that no proof had been 147 [pageend152]D65-D66 given that anybody had heard Václav's statement on the radio and on that basis decided to take part in the ceremony of remembrance at Wenceslas Square. The defence coun- sel concluded that Václav 's intention with his radio broad- cast had not been to get people to take part in the ceremony but to dissuade the supposedly anonymous person from his desperate act. The defence also drew the courťs atten- tion to the fact that the Czechoslovak daily press had been telling listeners - albeit in a very negative way - that something was due to take place that Sunday, so it is by no means clear what it was that led people to take part. And as for the second charge, it was not clear from the witnesses whether my brother heard the order to disperse, and even if he had, all the evidence pointed to the fact that he was indeed leaving the area and was not arrested until an hour later at a place that was entirely calm, and where he was doing none of the things of which he stood accused. My brother then made his concluding statement. (Abridged version of a telephone message broadcast by Radio Free Europe. Ed.) D66 21st February 1989 Václav Havel's concluding statement at the Prague 1 District Court Your honour, Since I have already commented sufficiently on the indi- vidual arguments of the indictment, both during the pre- trial proceedings and in this court, I do not intend to repeat myself but will merely sum up my position. I believe that no evidence has been produced to prove either incitement or obstruction of a public servant in the performance of his duties. I therefore consider myself innocent and de- mand my release. 148 DOCUMENTS Nonetheless, I would like, in conclusion, to say some- thing about one aspect of the whole case which has not been touched on so far. The indictment states that I "at- teni'pted to disguise the anti-state and anti-socialist char- acter of the planned gathering". That statement, of which, incidentally, no concrete proof is given - nor can it be - imputes political motives to my actions. I am therefore within my rights to dwell for a while on the political aspects of the entire case. First of all, I must point out that the words "anti-state" anf "anti- socialist" have long since lost all semantic meaning, having become, in the course of their many years' entirely arbitrary use, no more than a derogatory label for all citizens who inconvenience the regime for whatever reason, and it has absolutely nothing to do with their actual political opinions. At various periods of their lives, three General Secretaries of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia - Slánský, Husák and Dubček - were described in these words. Now the same label is applied to Charter 77 and other independent citizens' initiatives, simply because the government dislikes their activity and feels the need to discredit them in some way. As can be seen, the indictment in my case also indulged in the same kind of political abuse. What is the real political purpose of our activity? Charter 77 was created and continues to function as an informal community endeavouring to monitor respect for human rights in our country, including compliance with the relevant intemational covenants or with the Czecho- slovak constitution, as the case may be. For twelve years now, Charter 77 has been drawing the attention of the authorities to serious discrepancies between their legal con'imibnents and what is the actual practice in our society. For twelve years it has wamed about various disturbing phenomena and signs of crisis, and exposed violations of constitutional rights, as well as arbitrary behaviour, bun- gling -and incompetence on the part of the authorities. In pufsuing these activities, Charter 77 is expressing the [pageend153]DOCUMENTS views of a broad section of our society, as I am able to gauge for myself every day. For twelve years we have been inviting the authorities to tak:e part in a dialogue about these matters. For twelve years, the authorities have ig- nored our campaign and merely imprisoned or prosecuted us for our part in it. Notwithstanding, the regime now acknowledges many of the problems that the Charter ex posed years ago and which could have Jong been solved, had the authorities heeded its voice. Charter 77 has always stressed the non-violent and lega! character of its activi- ties. It has never been its objective to organise street disturbances. I myself have stressed publicly on repeated occasions that the degree of respect accorded to dissenting and critically-minded citizens is a measure of respect for pub- lic opinion in general. On repeated occasions I have stres sed that continued disdain for peaceful expressions of public opinion can lead only to increasingly open and forcible social protest. I have repeatedly stated that it will be to no one's advantage if the govemment waits until people start demonstrating and tak:ing strike action, and that it could all be easily avoided if the authorities were to start engaging in dialogue and displaying a readiness to listen to critical voices. No heed has ever been paid to such warnings and the present regime is now reaping the fruits of its own disdain- ful attitudes. I must confess to one thing: on 16th January it was my intention to leave Wenceslas Square as soon as the flowers · had been laid by the statue. In the event, I stayed th~re for over an hour, chiefly because I was unable to believe my eyes. Something had happened that I would have n~ver dreamed possible. The police 's entirely futile interference with those who wished, quietly and without publicity, to lay flowers near the statue, succeeded instantly in trans- forming a random group of passers-by into a crowd of protesters. I realised just how profound civic discontent must be if something like that could happen. D66-D67 The indictrnent quotes me as telling our country 's leaders that the situation was serious. In point of fact I told them that the situation was more serious than they thought. Then on 16th January, I suddenly realised that the situation was more serious than even I had previously thought. As a citizen who wants to see things tak:e a calm and peaceful course in our country, I sincerely trust that the authorities will at last heed the lesson and initiate an earnest dialogue with all sections of society, and that no one will be excluded from that dialogue for being labelled "anti-socialist". I sincerely trust that the authorities will at last stop playing the ugly damsel who break:s the rnirror in the belief that her reflection is to blame. That is also why I trust I shall not be convicted groundlessly yet again. (Václav Havel 's statement after the verdict) Since I do not feel guilty, I have nothing to feel remorse for, and if I am to be punished, I shall regard my punish- ment as a sacrifice in a good cause, a sacrifice which is negligible compared to Jan Palach 's absolute sacrifice, the anniversary of which we were intending to commemorate. D67 21st February 1989 (Brno) Letter from Dr Radomír Malý to the Czechoslovak Prosecutor General Dear Sir, I was extremely sorry to hear on the radio and television the verdict of the Prague 3 District Court sentencing the playwright, Václav Havel, to nine months' imprisonment in the second corrective category. I am a Moravian cath- olic activist who, together with Tomáš Kopřiva, organised in Olomouc, on 11 th December last year, a public prayer rally for the release of from psychiatrie treatment of Au- 149 [pageend154]D67 - D69 gustin Navrátil, the author of last year's 31- point catholic petition. Although we went about it in exactly the same way as Václav Havel in organising the ceremony of re- membrance at Wenceslas Square, I was not charged with incitement. I took part in the public prayers in Peace Square in Olomouc even though the security police had banned me from entering that city. No one charged me with obstructing a public official in the performance of his duty; I merely received a disciplinary fine of five hundred crowns. If the law in Czechoslovakia applies to everyone equally, then I believe, Mr General Prosecutor, that in organising the prayer rally in Olomouc on 11th December, I should be charged with the two offences that Václav Havel is alleged to have committed in arranging the cere- mony of remembrance in Prague on 16th January. I there- fore ask you why it is that Václav Havel was brought to court and I was not, even though I committed the same actions, qualitatively speaking? From this discrepancy it is clear that one of two different actions was at fault. If the relevant authorities did not regard my actions in respect of the Olomouc rally to be indictable, how is it that they did so in the case of Václav Havel? I therefore request you, Mr General Prosecutor, in pursuance of the duty invested in your office, to see that the law is applied and annul the shameful verdict in the case of Václav Havel. If not, I am afraid I must, in the interest of justice and in solidarity with Mr Havel, ap- proach you with a different request- that the same charges be preferred against my own person. I am extremely loath to do so, but my conscience does not permit meto remain silent when someone else is convicted for the same activ- ity I also pursue and I escape prosecution. I am confident, Mr Prosecutor General, that in the end you will opt for first altemative. As a believing Christian, I trust in the final victory of justice and right. The sooner it occurs in our country the better for us all. Yours sincerely, Dr Radomír Malý, Sušilova 9, Brno 150 DOCUMENTS D 68 2 1 st February 1989 Announcement by the Committee to nominate Václav Havel for the Nobel Peace Prize The first major reaction from the rural areas has been a letter from a group of working people - mostly manual workers from the Klatovy region. The letter states inter alia: "It is more than imperative that Václav Havel, a man of such outstanding qualities and creative powers should receive this high accolade. It would be an encouragement not only to him, but also to a considerable section of the public, for whom Václav Havel represents hope for a freer and more meaningfuJ existence in this country. But whether the prize goes to Václav Havel or some other personality, Václav Havel remains the protagonist and disseminator of those values by which we shall stand now and in the future."

D69 22nd February 1989 Jana Stemová's account of her treatment by the police and judiciary Immediately after I had laid my flowers at Wenceslas Square (on 16th January) in memory of Palach 's self-im- [pageend155]DOCUMENTS molation, I was subjected to an identity check. The flowers were removed and I was led away in the direction of the police cars. Wenceslas Square looked like it does every day: in other words, a promenade, with nothing out of the ordinary happening. They gradually took all of us away, the young people being dragged to the cars by force. We were driven to Školská Street were we were left standing in the yard while interrogations took place inside. By the time they brought me - I was the last one - the rest were already standing up against the wall. I refused to stand by the wall, saying I had had enough standing at Gestapo headquarters during the war. And I didn 't stand there. Interrogations went on until the following moming when I was driven off to Ruzyně in handcuffs, along with a group of youngsters who had been charged with me. I spent the next ten days in Ruzyně. The first three days were awful. No chance to wash, no toilet things, no comb, no stockings - they had taken them off me, in spíte of the cold - a Turkish lavatory instead of a toilet basin, filth, cockroaches. It was dreadful, not to mention the food. At the end of three days I was taken to another cell where my fellow-inmates were changed every other day. I was taken alone to the exercise-yard by warders with the vilest manners - swearing in the obscenest fashion, kicking doors, etc. I was allowed to wash myself once a week - under a cold shower. In short, it was a prison unworthy of human beings in the twentieth century. It was only after I returned home ten days Jater that I learnt what had happened at Wenceslas Square. Demon- strations continued the whole week and the behaviour of the security forces was so brutal, I can 't get over it. So we were al! interrogated and summonsed. The court hearing seemed to me like a put-up job - like an absurd play; to be convicted for laying flowers in memory of Palach's death is something I just can't come to terms with. If only you'd seen those police witnesses. Naturally they spoke the lines that had been scripted for them. Two witnesses in civilian clothes rambled on incoherently-and so it went D69- D70 on for two whole days from morning to evening. You've already heard the verdict. We were convicted of riotous behaviour, but the word for me means something quite different. ln my closing statement, I couldn 't help comparing the way I was arrested during the war and driven from Pankrác (prison) to the Petschek Palace (Gestapo headquarters) without handcuffs. Nor could I help comparing the prison of those days with the cell I had in Ruzyně. My cell in Pankrác was clean. There was a flush lavatory. We could wash ourselves twice a week in hot water, as well as the floor and anything else we wanted to. That was out of the question in Ruzyně . I think the whole thing was scripted in advance. When I think of Václav Havel who got nine months for nothing; of Jana Petrová who also got nine months hard; ofVeverka who got twelve months; and of ourselves standing there, I think to myself, this regirne really is anti-democratic and unworthy of twentieth cen tury people, if such a thing can happen just for laying flowers. (Jana Sternová was bom in l921 .- Abridged from a telephone message to Radio Free Europe. Ed.) D70 23rd February 1989 (Munich) Declaration by the Association of Slovak Writers and Artists Abroad on the conviction of Václav Havel Having been extremely moved by the magnificent show of international solidarity with Václav Havel by writers, artists, acadernics and people of other walks of life both in many countries of the Soviet bloc and in the democratic Westem world, we are shocked_ by the nine-month prison sentence which has just been handed down. The Husák- Jakeš regime thereby cynically scoms the human rights and civil liberties which it pledged to respect when it signed the various international accords. 151 [pageend156]D70-D71 There is absolutely no doubt in our minds that Václav Havel will survive his nine-months of strict penal servi- tude. The question is whether Husák, Jakeš, Adamec and their political and judicial servants will weather those nine months. On behalf of the Association of Slovak Writers and Artists Abroad we protest most forcefully against this judgment, as well as against all the convictions of free- dom-loving citizens in connection with the demonstration of Bratislava catholics on 25th March 1988. What started then in Bratislava continued in Prague in January 1989 when police units also committed brutal assaults on inno- cent citizens, merely because they sought to pay dignified tribute to the memory of Jan Palach. Freedom-loving people everywhere must protest with constemation against that system and its methods, since it denies the fundamental principles of liberty and even violates exist- ing legislation in socialist Czechoslovakia. We remind the present rulers in Prague that they are continuing to use methods from the Stalinist era, when Gottwald sent thousands of innocent citizens to the gal- lows or prison. President Husák ought to recall those times, since he spent them in prison, and even published a terrifying testimony to them. We remind him and every- body else who bears responsibility for the latest persecu- tions of freedom-loving citizens that the words of the great Slovak poet Ján Kollár are as true now as they ever were: Those who are worthy of freedom Know the value of everyone else's freedom Those who enslave others, are themselves slaves. Ata time when freedom's dawn is lighting up prison cells from the Baltic to the Adriatic, and in some socialist countries the first steps are being taken towards the resto- ration of democratic political parties, socialist Czechoslo- vakia is filling its gaols with new prisoners. On behalf of the Association of Slovak Writers and Artists Abroad we condemn these violent political meth- ods which are an affront to all friends of freedom and 152 DOCUMENTS human dignity wherever they may be. We also call on the regime to put an end to these harsh measures. We demand the release of Václav Havel and citizens imprisoned on political grounds, so that they may pursue their work once more. At this historical moment, when the era of primitive Stalinist dogmatism and brutality is being shaken to its foundations and when, under Mikhail Gorbachev's lead- ership, the land of Lenin and Stalin is stimulating moves towards greater freedom and human dignity, from Czechoslovakia, which was once regarded as a model of democracy, we once more hear the truncheon blows of the state police and the clang of prison doors. This is the symbol of communist socialism in present-day Czecho- slovakia. And this is how it will go down in history, under the names of Husák and Jakeš. Now that the regime is using violence to provoke its own citizens this is no time to be silent. lt is necessary to defend human <lignity and the nation's honour, people's rights and their good name from these assaults. The slaves have nothing else left to lose but their chains. This is a moment to show our support to all those in prison, all those suffering persecution, all those in bonds of slavery. They are the 15 rnillion Slovaks and Czechs who yeám for freedom, a life ofhuman <lignity, and a new govemment that will respect citizens' freedom and human rights, in accordance with our country's tradition, so that we may return to the family of free and equal nations in Europe. Honour to tomorrow's victors.

A letter from a group of citizens from Benátky nad Jizerou, Kropáčova Vrutice and Prague states inter alia: "In the eyes of many of our country's citizens, Mr Václav Havel is someone who has always taken a daunt- less and honourable stand in the struggle for human rights and liberty. As everyone knows, only a free human being can know and value human fellowship and hence the peace which all of us on this planet need. By taking this stand, Mr Havel has transcended our narrow national interest and become a fighter for world peace. For these reasons we endorse the candidature of Mr Václav Havel for the Nobel Peace Prize."

D72 24th February 1989 (Vienna) Viennese daily Kurier: Karl Johannes von Schwarzen- berg, Not just a crime - an act of folly When, twenty years ago, it was suggested to French Pres- ident Charles de Gaulle that he have the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre arrested because of his proven links with terrorists and his open expressions of sympathy with ter- rorism, de Gaulle refused, saying "One does not arrest Voltaires". In doing so, that great statesman, himself a distin- guished writer, displayed an instinctive deference to the spirit. De Gaulle, who was quite capable of vigorous action (such as during the fight against Hitler or the D71- D72 Algerian coup d'Etat), behaved as a man of wisdom who realised that to imprison someone like Sartre would be a sign of weakness and a political error - or, as Talleyrand declared when Napoleon sent the Duke ofEnghien before a firing-squad: "Iťs not just a crime - iťs an act of folly." Ah well, Czechoslovakia's present potentates are sim- ply of a different calibre from de Gaulle and believe that they have to display their might by sentencing a writer - a playwright whose works are staged al! over the world - to nine months' strict penal servitude. His crime was to have laid flowers near the statue of St Wenceslas in tribute to the memory of Jan Palach, who, on that spot, had bome witness to his love for his country. I shouldn 't think that those potentates have even read Havel, or understood what his plays - and also his prison letters - are trying to tel1 his nation and the world: that subtle confrontation between society and the power wielders. But at least they ought to recall the words of Bertold Brecht - himself a convinced communist: The times change The grandiose plans of the powerful Eventually come to a halt Even if they strut Like bloodied cocks The times change And violence will not avail The pebbles shift in the bed of the Vltava Three emperors lie buried in Prague Greatness will not remain great And the small won 't stay small The night has twelve hours And then comes the day The power wielders display their powerlessness every time they believe they must use force to prove their credibility. That is the real problem of the Czechoslovak leadership. Because the Party has failed, because it purged every one of of its leaders who still had something to say to the nation, this movement which, in the thirties still had 153 [pageend158]D72-D73 distinguished supporters and in the forties commanded a third of the vote, now finds itself in a state of total bankruptcy. Over these past days, Austria has behaved as a good neighbour and friend of Czechoslovakia. Its governrnent has spoken out clearly. Austria has set in motion the mechanism agreed on when negotiating the human rights question at the CSCE follow-up meeting in Vienna, and proved to the world that it values friendship with the nations of Czechoslovakia, not their govemment. The young people who have come out on to the streets during the past two months, the artists and inteUectuals who have stood up for Václav Havel, the working people who signed that remarkable petition calling for an end to lies on the radio, on television and in the press, have all shown that they have understood Havel 's message about retuming to the truth. They will not forget who thought of them in their time of need. D73 25th February 1989 Letter to Rudé právo from National Theatre player Josef Kemr Dear Erutor, I offer you the foilowing modest and very brief details as a supplement to the study and family tree published in Rudé právo under the title "Who is Václav Havel?" Miloš Havel, the proprietor of Lucerna-film and creator of the Barrandov film studios, was the second private firm to offer me a contract in Czech films. At the time I was an unknown budding actor having an engagement with the Anna Budínská-Červíčková touring theatre company and travelling round the villages of Centra) Bohemia. It is not Jong since the anniversary of the nationalisation of the Czech film industry was celebrated. I am now one of the 154 DOC UME NT S few people still capable of giving a persona! account of the period when distinguished players were perfecting their acting talents in Czech film. Miloš Havel financed Czech and Slovak sound films when they were still in their infancy. It was in projects jointly financed by the two Havels - Miloš and Václav - during the years of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Mo- ravia and in the post-Munich republic that directors like Mac Frič, Otakar Vávra, Josef Rovenský, Vladimír Slavínský, Miroslav Cikán, Václav Kubásek, Karel Steklý, K. Špelicha, František Čáp, Václav Krška, J. Slavíček, V. Binovec, E. F. Burian, Karel Salzer, Václav Wassermann, Jindřich Honzl and Gustav Machatý emerged, along with such pillars of stage and screen as the actors Stanislav Neumann, Jindřich Plachta, Vlasta Matulová, Zdeněk Štěpánek, František Smolfk, Saša Rašilov, Bedřich Karen, Theodor Pištěk, Antonie Nedošínská, Otto Rubfk, Jiřina Šejbalová, Olga Scheinpflugová, Otomar Korbelář, Jiřina Štěpničková, Karel Hoger, Josef Pivec, Hugo Haas, Eduard Kohout, Nataša Gollová, Zdeňka Baldová, Růžena Nasková, Ladislav Pešek, Eva Klenová, Jaroslav Marvan, Andrej Bagár and Karol Plicka. They were all subsequently to receive high awards and even the supreme accolades of State and Party. Miloš Havel offered actors and directors work mostly on films with Czech subject-matter, both contemporary and historical. Off hand I can name: To byl český muzikant (That was a Czech musician), Jan Výrava, Mlhy na blatech (Míst on the fens), Muzikantská Liduška (Lída followed the band), Pancho se Žení (Pancho's wedding), Jarní vítr (Spring wind), Jan Cimbura, Rozina sebranec (Rozina the love-child) and Babička (The grandmother). They were all box-office hits, but Miloš Havel pursued another goal in addition. He undertook the ethical mis- sion of reawakening and strengthening the Czech nation's dejected patriotic spirit, which had been se- verely wounded and undermined. [pageend159]DOCUMENTS The Havel brothers supported Czech authors, play- wrights and budding poets. They were visited by such writers as Vítězslav Nezval, Josef Hora, Jaroslav Seifert, Konstantin Biebl, Vladimír Holan, František Hrubín, František Halas and František Gotz. Miloš Havel offered them work as screen writers. In co- operation with Eduard Bass he was working on plans for the first Czech large scale feature film The Circus Humberto, a very risky project at the time, as the Germans suspected it rnight boost the patriotic morale of the subjugated Czech and Slovak nations. The Havel brothers took on many people as actors, artists, technicians and administrative personnel in order to save them from forced labour in the Greater German Reich. The swaggering, loud-mouthed Greater German interlopers in the form of the well-drilled Wehrmacht, at a time when the Republic was desperate and hopeless, were enslaving, imprisoning and murdering the Czech intelligentsia. The Havel brothers did not lose their heads. They remained calm and level-headed and lent their sup- port to the underground anti-fascist movement and the remnants of the officer corps of the Czechoslovak Army, as well as to outlawed political activists of different per- suasions, leaders of physical training associations, parti- san operations, and to members of different churches and religious associations, secret sects and lodges. When our national issues were being sorted out and consolidated at the beginning of the new republic, Havel hosted part of the Soviet generalitet and their aides de camp in his Barrandov villa. Rudí Seibel, a pro-Czech Sudeten Ger- man who was a regular visitor at both the Havels, was entrusted with saving Czech hot-heads from interrogation and irnprisonment at Gestapo headquarters. If I searched my memory I would come up with much more. I've discovered a number of things about certain people with "old-fashioned notions": that they managed to save people from unemployment or Totaleinsatz; they managed to provide a living for thousands of people; and D73-D74 they managed to maintain and increase their property- all of which requires a lot of work, effort, thought, unswerv- ing determination, the patience of Job, and fortitude. I offer you these few crumbs from my memory in order to ease my conscience and help vindicate the good name of the Havel family. With Christian greetings, God bless you! Josef Kemr, National Theatre, Prague D74 27th February 1989 Jiří Dienstbier 's proposal for the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Václav Havel To representatives of independent initiatives in Europe and USA Adam Michnik, Andrei Sakharov, Ferenc Koszeg, Tomasz Mastnak, Mary Kaldor, Timothy Garton Ash, Mient Jan Faber, and others, through the intermedi- ary of the Palach Press Agency Dear Friends, In connection with !atest developments in Czechoslova- kia, the proposal has emerged for Václav Havel to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. As many of you are aware from your persona! meetings with Václav Havel and from his work, this Czech writer, who is no professional politi- cian, has campaigned resolutely for many years against force and violence in his own country and in intemational relations. When, in June last year, there was a proposal for the creation of an intemational body to bring together independent movements and citizens in grassroots support of the Helsinki process, Prague was suggested as the new association's symbolic capital city, not merely because it is situated in the heart ofEurope, but also because through- out history, the fate of Prague has mirrored the state of relations in Europe, and European peace. The events of 155 [pageend160]D74-D75 the past weeks have once again confirmed this in dramatic fashion. By convicting Václav Havel, Jana Petrová, Ota Veverka and the other citizens, the Czechoslovak author- ities are once more creating an "image of the enemy" and violating the commitments they made in Helsinki and Vienna. Thereby they harm not only Czechoslovakia, but the entire process of European rapprochement. Represen- tatives of Charter 77, the lndependent Peace Association, the John Lennon Peace Club and the Czech Children have been sentenced to imprisonment or other penalties. These are independent initiatives which seek the path of dialogue in their pursuit of a non-violent, peaceful solution to the deepening crisis in Czechoslovakia. In other words they are trying to prevent destabilisation at the very heart of our still divided continent. To award Václav Havel the Nobel Prize would be to pay just tribute to his persona! contribution to this struggle for peace within centra! European society, which is also so crucial for peace between nations and states. It would also be a tribute to the independent movements which regard Václav Havel as their leading spokesman. We therefore ask you seriously to consider the possi- bility of supporting the nomination of Václav Havel for the Nobel Peace. Prize, both on your own behalf and on behalf of your organisations and movements. With best wishes Jiří Dienstbier D75 28th February 1989 Charter 77 Document No. 19/89: On the Budapest dem- onstration of solidarity with Václav Havel and other Czechoslovak political prisoners Dear Hungarian friends, We have learnt with great pleasure of the demonstration in solidarity with Václav Havel and the other Czechoslo- 156 DOCUMENTS vak political prisoners that you are organising in Budapest on 2nd March 1989. The playwright Václav Havel, who was present at the birth of our Charter 77 movement, has become a symbol not onJy of our struggle for hu man rights and a democratic social order, bul also of the ever inten- sifying international efforts to create a peaceful and dem- ocratic comrnunity not only in our part of Europe, but throughout the European continent and the world. For nearly twenty years now he has been persecuted for his open avowal of the mutual interdependence of hurnan rights, democracy and peace, both in European and global terms, as well as for his analyses of these problems. He has been gaoled four times already, and spent over four years in prison altogether. We would therefore like to ask you to support the proposal to award this year's Nobel Peace Prize to Václav Havel. The proposal is being submitted in Czechoslovakia by persons eligible to do so, and has the open support of many people in other countries. You may make known your views on this proposal by contacting the Nobel Institute, Oslo. Dozens of other people are unjustly imprisoned in Czechoslovakia. The following are just a few of those currently in prison. Tomáš Dvořák, Hana Marvanová and Jana Petrová of the lndependent Peace Association, Ota Veverka of the John Lennon Peace Club, Petr Cibulka, a publisher of recorded music and independent literature, Eva Vidlařová of the Petr Cibulka Defence Committee, and the poet Ivan Jirous, a representative of the cultural underground. On 23rd February, František Stárek, a pub- lisherof the undergroundjoumal Vokno, was sent to prison for the third time. Dozens of others were convicted in connection with the demonstrations that took place on 28th October 1988 and on the occasion ofthe anniversary of Jan Palach's self-immolation; most of them received fines. So long as these people remain in prison or are otherwise persecuted, Czechoslovakia will remain an irri- tation in Europe, a symbol oť anti-perestroika and a bas- tion for those seeking to reverse the Helsinki process. It is [pageend161]DOCUMENTS not only the citizens of our country who want democracy for Czechoslovak:ia, it is an aspiration shared by all the nati on s of Europe and the world, and first and foremost by our immediate neighbours. Solidarity with the unjustly imprisoned is not important in moral terms. We are convinced that the mighty wave of protest which has arisen in Czechoslovak:ia and elsewhere will oblige the Prague leadership to back down. We are particularly happy that independent initiatives and or- ganisations in Hungary are demonstrating their solidarity with Václav Havel and the other Czechoslovak: political prisoners, thereby showing themselves to be true friends of Czechoslovak:ia. Tomáš Hradílek - Charter 77 spokesperson Dana Němcová - Charter 77 spokesperson Saša Vondra - Charter 77 spokesperson D76 28th February 1989 Statement by Slov ak writer Eubomír Feldek about Václav Havel 's conviction On 20th January 1989 I sent a telegram to the Czechoslo- vak Writers' Union in Prague, protesting against the arrest of Václav Havel. On 29th January, I reiterated my protest in a letter to the General Secretary of the Comrnunist Party of Czechoslovak:ia. According to the reply I received, my request for intervention in favour of Václav Havel ran counter to the sovereignty of the court which has sole jurisdiction in such cases. On 21st February, the Prague 3 district court sentenced Václav Havel to an unconditional prison term of9 months. The fact that we do not have the right to influence the courťs decision does not mean that we have no right to comment on it. D75- D76 From press reports, it is apparent tl1at Václav Havel was convicted for trying to honour the memory of Jan Palach. It is absurd in my view to convict people on such grounds - particularly in a country which has started to tak:e the path of democratisation. lf my memory serves me right, official sanction was given to the possibility of honouring Jan Palach 's memory twenty years ago, when President Ludvík Svoboda expressed his condolences - and those condolences were never annulled. Apart from misgivings about the conduct of Václav Havel 's trial, I have grave doubts about whether the Prague 3 District Court had the right to reach a decision affecting all of us - which is what it did de facto. For its decision did not affect just one writer, but our literature as a whole, and all its best representatives. For twenty years now, our literature has been separated into impenetrable ghettos. Here at home samizdat authors and those writing abroad have not been accepted. And by the same token accepted writers have found themselves deprived of world attention, even though many of them justly merited it. That too was punishment for something they did not do. In recent days, the impression has been growing on us that it is a punishment which has now expired. Tak:ing the example of the Soviet Union, which has fixed as one of its priorities in the cultural sphere the unification of Soviet cul ture, in whatever part of the world its representatives live, we also have tried to attain our long-standing goal of again reunifying Czechoslovak: cul- ture, particularly literature, as the major victim. Everything that has been achieved in this respect has now been thrown overboard. The conviction of Václav Havel has undone the years of effort on the part of coura- geous individuals. Czechoslovak literature is once again thoroughly com- partmentalised. Once again we are being punished for something we didn 't do. How long is the sentence this time 157 [pageend162]D76-D78 - and what is it for? Could the Prague 3 District Court tel1 us? This unjust punishment has not been inflicted on Václav Havel alone, nor solely on the writers' cornrnunity, but on our whole country. The decision of the Prague 3 District Court has tarnished the name ofthe Czechoslovak Socialist Republic throughout the world. Who benefited from it? I request my statement to be attached to the minutes of today's meeting ofthe Committee session ofthe Czecho- slovak Writers' Union. Eubomír Feldek D77 (End February 1989) Statement by the Peace Activists Defence Cornrnittee Last year, two initiatives came into existence in our coun- try with the word peace in their names: The lndependent Peace Association - the initiative for a demilitarised soci- ety, and the John Lennon Peace Club. The two initiatives share the conviction that concem for peace is not some- thing to be delegated entirely to the professional politi- cians, whose negotiations are always to some degree subordinate to power interests, that peace among people is the responsibility of each of us. This conviction has led those active in the initiatives in question to express in peaceful ways their rejection of all sources of tension within society and all manifestations of tyranny. Although both initiatives are working for a nation-wide dialogue and have also invited govemment representa- tives to take part, the authorities have chosen to treat them in a confrontational manner. Sooner or later, the regime will be obliged to come to terms with the fact that an authentic public opinion is beginning to stir in our society alongside a growing awareness of shared civic responsi- bility. We are therefore perturbed by the fact that so many 158 DOCUMENTS of our fellow-citizens who are involved in the independent peace initiatives continue to suffer persecution, and hence personal suffering, because of their readiness to stand up consistently for what they believe in. These citizens are extending the frontiers of freedom for all of us. We feel duty-bound to express our solidarity with them. We have therefore set up the Peace Activists Defence Committee. Membership is open to anyone wishing to take specific action to assist peace activists persecuted for their inde- pendent views. Our primary aim is to inform the public about unjust treatrnent of peace activists, collect informa- tion about all manifestations of solidarity with them, and assist them and their families. Jiří Dienstbier, Václav Malý, Jiří Pavlíček, Tomáš Tvaroch, Luboš Vydra Addressed to: The Prime Minister of the ČSSR, the Federal Assembly, the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Czechoslovak Peace Committee Copies to: VIA, ČTK, Rudé právo, Mladý svět, AFP, Cardinal Tomášek D78 2nd March 1989 Charter 77 Document No. 21/89: Letter to the President of the Republic Mr President, In accordance with Article 29 of the ČSSR Constitution, we draw your attention to certain matters of grave concern which are impairing relations within our society and harm- ing the interests ofthe Republic abroad. You are undoubt- edly aware of the aggressive and provocative manner in which the authorities dealt with the peaceful ceremony in memory of Jan Palach at Wenceslas Square, with the clear intent of provoking clashes. That brutal assault was aimed [pageend163]DOCUMENTS at deterring the reawakening of civic activity and courage. lnstead of an objective enquiry into these oppressive op- erations which Prague has not witnessed for so long, people are being prosecuted on trumped-up charges and a slander campaign is being waged in the media. This policy has aroused protests among a considerable section of the Czechoslovak public and in other countries, particularly in view of the fact that these overt violations of the Vienna Concluding Document occurred at the very moment it was being signed by Czechoslovakia's representatives. In spíte of those protests, a month after the Wenceslas Square events, trials reminiscent of the notorious "Prague Trials" ofyesteryear have taken place in the capital, aimed at justifying retrospectively the oppressive and violent treatrnent of peaceful citizens. On 21 st and 22nd February, sentences were passed on Václav Havel and seven other citizens. The trials seriously violated the Pena! Code, particularly Article 2, Section 5 which requires that "equal care must be taken to exarnine evidence both against and in favour of the accused". The placing of flowers was held to be riotous behaviour. For that action, Otakar Veverka was sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment, Jana Petrová to nine months' imprisonment and five other defendants received suspencÍed sentences and fines. Intemationally respected jurists from France, West Germany, Holland and Sweden came to Prague for the trials but were not adrnitted to the courtroom. And al- though dozens of foreign joumalists also came, only four received permits. Trials from which the public were virtually excluded are now being presented as a judicial justification for the unlawful and frenzied actions of the authorities at Wenceslas Square. You yourself must know better than anyone else, Mr President, how hard it is to credit these attempts by the authorities to legitirnise their high-handed, arrogant behaviour. Official talk of restructuring and democratisation will scarcely gain credibility if the au- thorities return to tbe practices and methods of the nine- D78 teen fifties - to which you yourself fell victim. Likewise one can scarcely expect public support for any reforms - however half-hearted - unless the mistakes, deformations and wrongs of the past twenty years are remedied. The violence of the January days and the attempts to legitimise it through the afore- mentioned trials and legal proceedings still pending also call into question Czechoslovakia's credibility as a signatory to the Vienna Concluding Document and the govemmenťs proclaimed support for Gorbachev's "cornmon European home" pol- icy - including the much-trumpeted initiative to create a "zone of trust and co-operation" in Centra! Europe. The thousands who have signed petitions and letters have rightly called for an end to the governmenťs tyrannical behaviour and the initiation of a dialogue between the govemment and society. Ever since the creation of Charter 77 twelve years ago, the citizens' initiatives, which have been advocating such a dialogue with the support of specific, documented proposals, have been the voice of the "silent majority". In the Vienna Document (principie No. 26) the Czechoslovak govemment pledged not only to tolerate the activity of such initiatives, but also to respect and facilitate them. Mr President, we appeal to you to exercise your rights in the. interest of peaceful and necessary change in Czechoslovakia and of our country 's dignified standing in the world by ordering a halt to prosecutions, the reversal of verdicts and the quashing of sentences, where applica- ble, in the cases of Václav Havel, Jana Petrová, Otakar Veverka, Miroslav Šrámek (sentenced by the Prague 8 District Court to one month 's irnprisonment for taking part in the demonstration at Wenceslas Square on 19th January 1989) and all others prosecuted or convicted in connection with the demonstrations of 15th-2 l st January. Prague, 2nd March 1989 Tomáš Hradílek - Charter 77 spokesperson Saša Vondra - Charter 77 spokesperson (Charter 77 spokesperson Dana Němcová is in hospital) 159 [pageend164]D79-D80 D79 5th March 1989 (Moscow) Letter from Soviet and German writers and academics in support of Václav Havel To the press of the ČSSR. Copies to the Soviet joumals Sovyetskaya kultura, Literaturnaya gazeta and Moscow News, and to the West German press. Dear comrades, We cannot conceal our grave concem about the imprison- ment of the world- renowned playwright Václav Havel. The repressive treatment of representatives of what was until recently a flourishing culture undoubtedly harms both that culture and the State. We hoped that such repri- sals against an outstanding writer were unthinkable, not just here, but in all the socialist countries. This also ex- plains our appeal. It is a matter that concems not just us but the world as a whole. The fate of every single individ- ua! - and al! the more so when it is someone as distin- guished as Václav Havel - is inseparable from the fate of those major changes which are now under way in Eastem Europe. His imprisonment for expressing an opinion, for a normal symbolic act, has offended all those who favour these propitious developments. And in fact it damages their opponents as well, since actions like these can only compromise them even more. We attach great importance and significance to the fact that the latest issue of the joumal Tyeatr has just printed "Catastrophe", a play by the celebrated playwright Samuel Beckett, dedicated to Václav Havel. We are firmly resolved to speak out loudly in defence of Václav Havel - because in doing so we also defend ourselves. We believe that this official error will soon be corrected.

D80 6th March 1989 Letter from the Chairrnan of the Intemational Helsinki Fed- eration to Czechoslovak Premier Ladislav Adamec Dear Prime Minister, I write to you on behalf of a delegation made up of representatives of six countries: Karl Johannes von Schwarzenberg, President of the Intemational Helsinki Federation, Jiří Hájek, former Czechoslovak Foreign Minister and Chairrnan of the Czechoslovak Helsinki Committee, Bjom Elmquist, member of the Danish Par- liament and the Danish Helsinki Committee, Jeri Laber, Executive Director of the Helsinki Committee USA, and Gerald Nagler, General Secretary of the Intemational Helsinki Federation. We wish to express our disappointment and grave concem at the Czechoslovak Foreign Minister's refusal to meet with us. This disappointment is quite understandable since some of us have had to come a very long way to be here. Our greatest concem, however, is the fact that the reason for cancelling the meeting is the Czechoslovak authorities' negative attitude to the inclusion ofDr Jiří Hájek . in our delegation. Dr Hájek is chairrnan of a committee whose task it is to monitor and assist the implementation of the CSCE agreements. Principie 26 of the Concluding Docurnent of the Vienna CSCE meeting, endorsed by the Czechoslovak govemment on 10th January 1989-i.e.just recently-not only specifically commits govemments to respect the [pageend165]DOCUMENTS organisation 's right to do this, it actually requires them to "take effective measures to facilitate access to information on the implementation of CSCE provisions". To exclude the representative of our Czechoslovak member commit- tee from a meeting to discuss the implementation of the CSCE agreements is incompatible with the pledges signed. It is extremely important, in our view, for the Czecho- slovak authorities to initiate a dialogue in their country with independent groups such as the Czechoslovak Helsinki Committee. We hoped to assist such a dialogue. The request from the Intemational Helsinki Federation to meet with leading govemment representatives of the ČSSR was motivated by deep misgivings over recent events in this country. The lntemational Helsinki Federa- tion monitors the situation in all CSCE countries. Whereas neighbouring countries are liberalising their societies, in Czechoslovakia, citizens are being sent to prison for the non-violent expression of their opinions. The delegation of the Intemational Helsinki Federation protests against - the police brutality used in Czechoslovakia against participants in the peaceful demonstrations of August, October and January 1988-89; - the arrest of human rights activists and other citizens during recent months; - the trials and convictions of citizens exercising their right to free expression, including the Czechoslovak Helsinki Committee members Václav Havel and Jana Petrová; - the continuing court proceedings, some of which are taking place this week, against other citizens trying freely to exercise rights guaranteed in the Helsinki Agreements; - the denial of arrested persons' rights, such as the denial of visits by family members, the refusal to send prisoners' letters, or other restrictions; - the ratification of Article 15 6a of the Penal Code and Article 6c of the law on summary offences which are D80- D81 further restrictions of citizens' rights running counter to the spirit of the Helsinki Fina! Act, and introduced since the conclusion of the Helsinki talks. The Intemational Helsinki Federation therefore re- quests the following: - the immediate release of all political prisoners and an immediate halt to legal actions against them, includ- ing those citizens who protested against the police bru- tality during the recent events in Prague; - guarantees of the proper conduct of trials, i.e., in the cases of those prosecuted for political offences, by holding them in public in the presence of foreign observers; - a halt to the abuse of passport and visa regulations to punish political activists and the removal of the obstacles preventing members of the Czechoslovak Helsinki Com- mittee maintaining contact with Helsinki observers in other countries and taking part in their meetings; - recognition of the right of the Czechoslovak Helsinki Committee and other independent initiatives in Czecho- slovakia to exercise and assist the observance of human rights guaranteed by the Helsinki agreements. Looking forward to your reply, Yours faithfully, Karl JÓhannes von Schwarzenberg, Chairman of the Intemational Helsinki Federation D81 16th March 1989 (Strasbourg) Resolution adopted by the European Parliament; jointly tabled by the Socialist, Christian Democrat, Liberal, Dem- ocratic Alliance and Communist groups The European Parliament, A. recalling that the present govemment of Czechoslo- vakia is not only a party to the Helsinki Final Act, but this 161 [pageend166]D81 - D82 year signed the Vienna agreement in the framework of the CSCE which re-affirmed respect for human rights, B. whereas, contrary to those intemational agreement and the urgent appeal formulated by the European Parlia- ment, the Czechoslovakian writer Václav Havel was sen- tenced to nine months ' imprisonment with hard labour on 21 January 1989, Ota Veverka and Jana Petrová were given prison sentences of 12 months and nine months respectively, and five other Czechoslovakian citizens were given sentences, simply for having taken part in a peaceful demonstration to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the death of Jan Palach, C. whereas several European governments, the USA and hundreds of intellectuals, writers and private individ- uals have petitioned the Czechoslovakian Govemrnent to release Havel, D. recalling its resolution of 19 January 1989 and 16 February 1989 on Czechoslovakia to the effect that the fruitful development of East-West relations depended in part on both sides fulfilling their obligations, 1. Condemns the arrest of Václav Havel and his friends and calls for them and the other political prisoners to be released immediately; 2. Notes that this incident constitutes a serious violation of the final document of the Vienna Conference, which was signed, inter alia, by the Czechoslovakian Govem- ment; 3. Calls on the Foreign Ministers of the Twelve, meet- ing in European Political Co-operation, to make an official protest to the Czechoslovakian Govemments and to do everything possible to secure the release of peaceful op- ponents as soon as possible; 4. Instructs its delegation to the parliament of Czecho- slovakia to raise the question of political oppression with the delegation of the Czechoslovakian Parliament; 5. lnstructs its President to forward this resolution to the Commission, the Council, the Foreign Ministers Meet- 162 DOCUMENTS ing in European Political Co-operation, the Heads of State and the Czechoslovakian Govemment. D82 16th March 1989 (Bonn) Resolution adopted by the German Federal Parliament in Bonn; tabled jointly by representatives of the Christian Democrat, Social Democrat, Free Democrat and Green parliamentary groups The German Federal Parliament has noted with astonish- ment that a number of human rights activists have been convicted in Czechoslovakia in the recent period - the world-renowned writer Václav Havel to nine months' rigorous imprisonment, Ota Veverka and Jana Petrová of the independent peace and human rights movements to twelve and nine months' imprisonment respectively, and David Němec, Stanislav Penc, Petr Placák and Alexandr Vondra to fines and suspended prison sentences of several months each. They were indicted for attempting to com- memorate, at Wenceslas Square on 16th January, the 20th anniversary of Jan Palach's self-immolation in protest against the occupation of Czechoslovakia. Under the terms of recently toughened Czechoslovak legislation, this was deemed to be riotous behaviour, even though the defendants did not engage in any violence. The German Federal Parliament welcomes the Federal Govemmenťs swift reaction to the verdicts and its expres- sion of shock and amazement, as well as its appeal to the Czechoslovak govemment to annul them, and the appro- priate initiatives it undertook within the EPC [European Political Co-operation] framework. The German Federal Parliament notes with grave mis- givings that Czechoslovakia has thereby flagrantly vio- lated the Vienna Concluding Document of the CSCE which requires respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms. [pageend167]DOCUMENTS In the view of the German Federal Parliament, im- proved co-operation in Europe can only be ensured if all states work to strengthen peace at home and abroad and if they respect al! civil and human rights. The German Federal Parliament supports the Federal Govemmenťs initiatives and calls on it to continue to use every opportunity within the framework of the CSCE process, the EPC and the Council of Europe to induce the Czechoslovak govemment to respect human rights as it pledged to when it signed the Fina! Act of the Helsinki Conference, the Vienna Concluding Document of the CSCE and the UN Human Rights Covenants. D83 20th March 1989 Letter from eight independent initiatives to members of the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly Ladies and Gentlemen, We are writing to you at a moment when our Republic finds itself at the crossroads. There are two possible ways forward. One is the way of democratic renewal - not an easy course, admittedly, but the only possible one if we are to heal our society's deep economic, ecological and moral wounds, and forourpart, we have always been more than ready, as we are today, to be part of such a process. Altematively, the govemment can continue its violent treatrnent of the independent citizens' initiatives in an attempt to suppress renascent civic courage. There is no future in such a course, however. It is a path Ieading to economic and social catastrophe. During your present meeting you are due to ratify the so-called "lega) measures" adopted by the Presidium of the Federal Assembly on 14th February this year. Do you think this is what your voters want? Think about it before D82-D83 you raise your hand in approval. In Vienna, the Czecho- slovak govemment ceremoniously pledged under Princi- pie 13 of the Concluding Document to develop its laws, regulations and policies in the field of human rights in order to guarantee their effective exercise. Further, by endorsing Principie 26, it recognised the legality of the independent citizens' initiatives, and actually pledged to facilitate association, communication and contacts among citizens working to promete the implementation of the Helsinki documents. It also pledged to remove lega! and administrative impediments to such efforts. The so-called "lega) measures" placed before you are totally inconsis- tent with this standing intemational pledge and with our lega! culture. Dear representative, You bear an enormous responsi- bility. If you ratify these measures which bring us doser to a state of emergency, under which there can be no question of free speech, or freedom of peaceful assembly and association, then you will be ratifying a flagrant violation of a new ly- signed intemational agreement. You will thereby also be gi ving your unconditional approval to repression and the spiral of political trials and imprison- ment of persons enjoying undoubted authority both here and abroad. Thanks to its present foolish policies, Czecho- slovakia has already become an object of intemational denunciation and the risk is that the criticism of the ma- jority of the Helsinki community will also be reflected in relations that are of crucial importance for our economic development. The people who are urging this course on you will leave the scene. But you will not be able to escape your respon- sibility. Each of you should about think carefully whether one day you will we able to face your fellow- citizens and your nearest and dearest - your children - with a clear conscience. We therefore request that you: Do not vote for a measure that violates our intemational commitrnents. 163 [pageend168]D83-D84 Act in accordance with your responsibility towards citizens and true legality.

However, since I lack any concrete evidence to prove my assumption, it must remain a hypothesis. None- theless, it all hangs together so well that I feel I arn entitled to talk about it here. After 3 p.m. on I 6th January, the Security police (StB) received the news that representatives of independent 164 citizens' initiatives had tried to lay flowers in memory of Jan Palach near the statue of St Wenceslas. StB officers immediately arrived at Wenceslas Square, where, at 3.25 p.m. they also noticed me among the group of people gathered there, and placed me under surveillance. I did not lay any flowers by the statue. I did not behave at al! conspicuously and did not come into any contact with the police. lt would therefore seem that somewhere lengthy consultations were taking place about whether I should be arrested or not. Apart from that, they were most likely waiting for the the right group to arrive, i.e. the officers who have me "in their care", in other words, who know something about me and could put pertinent ques- tions to me at an interrogation. That phase lasted about an hour and culminated in my arrest at 4.30 p.m. in front of the Pragoimpo building, just as I was leaving Wenceslas Square. The haste with which the StB officers pushed their way through the crowd towards me is evidence that they feared I would leave Wenceslas Square and deprive them of at least forma! grounds for my arrest. I was not arrested as someone obstructing a public official in the perfor- mance of his duty, but quite simply because I was who I was. I then waited some eight hours at the police station in Školská street to leam what they intended to do with me. The interrogation I underwent was a fairly general affair which touched on various different matters and did not point towards any specific suspicions that might be con- firrned or disproved. On the contrary, it was clear that they did not yetknow whether I was actually to be charged with anything, and if so, with what. The decision was eventually reached. Accordingly, I was detained and Jater charged and remanded for an alleged breach of the peace. However, since my mere presence at Wenceslas Square did not provide sufficient concrete grounds for charges to be preferred against me, let alone for me to be held on remand or convicted, the authorities also took certain other actions into account, [pageend169]DOCUMENTS namely, statements of mine which had been broadcast by foreign radio stations conceming the events of 15th Janu- ary, for which I would seemingly not have been prosecuted otherwise. This second count was therefore included in my indictment for purely functional reasons, so the authorities would have at least some sort of grounds for the indictment and verdict. The fact that my indictment was re-formulated several times, that my case was first discussed at a ministerial council even before Major Žák had written his report on my arrest, not to mention the desperate and largely unsuc- cessful attempts to obtain witnesses who might say some- thing specific against me, as well as many other factors, all create in me the strongest of impressions that it was first decided that I should go to prison and only afterwards was an effort made to contrive some legal grounds. The trial was properly and objectively conducted. All the more astonishing therefore was the verdict, which was totally at variance with the evidence produced. It struck me that the decision had been taken before the trial, and somewhere other than in the courtroom. And this only confirmed my impression that I had been arrested because I was who I was, and was convicted only because I had been arrested. Consequently, the verdict appears to me as no more nor less than an act of vengeance for the fact that I hold the views I hold and do nothing to conceal them. The actual terms of the judgement seem to me to be a substitute for something else, and a very poor one at that. In the circum- stances, it strikes me that the verdict would have been far more honest had it merely stated: "Václav Havel, you are getting on our nerves, and so you will go to prison for nine months". ln the recent period, and in fact in connection with my own case, there have been several occasions on which the independence of our judiciary has been asserted. I sin- cerely trust that this appeal tribuna! will demonstrate that independence by ordering my release. D84-D85 D85 (21st March 1989) Account by Ladislav Lis ofVáclav Havel's appeal hearing at the Municipal Court in Prague I was one of the 450-500 people who assembled in the courthouse. There was tension and drama in the air, with people in the crowd expressing many differing views about whether the court would overtum the verdict, or whether he 'd get an even harsher sentence. Whatever their views, they all expressed warm support for Václav Havel. It was a demonstration of sympathy with him and the other convicted activists, as well as a rally to mark 21st March, which had been declared a day of solidarity with political prisoners. It was particularly interesting in the sense that elsewhere the regime prevents us publicly demonstrating or protesting against such judgments, yet quite a large number of us were able to express our views right in the courthouse. In other words, a rally, that would otherwise have taken place in the street, in a public square or in some hall or other was tak:ing place in the very courthouse. And when we received news of the court's decision it was greeted with great indignation and disgust and shouts of "Disgraceful!", "Shame on you!", "Release Havel!", "Free Havel!", etc. At the same time, the spontaneous proposal emerged that we should organise a 24-hour hun- ger strike in protest against the verdict. The proposal was signed on the spot by 150 people. I think it was both symbolic and symptomatic. On the one hand you have the regime doing its best to scandalize the citizens' campaigns and their representatives, while on the other, you get people coming from as far afield as Tábor, Soběslav, Plzeň, Jihlava and North Bohemia - all of them fully aware whaťs at stake - and they're ready to defy official sanctions and proclaim out loud their right to freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, and freedom of speech.

Now that we are starting to enter the arena of real politics in a more visible fashion we ought to keep in mind more than ever before the initial and underlying moral motives of our activity, and we should be more wary than ever lest our responsibility start imperceptibly to split in two: persona) responsibility on the one hand and rolitical responsibility on the other. We have only one responsibility; whether as the most degraded, of prisoners and social outcasts, or as possible mouthpiee'es of the national will, we must be bound by the same single conscience. To do otherwise would not only be to dishonour our own past it would also put paid to our prospects. It has always been my convic- tion, and one I still hold to, that the origin of all the symptoms of crisis surrounding us is society's moral crisis and that none of our crises - from the economic and political to the ecological - can be solved unless we solve that moral crisis. In other words we must defeat the diabolical ideology of "l'm all right Jack" and human and civic apathy that have-so Jong and so thoroughly infected our society. From the article by Václav Havel The witching hour: between the outcast and the politician written on 7th October 1989 for the samizdat monthly Lidové noviny [pageend187]
