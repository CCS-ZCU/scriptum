On 4 January 1979 VONS issued a list of the cases which it was following (Statement 63) and this was updated in Statement 80, issued on 6 March 1979. VONS now lists the changes which have occurred since January which were not included in its March list. The statement gives the names of 21 people who have been released after serving their full prison sentences and appeals to the public to supply information about two of them — Robert Merganz and Jiri Vesely. They are supposed to have been released on probation but VONS does not know the date of their release. The statement also lists 12 people, mainly VONS members, who are in detention awaiting trial, seven people who have been convicted, six people who have received a suspended sentence, and seven who were earlier sentenced to serve terms of imprisonment but who have only recently been required to start serving them. Three people are currently being prosecuted while not in detention and three are interned in psychiatric clinics. VONS stresses that the details on these cases are far from complete and that it is aware that many cases are unknown to it. Statement 124, issued on the same day as 123, lists 25 cases on which VONS has very little information and appeals to the public to provide information about them. These two statements are accompanied by a questionnaire in which VONS lists all the facts which it needs on individual cases before it can take them up. A similar questionnaire was issued with Statement 63. VONS also reissues the names and addresses of new VONS members, previously published in Statement 117. August 10 August 1979. VONS Statement 125. The case of Ladislav Sevec, Tomas Stejskal and Zdenek Vardan. On 15-17 December 1977, four young people — Ladislav Sevec, Tomas Stejskal, Zdenek Vardan, and Josef Trochta — were arrested in Brno. With the exception of Vardan, all were charged under Article 7/1 with preparing to commit a criminal act under Article 180a/l (the hijacking of an aeroplane) and Article 109/1 (attempting to leave the Republic illegally). Sevec and Trochta were additionally charged under Article 8/1 with attempting to hijack a plane. Vardan was charged with failing to report the prepared hijacking, under Article 167/1. Sevec was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment, Stejskal and Vardan to one year, and Trochta was acquitted. At the end of the trial at the Municipal Court in Brno both the Public Prosecutor and all the defendants, with the exception of Trochta, appealed against the sentences. The appeals were heard by the Supreme Court at the end of August 1978. The sentences on Sevec and Stejskal were increased to nine and three years respectively, and those on Vardan and Trochta were confirmed. 2 [pageend5]VONS then gives some biographical details of all four and describes what allegedly happened. In October 1977 Sevec, accompanied by Trochta, flew from Prague to Brno. He had with him an air gun which was examined by airport security staff before he boarded the flight and they concluded that it was incapable of firing. Shortly after take-off, Sevec asked Trochta to join him in an attempt to hijack the plane. Trochta allegedly replied that he was afraid and also refused to give Sevec his briefcase. After that there was no further talk about the scheme. Some time later Sevec was out drinking in a Brno restaurant with some companions, including Stejskal and Vardan. He mentioned the ’attempt' to hijack the plane and asked if any of those present would like to hijack a plane with him. Later that evening he mentioned the subject of hijacking again in the company of the other three accused. Although he met the others subsequently, no further mention of the hijacking was made. Stejskal (born 1958) is accused of agreeing to Sevec’s proposal during the restaurant discussion but the only ’evidence’ against him is Sevec's own statement, denied by Stejskal and other witnesses. According to Stejskal, he confirmed Sevec’s accusation during the first stage of the preliminary investigation but only under threat of violence from the interrogators. Vardan (bom 1958) was accused of not reporting the conversation. VONS then describes how drunk the four were when the conversation in the restaurant took place. Sevec, for example, had drunk two litres of wine. Most of the discussion was on a general level, provoked by the topicality of the subject at that time (a Czech couple had hijacked a plane to West Germany). A court psychiatrist called to give evidence testified that Sevec displayed a certain mental imbalance, a tendency to fantasise, diminished social adaptability, tendencies towards neuroticism, and so on. VONS maintains that, in the case of Sevec, not all the circumstances were properly investigated and that the court exaggerated his behaviour, and ignored certain features of naivete. It also paid little attention to his age (18) at the time. In the case of Stejskal, VONS considers that the verdict was unjust as there is no genuine evidence that he was prepared to take part in a hijacking. VONS also regards the verdict on Vardan as unjust because Article 167/1 specifies that the defendant ’should reliably ascertain that others are preparing or committing a criminal act’. According to VONS, it seems logical that, given the circumstances, Vardan had no reason to take the restaurant discussion seriously and regarded it as mere boasting. In conclusion, VONS stresses that, in principle, it deplores cases of hi jacking and it does not regard hijackers as people who are unjustly prosecuted, hi the case of Sevec, its criticism is directed more at the length of the sentence than at the question of his guilt. It reiterates that motivation to commit such a crime should be seen in the context of the current closure of Czech borders which restricts travel abroad. This encourages people of unstable and immature character to attempt to leave the country by using force. VONS believes that such acts can best be prevented by enabling Czech citizens to travel freely abroad. 20 August 1979 (This is only the second time that VONS has commented on the prosecution of hijackers. Statement dealt with the case of the Bares brothers and was used 3 [pageend6]against VONS members during their trial on 22-23 October 1979. For an account of the trial see Palach Press Summary of Available Documents Noo 12, document no. 2.) VONS Statement 126. Further information on Petr Cibulka's hunger strike. In Statement 121, VONS reported on the hunger strike carried out by Petr Cibulka, sentenced to two years’ imprisonment on charges of ’incitement’ under paragraph 100 of the penal code. After three weeks in the Pankrac prison hospital, where he was taken at the end of his 32-day hunger strike, Cibulka was returned to Pilsen-Bory prison. There he was assigned identical work as that which he had previously been allocated and he began another hunger strike in support of his demand to be allocated different work» After 14 days he was again taken to Pankrac prison hospital where he ended his strike. Both the prison doctor and psychiatrist asked the governor of Bory prison to transfer Cibulka to another part of the prison and to other work but without result. After spending two weeks in hospital, Cibulka returned to Bory hand was punished for his hunger strike by being sentenced to 30 days’ solitary confinement. On 13 August 1979 Charter 77 and VONS sent an appeal on behalf of Cibulka to the General Public Prosecutor. 26 A ugust 1979. VONS Statement 128. Detained in Poland. On 20 August 1979 Polish Security forces detained three Czechoslovak citizens — Tomas Liska, David Nemec, and Karel Soukup — in Warsaw. Soukup had gone to Poland with the intention of joining a hunger-strike organised in protest at the detention of VONS members in Czechoslovakia. Liska and Nemec had gone as tourists. All three were escorted to Prague where they were detained. All of them had their hair cut, allegedly for reasons of hygiene, although the doctor had not examined their hair. On the evening of 23 August Nemec and Soukup were released while Liska was taken to the psychiatric clinic in Prague-Bohunice although there was nothing to suggest that he needed psychiatric treatment. 29 August 1979. VONS Statement 129. The psychiatric internment of Tomas Liska Tomas Liska, born in 1957, is a student of theatre and film studies at the Philosophy Faculty of Charles University in Prague. On 23 August 1979 he was transferred from prison to the psychiatric clinic in Prague-Bohnice where he was interned against his will in order that he might be observed 4, [pageend7]’to see whether he displays homosexual tendencies, signs of drug addiction, or suicidal tendencies’. The papers recommending the internment were issued by Dr Miroslav Nosek who was present during Liska's interrogation but did not examine him. On 31 August Liska was transferred by the Security Service to another clinic in Prague 2, again under recommendation by Dr Nosek and again without medical examination. On 3 September 1979 Liska was released without any explanation for his detention. VONS concludes that Liska’s case constitutes a clear abuse of psychiatry which is being used as a means of ’exerting pressure on behalf of the power apparatus’. 3 September 1979. VONS Statement 130. Cases of police repression. VONS aimounces that during the last few months there have been an increasing number of occasions on which force has been used by both plainclothes and uniformed policemen, who have thus violated the law. A number of complaints have been sent to the Ministry of the Interior and the Military Prosecutor but they have all been rejected as groundless. Among the examples contained in the statement, is the case of Charter signatory Pavel Zajicek, a member of the Plastic People of the Universe, who was summoned to a police station in Prague 5 on 1 August and asked to substantiate his whereabouts for the period between 18 and 21 July. During this time an under-age girl had been raped in Zajicek’s place of residence, Radotin. Zajicek assumed that this insinuation was another form of harassment to which he had been frequently subjected by the Secret Service on account of his non-conformist cultural activity and he therefore exercised his right to refuse to answer any questions. Zajicek also maintains that as he was neither accused nor under suspicion there was no legal need for him to provide an alibi. As a result of his refusal, he was detained for eight hours and brutally beaten up before being released. Another example given by VONS is that of Leos Adamira who, on 15 August, took his wife and three small sons to a swimming pool in his home town of Uhlirska Janovice. A motorised police patrol asked him to produce his identity card although the police knew that he had lost it and reported the loss to them several days earlier. In fact, at the time Adamira was stopped, his card had already been found and was in the hands of the police. When he failed to produce his identity card, and was unwilling to leave his wife, who was ill, alone at the pool and go immediately to the police station, one of the two policemen beat him up. Adamira eventually managed to run off. 10 September 1979 VONS Statement 131. Pavel Skala sentenced. On 17 September a district court in Pilsen sentenced 25-year-old Pavel Skala to ten months’ imprisonment to be served in the second category for allegedly supporting fascism. (Details of the case are to be found in Statements 85 and 94.) The presiding judge, Mrs Jitka Fiserova, rejected as unreliable the evidence of 5 [pageend8]three witnesses — Rehak, Cupka, and Zajac — who denied that statements made by Skala propagated fascism and argued that, on the contrary, he attacked ito The judge decided to believe only the evidence of a prison guard, Baxa, whom she described as the only reliable witness. 23 September 1979 VQNS Statement 133O The case of Jaroslav Savrda. The trial of Jaroslav Savrda was held in Ostrova on 1-3 and 7-8 August. Savrda was charged with subversion of the Republic under Article 98/1 and accused of distributing hostile literature. He was sentenced to two-and-a-half years’ imprisonment and a fine of 5000 crowns» During the five-day hearing a detained VONS member, Albert Cerny, was called as a witness. In his testimony he defended the idea of Padlock Editions as an emergency measure at a time when Czech national culture was endangered. Savrda is very ill and during his detention received medical attention only as a result of hunger strikes. Both he and the Public Prosecutor appealed against the sentence. 5 September 1979 VONS Statement 134. Harassment of parallel-university seminars. On 10 September the Secret Service detained polytechnic student Vladimir Prajzler. He was interrogated for 17 hours and then detained for 48 hours. After his release he was rearrested after walking 20 yards from the police station and held for a further 48 hours. A thorough search was made of his flat and a great amount of written material was confiscated despite the fact that the police did not possess a search warrant. On 12 September Ludek Bednar and Petr Ragan were arrested in Prajzler's flat and detained for 48 hours. Another polytechnic student, Lenka Dvorakova, who witnessed the arrest was subject to two lengthy interrogations, the purpose of which was to obtain information about the philosophical and literary courses which allegedly took place regularly at the flat. At the same time, the Secret Service asked about other 'independent educational activities’ and questioned several people who regularly attend courses at the parallel university. 28 September 1979 VONS Statement 135. Measures against independent Catholic leadership On 10 September 1979 the Security Service, with the permission of the General Public Prosecutor's Office, which was granted on 28 August, launched an action against active Catholics and independent Catholic literature in Prague, Brno, Olomouc, and other places. The authorities took into custody Josef Adamek, 6, [pageend9]a pensioner from Brno; Frantisek Lizna, a clergyman denied state consent to carry out pastoral duties; and a Charter 77 signatory from Olomouc; Jan Krumpholc, a worker from Radikov near Olomouc; Josef Vlcek, a worker from Olomouc; and Rudolf Smahel, a clergyman from Uhersky Brod«, They were charged with having duplicated and distributed religious literature. Large quantities of this literature were confiscated during extensive house searches. For example, the police seized 300 copies of a publication entitled ’The history of the Roman Catholic Church in Bohemia and Moravia', religious pictures and photographs, duplicating machines and stencils from the home of Jan Krumpholc. Krumpholc and his wife were imprisoned for similar activity during the 1950s when they served 11 and 8 years respectively. VONS then lists those detained for a short period and interrogated and whose flats were searched. It also names some of the Security personnel involved in the action. 29 September 1979 (For brief biographies of the arrested, see Jan Simsa’s report in this issue of the Bulletin) VONS Statement 136. On 13 September Charter signatory Vera Vranova was attacked by two men in the middle of the night near her home. One of them hit her several times saying, 'that's for the Charter, you bitch. Next time it will be worse. ’ Vranova had earlier sent a letter to the President of the Republic asking him to put a stop to the brutal harassment of human-rights activists. VONS reminds the public that this is the tenth case known to them of such attacks. 28 September 1979 VONS Statement 139. The detention of Julius Tomin. On 5 October Dr Julius Tomin was detained in northern Bohemia near the village of Repcice. He was first taken to a police station in Litomerice and, after several hours, transferred to a psychiatric clinic in Horni Berkovice where he was interned against his will. Tomin’s wife Zdena, a Charter 77 spokesperson, was only told of her husband's whereabouts the day after she asked the police to order a search for him. VONS regards Tomin's internment as another example of the abuse of psychiatry (following the case of Liska, see Statement 129) but stress that, in this case, the doctors did not succumb to police pressure and acted according to their professional ethics. Tomin was released soon after his wife located him and urged his release. The detention of Tomin, says VONS, must be seen as part of a wider police action against the inhabitants of a house in Repcice (owned by the Barkan and Kubicek families — see Bulletin no. 11). From midday on 5 October until midnight on 6 October, the house was surrounded by police cars and policemen with dogs. All visitors were detained and subjected to lengthy interrogations. These included Kveta Bincova who was accompanied by a two-year-old child. 14 October 1979 7 [pageend10]VONS Statement 140o The detention of Rudolf Batteko On 1 October 1979 Charter 77 signatory and VONS member Rudolf Battek was arrested in the street and taken to Secret Service headquarters in Prague. 48 hours later he was charged with the subversion of the Republic under Article 98/i and, as a member of VONS, accused of participating in the preparation and distribution of documents hostile to the socialist system of the Republic and also of being in possession of an allegedly anti-state document entitled 'On freedom and power'. On 5 October, after 96 hours in prison, Battek was released and informed that a further interrogation would take place. Since then he has been under constant surveillance from the Secret Service. 10 October 1979 (PP comment: Battek’s release followed widespread protest from the major parties of the Socialist International. Battek is a member of the Independent Socialist group which attempts to maintain links with the Socialist International.) For Battek’s own report on his arrest see Palach Press Summary of Available Documents, No. 12, Document 130 VONS Statements 141 (14 October), 142 (19 October), and 143 (23 October) all deal with the trial of six VONS members on 22-23 October. For an account of the trial and the verdict see Palach Press Summary of Available Documents, No. 12, Documents 2 and 3. VONS Statement 144. This statement lists the people who were allowed into the courtroom, the measures taken by the police to prevent others from doing so, and notes the short-term detention of some of those who came to the court building. It gives the main points of the indictment and argues that none of these has been proved during the course of the trial. Summaries of the defendants' final speeches and those of their lawyers are given. All the lawyers asked for the full acquittal of their clients; only Benda’s lawyer, Dr Penka, stated that he was doing so because it was the wish of his client. The statement describes the hastiness of the trial proceedings, and the inaccurate reporting of the Czechoslovak mass media which included such outright lies as that VONS had defended terrorists. It briefly mentions the international response to the trial and names the other five VONS members still in detention, pointing out that criminal proceedings against another member, Rudolf Battek, are continuing. Two appendices give the names of 20 people detained for 48 hours and a further 16 held for shorter periods, and the full text of the final speeches of the defendants. (These are included in the transcript of the trial. See Summary No. 12, Document 2.) 8 [pageend11]VONS Statement 145O Charter activists detained On 2 November 1979 police detained eleven Charter 77 activists on suspicion of preparing to commit an act of terrorism (Article 94/i). The police claimed that on 28 October they had received an anonymous letter which had ’stated the intention of destroying an important public building and assassinating the President of the Republic, Dr Gustav Husak'. Those detained were Jiri and Jan Bednar, the sons of Charter signatory and VONS member Otta Bednarova, who were picked up after visiting their mother in Ruzyne prison; Jaroslav Kukal, a musician; Ivan Kyncl, Ivan Dejmal, Jan Rumi, Svatopluk Karasek, Miroslav Tyl, Jaroslav Suk, Vladimir Prajzler, and Miroslav Belovsky. During extensive house searches the police removed Charter 77 and VONS documents, typewriters, and the samizdat periodical Information on Charter 77. VONS points out that the confiscated material ’can in no way be linked to terrorism’ and that ’the alleged criminal act is only a pretext for further police repression against Charter 77’. 3 November 1979 (For further information see in this Bulletin: Open Letter from Charter 77, and the ’Letter to the Prague District Military Prosecutor’.) VONS Statement 147. Jiri Kaplan detained. On 12 October Jiri Kaplan was arrested and charged under Article 178 with the obstruction of State control over Church institutions and religious societies. Kaplan is the father of ten children (six of them minors) and was employed as an information technician at the Centre for Scientific, Technological, and Economic Information. On 10 September Kaplan’s home was searched by the Secret Service who confiscated a large amount of written material, most of it of a religious nature. Kaplan was detained and charged under Article 118 with illicit trading. After 96 hours he was released and the charge was requalified as that of obstructing state control over Church institutions. While still at liberty, Kaplan was interrogated several times about his contacts with Moravian Catholics, his translating activities, and his contacts with believers abroad whose addresses had been confiscated during the house search. VONS points out that Kaplan's case must be seen in the context of the state security campaign against Catholics in Moravia, including the persecution of Father Josef Zverina, who is charged with the same offence as Kaplan. (See VONS Statement 135.) Zverina is very ill and under medical treatment but nevertheless he is constantly summoned for interrogations. (For more information see the report by Jan Simsa in this Bulletin.) 9, [pageend12]VONS Statement 151. Harassment of cancer patient, On 30 October 1979, three officers from the Security Service in Ostrava (Cpt. Nedela, Major Matysch and Cpt. Greca) went to the hospital in Opava to see Jiri Legerski, a 30-year-old former miner, now a cancer patient, Legerski, who lives on an invalid pension, has already had three operations and has to spend from two to six months of each year in hospital. At the time of the visit from the Security Service he was being fed intravenously and was awaiting a blood transfusion. The officers demanded that he hand over ’illegal items’ which they claimed he had at his home. They then drove him, dressed in his pyjamas, to his flat. Despite the fact that they had no search warrant and that Legerski and his wife asked them several times to leave, they confiscated a number of items and asked Legerski to sign a statement that he had handed them over, which he refused to do. He was then taken to a Security Service villa, without any explanation being offered of his detention and interrogation. After the interrogation, he was taken back to his flat and the Security officers conducted an official search lasting several hours. Later in the evening, still dressed in his pyjamas, Legerski was taken for another interrogation. During this, he complained several times of the cold and repeatedly informed the interrogator that he was in great pain. At one point he was informed that he was being questioned in connection with criminal proceedings against'Smahel and co. ’ (accused of distributing religious literature). Totally exhausted, Legerski eventually refused to answer any more questions. He was returned to the hospital in the middle of the night. Legerski is known for his Catholic beliefs. Two years ago he suffered a nervous breakdown after he was stopped on the Czechoslovak-Polish border and religious literature, which he had bought quite legally in Poland, was confiscated from him. 2 December 1979 VONS Statement 152. Albert C erny sentenced. On 27 November 1979 the regional court in Brno, chaired by Dr Dolihal, sentenced Albert Cerny, born 4 February 1937, Charter signatory and VONS member, to three-and-a-half years' imprisonment. Cerny had been charged with subversion of the Republic under Article 98/i. The court also decided to confiscate Cerny’s typewriters and a large number of documents. The prosecutor, Dr Brym, based his indictment on the assertion that Cerny had allowed his flat to be used as an archive for anti-state and anti-socialist documents, that he had distributed these documents and arranged for others to do so, and that, towards the end of 1978, he had become a member of an illegal organisation, VONS. He alleged that all these activities had been motivated by hostility towards socialism. A large part of Cerny’s interrogation during the trial consisted of a reconstruction of his activity during 1968-69 when he had been a member of the preparatory committee of the Club of Involved Non-Party Members (KAN) in Opava. Regarding his activities during 1978-79, Cerny stated that he had copied works by banned authors or arranged for them to be copied by others. The court summoned Dr Jaromir Savrda, 10 [pageend13]sentenced in August 1979 to two-and-a-half years’ imprisonment, as a witness in connection with this» Cerny admitted that he had written an essay entitled 'The problem of the Czech nation’, and that he had duplicated a statement entitled '100 Years of Czech socialism’ (See Palach Press Update, April 1978), a letter to Pope John Paul H, and an open letter to West European Social- Democratic leaders from Rudolf Battek. The defence lawyer, Dr Machourek, argued that the court had failed to prove that Cerny had acted out of hostility towards socialism and that therefore his activity could not be classed as subversion and called for Cerny’s acquittal. During the trial Cerny denied that he had acted out of hostility towards socialism and described VONS as a 'legal form of appeal to the highest state organs’. Copying books of authors not published in Czechoslovakia was, he said, a 'necessary form of citizens’ self-help'. Cerny described himself as an Independent Socialist (a group led by Rudolf Battek and Jiri Muller. For their policies see Palach Press Summary No. 10, Document No. 6 and New Statesman, 10 November 1978) and stressed the need for dialogue not only at the international level but also between socialists in Czechoslovakia. Cerny’s final speech was interrupted many times by Dr Dolihal. After sentence had been passed Cerny immediately lodged an appeal while the prosecutor reserved his decision. 3 December 1979 (Palach Press can supply a photograph of Albert Cerny.) Charter 77 Document 27. This lists the names of 39 new Charter signatories, 14 of whom are workers. This brings the total number of signatories to 1, 017. 8 October 1979 Letter from Charter 77 and VONS to Dr Jan Fejes, General Public Prosecutor. On 13 August 1979, Jiri Hajek, Zdena Tominova, and Ladislav Hejdanek (in the name of Charter 77) and Pavel Roubal, Anna Sabatova, and Dr Gertruda Sekaninova-Cakrtova (in the name of VONS) wrote to Fejes to inform him of the details of the case of Petr Cibulka, in prison since 17 April 1978 and sentenced to two years on 3 October 1978. Sime he was transferred from the detention centre in Brno to prison in Bory near Pilsen, he has been the target for regular physical assaults by some of his fellow-prisoners, encouraged if not actually provoked by the prison authorities. They describe Cibulka's various hunger strikes, undertaken to support his request to be moved to another part of the prison and express their belief that this request is a reasonable one and ’in harmony with the duties of the prison authorities’. (For Cibulka’s case see VONS Statement no. 121, Palach Press Bulletin no. 11, p. 21.) 11 [pageend14]Letter to the prosecutors in the VONS trial, Dr Janda and Dr Adamec 16 people wrote to the prosecutors in the VONS trial, informing them that they intended to go on hunger strike for the duration of the trial in order to emphasise their demand that the accused be released immediately» (The strike lasted from 8 a. mo on 22 October until 8 a» m. on the 24th.) Joint Statement by Charter 77, the Committee to Defend the Unjustly Prosecuted (VONS), and the Social Self-Defence Committee - KOR. On 22 October 1979, the trial of Petr Uhl, Vaclav Havel, Vaclav Benda, Otta Bednarova, Jiri Dienstbier, and Dana Nemcova, accused of subversion of the Republic, will open in Prague. The government of Czechoslovakia has made this decision despite the many protests of public opinion throughout the world» Despite the appeal for detente, they are in prison for their convictions» This action, aimed against people who defend human rights, is unlawful. We declare that we will continue in our endeavours to defend human dignity and to defend all people prosecuted in our countries. Signed: Charter 77, the Committee to Defend the Unjustly Prosecuted (VONS), the Social Self-Defence Committee - KOR 21 October 1979 Polish hunger strike and Charter 77 telegram On 3 October 1979 at 7 p. m., eleven people began a hunger strike in the Church of the Holy Cross in Warsaw, which was intended to express their solidarity with those defenders of human rights who arein prison in both Czechoslovakia and Poland. Those taking part in the strike included members of both the Social Self-Defence Committee - KOR and ROPCiO. On 6 October they were joined by three other people. The hunger strikers issued a statement of their aims which is reprinted in Information about Charter 77 No» 14. On 8 October eleven people in Prague began a similar hunger strike which lasted between two and five days. The strikers demanded the release of two Poles currently in detention and of Czech and Slovak political prisoners, particularly the VONS members. Charter 77 spokesmen sent the following telegram thanking the Poles for their action: 'We thank you for your effective expression of solidarity. We are with you in your effort to gain respect for human dignity at all times and in all places» ’ 12 [pageend15]Interview with Jacek Kuron, 12 October 19791 Palach Press interviewed Jacek Kuron, who took part in the hunger strike organised in Warsaw at the beginning of October«, Qo I’d like to ask you a few questions about the recent hunger strike in Warsaw in support of political prisoners in Poland and Czechoslovakia. How many people took part in the strike and who are they? A. 15 people took part in the strike« They included a well-known actress, Halina Mikolajska, Jerzy Martuszewski, a director, Anka Kowalska and Jacek Bierezin, both poets, (and Andrzej Czuma, Kazimierz Janusz, Jacek Kuron, Jan Litynski, Father Stanislaw Malkowski, Adam Michnik, and Mariusz Wilk)«, Q. What was the aim of the hunger strike? A. It was a question of expressing our solidarity with our friends imprisoned in Czechoslovakia, activists and defenders of human rights and members of Charter 77 and the Committee to Defend the Unjustly Prosecuted (VONS), with Catholic activists arrested in Slovakia, with our two friends in Poland who have been arrested and are now in prison, Edmund Zadrozynski, a worker activist from Grudziadz, and Adam Wojciechowski from Warsaw, a member of Amnesty International. Q. Is this solidarity based on a similarity of aims between KOR and Charter 77? A. Certainly, but that isn't the important thing. Most important is that people are being persecuted for their beliefs and we wished to express our solidarity with all those persecuted for their beliefs. Q. Do you feel that both groups face a similar kind of repression? A. The situation in Czechoslovakia is much worse and the repression much greater than in Poland. It is very important to be aware of this because, for example, we know for certain that since the summer of this year there have been frequent hunger strikes in Czechoslovakia by various people in solidarity with those in prison and this hasn't reached the Western press«, Q. What do you see as the most important aspect of the cooperation between Polish and Czechoslovak human-rights activists? A. The most important thing is that we are confronting the solidarity between the totalitarian regimes which rule our countries with the solidarity between our peoples. This is the most important thing«, This is the question for the future of Eastern Europe and for the chances of peace here. Qo Do you think this cooperation can continue? A. Yes. I think that we are now creating the beginnings of future peaceful cooperation between peoples of this part of Europe. Q. If the members of VONS now awaiting trial receive heavy sentences, do you think this will have any significance for human-rights activists in Poland? A. Yes, of course. We shall try to meet this with an energetic response. We treat this struggle as our own struggle, as a struggle on behalf of our own arrested and imprisoned. We feel obligated to struggle for them. We feel personally obligated because we have met them, because the repression began when Dr Sabata was arrested for trying to attend a meeting with us ... 13 [pageend16]Letter to Czechoslovak and Polish human-rights activists from Academician Andrei Sakharov and others«. In October 1979 a letter was sent to human rights defenders in Poland and Czechoslovakia by a number of human-rights activists in the Soviet Union. The letter was signed by Andrei Sakharov, Elena Bonner, Tatyana Osipova, Malva Landa, Yuri Yarim Agayev (members of the Moscow Group for Monitoring the Observance of the Helsinki Agreement in the Soviet Union), Vyacheslav Bakhmin and Leonard Ternovski (members of the Working Group for Monitoring the Abuse of Psychiatry for Political Purposes). The writers express the hope that their letter 'will serve as a basis for more regular contacts and for the unification of our struggle for human rights in Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union«, We hope that full acquaintance with each other’s letters, statements, and articles will allow us to reach the definite conclusion that, in general, our views are identical and that we all take as our starting point principles which confirm the need to respect human rights everywhere and at all times, irrespective of state and national frontiers . . . it would obviously be fitting to formulate a common statement of the human rights groups in Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union, which would stress the universal principles applicable to human rights in our countries«, Being aware of the specific role of the Soviet Union in relation to Poland and Czechoslovakia, we also consider it our task to struggle against the violation of human rights in your countries ...' Charter 77 answers«. In their reply to this letter, dated 6 November 1979, the three Charter 77 spokesmen, Jiri Hajek, Zdena Tominova, and Ladislav Hejdanek wrote that, 'Together with you, we consider it our struggle to defend the rights and dignity of man everywhere in the world. We agree with the view that, because of the social and political structure of our countries, we have with you and with our Polish friends many similar or identical problems. We would gladly participate in work which would express these common problems and outline possible solutions«, ’ Charter 77 Statement on the death of Frantisek KriegeL Dr Frantisek Kriegel, a great man and fighter, doctor and politician, died on 3rd December in the afternoon, aged 71, after a ten-week courageous battle against the effects of a heart attack. The action by the authorities did not allow us to take our dignified leave on his last journey, but no one and nothing can wipe from our hearts and minds the rich bequest of his ideas and deeds, his entire personality«, We shall always come back to this inexhaustible source of moral strength and determination, experience and political wisdom. In this respect Frantisek Kriegel has not died and cannot die for us. Yet our grief at his sudden departure from life is no smaller, we have lost a unique friend and fellow fighter. ’ 14 [pageend17]There then follows a biography of Dr Kriegel and the statement continues: ’For a long time, particularly since the emergence and activity of Charter 77 Frantisek Kriegel had been the target of slanderous attacks in the Czechoslovak mass mediae His flat and often his every move were virtually under constant police supervisiono Two uniformed policemen even accompanied him on his last journey to hospital» He showed proud indifference to all the harassment, he lost nothing of his immense energy and subtle sense of humour, of his kindness, his hospitality and frankness with his friends and all who came to see him with good intentions. Today we can no longer tell him how much we respected all this, how much he had meant to us, but we are and shall always remain fully aware of it. Frantisek Kriegel is no longer» But his entire life has filled one of the brightest chapters of our and international history» The example of this great man commits us, it is now up to us to carry on the heritage of his truthful and sincere struggle for human dignity.’ Prague, 6 December 1979 Signed by Jiri Hajek Zdena Tominova Ladislav Hejdanek Charter 77 spokesman Charter 77 spokesperson Charter 77 spokesman (Photographs of Kriegel taken shortly before his death are available from Palach Press.) Open Letter from Charter 77 On 14 November 1979 Charter 77 spokesmen wrote to the Prosecutor General of the CSSR and to the Military Prosecutor of the CSSR: ’In recent years hundreds of Czechoslovak citizens as well as entire groups have approached State, Party and public officials with complaints, representations and applications concerning observance of legality and civil rights; in some cases they have received non-commital replies, but the overwhelming majority have received no reply at all. Many citizens chose the form of an open letter and asked the Czechoslovak mass media to publish this — in vain. Naturally, and entirely in the spirit of international pacts on human and political rights, the Final Act of the Helsinki Accords and in accordance with the fundamental principles of the basic principles of democracy they informed their friends and fellow-citizens about their endeavours, and in some cases they solicited the assistance of international organisations of which Czechoslovakia is a member. The fact that some of these open letters were published in the West (the majority in the progressive Left-wing press) and certain especially striking cases of the violation of legality had to be taken up by the world-wide highly-respected non-political organisation Amnesty International is the logical result of the absolute anonymity of the Czechoslovak authorities, their representatives who have erected a wall of silence and the National Security Corps to divide them from citizens voicing criticism. 15 [pageend18]To give this anti-democ ratic division between citizens and their institutions — so tragic for the development of society — a minimum constitutional appearance, six signatories of Charter 77 and members of the Committee to Defend the Unjustly Prosecuted (VONS) had to be sentenced to long terms of imprisonment in October 1979 in a trial whose preparation, procedure and outcome aroused indignation among world democratic opinion. If we are approaching you today once again in an open letter the reason is that we feel it our duty to draw attention to the escalation of anti-constitutional trends in the activities of the National Security Corps which, unless brought to a prompt stop, can lead to an even more profound split between Czechoslovak citizens and the State at a time when the serious economic situation demands the responsible and voluntary participation of all citizens in our country in all public affairs. We have on many occasions pointed to cases of unlawful harassment of innocent citizens by members of the State and Public Security yet no remedy ha«- been forthcoming» On the contrary, instances of the use of sheer physical violence and the misuse of medical establishments for applying gross pressure on non-conforming citizens are multiplying and members of the National Security Corps no longer even try to conceal this • •»• We have well-founded reason to believe that this terrorising of citizens was not just a temporary manifestation of the nervousness of State officials who were aware of the unjustifiable nature of the trial. In the first week of November a further wave of house searches and interrogations of some two dozen young people took place» Most of them were signatories of Charter 77. They were detained for 48 hours and subsequently released without a proper certificate for their respective employers (one of the detained women had already been penalised by a cut in her holidays owing to absence without leave). Most of the men had their hair shorn off by force and without any justification. One person was beaten up with a truncheon. Unfortunately, such waves of repression are almost current in our country» But the shocking and alarming circumstance in this case is the disproportionate pretext which the police chose for their action. Most of the interrogated and detained persons were allegedly suspect of 'preparing a terrorist crime’, allegedly reported by an unnamed person in an anonymous letter and which was to have been carried out 'by the destruction of a major object in Prague and the assassination of the President of the Republic'1 None of the house searches revealed anything that might in any way be linked with terrorism. On the contrary, the confiscated objects again included literature and materials of Charter 77. All the detained persons had to be released after two or three days. The State Security officials know best that they will not find terrorists among the Charter 77 signatories. The purpose of the existence and activity of Charter 77, namely to contribute to the observance of legality and human rights in Czechoslovakia, are sufficiently well known to both the authorities and the Czechoslovak public to whom Charter 77 is submitting its materials. And yet in that same week in November the Czechoslovak media, and in particular 'Rude Pravo' carried articles which indirectly justified this absurd police action against the Charter 77 signatories: they tried in every 16 [pageend19]possible way to create some link between the trial of the six VONS members, its international response and the very struggle for human rights and international terrorism«. It would be futile to enter into polemics with this useless and distorted effort. We only want to point out that the artificial creation of an atmosphere cf fear and terror is dangerous not only for its authors but above all for the whole of society. Proceeding from the unequivocal provisions of the Law on the Prosecutor’s Office, we call upon you to instigate a prompt investigation into the unlawful acts by the police which we have mentioned, and to draw conclusions from them for those who have caused the violation of legality. The question of the possibilities and means of supervision and control of citizens over the activities of the National Security Corps is becoming exceedingly urgent, That is why we, moreover, call upon you to investigate the action of the Czechoslovak mass media which are meant to be an instrument of democracy but which are today helping to conceal its shortcomings as well as outright unlawfulness. Violence has always led into a blind alley in history. It is not in our power to prevent or evade violence consecrated by the State. But we know that the longing for a just arrangement of public affairs as well as the longing for truth cannot be silenced by force or the physical liquidation of individuals or entire groups. Methods resembling the 1950s can only further harm our society without solving anything. What is needed here is not a trial behind closed doors and terrorising citizens but a businesslike and lively dialogue between the Government and the people. Jiri Hajek Zdena Tominova Ladislav Hejdanek Charter 77 spokesman Charter 77 spokesperson Charter 77 spokesman Letter to Prague District Military Prosecutor. On 20 November 1979, 12 Charter 77 signatories wrote to the District Military Prosecutor’s Office in Prague, protesting at the abuse of power by the security service. The letter was endorsed by the three official Charter spokesmen. ’The following citizens were taken into custody by the State Security bodies between 2-6 November 1979: Ivan Kyncl, Jan and Jiri Bednar, Jan Rumi, Jaroslav Suk, Miroslav Tyl, Ivan Dejmal, Svatopluk Karasek, Miroslav Belovsky, Jaroslav Kukal, Vladimir Prajzler, Markéta and Pavla Nemcova, Tomas Liska, Josef Danisz, Martin Hybler and others. Mrs Anna Grusova was subjected to interrogation under pressure on 5 November. She was informed that if she refuses to give evidence she, as well as her young daughter Milena, would also be detained. 17 [pageend20]Searches vere carried out in the homes and places of work of some of these persons. The house search warrants stated that they were being carried out under a decision of a State Security investigator, dated 2nd November 1979, ref. noo OVS-VS-651/79 which provided for the instigation of criminal proceedings for the preparation of a terrorist crime under Article 7/1 of the Penal Code and Article 94/1 of the Penal Code. The reason given was that it had been 'ascertained that an anonymous letter had been despatched on 28 October 1979 stating the intention of damaging the socialist social and state system of the Republic by destroying a major object in the capital and assassinating the President of the Republic□ ’ On these grounds the cited citizens were interrogated, detained in custody cells for 48-75 hours (without being made to appear before a prosecutor) and they were treated as though they had been charged with a crime» Some of them, for example, Ivan Kyncl, sustained serious damage to his health as a result of physical violence accomp anied by insults and threats. Some of the others mentioned in this document were detained under Article 23 of Law No. 40/1974 under the pretext of suspicion of having committed the crime of incitement, or other criminal offences (in none of these cases the conditions existed justifying the detention of a citizen under the law in question i»e. they did not 'threaten public order'). In fact some of them were detained in their flats» Dr Danisz and Dr Hybler were not even formally informed of the reason for their detention» None of those concerned were even told why he or she had been selected without evident legal justification to be subjected to humiliating procedures (for example, most of the detained men had their hair shorn off against their will at Ruzyne prison)» The formality of the incriminated suspicions of criminal acts is borne out also by the fact that no further investigation proceedings were taken against almost all the detained during their custody» The procedure of the officials involved in the quoted measures made it clear that they were aware that the detained citizens were Charter 77 signatories, a civic initiative striving to ensure observance of legality in relations between the authorities and citizens - in brief, that they were citizens actively committed under Paragraph 17 of the Czechoslovak Constitution. This was evident from the content of the materials confiscated during house searches. This fact in itself could and ought to have demonstrated the absurdity of linking their committed activities in any way to the preparation of terrorist activities. Yet they acted as though such charges were justified. The victims, therefore, rightly wonder whether this was not an attempt to force them to abandon their committed activity by intimidation. But leaving aside this aspect, the action by the State Security officials must in any case be classified as the crime of restri cting personal freedom (under Article 231/1, 2 of the Penal Code)together with the crime of misusing authority by a public official ( under Article 158/1 letters a, b, c of the Penal Code)» We are therefore reporting our treatment by members of the State Security to you as the competent Prosecutor's Office (under Article 12 of the Law on the Prosecutor's Office) and we demand an investigation to ascertain whether there has not been a violation of the law. 18 [pageend21]Signed: Ivan Kyne 1, Jiri Bednar, Jan Rumi, Jaroslav Suk, Ivan Dejmal, Svatopluk Karásek, Markéta Nemcova, Pavla Nemcova, Tomas Liska, Josef Danisz, Martin Hybler. Prague, 20 November 1979 We endorse the above report on the committed criminal acts«, Jiri Hajek Zdena Tominova Ladislav Hejdanek Charter 77 spokesman Charter 77 spokesperson Charter 77 spokesman Letter from Ivan Kyncl to the Military Regional Prosecutor, Prague 4, reporting an abuse of power by the police, 8 November 1979, Kyncl asserts that the authorities of the prison in Prague 1, where he was detained for 48 hours, committed a criminal act under Article 158 (abuse of powers by public officials). He gives a detailed description of the circumstances of his detention between 2 and 4 November, Kyncl was held on the pretext of being under suspicion of having prepared to commit a terrorist act. (See VONS Statement 145) He says that not one of the questions which he was asked during the interrogation had anything to do with terrorism but dealt mainly with the items confiscated during a police search of his flat. (Palach Press comment: among the items confiscated were 4, 000 negatives.) During the initial interrogation Kyncl drew attention to the fact that he had had a severe spinal fracture and had undergone a difficult operation. The interrogator took note of this and allowed him to lie down in his cell during the day if his back gave him pain. The next day, however, a plainclothed policeman threatened to put him in solitary confinement if he lay down and took him to be photographed and to have his fingerprints taken. Kyncl refused on the grounds that he was only under suspicion and had not been charged with any offense. He was then deprived of food and threatened with a fine but when he continued to refuse, he was attacked by the plainclothed man and three other policemen who beat him with truncheons, particularly on his back. At the same time, they swore at him and threatened to run him over when he got out of prison. Eventually, Kyncl was forced to submit to being photographed and fingerprinted but he refused to sign the necessary protocol on the grounds that the action was unlawful. This resulted in further punishment and eventually to solitary confinement. In addition, he had his beard shaved off and his hair cut. Kyncl submits medical evidence that he was subsequently given sick leave because of the spinal injuries sustained through being beaten up and asserts that there will be many more such medical reports because his health difficulties, clearly resulting from this attack, are getting worse. Kyncl offers various kinds of proof of his statement, lists witnesses, and asks for a confrontation between himself and the plainclothed policeman involved. He requests that the military prosecutor open proceedings against this man under Article 158/a, b, c. 19 [pageend22]Letter from VONS to the International Federation for Human Rights. On 23 October 1979 the Committee to Defend the Unjustly Prosecuted (VONS) sent the following letter to the International Federation for Human Rights: ’The Committee to Defend the Unjustly Prosecuted (VONS) is of the opinion that, in the present-day situation when some of its members have received long sentences for their activity and others are in detention awaiting trial, international support has invaluable significance for its work. During the present information blockade within Czechoslovakia, this is the only corrective to the behaviour of the Czechoslovak state organs. The fact that Daniel Mayer has announced that VONS has been accepted as a member of the International Federation for Human Rights constitutes a most important source of support for the continuation of our activity» With best wishes »»»' Open Letter from Julius Tomin to the Minister of the Interior, 28 September 1979 Two uniformed policemen have been sitting in front of Tomin's door for the past three months, frequently preventing visitors from entwring his flat» Tomin explains that, because such activity is unlawful, he cannot recognise the policemen as such and, therefore, when they recently asked him to produce his identity card he refused to do so. He asserts that in a situation when the country is shaken by economic and social disturbances it is important for people to learn to respect the law and it is particularly important for the police and security forces to do soo When he refused to produce his card, the two policemen began to struggle with him and tried to silence him when he called for help. When two women, who had heard Tomin shouting, came into the corridor from their flats the policemen released him since they are always concerned not to act brutally in front of witnesses» Tomin then quotes two subsequent conversations between these policemen and his wife from which it transpired that they knew perfectly well who he was and therefore had no need to ask for his identity card in the first place and that they had been ordered by their superiors to pretend that the incident had never taken place. Tomin sees some hope for the country in the fact that the courage of two women was able to stop the police using more brutal force. He explains that he will send this letter to a number of people and institutions so that they will know that two policemen are stationed permanently outside his door and he invites anyone, including the Minister, to come and see for themselves» Letter from Pavel Roubal to Suarez» On 8 September 1979, Roubal wrote a letter to Suarez in his capacity as leader of a country which will host the 1980 European Conference on Security and Cooperation» Roubal wanted to inform him about those actions of the Czechoslovak state authorities which, as he knows from first-hand experience, have violated the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and other Czechoslovak laws. Among his examples, Roubal mentions the prosecution of 20 [pageend23]eleven VONS members, and the way in which Czechoslovak courts bar the public from proceedings in cases concerning people prosecuted for their political beliefs«. In connection with both of these, he sent letters to twelve institutions but on each occasion received a reply from only one of them — the Law Faculty of the Charles University in Prague which informed him that it was not ’entitled to express its opinion’ on the VONS trial, and that it was ’not allowed to comment on the violation of the principle of public participation in trial proceedings'» In addition, Roubal discusses prison conditions for those in detention, which are contrary to the law and which he has himself experienced, as well as discrimination at work«, Letter from Pavel Roubal to the Syndicat des Advocates* Roubal, a VONS member and Chartist, recalls the interest of the French Union of Lawyers in cases of people prosecuted in Czechoslovakia for their political beliefs and appeals for their help on behalf of Jan Zmatlik. Roubal wrote on 11 October, after Zmatlik’s conviction in July but before his appeal hearing, enclosing the full text of the verdict and drawing attention to the most flagrant violations of the law as illustrated in the verdict himself. (For the verdict on Zmatlik, see Summary No. 12). For example, in order to show that the written material confiscated from Zmatlik's flat was indeed capable of subverting the Republic, its contents should have been analysed in court bu the verdict contained not a single quotation from the material in question. With the exception of a cutting from the official Czechoslovak press, some United Nations documents, and a criminological dossier, all the material was simply assumed to be subversive. The court justified its confiscation on the grounds that it served Zmatlik as a means of 'comparison', without saying what it was that he was ’comparing’. Similarly, the court should have been able to prove that the documents were collected out of hostility to the Republic but the only grounds for ascribing such hostility to Zmatlik were his refusal to condemn Charter 77 and his activity in the student movement in 1968-69. Roubal then describes Zmatlik’s life and activity and convincingly argues that he in no way violated the law. He asks the French lawyers to use their influence to achieve Zmatlik’s acquittal, the return of his confiscated property, and the establishment of who was responsible for his unjust prosecution. Copies of the letter were sent to a number of organisations in Czechoslovakia and abroad. Letter from Eva Kantůrkova to Mrs Thatcher, 24 October 1979 Kantůrkova thanks Mrs Thatcher for her reply and expression of support in response to Kantůrkova’s first letter to her, which she wrote during the summer. Among other things, Kantůrkova asks Mrs Thatcher ’to keep in mind at all 21 [pageend24]levels of European decision-making that Bohemia is a land of old European culture of emotion and mind, that Czechoslovakia has not ceased to be a part of Europe and that, if we, who may express ourselves in our homeland and before the world only in a limited way, remain here, it is mainly so that we may preserve this European tradition for the people of the country and so that we may carry it on'. Report by Jan Simsa on the arrest and harassment of Czechoslovak Catholics, 11 October 1979 On 10 September 1979 tens of Czechoslovak citizens of Catholic convictions were detained and interrogated, following the initiation of criminal proceedings on 28 August under Article 118 of the penal code dealing with the offense of ’illicit trading'. Of those detained, five were eventually charged and remained in prison and criminal proceedings against some of those released continued. For example, Dr Josef Zverina was charged under Article 118 with obstructing state control of Churches and religious organisations«, Simsa then lists the different items confiscated by the authorities, including different types of duplicating machines, book-binding equipment, postcards with religious pictures and slogans (Palach Press can supply some of these), a duplicated dossier on Pope John Paul n, and a dossier on the Pope's visit to Poland, money and receipts connected with the publication of religious literature, and receipts from the postal authorities indicating when material was dispatched and to whom. Simsa claims that the investigation proved that this activity was non-profit making and was not covert and that, in fact, it had taken place for several years with the full knowledge of the Security Service which has shown the detainees photographs of the transport of paper, the handing over of parcels, and meetings with co-workers«, Simsa asserts that the Church leadership is convinced that the actions of 'undisciplined' clergy and non-conformist laymen are undermining the good work of the Church and the good relations between the Church and State. At the same time, he alleges that Church leaders are unable to ensure that even one tenth of the religious literature needed is available. Summer camps and courses for clergymen, laymen, youth, and children have either been cancelled or continue on an extremely small scale. Simsa states that this blow against the Catholics, particularly in Moravia, has provoked solidarity actions in both Czechoslovakia and Poland and he challenges the leadership of the Catholic Church in Czechoslovakia and the Vatican to respond to these events. Simsa attaches some biographical data on those detained; Rudolf Smahel: born 11 May 1950. Studied theology in Olomouc and ordained in 1974 but did not obtain state consent to carry out pastoral duties and therefore worked as a manual worker until the end of 1977. Then obtained state consent and became a priest in Uhersky Brod. 22 [pageend25]Jan Krumpholc: born 3 June 1927« Worked as a butcher« Arrested 1949 and sentenced to 15 years for treason« Amnestied in I960« Employed as a manual worker« Wife arrested 1952 and sentenced to 14 years.

(Palach Press has photographs of Smahel, Krumpholc, Lizna, and Adamek, including several of Adamek's arrest.) Stop Press. Palach Press now has a detailed report of the police action against believers in Moravia and Slovakia, dated 6 December 1979, with an appendix listing all those involved in one way or another. Letter from 344 Polish citizens to Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek, 5 July 1979. The Polish signatories express their solidarity with the ten VONS members and Charter signatories awaiting trial. They write that the Church has recently been defending human rights and that, as it is the sole moral authority in countries like Czechoslovakia and Poland and the voice of the Church has great significance, they are asking Cardinal Tomasek to speak out on behalf of those in prison and take into care their families. They also discuss how difficult it is to communicate between the two countries. 23 [pageend26]Open Letter to Pope John Paul IL In October 1979, 350 Czechoslovak citizens sent a letter to Pope John Paul IL They write that they are turning to him at a time when many believers in Czechoslovakia are being arrested and imprisoned for their beliefs» They describe the recent house-searches and detention of a number of Catholics who are accused, among other things, of ’illicit trading’, explaining that, in reality, this means 'religious activity and the work of many modest believers who attempted to ensure that religious literature, so rarely published in our country, would reach the hands of the believers’» They list the items confiscated by the authorities which include books on the Pope, photographs of the Pope, copies of papal encyclicals, historical and philosophical literature, and Charter 77 documents. They point out that most of the confiscated material can be purchased openly in the Pope's native country, Poland. They then give some details of the imprisoned Catholics and appeal for the Pope's assistance. A similar letter was sent to the Pope on 30 September, signed by 68 people living in Brno. Charter 77 Representative meets Austrian Foreign Ministry official» During an official visit by the Austrian Foreign Minister, Dr Willibald Pahr in Czechoslovakia from 15-17 November 1979, Charter 77 activist Rudolf Battek, representing Czechoslovak Independent Socialists, met Dr Fischer from the Austrian Foreign Ministry, in the presence of the Austrian consul in Prague, Dr Toth. The meeting took place at the Austrian Embassy and at the initiative of Austrian quarters. Rudolf Battek conveyed the views of the majority of signatories and supporters of the Charter 77 that the objective of the recent escalated persecution of human-rights defenders in Czechoslovakia, and in particular the trial of six members of VONS at the end of October, was in fact the complete suppression of the human-rights movement and of all independent civil activities in Czechoslovakia. Ambassador Fischer promised to convey *his view to Dr Bruno Kreisky, Chancellor of the Republic of Austria. Prior to the reception at the Austrian Embassy Austrian television recorded a brief interview with Rudolf Battek, screened that same evening in Austria. An account of corruption in high places. Towards the end of 1978 the managing director of the AZNP car factory in Mlada Boleslav, A. Zapadlo, was dismissed. Later, all his deputies, his son and his wife, who was in charge of a car salesroom attached to the factory, were also dismissed. No explanation was given to the public. Only on 31 August 1979 was a short article published in Pravda which discussed the fact that a number of Slovak factory directors were leaving their posts, although this should not be taken to mean that they had committed any 24 [pageend27]malpractice« In passing, it mentioned that one exception was Zapadlo who had been obliged to leave his post and the party and who would soon appear in court« By piecing together the information now available, this report outlines what actually happened. Zapadlo replaced J. Simov, now deputy prime minister, as director of the car factory« It seems that Zapadlo began to sell Skoda cars described as ’damaged' for virtually nothing to his influential friends in political and economic positions. At least 500 cars were sold for these symbolic prices. At the same time, he established a car-hire firm, attached to the factory. About 200 cars were never returned and cannot be traced because there is no evidence of who hired them. A further 200 have been traced to friends and acquaintances. In 1978, Zapadlo created an artificial shortage of Skoda 120s and his wife began selling these cars at inflated prices. In all, he appears to have defrauded the state of roughly 250 million crowns (at the official exchange rate 17 crowns equal £1). Because of a certain shortage of manpower, Zapadlo arranged for Soviet soldiers stationed in Czechoslovakia to work in the factory but as they were not paid for this work they began to complain and it was this which apparently led to the investigations into Zapadlo's behaviour. The authors of the report ask how it was that Zapadlo was able to obtain such a cheap labour force and point out that in 1978 the Commander-in-Chief of Soviet troops stationed in Czechoslovakia, General Sukhoruchenko, was suddenly dismissed from both his Czech and Soviet military posts and has not been heard of since. The authors claim that it was initially decided to give Zapadlo a diplomatic post in a 'northern European country’ but that later the party’s Central Auditing Commission expelled him from the Party and proposed that he be tried in Hradec Kralove, where the courts are known to sentence people up to 15 years for similar offences. The proceedings reached the point of deciding to give him only a sentence of half this length, of which he was supposed to serve only three years but, at the last minute, as a result of an order 'from the highest places’, the case was put on ice and today Zapadlo is employed in the headquarters of the Czechoslovak car industry in Prague. The authors conclude by wondering what Zapadlo's protector, Deputy Prime Minister Simov, thinks of the case. Political qæstionnaire for all job applicants.

[pageend29]Women demand the release of Otta Bednářová 18 Czech women have sent a letter to the Presidium of the Czech National Council demanding the immediate release of Otta Bednářová, sentenced in October to three years’ imprisonment. The signatories, all of whom know Bednářová personally, include the actress Vlasta Chramostova, Charter 77 spokesman Zdena Tominova, and Josefa Slanska, widow of Rudolf Slansky, General Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party executed during the show trials of the 1950s. The request for Bednářová's release is based, firstly, on the fact that she is. very ill and may well die as a result of a prolonged stay in prison and, secondly, on ethical grounds. The signatories argue that Bednářová 'is an exceptionally fine person«,... She regards her aim in life as the opposition to violence, as the humanisation of the world around us..' and that 'her imprisonment serves no purpose'. The non-funeral of Dr Frantisek Kriegel Dr Frantisek Kriegel died in Prague on 3 December 1979. The authorities did everything in their power — and succeeded — to thwart the efforts of his family and friends to organise a funeral ceremony. In an essay entitled 'An attempt to excuse the inexcusable', Charter 77 signatory and VONS member Jiri Rumi recounts in detail the measures taken to prevent the funeral from taking place. 27 [pageend30]STOP PRESS EXTRA 766 people petition the Supreme Court, On 18 December, two days before the appeal hearing before the Supreme Court, a petition signed 766 people was sent to the Supreme Court of the Czech Socialist Republic, with the specific request that it be delivered to Dr Maria Dojcarova, the presiding judge at the appeal hearing. The petition demanded the immediate release of the ten VONS members then in prison and other political prisoners in Czechoslovakia. This is the largest number of signatures on any single petition to date, which shows that the VONS committee is still able to function and that many people have not been deterred by the October trial. Among the signatories are a number of people who have not signed Charter 77. VONS Statement 154. Petr Cibulka again in court. On 12 December the regional court in Pilsen considered the case of Petr Cibulka. Cibulka, who is serving two years’ imprisonment (see earlier VONS statements), is accused of 'obstructing the implementation of an official decision', allegedly by refusing to work since 18 May 1979. During this time he held a three-month hunger strike which was occasionally interrupted by intra-venous feeding in the prison hospital. VONS stresses that, interestingly, the hearing was held in an objective atmosphere and ten relatives and friends of the accused were allowed to attend. Cibulka described the work conditions against which he protested by his hunger strike and the physical attacks to which he had been repeatedly subjected. He denied that he had refused to work for no reason or in protest against the imprisonment of VONS members. He asked for a number of witnesses to be heard. One witness who was called, a prison warder, Antonin Gruber, evaluated Cibulka's behaviour and work positively. The presiding judge, Dr Sakarova, eventually adjourned the hearing for an indefinite period in order that evidence could be obtained from more witnesses. 12 December 1979 VONS Statement 156. VONS announces the release from detention of Jarmila Belikova, Ladislav Lis, Vaclav Maly, and Jiri Nemec. The four had been detained since 29 May 1979 and were released on 22 December. Criminal proceedings against them, however, are continuing. VONS now signs all its statements as the Committee to Defend the Unjustly Prosecuted, the Czechoslovak League for Human Rights, a member of the International Federation for Human Rights. 27 December 1979 [pageend31]VONS Statement 158 This is a detailed report of the appeal hearing of the six convicted VONS members which describes the arguments of both the defence and prosecution. Vaclav Benda and Petr Uhl objected that, contrary to the stipulations of Article 71 of the Penal Code, the Public Prosecutor, Dr Balas, was responsible for both the decision to detain the accused and for the extension of the detention period. He also participated in the October trial and supervised the interrogation. Dr Klouza, defence lawyer for Otta Bednarova, objected on behalf of all the defence lawyers that some of the judges at the hearing had been involved in some of the cases about which VONS had issued statements and that, therefore, the court must be biased. This argument took the court by surprise but after an hour's adjournment, the objection was overruled. Later the court also refused numerous defence requests for a thorough analysis of the individual volumes of evidence, which had not been done at the first trial. The court eventually accepted the opinion of the Prosecutor who argued that such an analysis did not come within the competence of the appeal hearing. The court also rejected Jiri Bednar's proposal that the publisher of the French version of Listy, Jean-Jacques Marie, be called as a witness. Marie had gone to Czechoslovakia to testify that he had published articles by several of the defendants without their permission. In his final speech the Public Prosecutor defended the sentences imposed on the VONS members as 'the expression of the inalienable right of the state to defend its economic system by adequate means' and supported this by quotations from relevant parts of the United Nations Charter. In a lengthy supplement, VONS summarises the final speeches of the six defendants. 28 December 1979 Palach Press has received an article entitled 'Letter from Czechoslovakia: Prague — Kabul — the Olympic Games', (900 words) This article, written by several authors, compares events in Afghanistan with what happened in Czechoslovakia and explains why the writers believe that the boycott of the Olympic Games in Moscow as a moral sanction is now necessary. The article discusses the'way in which the Games are and will be used by the Soviet Union and the impact this will have on those who oppose the Soviet regime. The writers claim that their views are shared by the majority of the population in Czechoslovakia. 5 January 1980 Palach Press has received an article by Martin Ilybler, a Charter signatory and VONS member, about the aims and situation of human-rights groups in Czechoslovakia. It was written primarily for the journal of the International Federation for Human Rights. Palach Press has also received'lnfor-mation on Charter vt\ No. 16 which covers the period from 24 November to 22 December 1979.
