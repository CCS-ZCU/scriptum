Though this year was a particularly difficult one, through out combined efforts, we came through very successfully. Whatever measure of interest you contributed serving our guests and members at different functions-helping expedite the Vestnik- cooking-contributing pastries-decorating the hall-selling ticketsand all the other sundry interests necessary to perpetuate Sokol, I deeply appreciate and thank you all from the bottom of my heart. Sokol is not just one person, as you all know, and without the help in whatever degree from the associate members, no Presidency can survive. iVith this thought I extend my everlasting gratitude for your help during my second term of office, and wish the new officers — Godspeed!

Respectfully submitted [pageend2]DECEMBER, 1983_________ SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO VESTNIK________ STRANA - PAGE Continued from last month- The Nazi occupation of the whole country March 15, 1939 (10) was a signal for the Sokol to begin its underground resistance, which was set in action the very moment that the German troops marched upon our soil. Following the arrest of the first-line leaders an extensive resistance net was created to carry on, with second and third line standi ng in reserve* The Sokols established a number of revolutionary groups, of which the "Jindra“ group was numerically the largest. These groups cooperated loyally with the Central Organization for Revolt at Home, also with the military organizatlen “The Nation's Defense" etc. The Sokols had a lion's sharp in all the underground activities ranging from the intelligence service for the Czechoslovak government in exile in London to sabotage and to organizing partisan units. At this time the Sokol played a signigicant role in the national uprising in Slovakia whose political and military leaders were predominantly Sokols,•while in England our aviators in the RAF performed heroic deeds in the Battle of England and in destructive flights over Germany. The Nazi authorities in charge of the occupation allowed the Sokols two years for their activity, which kept paying more and more attention to the Sokol youth as the future leaders of the nation. In spite of all the caution the Sokol underground activity did not escape the attention of the occupation powers who in April 1941 forbade further activities of the Sokol Community. Since the secession of Slovakia the Sokol Community was once again referred to as strictly Czech Sokol. In October of the same year the organization was dissolved, its property (estimated at 2 billions KéConfiscated and thousands of Sokol members dragged away to the concentration camps. These steps were being justified by claiming that the Sokol has become the center of open as well as secret resistance against the German Reich. However the Sokol underground activity did not stop even after dissolution of the Sokol Community. It began with the occupation and in its closing days it changed into armed resistance on the Prague barricades where 654 Sokols gave their lives. The Sokols paid indeed a heavy price for freedom: at least 11.000 Sokol brothers and sisters passed through the hell of the concentration camps, and 3*258 lives were wasted away in the camps and by execution, including juniors and children. For three years after the war, to the Eleventh Slet, it was an uninterrupted struggle against the communist's efforts to seize control of the Sokol.Profitting by the Nazi experience the communists knew that dissolution would not destroy the Sokol spirit, they chose the opposite approach... get control of the spirit by infiltration. Long before the first World War Lenin advocated this same approach. Furthermore the communists wanted to preserve the Sokol in order to gain its confidence at home and abroad. The means for attaining this goal was to be the unification of all the organizations of sports and physical education, towards which they were working obviously by negotiating as well as resorting to pressure. Simultaneously however they were treacherously blocking the revival of the Czechoslovak Sokol Community and by ordering their people to join en masse the Sokol Continued next page [pageend3]DECEMBER, 1983 SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO VESTNIK STRANA - PAGE, j4 Con’t. from previous page units. Basically the Sokol did not oppose the unification, but under one condition, that such joining be absolutely voluntary and that the new groups not assume merely the Sokol name but the Sokol idea as well. As could have been expected this condition was rejected especially by the sports groups. After half a year of futile negotiations the Sokol withdraw from the preliminary committee for unification and renewed fully its organization and its activities. The communists made another attempt to force the uni fication issue by a presidential decree but president Beneš categorically refused to issue such a document. After the renewal of activity there began an avalana che-like tide of applications to the Sokol. The nation saw in the Sokol the only possible dam against the growing communist danger. By the end of 19^-7 the Sokol recorded one half million members and with the youth groups the organization had a total of more than one million members. Plans for the Eleventh Slet were being undertaken with new and untrained membership. The enthusiasm for the Slet exceeded everything known in the past. After all,this was the Slet we were all yearning for over the past ten years For the past decade- memories of the Tenth Slet kept alive w-i thi n us the hope that the very values which it stood for could not be destroyed and must again assert themselves. The Slets had become symbols of freedom, democracy and humanity. The Tenth Slet was a temporary parting with these values, the Eleventh was to become a celebration of their return. Indeed no other Slet was ever prepared with so much love and sacrifice as the Eleventh. There were no impossibilities. The assignments which the leadership itself hesitated to impose as almost impossible of performance, were carried out as under a magic wand. Four months before the Slet the communists carried out their coup. The quickly summoned directorship of the Czechoslovak Sokol Community offered to President Beneš the help vf the Sokols in defense of democracy, but it was too late. The Sokol delegation was not allowed admission to the President. The various active committees injected into the Sokol by the communist party arbitrarily expelled old Sokol leaders and replaced these with cnmmnnists who had nothing in common with the Sokol. Within secret Sokol circles it was being considered to cancel the Slet. The communists wanted the Slet to be held, to show the world that "nothing has happened" and that the nation agreed with the new regime, and was cooperating with it in complete harmony. On the other hand the Sokol leadership wanted to hold the Slet for other reasons. It had become clear that the Slet would be a farewell parting with the Sokol, the last gathering of the Sokol brothers for an unpredictable length of time. A failure of the Slet, all the efforts, all the work, all the love and sacrifices which had been already made on its behalf, would bring about a moral trauma aimd 1 ar to the vain mobilization in October 1938* To be continued — [pageend4]_ DECEMBER, 198g______SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO VESTNIK STRANA- PAGE ZA BrATRNE VULEL1ZJ BURSIZEL Věčné kolo času dotáči zase jeden rok drive však než všecky u_dálosti roku zapadnou do nenávratné minulosti a z&^omnění.

Nechci psát o jeho za^sluhach,^tyto jsou nám dohře zamé - jak pomáhál uprchlíkům, jak dobrým byl řečníkem a výborným redaktorem Sokolského Věstníku. Nebo nekompromisním buditelem a to joistníkem za svobodu a demokracii naší okupované vlasti. Chci se zmínit o jeho plánech - jak jsme o tom spolu hovořili.

Tato idea by se byla mohla uskutečnit. Společnou práci a pomocí. Skoda, že se mezi námi našli lidé, kteří mu nerozumněli, nepochopili, že zdánlivě pod jeho tvrdší slupkou bylo měkké, teplé srdce, plné porozumnění pro potíže ostatních. Chvíle sjním byly nezapomenutelné, ať - už při politických deba tách. Nebo když jsme při dobrém nápoji se bavili, zpívali a nasmáli při různých anekdotách a vzpomínkách. Bude nám tu hodně chybět. Cest jeho památce. Jan L. Ticháček Gifts: Getting It There “Imagine putting your package in your clothes dryer and turning the dryer on. Would your package come out unbroken and still wrapped?” asks one postal worker. “Then it’s ready for the mails!” Your packages won't be deliberately mishandled, but if you keep in mind the volume of mail and that yours may beat the bottom of the truck, you’ll have a better idea how secure your package must be. Try these suggestions: • Avoid paper wrapping, which can be torn off, and twine, which can catch in postal machinery. • The best container is a corrugated fibreboard box. The small round imprint on the bottom indicates its strength. * The most sophisticated stuffings, such as bubble plastic and plastic pellets, are the most effective and the lightest. For the best packaging, pad the bottom of the box several inches deep, wrap each item in corrugated cardboard or bubble plastic, put the items in a snug inner box, then continue cushioning the inner box inside the outer box. • If you shake the box and anything shifts, repack the contents with more cushioning. • Close with carton sealing tape or strapping tape. Masking and transparent tapes may break or become unstuck In cold weather. • Cover a clearly-printed address label with transparent tape to prevent rain from smearing Ink. Tuck another address label inside the box in case the outer box is damaged. Don’t mail anything irreplaceable [pageend5]SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO VĚSTNÍK strana-page Christmas • Give your whole home the aroma of Christmas. Make your decorations fragrant ones—fresh-cut boughs, spicy carnations, scented candles. Friends will begin to feel festive as soon as they walk in the door! • Give a gift of true Christmas feeling. “One Christmas, my friend Debby gave me a card instead of the usual token gift,” says Barb. “The card explained that, for me, she had gone to our local retirement home and had gotten the name of a person without friends or family and then sent her, “From a Friend,” a wonderful basket of Christmas treats— flowers and cookies and small gifts like slippers. It was the best Christmas present / ever got.” * Gather a caroling party and warble your way from your house, where hot bracing drinks are served, to another caroler’s home for predinner nibbles and then on to the final home for a warm and waiting dinner. And as you sing your way to your supper, you’ll be spreading Christmas spirit in your path. HOLIDAYS New Year’s Eve Have family members make a list of resolutions for themselves and predictions for the family for the coming year. Seal and save to open next New Year’s Eve. New Year’s Eve doesn’t have to be frantic! Enjoy a quiet evening at home and lavish well- deserved attention on yourself. Start with a long, scented, relaxing bath for quiet contemplation, followed by a pedicure, manicure, a facial, and then the company of a good book in bed, accompanied by wine and a gourmet snack. Just as luxurious for two as for one. How Not to Succeed at Giving Parties ★ Neuer let guests interrupt your routine. Keep right on folding the family laundry, item by intimate Item. Holdup and discuss several items. Or continue to carefully follow the plot of your favorite soap opera in progress, explaining each character’s life history to your guests. Diet Alert! * When guests otter to help, let them. Assign them several tasks; then go rest on the sofa. * Surprise your guests with planned activities. Volleyball, baseball, simulated survival training, or obstacle courses are choices for the afterchurch crowd. Insist they participate. * Choose any game at which your family is semi-professional and invite guests to play. Laugh at their mistakes. Enjoy reminiscing among family members about how awful they were. * These guests are boring, and you wish they’d go home. Yawn copiously. Turn out a few lights—they’ll get the hint when it’s dark in the living room. * Never check the guest bathroom for supplies. * When guests compliment your food, graciously pass off compliments with: “Oh, that? It's leftovers from Monday.” * When someone asks you fora recipe, insist on dictating it right then. Don’t mention beforehand that it covered three printed pages in Bon Appetlt. * Keep a special selection of food for guests, such as those gourmet gift Items you got for Christmas—guava jelly, peppered tongue, chocolate- covered insects of any variety, mystery meat pate. Make it clear that you wouldn't touch the stuff yourself. Holidays are hard on diets, but you can enjoy the holidays and retain your svelte figure (or your progress toward one) by sticking to these guidelines: • Always eat at home first! A little snacking on low calorie fillers will help you resist those tempting plates of cookies lurking everywhere at parties. • Remember how the postholiday blues feel. There's nothing worse than living with the after-holiday letdown at the same time that you're feeling plump as the turkey. Think about how you want to feel after the holidays • when you're tempted to equate good times with eating. • Offer to bring food to parties—that way you can be sure there will be low calorie snacks available. • If you must have something sinful, settle for a sample. If you just have to taste that chocolate mousse, taste it... savor it... leave It! • Don’t make luscious food for Christmas gifts on the theory that you're going to give it all away. Let’s be realistic! • After you’ve given a party, don’t feel duty-bound to polish off the left-overs. Get them in the freezer fast before they get you. This way you aren't wasting them, so there’s no guilt at all! • Be careful not to use food asa reward foryourchildren.Give them a gift that will last the rest of their lives—a healthy attitude toward food. • Weigh yourself every day during the holiday season. Add extra sessions with your scale before parties. [pageend6]DECEMBER, 1983 SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO VESTNIK STRANA - PAGE We have heard from Emil Suskind to teach the Czech language. The next important step is to hear from the folks who are interested in lessons. Then we can meet and discuss important items like when, where, how often, cost, etc. Please drop us a card — We can’t contact you any further - You must contact us. Thanks to Br.

NICHOLAS falls on December 6th and is celebrated as a special holiday in many European countries. Men in bishop robes pose as St. Nicholas. They visit children and urge them to be good. In Czechoslovakia they are accompanied by an Angel to help with the gifts that are brought....and the Devil to instill fear and the promise of punishment if they are bad. The Dutch brought the visit of St. Nicholas to America, which became Santa Claus after the Dutch Sinter Klaas. Little is known about this popular saint, except that he was Bishop of Myra in Lycia on the coast of Asia Minor. It is believed that he was born in Patara about 500 A.D. He was credited with many miracle The legend that he gave a dowry to three poor girls so they could be married probably was the basis for the custom of giving gifts at Christmas time. 'Thanks to L.A. Board of Instructors for the above [pageend7]DECEMBER, 1983 SCKOL SAN FRANCISCO VĚSTNÍK STRANA - PAGE Q AN OPEN LETTER TO MY SISTERS, BROTHERS, AND ALL OTHER FRIENDS OF SOKOL: Speaking from my heart, I would like to briefly touch upon a few subjects which deeply concern the future well-being of Sokol. I sincerely believe that as individuals we need to take stock of what we have contributed in a positive manner to Sokol as well as what we have given in a detrimental way! Constant ’nit-picking* and screaming results in a dead-end! We need to quietly listen to each other and really open our minds and hearts to understanding. Our first Hoe-down Barn Dance held in our San Mateo Sokol Hall could have been a huge success as the decorations were exceptional and those who had our hoe-down supper couldn’t rave enough about it! The band play with great enthusiasm, but the evening was rather sad because of poor attendance! Those who came had a marvelous time, and those who did not attend really missed out on a fun evening! The Hoosegow was built by caring members, and the Marriage Booth was all set to go too. If the post office did not deliver your Vestnik announcing this dance, then each of us hould write our congressman reflecting our exasperation on the tardiness of the delivery of our mail. May I also suggest that each of you contact Sokol to inquire if there is a monthly dance scheduled. And, of course, the January issue of the Vestnik lists the events for the YEAR so at that time, one should immediately indicate on their home calendar each date to assure that you will not miss any Sokol event. Coordinating an event at Sokol takes a lot of energy of mind and body but it truly is fun to see it ’’come together". If each one of us willingly contributes for each event then all can enjoy these times together. This balance has not been there in recent years and many who have been the ’workers’ this past year will not be able to take such an intensive coordinating position next year. If all of the Sokol members do not step forth to help as a team - we will not be able to have any events! We need you!!! My heart cries everytime I recall our visit to Czechoslovakia and remember the way our dear relatives have to exist - not live!!! Therefore, whatever I can do to lighten their burden of life is my desire. My satisfaction comes not from monitary rewards — which are ’zilch* - but from helping our dear ones (over there) obtain a better life from this help. That is my reason for being a Tuzex agent. Jeannettka Chambers THAT’S ALL WE’RE ASKING - Do Your Best - to collect and deliver to Sokol Hall your Rummage! We have set a date for next Spring - So - we should have a successful sale with a large assortment of saleable items. [pageend8]DECEMBER, 1983 SOKOL SAN. FRANCISCO VESTNIK STRANA - PAGE 9 FROM THE DESK OF THE EDITOR; The San Francisco Sokol Věstník is a means of communication between the Sokol Unit and ALL OF ITS MEMBERS! Sometimes it gets pretty lonely around here! There have been several times- when we have requested responses, and never a word came through. Even a "not interested" would let us know how to plan further. It was a thrill to receive responses to the puzzles we have published from time to time - sparse as they were - they were a great 'lift* because the Editor felt that 'somebody out there' was really-really-reading the Vestnik. We welcome items of interest - Czech or English - that you might like to share with your fellow members. An occasional encouraging word in a "Letter to the Editor" would be up-lifting. Well, of course, constructive criticism is acceptable also. SO - give us THE EYE and a letter. Let us know you care about our Sokol Unit and that you are interested in our Sokol activities. May you all have a joyous Holiday Season and a very Happy Healthy New Year!!

Store them in the freezer, then pop them in the toaster to heat on eat- and-run mornings. Sprinkle grated cheese over corn chips, microwave for a few seconds or heat in oven, for fast-fix nachos. Add any extras on hand—green pepper, onion, sausage. * If you have a freezer, keep a container of frozen punch. Scoop out and serve In glasses, to be eaten with a spoon. Add a lemon-based soda for a quick, festive drink. SHORT s CUTS Freeze part of your parly punch in a mold and use it instead of ice to avoid diluting the punch as it melts. Chop leftover baked potatoes and fry in butter for a quick morning treat with eggs. To loosen stamps that have stuck together, place in freezer for a few hours. [pageend9]DECEMBER, 1983 SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO VESTNIK STRANA - PAGE ] Q For those of you - and me, too - who have tried to figure out the rules ano the exceptions, thereof, we offer you this hit of poetry — WHY IS ENGLISH SO HARD? We'll begin with box, and the plural is boxes; But the plural of ox should be oxen, not oxes. Then one fowl is goose, but two are called geese Yet the plural of moose should never be meese. You may find a lone mouse or a whole lot of mice, But the plural of house is houses, not hice If the plural of man is always called men, Why shouldn't the plural of pan be called pen? The cow in the plural may be cows, or kine, But the plural of vow is vows, not vine. And I speak of a foot, and you show me your feet, But I give a boot - would a pair be called beet? If one is a tooth and a whole set are teeth, Why shouldn't the plural of booth be called beeth? If the singular is this and the plural is these, Why shouldn't the plural of kiss be nicknamed kese? Then one may be that, and three may be those, Yet the plural of hat would never be hose; We speak of a brother, and also of brethren, But though we say mother, we never say methren. The masculine pronouns are he, his and him, But imagine the feminine she, shis, and shim! So our English, I think you will all agree, Is the trickiest language you ever did see.
