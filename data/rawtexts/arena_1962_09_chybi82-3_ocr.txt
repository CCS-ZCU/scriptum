James Thurber There is no single theory of art that has not finally confused and narrowed and impoverished it. Malcolm Cowley “Excuse me,” said the First Inmate. “It won’t take a minute. I’m just about run down.” He placed his right thumb and index finger against his hip and moved his wrist forward and back while he emitted a sound that was a reasonably close replica of the noise a music box, a gramophone or a mechanical doll would make on being wound up. Then he nodded. “It’s all right now.” “Aren’t you a bit uncomfortable?” I asked. The straitjacket allowed him a certain amount of movement but not very much. “But it didn’t cost me a penny!” he replied violently. “Completely free! And under the next five year plan the issue of gags, thumbscrews, blue pencils, jamming apparatus, iron maidens, assembly line censors and easy do-it-yourself social realism kits will also be gratis. In twenty years no citizen of the peace-loving and progressive peoples’ democracies will have to pay for self1 [pageend3]criticism pills, confession equipment, personal or impersonal cult detectors, non-deviationist dachas and unschematic holidays. In fifty years. . “Can you sleep in them?” I interrupted. “Listen—what did you have to do to earn that suit? How low did you have to stoop to pay for those shoes? How often did you have to prostitute your talent to buy that necktie? Sleep in them! What the creative artist needs is not comfort but freedom. . .” “Excuse me—those bars on the windows—and the guards outside in the corridor—with the peep-hole in the iron door—” “It is obvious that you do not know what Lenin replied to de los Rios, that traitor of the workingclass who miscalled himself a socialist. . .” His voice rose in a chant: “La liberté? Vladimir Ilich asked, Pour quoi faire?” “Isn’t freedom a state of mind and not a purpose?” 1 asked. “Isn’t it a journey rather than a settlement? Can it be modified and pinned down by definitions? Isn’t it continuous creation, like the universe, according to some astronomers?” “Freedom is the possibility of praising what is good and the duty of denouncing what is evil.” “And who defines what is good and what is evil?” But the First Inmate could only gasp. The record had apparently run down, the mechanical doll’s spring was unwound. So I left him. Any conducted tour must include the kitchen. I came upon the Second and the Third Inmate preparing the bill-o’-fare, writing out the menus with precision and care, building socialism and withering the state with impeccable class-consciousness. 2 [pageend4]“As you see,” the Second Inmate explained, “we have the greatest variety. Hors ďceuvres trěs riches, including everything from marinated marx to jellied engels; from scrambled hegel to sweet-sour pickled zhdanov. Our Soup Solochov is made from the purest Don-water which naturally runs quietly. Our caviare is always red and the choice of fish includes nerudá stuffed with anticolonialism; cold sliced aragon with a triolet and quasimodo sauce, very piquant. Naturally our main course is always lenin steak, invariably overdone and served with hot fried gorkys and just a dash of twisted mayakovsky. Our other meat dishes include excellent minced brecht, becher and seghers cutlets, jacklindsay chops and hikmet stuffed mutton. No kitchen could be more international! As for dessert, you can choose between anti-clerical pancakes, non-idealist dumplings, khrushchev doughnuts and tarts fit for positive heroes. . “Nothing d la carte?” The Third Inmate drew himself up to his full height of five foot nothing. “Look at our consumption statistics! We are producing fifty million gallons of progressive pap every year —more than six hundred per cent more than in the old capitalist days! In ideological hash alone our output has exceeded the norm by a hundred and twenty per cent! Everybody is reading in our communities! The tractor drivers! the sewer-workers! the tram conductors! the midwives! even we who write the books are reading!” “But only what is on the menu?” I persisted. “Not at all!” the Second Inmate protested. “We are always prepared to serve some slightly secondhand gra- hamgreenes provided they show what rotten taste the people outside these walls possess! We regularly dish up snows and kaestners, hemingways and other game— 3 [pageend5]a wide choice of angry-young-men and angry-old-men, provided of course that they are angry with the right things and not the left ones. We believe in a balanced diet. But obviously we will not let anybody spoil his stomach, ruin his digestion and upset his metabolism by koestlerian concoctions, silonean salads or madaria- gan muffins! After all, we know what is good for the people! And if by any chance some of the people do not like it, they can lump it!” Naturally I was also taken into the laboratories and wards, the therapeutical and diagnostical departments, the operating theatres and finally the morgue. It was a breathless tour; I was whisked through it all at a tremendous pace, and my impressions were unavoidably fragmentary. Still, I saw a certain amount— —an assembly line along which highly-trained specialists were dyeing slides of classics, invariably using red, proving that any poet who had described a crimson sunset or the blush on his beloved’s cheeks, had been a Communist— —a gymnasium in which truth was stretched, fact was used for a punchball and fellow-travellers were trained to turn themselves into wooden horses— —the wards of occupational therapy in which idealists beat their own heads to convince themselves that only matter mattered; amateur gardeners were turned into professionals by rooting up the hundred flowers so that the weeds could flourish; objectivity was turned into bias and neutrality into partisanship; the cult of personality was surgically removed and replaced by the ability of writing odes into which first party secretaries’ names could be inserted automatically no matter how many syllables they contained; 4 [pageend6]—showers for brain-dirtying if anyone should have lapsed into clear thinking— —conditioning surgeries in which talent was replaced by servility, originality by conformity to party directives and guts by cast-iron stomachs ready to swallow anything. There was, I am sure, a great deal more to the place but they told me that a much longer visit would be needed to explore it thoroughly. Perhaps, the Fifth Inmate said, winding himself up tirelessly, I might apply for admission to one of the wards; he could guarantee that I would never want to leave again. Foolishly, I declined. Finally I was taken to the non-denominational, antisectarian, all-purpose chapel. There, in the discreet darkness with red stars continuously rising over the violet horizon, the Tables of the Asylum Law glowed in blood-red letters while a Don Cossack choir of basso profundo voices repeated the New Commandments without a pause: “I AM THE PARTY, THY FATHER, THY MOTHER, THY FAMILY AND THY UNIVERSE AND THOU SHALT HAVE NO OTHER DODS BESIDE ME! “THOU SHALT IMAGINE NOTHING THAT HATH NOT BEEN APPROVED BY THE LAST PARTY CONGRESS! “THOU SHALT CREATE TYPES AND NOT CHARACTERS FOR INDIVIDUALISM IS DANGEROUS AND REPREHENSIBLE AND THE ONLY SAFETY IS IN NUMBERS! “THOU SHALT NOT HANKER AFTER THE ALIEN GODS OF EXISTENTIALISM, SURREALISM, ANAR- 5 [pageend7]CHISM, NOUVELLE VAGUE, DOLCE VITA OR ANGRY YOUTH! “THOU SHALT ALWAYS PREFER ORTHODOXY TO EXPERIMENT, UNIFORMITY TO ORIGINALITY, PARTISANSHIP TO OBJECTIVITY ! “THOU SHALT NO LONGER CONSIDER YOURSELF A. WRITER WHEN THE PARTY DECIDES THAT YOU HAVE CEASED TO BE ONE! “THOU SHALT NOT WRITE FOR YOUR DESKDRAWER, FOR POSTERITY OR FOR ANYTHING BUT CONTEMPORARY MASS CONSUPTION! “THOU SHALT BE GRATEFUL FOR CRITICISM, GIVE THANKS FOR CHASTISEMENT AND HATE, LOVE, MATE AND LIVE AS THY PARTY TELLS YOU! “FOR MINE IS THE POWER AND MINE IS THE GLORY AND ONLY THOSE SHALL SHARE IT WHO FOLLOW MY COMMANDMENTS.” It is possible, I thought, as I left the Asylum, taking a deep breath of the sweet, fresh air outside—it is possible to understand that the inmates have taken it over and that no one can gainsay their lunacy. But when they dream and talk of taking over the rest of the world, of turning Helicon and Parnassus, Greenwich Village and Breadloaf Mountain, Stratford-on- Avon and St. Germain-des-Prés, the Vienna cafés and the pubs of Chelsea and Hampstead into extensions of their bedlam—let’s sound the tocsin, man the barricades, raise the alarm and Jight. For all we have to lose is our freedom, and all we have to gain from those within the Asylum is the madness of praising and loving the chains and strait-jackets that cripple and strangle the very breath of our art. PAUL TABORI 6 [pageend8]P. E. N. IN EXILE Bulgarians DRAGOMIR NENOFF INTRODUCTION Even for a very brief review of Bulgarian writers in exile it is necessary to give a short survey of historic developments in Bulgaria since they are closely linked with cultural achievements. After five centuries of alien domination, Bulgaria was liberated from the Turks in 1878; then the country became independent. Before independence, writers had not been permitted to write or to distribute any of their works in their native language. While, before the country’s liberation, political parties did not exist in Bulgaria, the people always took an active interest in politics and in cultural development. Due to existing conditions, the people were geared to radical revolutionary ideas, and this trend persists to this day. After the liberation, two important trends of thought dominated and led ultimately to the formation of two corresponding schools in literature— liberalism and conservatism—with practically no connecting link between them. They violently opposed each other over the pattern of development which the country should follow. Finally both schools moved in entirely opposite directions—the conservatives turned to extreme nationalism and the liberals toward extreme populism. Literary achievements since the time of the liberation were intended to satisfy either of these extreme trends. The newly created state which had neither the oppor- 7 [pageend9]tunity nor the time to establish any definite political tradition was also hampered in its normal literary development by the totalitarian character of certain statesmen and their followers. During their term of office these men adopted the expedient of identifying themselves with the state; thus they were able to denounce all those who opposed them as enemies of the country and as traitors. Throughout the turbulent history of Bulgaria, the emergence of her political, religious and literary exiles has been almost traditional. Under the Ottoman yoke, men left the country, fleeing primarily to Russia and Rumania, either to avoid personal persecution or to live as exiles because it was not possible to live in freedom at home. In the course of the years, these early exiles came to number several thousand. About five to six thousand people fled Bugaria after the counter-revolution in September 1923—the “September Events.” Some chose Yugoslavia or Czechoslovakia; the largest group, however, ultimately went to the USSR. A small group of people left during the war in opposition to the presence of German troops in the country, while others already in exile refused to return. Since September 9, 1944, when both the necessity and the difficulty of escape became greater than ever, several thousand Bulgarians fled abroad; several thousand, then in Germany, did not return to the home country. From all these exile groups at different periods, the first produced the largest number of writers, whose works, published in exile, became the cornerstone of modem Bulgarian literature. Exile is not an innovation of our times. Even in ancient democracies, such as Athens, men fighting for progress or changes were ostracized. But in Bulgaria, the exile problem affects all cultural development in the country. The many thousands of exiles who became repatriated sometimes 8 [pageend10]introduced new ideas or contributed to the country’s cultural life by importing traditions from the guest countries where they had lived. These experiments, however, proved not very felicitous and affected literary development rather detrimentally. In spite of political and economic instability, and as a result of the intensified struggle between various alien influences, Bulgarian literature followed a progressive and liberal rather than a conservative line. Due to political instability it became a literature which was more educational, messianic and revolutionary in character than designed simply for pleasure and entertainment. From these three groups of exiles came much of the great creative work in Bulgarian literature. Books which rank among the Bulgarian classics were written by Ivan Vazov, Khristo Botev, Louben Karavelov, Dimt- cho Debelianov, Petko Slaveikov, and others while they were exiled. "When exile is linked to great ideals and accepted with fortitude, it gives the writer great and lasting . prestige.” This happened to Ivan Vazov who, had he not been exiled, might never have written his lovely poetry and his chief work Under the Yoke. Far away from his country and his adversaries, he could write his satiric works which he would never have been able to do back home. He, more than any of his fellow countrymen, was moulded in exile. In the foreword to the fifth edition of Under the Yoke, which was translated into six languages, Vazov wrote: Exiled from Bulgaria in 1887, I lived for one year in Odessa. I felt great sorrow and heartache for the lost fatherland. My mind, heart and spirit always turned to it. Under these circumstances I conceived the idea of writing this novel and breathing into it the fresh air from Bulgaria. Thousands of memories, thou9 [pageend11]sands of beautiful and clear pictures from the turbulent life in my country during the April uprising were revived. Oh vision, how you sweeten my soul! Oh, how those fatal days upset my memory! I forgot the sufferings of exile life. I was happy with my ever present memories; they inspired and uplifted my spirit and a new and youthful Muse guided me; from this poor room on Odessa’s outskirts my novel reached Bulgaria, passing its borders, and has now come to Europe too. Now I bless my exile. October 19, 1920. Ivan Vazov’s poems, short stories, and novels have remained popular in Bulgaria for over half a century. His work forms the peak of Bulgarian literature. It appeared at a period of stagnation and was a challenge to the Bulgarian people, stimulating them to accelerate their independent life and progress in order to catch up with the more advanced European nations. Vazov’s historical novels concentrated on the spiritual aspirations of several generations. They played an important part in the unification of the Bulgarian people and strengthened their national consciousness for the hard times they were to face in days to come. Among the most important of Vazov’s works written in exile are Under the Yoke, Epic of the Forgotten Ones, and The Exiles. These convey his ardent struggle for freedom—freedom for his people, and freedom for the individual. In his solitary life in the Ukraine, in Bucharest and in Belgrade, Vazov grew in stature far more than he could have done in his enslaved country. It would be wrong to assume that his art was formed only by his life in exile, yet it was certainly enriched 10 [pageend12]by it. Once the country was liberated, he became one of the pioneers in building the foundation of its modern literary development. Although never politically active, Vazov was definitely politically minded and was greatly influenced by the populists of his time and by the French romanticists. He was one of the first to start open opposition to the false attitude of the new “intelligentsia” which relied on the state for support instead of seeking new ventures and approaches. He was one of those who foresaw the unfortunate trend toward imitation of an alien social structure unfit for domestic conditions—a trend which caused great trouble in Bulgaria. He predicted the great danger caused by the state bureaucracy when he wrote in 1881: “. . . our immature but practical intelligentsia has found, and satisfied all spiritual needs in the narrow world of state offices. . Vazov fought incessantly those who “were getting something for nothing.” He ridiculed state employees in many of his short stories in a manner somewhat reminiscent of Gogol. He made fun of army people and their attempts to create a superior caste, of the lower echelons of civil servants who cheated the poor peasants, and of the quasi-intellectuals who tried to copy foreign “high life.” Above all, however, Vazov was a master in depicting Bulgarian basic traits and characteristics. He was quite outstanding in the retelling of old folk tales and epics, and in his genuine lyrics. Some of his heroes, such as “Mountcho,” “al-Frangata,” and “Dransusa,” became universally popular and part of the language. In the Epic of the Forgotten Ones, mostly written in exile, many of his verses reflect his strong national feeling. The balanced relationship between the main characters and the people, especially in his later work, show the integrity which he had attained. Vazov followed his populist democratic ideals 11 [pageend13]consistently. Although influenced by the Russians— Dostoevski, Tolstoi, Dobrolubov and Nekrasov — he saw himself rather as a Westerner, pursuing the continuation of the French romantic school. Psychologically his main characteristic was perhaps a strange combination of deep morality and an appealing, almost childlike modesty. To Bu l g a r ia No, I do not think that in that time You will sacrifice yourself for gold; Your day will shine, Your wings unfold. Greatness shall burn Anew in a new century And the sun will turn Its smile upon your unity. (Translated by A. Colman) If poetry is the most expressive form of literature, the poems of Khristo Botev, always rebellious, fighting injustice, can be considered the best reflection of the Bulgarian people’s character. It is not by chance that Botev’s work has remained dominant in Bulgaria. Almost all of his short poems, now considered as classics, were written at the time of the Ottoman oppression when Botev was in exile. Almost all of them are of social revolutionary character, voicing universal and highly patriotic ideas. Botev was very much under the influence of the turbulent romanticism of Byron, Pushkin, Lermontov, Chemishevski, and the revolutionary enthusiasm of Garibaldi and Bakunin. In his admiration for them Botev 12 [pageend14]wrote: “They are invincible, they never die . . . . those who are ready to sacrifice their lives for the freedom of mankind. . While he was in Odessa he was attracted by the Poles there who were well organized in their fight against the autocratic Tsarist regime. He also became acquainted with the leaders—mostly writers—of the Ukrainian liberation movement. This environment prepared him for his later leading role in the Bulgarian liberation movement whose headquarters were in Bucharest. Botev moved from Odessa to Braila where he started . the publication of a journal, The Word of the Bulgarian Exile; this venture, however, came to an end because of a lack of funds after the first five issues. Some of his best poems were printed in that journal. Hadji Dimiter, The Sharing, A Prayer, later to appear in all textbooks, were written during his exile in Rumania, After moving to Bucharest, Botev continued to write; he organized and trained Bulgarian exiles for an invasion across the Danube into Bulgaria. He succeeded in landing with 120 volunteers, and was killed in a heroic battle with Ottoman regular armed forces on the Stara Planina mountain. His most important poems are The Hayduks, Father and Son, Hadji Dimiter, Levsky, To My First Love, On Parting, To My Mother, The Patriot, and A Pr a y e r Oh, my God, Thou Lord of Justice—■ Not the one in far-off Heaven— But Thou, God Who dwell’st within me, In my heart and in my doing. Not the one who out of mud balls Made a man and then a woman, 13 [pageend15]Whom he left, enslaved, to suffer Bound in chains and bent with labor. Nor the one who asks submission, Makes us cringe and say our prayers, Feeds our hearts with empty stories Of gold mansions and white stairs. But my God of mind and reason, Champion bold of slaves and pris’ners, Whose great day of liberation Soon shall dawn for all nations. Kindle in me, God Almighty, Burning love for human freedom, Help me fight with dauntless courage The enslavers of my people. Strengthen my right hand, O Father, When the slaves arise from slumber; Make me one of Thy bold warriors; Take my life—give others freedom. (Translated by. R. N. Markham) In the second period of Bulgarian exile, 1923 to 1930, very few books were published abroad. Kosta Todorov, one of the leading members of this group, wrote four books of poetry and prose, three of which were translated into French. The “Balkan Firebrand” was in English. At present, Bulgarian exiles are scattered all over the world. Many of them cannot visualize the changes which have taken place in their native country since they left it. They cherish their recollections of the past and set their hopes on the day of their return, when, 14 [pageend16]they imagine, they will continue the life they left. The interpretation of major events in the recent past is the main subject of their polemics. With some exceptions they had not been prepared to face the hardships of exile life when they were forced into it—they had held their preconceived ideas of the new life, their fixed prejudices and notions about their country of asylum and its people, only to find themselves confronted with unexpected conditions. Strong and mature characters have proven capable of profiting by ordeals, but there is no great writer of the quality of Botev or Vazov among the Bulgarian writers in exile now. Anton Bulgarensky found success with his novel La Conscience d’Emanouil which was translated into French and published by Flammarion in 1957. His second book, Father and Son, was published in 1960 for a limited Bulgarian readership. Bulgarensky, a young and promising talent, has written several short stories which are awaiting publication as part of an anthology. Krustu Zarev, also of the Paris group, is writing short stories and analytical essays. Nikolay Levkov’s The Crying Earth, published in Paris, was not a great success. Iskar Shoumanov’s Today and Tomorrow is a collection of short stories in the popular style. His knowledge of village people and his fine description of their character have not yet fully shown his gifts; since he deals exclusively with Bulgarian ethnical and sociological topics, his short stories would hardly find their way into the English book market. C. Boyadjiev has written some good satire but in recent years seems to have ceased writing. Ivan Bankovsky’s Far from the Father- land, a collection of highly patriotic poems in a popular style, has not found a large reading public. Professor Nikola Dolaptchiev, now living in California, published some interesting analytical essays in Vuzrajdanie about five years ago. Professor Loubomir 15 [pageend17]Delin, who published a history of Bulgaria four years ago, has since then only written some essays. Michael Padev whose last book came out five years ago has not been heard from again either. Dr. Ivan Robev wrote Bulgariada, a historical epic, three years ago. Kiril Vassilov’s short play To the Steep Road could, if translated and changed to a full-length play, become a success. Two books, Upovania (Confidence) and an Anthology of Selected Poems by a gifted Bulgarian exile writer, Miss Irene Dolska, appeared in 1959 in Italy. In the first, the author describes in a highly emotional and romantic style the suicide attempt of a young exile. Her poems are symbolic and full of sorrow for the lost Fatherland and close friends. She has not published anything since. Dr. Christo Ognianov, who several years ago published a collection of poetry, is one of the most prolific of the Bulgarian exile writers. Some of his poems could, if translated, appeal to Western readers. His poetry is dynamic and full of new ideas. All in all, Bulgarian literature in exile is far from satisfactory, hampered by its old-fashioned ideas and polemics—continually turning back to the past instead of looking towards the future. JIVKO GUELEV FUGUE La voiture s’élance et creuse le vide — parfaite substance de gouttes limpides. 16 [pageend18]Forets et champs se fondent et naissent et nous caressent au chant du vent. Ľ espace se párne et retentit et comme une ame nous engloutit. C’est la pensée qui seule se brise dans l’infini qui s’eternise. O douce ivresse ou pleurent sans cesse les larmes pures de la Nature. JIVKO GUELEV WIND In der stillen, lichten Morgenfrühe Glanz springt er rasch ins Leben aus der Berge Schoss. Und auf Zehen springend, leichten Flügelschlags, tritt er scheu erzitternd auf den Pfaden auf. An den steilen Felsenhängen hält er an, wirft wie traumverloren zwei, drei Blicke hin, bäumt sich auf und schiesst in schwankem Fluge vor und verschwindet bald im weitem Raum. . . 17 [pageend19]Dann taucht er golden wieder auf, wie ein Sonnelächeln spielt’s im Angesicht, dreht sich um, erhebt sich, schaukelt, fällt mitten in die reife Leidenschaft der Wiesen — wie betäubt vom starken Duft des frischen Rasens taucht er tief hinein bis zum Vergessen. . . Später reckt er sich und glättet sich das Haar, springt wie wild durch alle Täler eilend hin, und, in seinem wilden Spielen arg verwöhnt, schwingt er gleichsam einen Stecken noch — und die Gräser auf dem Felde ducken sich, und die Vöglein fliegen schreckhaft rasch davon. Wie ein Habicht stürzt er plötzlich ungestüm, spannt mit letzten Kräften seine Muskeln an — und zerreisst den ungeheuren Raum der Luft, der sich hin zu Ewigkeiten dränget. . . Und frei entfliegt er mit den Elementen erreicht die Zeit, die er durchbricht — sie fällt, sie stirbt, und dann mit ihr steht auch der Puls des Weltalls still. Sodann durchdrängt er flink die Weite, schwer schnaufend bis zur Mattigkeit, kopfüber stürzt er sich die Schlucht hinab — er springt, er tollt, er rast, versinkt als Toter in den Gründen, wo spurlos er verschwindet. . . Oh, ich kenne diese Jagd, dies Spiel des Windes, der in Essen pfeift und gegen Fenster schlägt. Wie er leicht die Mauern streichelt der vergangenen und so fernen Kinder jahre! 18 [pageend20]Aengstlich schrecken auf die längst entschlaf’nen Träume, spriessen hoch die Wünsche, leben auf die alten Freuden, schaudern, tief erzitternd die ganz zarten Saiten, dass das schuldlos reine Herz sich schmerzhaft krümmt! Wie viel Blicke, Bilder, die viel Leid vergraben, wollen nun voll Wärme quellen und sich zart ergiessen ! Alles augenblicks entsteht und augenblicks verweht, voller Gleichmut alle Spuren mit sich ziehend. . . Hiernach flutet hin das grosse Schweigen, und die Seelen trunken, sie verstummen, Menschensinn, er bleibt voll Zweifel und das Aug schweift unbeweglich wie betäubt. . . Oh, ich kenne, Wind, dein Lied, die tolle Jagd, und dein Pfeifen in den Essen, an den Fenstern — der in weiter Welt die kleine Heimat suchet, der mit ihren Schmerzen, Leiden lebt und mit ihrem heil’gen Kreuzestod ! Oh, du wirst’s vernehmen, wirst die Bitte hören, dass auch ich den Schicksalbann ertrage wie ein Flüchtling von der Frühe bis zum Abend, meine Spur verbunden mit den Ewigkeiten, meinen schwachen Arm zu straffen, stummes Weltall zu umfassen. Höre du mich, Wind, erhör’ die Bitte, nimm auf deine Flügel all die Weltensorgen, du, o Wind, so unbekümmert, hör’ ergeben meine Bitte! Wenn du fern gen Westen fliehest und zum warmen Süden wehst, 19 [pageend21]nicht verweile sorgenlos, nicht vergiss mein Heimatland. Im schweren Schmerzen schlummern dort die Felder, Oed’ und tot vergeh’n die Tage, ew’ge Not die Wälder rauschen, ewig trüb der Flüsse Lauf. Ach, wie schnell die Jahre fliehen einer unbesorgten Kindheit — wieviel helle Morgen mir erstrahlten, vieviel gold’ne Dämmerungen. Dort die ersten Nachtigallen sangen einer stillen reinen Jugendzeit. . . Wenn du dann die Heimathäuser sichtest, die aus Einsamkeit sich zag umarmen lass dich in die leeren Strassen fallen. Ueberspring’ die niedern Mauern, blase in die breiten weiten Höfe, lass dein müdes Auge schweifen und beschau dein Bild im Brunnen. Sieh, ob schon die Hyazinten blühen, ob der alte Flieder dort noch steht. Such die Vöglein unterm Dach auf, streichle alle sie ganz zart. Fliege dann von neuem in die Höhe, tröste den verträumten Heimatsraum, stürme in die Wälder, Feller, Täler, in die Seen, die so klar sich wiegen, steig’ hinauf zu den Gebirgen, und auf ihren kahlen Gipfeln kröne du den stolzen Flug. . . Wenn du nachts an Bergeshängen wehest, suche die im ew’gen Schlafe ruhen auf. 20 [pageend22]Lass dich still bei dunklen Kreuzen nieder, klopfe dreimal mit dem Finger an. Grabesplatten werden sich erheben, und ein Schwarm von Todesschatten schweigend wird sich jäh bewegen. Arme sich ausstrecken werden, man wird fluchen. . . Nichts wird man von diesen Toten hören! Nur ein Schrecken wird sich breiten wie ein fernes Echo in der Wüste. . . Sterben wird das grosse Dürsten dort, niemals schlürfen Totenknochen Lebensblut. Wenn Himmel Augen öffnen, die vom Schlaf gemieden, von denen Sterne wie die Tränen fallen, entblösset ihren Schoss die Erde und Tote werden steinern in die Gräber sinken. Traurig wirst du pfeifen dann, und es weinen dunkle Welten hier mit dir — wieder werden Platten poltern, heil’ge Felder werden ächzen, und die Nacht wird gierig saugen allen Gram aus Flüssen, Meeren. . . Wenn du dann von dort entfliehest auf die öden Wege hin, störe nicht die zarten Büsche. Leise wehe in die Hütten — vor den alten Heil’genbildern bete dort für sie, die tot. . . Nicht verlosch’ die heil’gen Lämpchen denn Jahrhunderte von ihnen starben, und Jahrhunderte erstrahlten hell für sie. Wenn du später wiederkehrest, werden wir uns alte Freunde 21 [pageend23]treu und herzlich fest umarmen. Wirst dein Haupt tief nieder neigen und mit ungehörten Worten mir ins Herz hinein erzählen, wie die weite Fahrt gewesen. Scharf wird’s schmerzen, o ich weiss, reine Tränen werden fliessen, Tränen letzten Kummers werden’s sein Tränen meiner letzten Zweifelspein. Flammen werden meine Stirn umlodern, schmelzen werden Blut, Gebein und die Steine, wie das Eisen und der Anfang und der Tod. Unbesiegt zum Riesen werd’ ich wachsen. In dem grossen dunklen Schweigen mögen harte Glockenschläge tönen, mögen Reitermassen galoppieren, mögen Tuben schmettern, Trommeln dröhnen, mögen Sterne leuchten, Blitze prasseln, möge Meereskraft die Himmel stürmen — mächtig, unbeugsam und fest ich bleibe! Werde schmelzen Blut, Gebein und die Steine, wie das Eisen und den Anfang und den Tod ! Mögen Tempel und Altäre stürzen ! In der Seele, die ich in mir trage, ewig wird ein Funken dort entflammt — mein Glaube eines Menschen und des Sohnes vor der Heimat! Donner mir die Schultern drückt, und mich auf das Knie zwingt, wird’s mir letztes Labsal sein ! 22 [pageend24]In die Erde will den Kopf ich stossen, dass die harte Scholle springt! Hiernach will ich mich zur Höhe schwingen, hoch hinauf die Arme strecken, mit dem Blick das All durchmessen! Das wird höchstes Streben werden, in den Aether einzugehen, und mit Gott und Sturm verschmelzen, um zu werden Sturm und Gott! Aber du entfliehe durch die Hänge, rüttle, richte, tolle wild, blindlings fege durch die Gründe und entschwinde spurlos schnell. . . GEORGE SAVA THE WITCH (St r a n g e Ca s e s, Incident Three) ... A more worldly-wise woman than Flora would have taken advantage of her good fortune to leave the village of her unhappiness for ever. The idea barely occurred to her. She was independent, with an income sufficient for a life of reasonable comfort. Nothing tied her to the spot where she had spent all her life. Yet she remained. She refused the solicitor’s advice to sell the house while the market was good and tried to settle down to a life as similar to her previous existence as it could be in the altered circumstances. It was an asto23 [pageend25]nishing decision, at which Mr Fordyce did not conceal his surprise. But she was adamant—though perhaps mulish would be the better term. He quite failed to understand what a woman still young might want in a large house with a walled garden and why she should choose to live a life of utter solitude. Probably the reason for her decision was sheer inertia —inability to change her course. Certainly she did not take into account the remarkable reactions of the village to her change of status, though even if she had, she would probably still not have possessed the will-power to tear herself loose. The news of her inheritance spread rapidly and became at once the main topic of conversation. At first it was a mere gossip around the main fact of her having been bequeathed the entire wealth of the Misses Withers, but little by little, in the mysterious way that things come about the whole details became known to the village. As each new fact was revealed, the talk grew. Eager to see ill in anything connected with Flora Beston, the devil’s brat, the villagers quickly seized on the fresh news that she had inherited under a will made very recently—only a fortnight, in fact, before the death of the second Miss Withers. This was regarded as damning. The sudden deaths of the two ladies, the one so soon after the other, now assumed a new significance. Obviously the devil’s brat had been at work in ways only known to her black master. There must be something fishy about those deaths, coming like that. It was witchcraft Of the blackest sort. Probably the sudden death of Annie Beston, too, had not been entirely a matter of natural causes. How could that young doctor know? He might be stuffed full of the teachings of the latest medical science, but he had come straight to the village from practice in London, and he was as ignorant as a new-born child of the age-old resources of the witch. 24 [pageend26]And that, as someone remarked, wasn’t a very good simile, for that little devil Flora Beston had taken in the black art with her dam’s milk and had Devil’s own cold blood in her veins. It was not long before Flora, though she walled herself in her citadel, began to realize that the passive resentment of the village towards her was turning rapidly to active hostility. She went into the post office one day —the post office that formed part of the small general shop that provided the whole of the local shopping facilities apart from the butcher and the dairy. The presiding lady, Mrs Roster, refused point blank to serve her and warned her not to enter the shop again. She was not going to run the risk of having the Evil Eye cast on her or her customers. That was the first and most blatant sign of the new attitude. Others followed quickly. Women in the village crossed the road when they saw Flora coming, and, if they had children, shielded them from the danger that was supposed to lurk in Flora’s most casual glance. The postman, though he maintained an air of philosophical detachment in discussions in the inn, left the few letters Flora received— usually from the solicitor—at the gate; he thought it better to take no chances, and that safety first was not at all a bad guiding principle. The malign star that had presided over Flora’s birth must now have reached its zenith of power. At the moment when fortune seemed to have smiled at last on Flora, giving her independence and a chance of reclaiming something of all she had missed in life, malefic influences began to dog her at every turn. Among the villagers, the ancient ingrained superstitions easily broke through the veneer of partial education and modern civilization to show themselves in their ugliest forms. Foot-and-mouth disease broke out among the cattle in 25 [pageend27]the neighbourhood, and the Ministry of Agriculture was quickly on the spot, identifying the origin of the malady in the herd of Farmer Gulliver. One of Gulliver’s meadows ranged along the walls at the end of Flora’s garden. The inference was obvious. The disease was Flora’s doing. It would be easy enough for a woman who had caused two human deaths to' bewitch cattle that grazed so near to her. When the chickens in a flock at the other end of the village started to decline in egg production, the reason was again simple: Flora passed that way on her occasional walks. That the decline was normal at that time of the year and in any other circumstances would have been accepted as natural never seemed to occur to anyone. There was a dangerous mood in the village now. Authority was known to be harsh and unreasonable, but for all that there was secret talk of dealing with the witch in the traditional manner—of dragging her out and ducking her in the pond, naked, before the assembled people, though it was realized that there could be no burning at the stake. Rumours of these upsurgings of public opinion came to the aged rector, now in his ninetieth year, and he nodded gravely to himself. Though he had appeared aloof from his flock, he had lived long enough among them to understand them and also the tortuous ways of the rural mind. But his first attempt to cast oil on troubled waters was signally unsuccessful; indeed, it tended to make matters worse. In his faltering, tired old voice he preached a by no means contemptible sermon on the dangers and evils of superstition. The moral of it all went home to his congregation but they assigned a cause for sermon that the rector, for all his experience, had never considered remotely possible. He had clearly been bewitched by Flora into making a veiled defence of her; the Devil could always quote scripture for his purpose when he 26 [pageend28]wished to, and it was no new thing for him to take the guise of a monk. As the mutterings grew, the rector took serious alarm. He knew it would be no good to consult higher authority, either of the State or of the Church. His stories would be pooh-pooh’d and probably regarded as the rambling of the mind past its work. He decided to call on Flora and try to talk things over with her. After all, she deserved some consideration, for she had generously continued the donations and subscriptions habitually made by the Witherses. His action added another coal to the fire. When he was seen tottering along the road, leaning heavily on his rubber-shod stick, heads were wagged and significant glances exchanged. Flora was astonished to see him, but she did her best to welcome him. It was the first time he had called for a long time, and she found it difficult to deal with him in her new status. It had been easy enough to serve him with tea and buttered scones in the drawing-room and answer his polite inquiries when she had been the maid. It was a far different thing to be the actual hostess. "My child,” said the rector earnestly, “I’ve come here because I’ve something very important to say to you. I don’t go out much now, as you know, but I thought it better to call rather than write and ask you to come and see me. I don’t altogether trust what happens to letters in the local post office. “But surely, sir—” she broke out. He shook his head weakly. “Now please don’t interrupt. Flora,” he said with the air of one reproving a naughty child. “I haven’t got much breath left at my age, and I don’t want to waste it. You know what they say about you in the village, I suppose—you’re a witch and so on?” She nodded fiercely. “They’ve been saying that ever 27 [pageend29]since I was a kid and the Catfords’ dog died,” she rejoined. ‘‘But it’s serious now,” he said. “Very serious. They’re doing everything except openly accuse you of murder, though they do that in secret, I know. They say you bewitched the Misses Withers after you’d made them leave everything to you. They even go so far as to say you killed your mother by witch-craft. And everything unfortunate that happens is your fault, they say. This outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease is due to you, my child, because Gulliver’s cows browse in the shadow of your garden walls. Miss Leathers’s fowls aren’t laying because you went for a walk that way. And the chimney that fell off the roof of Herbert Cutler’s house and just missed Mrs Borrow and her daughter fell not because it’s needed attention to my knowledge for the past ten years but because you forced it to fall at precisely that moment. Did you know all this?” “I didn’t, sir,” she replied. “But I don’t take any notice of their evil, lying tongues.” “That’s quite right of you, as a general principle,” said the rector. “Very right. But this is going too far. 1 fear what may happen to you, and the time has come for you to take a little more notice. If something else unfortunate happens in the village, I hesitate to think what they may not do. As like as not, they might come up here and set the house on fire.” “They wouldn’t dare!” exclaimed Flora hotly. “Unfortunately they would,” returned the rector seriously. “These fits that come on village people are like some form of contagious madness. It’s no wonder the church in olden times used to believe in possession by spirits, for that’s exactly what this sort of thing looks like. They are ready to take advantage of anything to give you what they feel are your just deserts. I tried to warn them of the sinfulness of it all, but they even 28 [pageend30]put down my sermon to your magic influence. And I’ve no doubt that seeing me come up here has confirmed them in that belief. I seem to remember I got a few very nasty glances on my way here.” “But what can I do?” asked Flora helplessly. Faced with a situation the seriousness of which she now could not doubt, she turned automatically to someone else for guidance—or rather instructions. “That is what I want to talk to you about,” said the rector wheezily. “I think the best thing you could do would be to leave here. Sell the house and go away altogether. Mr Fordyce will help you, I’ve no doubt at all. It will be better for you, too. It’s not right that you should live all alone up here like this.” “But I don’t want to leave,” she protested. “Why should I, just because they want me to go? They’ve never done anything to make me feel grateful to them or even friendly. Why should I do what they want me to do now ? ’ ’ “Because it’s for your own safety, my child,” said the rector persistently. “Forget that it might look like cowardice. It doesn’t matter to you if they crow over it when you’ve gone. You’ve no friends in the village, more’s the pity, and you’ve nothing to leave behind you. You’ll be much happier elsewhere, with the chance of making friends.” She was impressed by his deep sincerity. It was not a mere business proposition he was putting to her as the same suggestion had sounded on the lips of Fordyce, the solicitor; it was the considered counsel of a man whom all her life she had respected. “I’ll think about it, sir,” she said, at last. “It’s not a thing you can do in hurry.” “Well, don’t leave it too long,” he returned. She helped him to his feet and having piloted him 29 [pageend31]to the garden gate suggested she should accompany him home. He shook his head. “No,” he said firmly. “That would never do. It would make matters worse for both of us.” As she watched him tottering down the road till he was out of sight, she felt a growing resentment against life. There was nothing she could enjoy in peace—not even solitude. It was true the door was now wide open for escape but she did not care to go that way. Here she was rooted. This was her world—the only world she had ever known. More than the animosity of the villagers and the unknown future that the rector predicted, she feared contacts with a strange world of people, however friendly they might seem to be. She did not believe in friendship; it was something of which she had had no experience whatsoever, something from which she felt herself for ever to be debarred. Flora did not leave the neighbourhood. It would be untrue to say that she decided to dismiss the rector’s advice and definitely determined to stay, for that would imply a positive judgement of which she was incapable. She remained for the same reason as she had before—• because she was mentally incapable of rousing herself to any sort of decisive action. And so, unknowingly, she set the stage for the last act of her lifelong tragedy. The denouement came not from the muttering villagers nor from any outside source at all, but from the mysterious forces within her. It was so strange in its effects (yet not so strange seen through the eyes of science) that perhaps the villagers might be excused if they saw in it the workings of a supernatural justice, a form of retribution from a higher source. Curious things began to happen to Flora. Living on her own she barely noticed them herself, and she had no intimates to drop her a hint or advise a visit to a doctor. 30 [pageend32]When at last she did observe some alterations in her appearance, she ascribed them simply to an early onset of old age. She knew nothing of biology or even the workings of her own body. People grew old, and age was accompanied by various obvious changes in appearance and manner: that was the sum of her knowledge. But when these began she had not the faintest idea, nor did she so much as guess that there might be general rules about these things. When her face began to show signs of hairiness, she was not at all upset. Her only reaction was one of renewed bitterness. That hirsuteness was merely a mark of age, an earnest to her that she might give up whatever slight hopes she might secretly retain of living a normal life. They were undeniable signals to her that her youth and maturity were passed and that all that lay before was the long, gradually steepening decline that led into death. Her fatalistic acceptance of this symptom dimmed her powers of self-observation still more. The progress towards flat-chestedness was just another sign of the weight of years pressing out her normal feminine shape; she could do nothing about it. Some women did develop that way when they grew old, just as others tended to become full bosomed, encumbered with what the sailor terms 'top hamper’. She had worked hard all her life, for though the Witherses had been solicitous for her education and welfare, they had not objected to her helping her mother in every possible way. That had meant the hard domestic round and had included many tasks that had developed her., muscles. So again she gave no special attention to her muscles; if they looked more massive, more like the pictures she occasionally saw in magazine advertisements of champion weightlifters who promised to impart equal strength by postal lessons, it was merely 31 [pageend33]because they looked so in comparison to her shrinking bosom and the general squaring-up of her figure. If she had noticed them, indeed, she would have been none the wiser. . . . The talk went round spreading like a plague, and the tongues of reason that lately had been permitted to wag were silenced. Everything was beyond doubt. Flora Beston was the worst kind of witch. There were white witches who knew the kind of magic that was good for men and women—they were the wise women who could heal and comfort with their simple remedies and perhaps see into the future. But Flora Beston was not a white witch. She had sold herself to the Devil, her father, and now he was claiming the price. He had given her the things she wanted, showing her how to destroy her employers and get their money. Now in due time the price of all that was being exacted. Fear stalked abroad—a fear all the more searching because it could not be openly expressed. There were many who would have liked to drag her forth and demand the penalty; but they had a greater fear of the law of the land. Spies were sent up to the house. Word must be sent at once to the village if she was seen abroad, so that doors could be locked and blinds or curtains drawn. No one must be allowed to go near the witch. They would have liked to drive her from the village with stones, but that could not be done. There were other ways, however, that might be tried. Words, especially written words, were sometimes as powerful as stones. The very next day, the first of the letters came. Flora read it uncomprehendingly at first and and then, when its sense had come to her, she screwed it up and tossed it aside. You are a witch, (it ran). Get out of the village. The 32 [pageend34]Devil is turning you into a man and you will bring bad luck on us all. That letter or some variation of it was repeated, sometimes as often as three times a day. She found the trees in the garden carved with the words: Witch! Go back to your master, the Devil. In some mysterious way notes were slipped into the parcels of groceries that reached her from the town. Nightmare was on her. She tried to go out, and people vanished as soon as she appeared, though once or twice voices called to her from behind the hedgerows, accusing her of being a witch and telling her to go. The letters grew more abusive, accusing her openly now of having killed the two old ladies and bringing every conceivable misfortune to the village. She looked at herself in the glass. For the first time she realized the changes that had come to her and could see herself through the eyes of others. They were right. She had turned into a man. A coarse moustache was on her upper lip; her chin was fringed with a beard more marked than it had been as recently as when she had seen the rector. Her breasts had shrunk to mere nipples. Her feminine curves had been transformed into the hourglass silhouette of the man. For a moment or two she studied herself. Then she put her hands over her eyes and staggered. She wanted to cry, but her eyes remained dry. The terrible thought rushed to her mind: the village must be right. She was accursed. Unbeknown to herself she must be a witch. . . . Flora came down the path. She was walking like a somnambulist. The rising moon, catching her face momentarily, threw into relief the deep lines of care with which it was graven. But also it gave an unnatural air, emphasizing the fringe of beard and the sharp jut of 33 [pageend35]the chin. To the watchers it was the face of an evil monster, and they shuddered. She wore neither hat nor coat, though she had a scarf wound round her neck. Slowly she opened the gate and turned in the direction of the downs. At a little distance the men followed. They were used to trapping things in the dark and they had no difficulty in following this quarry. She walked on slowly, yet with an air of purpose as though she knew her destination clearly. At last they reached the grassy track along which, years before, she had so often wandered—the track on which Bob Catford had trailed her and caught her. A little further on she turned into a track that led downhill. The men exchanged quick glances as though they sensed her intention. At the foot of that path was a deep pond, unfenced, fed by a running stream. At the edge of it she paused. She looked upwards at the moon, and again the men exchanged glances and shuddered; for the moon has affinity with witches. Then slowly and with a detached though determined air, like one in a dream, she unwound the scarf from her neck and twisted it round her wrists, knotting it firmly with her teeth. Again she paused and glanced at the moon, as though it fascinated her. Then, in the same slow, deliberate way, she waded into the pond. The water reached her waist, but still she walked on. Suddenly she seemed to trip over a submerged root, and pitched forward. The disturbed water gleamed eerily in the moonlight. None of the men stirred. They were like frozen figures watching some savage, ancient rite of self-immolation. They waited without stirring. None of them made a move to go to her aid. They saw no more of Flora Beston. The cold moonlit waters settled again, black and still. 34 [pageend36]“It’s over,” said Chapman gruffly. “It’s better so.” He cast one look at the pond and turned heavily to retrace his steps. “Come on. She’ll not come up for some time yet. Maybe we’d better go and tell the constable. We can say we were too late to do anything.” The others nodded in the thin moonlight and followed him. Chapman was right, they thought. It was better so. They could not have helped her without also paying a price to the devil. It was the Justice of God that had been satisfied. By now, the tormented soul of Flora Beston was with her dark master in the region of eternal damnation. CHRISTO OGNYANOV FERNE ZEITEN... Wie glücklich unsre Väter waren ! Zu ihnen kam zuweilen Gott, Er setzte sich zu ihren Mahlen Und teilt’ mit ihnen Wein und Brot. Sie gaben jedem Wandersmanne, Der müde, gastlich das Geleit, Und hob Gewitter sich am Himmel Ein Lager war im Nu bereit. Und Gott und Wandrer sprachen Segen Für gute Ernte, Brot und Wein, Des Gottes Nähe alle spürten Wie war des Lebens Glück so rein! 35 [pageend37]Mit harter Prüfung nicht verschonte Sie Gott, erprobend die Geduld. Da fest im Glauben sie beharrten Nahm er Sie neu in Schutz und Huld. Vergebens suchts du heut die Ahnen! Auch mich verlangt’s nach Brot und Wein, Wer wird von Hagel mich bewahren, Wer lädt auch mich zum Mahle ein? Der Wandrer harrt gleich Gott vergebens Am Tor auf gastliches Geleit, Verschollen ist die Spur der Väter, Verschollen ihre Herzlichkeit. Auch ich vergebens immer suche Der hehren Väter Spur und Schein, Ein jeder läuft nun seine Wege, Ein jeder kämpft für sich allein. BISTRA Du bist nicht eines Mädchens Name, Nicht Name der geliebten Frau, Der Fels bist du, aus dem ich stamme, Der Berg, seit Kindheit mir vertraut. Ich wuchs von deiner Lieb umschlossen — Ein freier Vogel auf der Flur, Aus dir die Kräfte mir entsprossen, Zu trotzen jeder Unnatur. 36 [pageend38]Und sieh, schon lange, lange Jahre Geh ich durch Menschenleid und Not Und hab auf meinem Weg erfahren Den Sinn von Kommen, Sein und Tod. Wie oft bei Nacht aus Sternenweiten Zu deuten suchte ich mein Los: Ob Glück und Sieg mich wird begleiten Ob ich geschlagen fallen muss. Ich beichte dir wie einer Mutter: Oft in Verzweiflung ich mich wand Und glaubte nah mich am Verbluten Und nirgends ein Verstehn ich fand. Sowie ein Stein in schnellen Wogen Dem Stoss nur folgt in Hin und Her So fand auch ich, von Glück betrogen, Dem Steine gleich, den Halt nicht mehr. Und selber weiss ich kaum mehr heute, Ob Segen mein Geschick, ob Pein: Zu lechzen nach verlorner Heimat Zu brennen, glühn nach ihr allein. Nie kann ihr Bild ich mir verwehren, Im Traume selbst vor mir sie schwebt, Nach ihr die Sinne sich verzehren, Nach ihr mein ganzes Leben strebt. Und du, mein Berg, wie rufst du leise Durch Wind und Mond und Sonnenschein 1 Sie alle deine Schönheit preisen, Erzählen mir von dir allein. 37 [pageend39]Mit dir gemeinsam leid ich heute, Bin treuer Sohn wie früher noch, Der gleiche Freiheitsdrang uns leite, Zu stürzen der Tyrannen Joch. Dann jauchzend werden wir dich grüssen : Befreit bist du mein Berg, befreit! Umarmen lass dich, Berg, und küssen, Zu neuem Frühling sei bereit! Mit solchem Glauben leb ich heute Er strömt aus dir mir immer neu, Ein Glaube, der mir mehr bedeutet, Als jede schwarze Tyrannei. O segne mich, du Hort der Heimat, Mein teurer Berg, mein Wein und Brot, Dass ich für deine Freiheit sterbe, Mit Lust wie einst ich mir gebot. MICHAEL PADEV SONYA I saw Sonya for the first and last time in my life in the Sofia Prison, one November afternoon in 1941. I had gone there with a lawyer friend of mine to see another friend—arrested, together with a group of fourteen other students, one month before that, for distributing anti-German leaflets. Eight of them had been sentenced to death, the rest to lifelong imprisonment. My lawyer friend was defending B., but in spite of all his 38 [pageend40]\ efforts he couldn’t save him, and the poor boy was among those sentenced to death. He had expressed the wish to see me before his execution. As the police at that time were in in ignorance as to my whereabouts and were trying to track me down, it was only possible for me to penetrate into the prison, thanks to a subterfuge. The police had lost all interest in B., knowing that he was to be executed any day—there was nobody to spy on him and he was allowed to see members of his family in the prison lawyers’ room. So, disguised as one of his brothers and with a forged permit, I entered the prison. Luckily nobody recognised me. The Lawyer’s Room overlooked the large prison courtyard. While we were talking, B., who was near the window, suddenly said, “Come and look at her.” Not understanding what he meant I went to the window. Outside in the yard I saw a sad procession—a group of about fifty men and woman taking their daily compulsory walk, escorted by a large number of prison guards. This was very unusual. What was the woman doing in the midst of all these men, when prison regulations forbade women prisoners to leave their particular building and their particular courtyard? In the prison women and men never met. B. explained. “They’re the parachutists. And that’s Sonya. . . . We are not allowed to get in touch with them. Their cells are isolated from the rest of the prison and they are taken out only when the rest of us are indoors.” I put my arm round B.’s shoulder and gazed through the window. I was very interested to see this Sonya, of whom I had heard so much. She wore a dark dress and looked tired and old. I knew she was over forty, but she seemed more. Her hair was scraped back from her ears and almost white. From time to time she drew her right hand over her forehead, as though she were remembering something. She was slightly bent and 39 [pageend41]walked slowly. I could not see her face well from that distance, but I thought she looked more thoughtful than sad. Determination and defiance shone through her personality. Or was it only my imagination? I wanted to go on looking at her but the prison guards had come to tell us that our interview must end, as we had been with B. for over half an hour. . . . B. and his friends were hanged in the prison yard two days later. Their execution was not announced— they were not important enough. I heard about it from B.’s brother, who sent me a message, simply informing me that the previous day he had seen B.’s grave. Apparently a new system had been introduced with regard to the executions. The prisoners’ families were no longer told beforehand nor were they allowed to see the dead body of their son, brother, husband, or father. Men were now hanged and buried hurriedly. Only then were their relations informed, and all they were shown was a freshly dug grave in the prison cemetery. Sonya Petrova. Bom in Sofia, 1903, of a middle-class family. Arrested 1925 and sentenced to death for antiGovernment activities. Sentence commuted by Royal Decree to imprisonment for life, because of pregnancy. Child born in prison in 1926. Father unknown. Released 1939 for good behaviour. Left Bulgaria the same year. July 1941; caught by special police troops as head of a guerilla parachutist band near the town of Troyan. Sentenced to death by special Military Court in July 1942. . . . I imagine that the police file of Sonya Petrova must refer to her life in such prosaic terms as these. Yet the life of Sonya Petrova is one of the most interesting and fascinating I have ever known. 40 [pageend42]Sonya had neither brother nor sister. Her father, a minor railway official, spent most of his life in small Bulgarian towns, usually in the railway station building, and Sonya’s life, until she reached the age of twenty, was uneventful. True, the girl rather worried her mother, a simple, fat, good-hearted woman. She was worried because Sonya, when she reached the age of eighteen, showed no interest whatsoever in marriage, as all well-brought-up girls should. She read books instead, and that in itself worried her mother still more. “Books only give people crazy ideas,” the old woman used to say to her friends. When her mother complained to her father, he only replied, “Leave the child alone!” Sonya thought her father was an old darling and she adored him. Perhaps it was because of his death that her life changed so completely. Years later, Sonya would tell her friends that there was one night in her life which she would never forget, the night she saw her father for the last time. It was a beautiful September evening, in 1923. Somebody knocked heavily at the door and Sonya went to open it. Three men entered. They were in civilian clothes, but they carried rifles. She recognized them as the special Government police whom the whole town feared. She knew that there had been some changes in the Government months before. Her father had told her that the Prime Minister had been killed and that there was a new Government. He had told her, too, that in several towns there had been riots with many casualties. In their own town the newly appointed Mayor had formed a special Government police group of men. Sonya’s father had been asked, as a former N.C.O. who had taken part in the war, to join the special police force, but he had refused. He did not like the idea, he said. He had his job in the railway station and did not want to be disturbed. This must have been some weeks be41 [pageend43]fore and the whole matter had been forgotten. Now, here they were again. “Where’s your father?” the men asked. Sonya did not need to reply because her father had already come into the room. “Get dressed. You’re coming with us,” one of the men said. “You are wanted for special duty.” “I have to get up very early to-morrow,” her father protested. “Do as we say,” the man interrupted angrily. “You know we are military. You have been a soldier and you should know what disobedience means!” They left in about ten minutes. Sonya and her mother cried the whole night; instinctively they knew that something was wrong. They were not mistaken, for next day the father did not return. Three days later thirtyseven men were found dead in a field near the main road, not more than ten miles from the railway station. Sonya’s father was among them. They had all been shot. Some had ten, even fifteen wounds in their bodies. Sonya’s father had three bullets through his head. The Special Police did not even try to hide the fact that the thirty-seven men had been “executed” by their order. Of Sonya’s father they said that he was a dangerous element for the State security, since he had refused to do his patriotic duty by joining the Special Police when called upon to do so. The town was horrified, but remained calm. Not so Sonya. . . . She left her mother (the poor woman died in misery and poverty in 1928) and came to Sofia, where she entered the University. She was regarded in diSerent and varying ways by her fellow students. According to some, she was too reserved and too wrapped up in herself; according to others, too serious. Some even thought 42 [pageend44]her frivolous, while others said she was conceited. One thing, however, was certain: Sonya had more success with men than with women. Men liked her, loved, adored her. Women pretended to like her, but really they feared her. She was at her ease with men and always preferred their company. Everyone who knew her at that time says that she was extremely attractive. She had beautiful blue eyes and there was something quite unusual about them. The spark of enthusiasm for some, the flame of love for others, and the strong feeling of hatred, perhaps, for a few. Her hair was brown. She wore it long and it fell in soft, natural waves over her shoulders. There was nothing unusual about her mouth, though some people thought it too big. Her voice, however—and on this point all her friends agreed—had an extraordinary quality. It was, at times, a hard, deep voice that could command, and yet it was a soft, sweet voice that could whisper the gentlest words of tenderness and affection. Her figure was lovely. She was only twenty but she looked younger. Tall and slim, conscious of her beauty, she was always very simply dressed. She wore a black satin overall in the University lecturerooms and a plain dark dress in the town. Sonya lived in a small flat. It could hardly be called a flat at all, for it consisted of one very small room and of a small cellar that was kitchen and bath all in one. She did everything herself—cleaning, washing, cooking. Her home was the most popular among the students, and her parties—to which all the guests brought something and cooked it themselves, helping Sonya to wash up afterwards—were awaited with the greatest eagerness. More often than not, Sonya invited men only. This, of course, did not endear her to the other girls, and she became the butt of all their gossip. She was accused of being selfish, and jealous of the other women, and of trying to keep all the men to herself. As 43 [pageend45]a matter of fact, she did monopolise the men; all the male University students who knew her preferred her to anybody else, and many would neglect their own girls in the hope of seeing Sonya or being present at one of her parties. When she entered the University in the morning, all the men had a smile for her and each would stop to speak to her. It was an honour, a great honour, for a University student to be noticed by Sonya. The greatest honour of all was to be her friend. Perhaps one of the reasons why she preferred men was because she worked with them. For two years, from 1923 to 1925, she was the actual head of the Students’ Labour Organisation. It was a secret organisation: the Government had disbanded all labour organisations, accusing them of communist activities. But the labour groups continued to exist, nevertheless. Officially, there was a legal Students’ Corporation, called "Botev”, named after a Bulgarian revolutionary and the greatest Bulgarian poet, Kristo Botev, who was killed in 1862, fighting the Turks. The leaders of "Botev”, however, were also the leaders of the secret Students’ Labour Union. Sonya was Secretary of "Botev”, and Vice-President of the Labour Union. The President of the Union, Nacho Belata, an energetic and courageous student of twenty- five, who was known as “the Fire”, became of his passionate speeches, was Sonya’s best friend. The Fire was often at Sonya’s flat until late at night, but so were many of her other friends. She usually talked to her friends alone. If, as often happened, someone lost courage, and his nerves showed signs of breaking, Sonya would take him home for the evening and talk to him and the man would unfailingly regain his confidence. Her many men friends never discussed her among themselves, except in very general terms. They all agreed that she was lovely, and the best friend anyone could have. They all agreed that she was invaluable to the 44 [pageend46]work. They all admired her and were ready to do anything she demanded of them. Yet each kept the secret to himself, the secret of what Sonya had said to him and to him only. The secret of her attitude towards him when they were alone. Was she the mistress of all, or was she the sister of all ? Nobody knew and nobody will ever know! The task of the Labour Students’ Union was simple: the leaders knew that throughout the whole country something was being planned. The students were told that a United Front had been formed comprising all progressive political parties and movements in a joint eSort to overthrow the Government. They were requested to form a big students’ organisation that would back the opposition coalition. They were then told to form small groups of students’ yatki (cells), which would, if necessary, take an active part in fighting the Government forces. The leader of each of them was chosen by Sonya and his contact with the Union was maintained only through her. In 1924 and 1925, the Union received arms, revolvers, bombs, and handgrenades. These groups were trained by special instructors outside the town. The communication between the students’ organisation and the leaders of the Labour Party was maintained through the President of the Students’ Union, the Fire. He and Sonya were the only people among the students who formed the liaison with the Party. Not all the revolutionary cells in the country, however, were as successfully organised as the students’ cell. This was one of the reasons why the Government police forces after savage fighting which in some towns lasted many weeks, succeeded in suppressing the movement. But it took them two years to do so. The first revolt had broken out late in 1923, and there were 45 [pageend47]sporadic uprisings until the end of 1925. In Sofia, clashes with the police occurred almost every week. The revolutionary leaders were surounded in their houses and hiding-places where they fought to the last. Their strongholds were blown up and burnt to the ground, but still they would not surrender. Month by month, slowly but surely, the police forces were extinguishing the fires of rebellion. The great network of the underground Labour movement was gradually untangled and destroyed bit by bit, cell by cell. And those of the leaders who were captured were put to death in most cases without a trial. The police decided to arrest Sonya early in October. Six plain-clothes men went to her flat at four o’clock in the morning and rang the bell. There was no reply. They forced the door, but the first two policemen to enter the flat were shot dead. The police withdrew, surrounded the house, compelled all the occupants of the other flats to leave the building and then organised an assault on Sonya’s flat. From Sonya’s windows came several shots killing and wounding more policemen. It was obvious that she had barricaded herself in with several other friends, and that they had decided to fight it out. The police threw two bombs through the windows but the defenders retorted by throwing more bombs back at them. Fighting continued for over an hour and then the flat was silent. When the police entered it, they found two persons only : Sonya and the Fire. Both were unconscious, soaked in blood, but still alive. They were taken to hospital, where the boy died several hours later without regaining consciousness. Sonya was saved. She had eight wounds, but none proved fatal. In three weeks’ time she was discharged from hospital and taken to prison. In January of the following year, she was tried, together with a group of one hundred other students, by the Sofia Special Military Court. 46 [pageend48]The Military Court divided the students into three groups: organisers, members, and sympathisers. The organisers—thirty-one in all—were sentenced to death, the members to lifelong imprisonment, and the sympathisers to different terms, ranging from three to ten years. Some were even released. There were fifteen women students in the group, but Sonya was the only woman to receive the death sentence. She received it with complete calm. Some of the boys grew pale, but she had only to look at them and they regained their calm and spirit. When her sentence was read out by the judge, Sonya did an amazing thing: she began singing the song of the old revolutionary, Kristo Botev. The boys joined in, and within a minute all of them were singing it. The Court, the guards, the police were powerless. They did not even attempt to stop it. It was, after all, the students’ last chance of singing together! The amazing fact about this trial was the lack of evidence against Sonya. It was clear that she was the centre of the whole organisation yet nobody bore witness against her. Her best friends and assistants had been killed, but among those who were tried there were many boys who knew all about the work she had been doing for the last two years. Yet when questioned, each one of them gave the same answer: “I know nothing about Sonya Petrova!” In vain the Public Prosecutor told them that they might save their lives by revealing the real head of the organisation. They all preferred to die rather than to utter a word against her. As there was not other evidence against her, she was convicted for opposing the police authorities with arms. The trial was over by the end of January and the death sentences had to be carried out by the middle of 47 [pageend49]February. But Sonya’s death sentence was commuted to life-long imprisonment several days before the execution of her fellow students. And this is the most mysterious page of Sonya’s life. It has remained a mystery ever since and will in all probability always remain a mystery. According to Bulgarian law a woman who is sentenced to death, but is found to be pregnant cannot be executed. Her sentence is automatically commuted to imprisonment for life. Six days before the day fixed for the execution of the students, the Chief of the Prison sent a petition to the Ministry of Justice, asking for a Medical Commission of Inquiry, to investigate the case of a woman prisoner, Sonya Petrova, who had claimed to be pregnant. A protocol to that eSect was signed and Sonya’s lawyer was able, in less than a day, to have her sentence commuted. He had no difficulty, for the law in that respect is perfectly definite. The doctor’s examination revealed, however, that Sonya was only one month gone in pregnancy. Therein lay the mystery. She had been arrested early in October of the previous year. She had stayed three weeks in hospital under police supervision and more than three and a half months in prison. Her prison cell was continually guarded, and for three and a half months she had not seen any men alone, with the exception of her lawyer and the Director of the Prison. The latter she had seen not more than twice, in his own office in the prison building. These two interviews had only lasted for some ten minutes, and, in each case, it was proved that the Director’s secretary had entered the room during that time and had seen nothing unusual. The Director had been at his desk, while Sonya sat in a chair at the opposite end of the room. She had seen her lawyer more often, but their interviews had always taken place in the Lawyers’ Room, a big hall with several desks and chairs, where at every hour of the 48 [pageend50]day there were at least five clients speaking to their lawyers. No one remembered seeing Sonya alone in that room with the lawyer. Besides, both the Director of the Prison and the lawyer were respectable middle- aged married men. The affair created a big sensation. People were divided into two groups: those who suspected the lawyer of being the culprit, and those who suspected the Director of the Prison. The lawyer’s party was more numerous and had better arguments. He was obviously in love with his client, they claimed. He had defended her without taking any fees, and he had put all his other work on one side in order to be able to devote his entire time and attention to her trial. But why, the other party would demand, was the Director of the Prison so exceptionally kind to Sonya ? Why did he allow special food to be brought to her by her friends ? Why was she given almost every book she asked for? Why did he allow her to write more letters than the other prisoners had the right to do? Why did he receive her in his office twice in three months, when he had received no other prisoner for years? Was that not all very mysterious? It seemed plausible enough that he, too, had fallen in love with Sonya, it was argued, and seeing that there was only one chance of saving her life, had decided to become the father of her child? Everybody had a theory but nobody knew the truth. Sonya herself said nothing. A special committee from the Ministry of Justice investigated the case and asked her point-blank who was responsible for her pregnancy. She simply replied : “I myself,” and gave no further explanation. In September the same year, she was transferred to the prison hospital, and in October, her child was born : it was a boy. Again the prison authorities tried to solve the mystery. They asked Sonya to inscribe the name of the father on the birth certificate. She 49 [pageend51]signed her own name for the mother, and left a blank where the name of the father should have been written. “You must write some name,” they told her. “The child has to have a father. Otherwise it will be registered officially as an illegitimate child.” Sonya took the birth certificate and wrote “Unknown”. When Sonya recovered and had to return to prison from the hospital, she insisted on taking her child with her. Her friends tried in vain to convince her that, for the sake of the child’s health, it would be better to send it to the State nurseries. “I refuse to have my child brought up by the Government,” she insisted. “I will educate him myself. I will look after him myself. When he is old enough I’ll tell him what I’ve done, and then he may decide for himself.” The impossible happened. Sonya obtained permission to have her child with her in her prison cell. Many people thought that in reality she was killing the child, for a prison cell can hardly be considered suitable environment for a new-born baby. But soon everybody had to agree that her choice was the wisest. In a Government orphanage, the boy would have been treated like all the other boys, whereas, in the prison, he became everybody’s child. Two thousand political prisoners with one child! All the women prisoners made him dresses and clothes. The men made his toys and his shoes. He lacked nothing. Everybody ordered chocolates for him. The best milk from the prison dairies was put aside for him. When the other prisoners received presents from their friends in town, they invariably kept the best tit-bits for the child. Sonya gave him a beautiful name —Vladimir, the name of the founder of the Soviet State—Vladimir Ilyich Eenin. That made him even more popular. Everybody called him Vladi. He became the joy of the prison. The prison doctors were 50 [pageend52]asked several times a day how Vladi was, and once when the child fell ill, the whole prison was in despair. No one dared make a sound for fear of disturbing him, and, when the child recovered, the prisoners organised a “banquet” in the prison dining-room and presented him and his mother with gifts. The most interesting fact, however, was that the men in the criminal department, where all those guilty of criminal offences were confined, were equally fond of Vladi. Assassins, thieves, crooks, bandits, forgers— people who were considered the scum of society, the criminal underworld, men bereft both of principles and scruples, became soft and kind-hearted with Vladi and his mother. They sent him presents every day. Sonya received more than twenty letters offering financial support for the child. “I am prepared to do anything for the child,” wrote one man who had been sentenced to lifelong imprisonment for killing his wife. “If anyone is rude to you or the boy, Sonya, just send me a note. We know how to deal with such people,” wrote another tough who was serving a sentence of fifteen years’ imprisonment for robbery with violence. She knew that these letters were sincere. She knew that these men were prepared to do anything for her and for the boy. And so one day, in 1930, when Vladi was four years old and she had spent five years in prison, she appealed to these men to do something for her—to kill a man! That day, Sonya had received the following letter from the Criminal Department. (The letter was, of course, sent secretly, through one of those channels that are to be found in every prison in the world.) 51 [pageend53]Dear Sonya, A man who may interest you came in several days ago. At first, he said he knew you, but when we asked him to communicate with you, he refused to do so, saying that you had in all probability, forgotten him. His name is Andro Pardov and he is sentenced to five years for embezzlement of public funds. We suspect that he may have served in the police force. He claims to have been a Government official in the provinces. Do you know anything about him? Yours, E. The letter was signed by one of the prisoners in the Criminal Department, who was on very good terms with the political prisoners. He had a light sentence, three years, and worked each day in a factory near the prison with other groups of prisoners. In this way, he was able to keep in touch with the “outside world”, and to transmit letters, newspapers and all kinds of messages from and to the political prisoners and their friends in town. The prisoners trusted him and often gave him risky and difficult jobs to do. The man was loyal and did his best to help them. He usually succeeded, for the prison guards who accompanied him and his fellow prisoners each day to the factory were not very strict with him. He had already spent more than two years in prison and there was not much likelihood of his trying to escape, as he had only a few more months left. Sonya read the letter and at once sent back the following short note to the Criminal Department: “At all costs, find out where the man was in 1923 and what he was doing at that time.” Directly the reply came, Sonya wrote back: “I want you to kill that man!” 52 [pageend54]E. received Sonya’s request in the evening and read and re-read it. It was as clear as it was imperative. He made up his mind at once: Sonya wanted this thing done and therefore it must be done. There was only one problem : the whole affair had to be finished at once, the same night. Who knows, he thought, to-morrow the man may be transferred to another prison and then she will never have satisfaction ! Yes, the affair had to be settled on the spot. The next day she must receive a letter telling her that her instructions had been carried out. E. called three of his best friends and discussed the whole matter with them frankly. They unanimously agreed to do the job the same night. It was Sonya’s request! "I’ll strangle him to-night before they lock the cells,” one of them suggested. "Nonsense,” replied E. "You would only be caught and there’ll be an investigation. Sonya wouldn’t like that.” "If we kill him with a knife, there’ll be an investigation just the same!” But E. had another plan and he whispered it to his friends. "Marvellous!” they agreed and returned to their cells. All cells in the prison are locked for the night. At five o’clock in the morning, they are unlocked again and the prisoners prepare themselves for breakfast before going to work. Andro Pardov was sharing a cell with four other men. A few minutes after five, the following morning, all four left the cell and Pardov remained alone. Immediately, two men entered the cell. They were E’s 53 [pageend55]two friends. They did not speak but Andro saw from the expression on their faces that he had cause to fear them. “Get up!” one of them ordered, for he was still in bed. “What’s happened?” he asked. “Get up!” He got up. Then the second man suddenly cracked him on the jaw with all his might, and he fell to the floor uncounscious. “Good shot!” the first man said. “Now let’s finish the job quickly.” The second man took Andro from the floor and raised him on to his shoulders. “Damned heavy,” he murmured. “Go on, try again !” They approached the window of the cell. It was built high up in the wall. The first man dragged one of the beds to the window and then helped his friend to climb on to it, with Andro’s body on his back. He jumped on to the bed beside him and, between them, they hoisted the unconscious body slowly and carefully towards the window. It had been opened during the night and soon Andro’s chin was parallel with the sill. “If they don’t see him, we’re done for.” They raised Andro’s head still higher. From outside, it would look as though he were climbing up to look out through the iron bars. Bang ! Bang ! Bang ! Three shots crashed through the early morning air, and the two men dropped Andro’s body back on to the bed. “We must make sure he’s dead.” “He’s dead all right! Look at the blood on his head.” In less than a minute they had left the cell. “All right,” they whispered to the three men who were standing guard outside the door. And all five 54 [pageend56]calmly and silently went to the wash-room to prepare for breakfast and work. Immediately after breakfast, the prison bell rang. Roll call! All prisoners were lined up in the big corridor and the Chief of the Prison himself came and delivered a short address: “Every one of you knows that it’s absolutely forbidden to look out of the windows and to climb up to the window-sills. The guard outside have orders to shoot at sight and without any warning, at anyone looking through a window. Five months ago’, we had an accident and one of you was killed. To-day, another one of you, Pardov, climbed up to his window-sill and he was shot. I myself went to his cell five minutes after the accident. It was quite obvious how it happened : the man had even put one of the beds near the window in order to reach it more easily. He is dead. I warn you once again that the guards outside have definite instructions. I repeat, unless any of you want to commit suicide, there is absolutely no point in trying to climb up to the windows of your cells. You will be shot. That is all. Now you may go to your work!” When the Chief of the Prison had left, the prisoners assembled in groups to discuss the incident. Some went to Andro’s cell, but the body had already been removed. There were only splashes of blood on the bed and on the floor. In half an hour most of the prisoners left for work and, by lunch-time, the incident was almost forgotten. The dead man was a newcomer; no one knew him well, and in any case he had not been popular. After lunch E. received a short note from the Political Department. He recognised the handwriting: it was Sonya’s. Before destroying it, he showed it to his friends. It ran as follows: “Well done! Thank you!” 55 [pageend57]"Amazing woman!’’ was E.’s only comment. "Now I understand why all those fellows from the Workers’ Union were so crazy about her.” "She’s bom to command,” remarked one of E.’s friends. "I wonder who that fellow was?” "I have no idea,” E. replied. “Such is Sonya’s technique. She orders and the others obey. No questions are asked. . . .” “That means we’ll never know. . . .” “No. We shall never know.” E. was right; they never knew that Andro Pardov was one of the men who> had rushed into Sonya’s house that evening in 1923. She had never forgotten the night when she saw her father for the last time. DRAGOMIR NENOFF THE PLAGUE Once, when I was ten years old, I was visiting my grandfather in Timovo. A week before Easter every year, we had a general cleaning. This was also the time for re-tinning all the copper pots and pans. Mango, the gypsy tinker, came early in the morning, and started his charcoal fire in one corner of the backyard. He was helped by his wife and five children. “Look Mango, you gypsy, last year you did a poor job. The tin wore off too soon,” my grandfather said, picking up some of the pots where the red copper showed through. “Did you want to poison us?” On a day like this my grandfather, Deddo Gueorgui, stayed home from his shop. He considered the tinning 56 [pageend58]too important to let Mango work alone. Besides, he liked to invite Mang and his family to a Lenten dinner of anchovies, olives, and lentil soup outdoors under the ancient twisted grapevine that shaded the arbor. While all of us were eating, Deddo Gueorgui would hear some of the latest gossip Mango collected as he worked around the countryside. “Where is the garlic?” Deddo Gueorgui asked after I said grace. “You know garlic is my life,” and started his dinner. “Now, Mango, what was this story being spread about what happened at the Monastery last fall? Is it true?” “Of course it’s true, Deddo Gueorgui. I saw it with my own eyes.” “You really saw the fire. It was a big one, was it?” “Very big, Deddo Gueorgui, very big. And I saw some of those who were trying to escape from the pit. Just as they reached the edge, the fire caught them and sent them back to the bottom.” “Were there any women?” “Yes, there were women crying, screaming. It was still dark early in the morning. I was tinning the copper pans at the Monastery. They put me to work close to the pit. I won’t ever work there again, believe me. I ran away and left everything behind.” Everyone around the table was quiet. I could see that Deddo Gueorgui was trying to decide whether Mango was making up the story. My grandmother put her hand on the trembling arm of Mango’s wife, Aishay. “Fire! That must have been horrible. They must have been burned to ashes,” Deddo Gueorgui said and from his glass he dropped the homemade wine on the ground in the form of a Cross. “God forgive them. God forgive the dead.” As he spoke, all of us crossed ourselves. Tirnovo is in the middle of the Balkan Peninsula. 57 [pageend59]Built on many levels up and down two high hills surrounded at the bottom by the river Yantra which long ago carved out a deep uncompleted figure eight, the town is a natural fortress. As the ancient capital of the Bolgars in the first part of the Sixth Century, Tirnovo was destroyed many times by wars, fires, earthquakes, and plagues. But it was always rebuilt, more beautiful than ever. My grandfather’s house was in the oldest part of the town. Across from it I could see the ruins of Tsarevets Castle, and at the left on the other side of the river was Trapezitsa, the residential quarter for the aristocratic Boyars. Crusader armies from the West, Tartar hordes from the North, and Byzantine legions from the South once had bloody rendez-vous here. Tirnovo to me was the source of perpetual romance and many stories each of which was, of course, a true one. I loved my grandfather very much, and I was proud of him, too. I liked his flowing white moustache that I played with when I was smaller. I liked his strength; he was never sick in his life. As a matter of fact, he died in perfect health at ninety-eight. One night he went to sleep in his bed and never woke up again. But, most of all, I liked the clear things he said, convincing and powerful. He animated the telling of episodes of his life in such a way that those who listened cried or laughed in just the right places. He was a wonderful man to have for a grandfather, admired and respected in the entire region. So free and tolerant, he seemed not to fear anything in the world,—except perhaps one thing which was not exactly clear to me at first. “God forgive the dead,” my grandfather repeated, turning back to the table. On Saturday after Good Friday, after the long fast in the old Orthodox style, Deddo Gueorgui started cal58 [pageend60]ling us long before the sun rose, ready to start our Easter pilgrimage to Preobrajenski Monastery. His small cart had been waiting in the backyard since the day before. “Come on, Tchotcho! Come on! We are late. Evdokia, where are you?” I don’t know why Deddo Gueorgui chose to call me Tchotcho,—which means an agile and strong boy,—but according to Timovo custom everybody had an extra nickname. I certainly was his favorite, because some of the nicknames he gave my cousins were really unpleasant like Kletcho, the boy who is as thin as a toothpick. I ran out to watch him arranging the scarlet and blue ribbons on the big white horse that was his special pride. “Where is your Grandma? Go and pull her out! Quick, quick ! What in the hell is she doing in there ? Does she want to go to the Monastery or not?” I went to help Grandma with the baskets of provisions,—'Easter eggs, fruit, pastrama, sweet homemade bread for the season. “Don’t take that basket!” she ordered sharply. “The eggs are in there. Be careful, don’t break them. Remember how you broke the jar of cherry preserves.” The day I dropped that jar and sweet sticky cherries spread over the kitchen floor, she pulled a thin strong switch from behind the door. “I’ll show you how to behave!” she cried and lifted the switch. I got angry, tried to catch it and fell on my face. She managed to give me one blow but I'jumped up, grabbed the stick and broke it to pieces. At this point she and I both noticed Deddo Gueorgui in the doorway. He winked at me and smiled in a friendly way. Evdokia ran to her room and cried all evening but 59 [pageend61]never tried to punish me again. She was my grandfather’s second wife. Now Grandma Evdokia finally appeared on the doorstep, all graciousness in her best clothes, her purse as usual in her left hand, a true Tirnovo lady. Untroubled by Grandpa’s temper, she spoke to him. “Gueorgui, would you come to drink your coffee and take the gifts for the Monastery? Tchotcho can’t carry them.” After he had loaded the cart, Deddo Gueorgui lifted Grandma and planted her lightly on the cushion of the back seat; then he placed me beside him in the front. He picked up the reins and we started on our long journey. When I think of the distance and the means of transportation, I laugh. Preobrajenski Monastery, situated on a great rock above the river Yantra, is about twelve miles from Tirnovo. It took us nearly all day to reach it. We descended slowly downhill. The strong horse, who knew every stone, stepped gracefully like a show horse, choosing each spot before putting down a foot. We reached Bajdarluka, the main square, and passed the Monkey House, a jewel of the Seventeenth Century with a stone medallion of a monkey set over the door, and finally reached the main street. At the old bridge, which once could be drawn up to guard the Castle we clung to the southwest road, parallel to the river. “Look here, Tchotcho. This is Trapezitsa district,” Grandfather said, as if I didn’t know it. “You see the palaces of Ivanko, Kubadin, and Stratsi- mir, such distinguished Boyars.” We saw the remains of fine mosaic floors and the walls all in ruins. Deddo Gueorgui nodded his head wisely. “This is the result of wars, fires, and plagues. Yes, plague. . . .” he was silent and looked about him. “Do you see that meadow under the cliff? At the time 60 [pageend62]of the Plague it was covered with the dead. During the night when the vampires started flying around, the people got frightened. Dike sheep they ran about screaming in the dark until they fell off the cliff.” Suddenly his face was full of sorrow. I shivered with fear when we drew near the high cliff. What was the Plague really ? I had heard many horrible tales and they all seemed connected with animals like bats, snakes, rats and turtles. Yet I was torn two ways. One moment I was afraid, the next moment I was curious to know what the Plague was. How could a bat have such power? Playing in the old Castle I had caught five or six of them already. “You don’t need to be afraid,” said Deddo Gueorgui, putting his arm around my shoulders. “It’s over now. Yes, the Plague is over. It will never come back, never.” But he spoke in a different voice. This was not the voice full of determination which had created such a sense of security in our family for so long. “Deddo, do you really think there are vampires?” “Vampires. . . . h-m-m. ... to tell you frankly, I don’t know.” “But you told me that vampires brought the Plague to Tirnovo.” “Well,—they say so, but nobody knew where they came from.” “Tell me, did you ever see a vampire?” “Of course I did, during the Plague. I saw their shadows as they flew down the street in the night. They were big, ugly, and cruel. Sometimes they hid in one of the sheds behind Rumiana’s house.” This news was a great shock to me because Rumiana was one of my special friends, only eight years old with a face like a small angel. She was a little taller than other girls her age and naturally graceful. 61 [pageend63]“Rumiana, what would you like to be when you grow up?” “A doctor,” she answered simply. “I want to help sick people, to cure their diseases.” She threw back her head to shake her hair into place. Then she lifted a shoulder, imitating the midwife Sophia next door. Her big house was built in the old Bulgarian style on a terrace below ours behind a high wall with a heavy gate of iron-studded wood. An ordinary-sized door opened in one half for everyday use. The house was stone and wood, perching like a castle over the river. From our balcony I could look down and watch Rumiana playing in her big courtyard where I often played too with her and other kids our age. Once we were alone at the shed where her family kept dry wood for fuel. Rumiana, jumping around, caught her leg between two logs not yet cut up for firewood. She was struggling to free herself when I rushed over and moved one of the logs. I put my arms around her to pull her out. Her warm body was shivering. Then I suddenly kissed her and she ran away, red-faced and confused. I tried to imagine in what corner of the fuel shed those vampire bats could have hidden themselves. Now Deddo Gueorgui stopped the horse as we approached the river. He turned to his left toward an old stone church and in holy concentration slowly made a large sign of the cross upon his chest. Grandma at the back was crossing herself rapidly without any concentration at all. We were in front of one of the oldest shrines in the country, perhaps one of the oldest Christian churches in the Balkan Peninsula. Grandpa read the inscription carved on a flat stone above the door. “In the summer of 6738 (1230) I, Ivan Assen, Tzar and Ruler of the Bolgars .... built this sacred church and adorned it with paintings in the name of the Forty Martyrs with whose aid .... I routed 62 [pageend64]the Byzantine Army, captured Teodor Commen and all his Boyars . . . .” Deddo Gueorgui made a second elaborate sign of the cross, shook the reins and we went on our way. Preobra- jenski Monastery, built early in the Eleventh Century on a high rocky hill above the river, was still three hours away. We approached the tents of dark brown felt of the gypsy’s camp. It was built between the road and the river on the outskirts of the town. Here and there were piles of handmade baskets and wood for carving. It was quiet, the gypsies were still sleeping. Only an old woman, the fortune teller, was sitting by her fire smoking her clay pipe. As we passed the last tents, we saw the gypsies’ famous big brown bear fastened to a tree by a chain that ended in a ring in his nose. Deddo Gueorgui whipped up the horse which had been walking as we passed the gypsy camp, and we rattled behind his trotting for a few miles. When we reached the climbing road to the Monastery, we found ourselves in a beautiful grove of linden trees in full blossom. A slight breeze moved the linden flowers and leaves and created a haze of pale yellow cloud, as if the air were being powdered with fragrance. I can still smell the fine aroma of linden which gave me then the impression that we were entering into heaven itself. The winding rocky trail became sharper and sharper until we reached the old fountain built by King Kaloyan after he left his throne to spend his last days in monastic retreat. At least twenty feet of red granite backed the ten basins set side by side in a semi-circle which caught the clear water gushing day and night through three openings from the spring in the natural rock behind. It was surrounded by the linden trees and approached by a carpet of grass thick with wild strawberries. The fresh morning air and the fragrance of the trees made me feel light enough to fly. 63 [pageend65]“Stop, stop, Beltcho! We have to rest a little before you take the last and hardest part,” Deddo Gueorgui pulled in the horse. I jumped from the cart and went to drink some water. Deddo alighted and loosened the horse. Grandma who had fasted the whole week did not move from her place. Many other carts coming up the hill now began stopping here also. Deddo talked and joked with old friends. It is strange to think of those times when everyone seemed to be friends. A carriage drawn by three horses came up. It was full of young people singing at the tops of their voices. The people in this part of the country are always singing. The music of the town was choirs of voices and small orchestras of mandolins and guitars, Tirnovo was with justification considered the most romantic town in the country and I don’t believe anyone could ever change it. The young people jumped from their carriage still singing and playing around. Some washed the dust off their faces, others drank water, but all approached Deddo Gueorgui and greeted him with a respectful smile. He in his stately manner said a few pleasant words to everybody. I was proud of Grandpa. He finally brought Beltcho to the horse-trough. That meant that soon we should start on the last stage of our journey. We left the fountain first and led the long caravan of more than fifty carts and carriages loaded with people who were going to get purification for their souls. This was my first experience of the Orthodox Sobornost, the spiritual reunion of the congregations, so well described by Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. When we neared the Monastery, all the people behind us stopped their singing and I could hear the breathing of the horses. I turned my head and saw the faces become serious and almost mystical at the moment we passed through the huge gates and arrived in the court64 [pageend66]yard. All around us were the handsome buildings of the Monastery, their walls boldly decorated with pale blue and yellow figures and designs and with high wooden balconies dark with age. The Romanesque church showed traces of centuries of change. The main monastery building was rebuilt in 1825 after the destruction of the original by the Ottoman police because the monastery served in those days not only as a center of worship but also as one for liberation forces and secret schools. Deep below the high hill the river Yantra ran noisily toward her destination, the Danube. “Tchotcho, take some of the baskets and go up to that room at the corner there with your Grandma.” I went on ahead of her to see the room. It was big with a wooden bed stretching from one side to the other covered with hard mattresses and hard homemade pillows. It was plain that we would have to share the room with other pilgrims. An old monk came in to greet us and to explain some of the rules. Since we were “first come” we were “first served.” He gave us clean blankets but no sheets and let us choose three places for night near the window. While we were arranging our things in one corner, a second family came in. I went down to help Deddo who was leading the horse to an old stable. I slipped into the church for a minute. It was dark with little rays of sunlight penetrating here and there through the window slits, illuminating the golden Byzantine icons fixed on the iconostasis. There was magnificent carving on the beams and altar, and beautiful frescos on the walls. One fresco had a yellow and blue wheel with four points representing birth, youth, middle age, and the last pointing down to the abyss of death. The smell of incense mixed sharply with the odors of old wood and paint as I approached the altar. But even while assimilating some of this mystical atmosphere, 65 [pageend67]I was preoccupied with ideas about the Plague. What was this power which scared everybody? I lifted my head and saw the compassionate face of St. Andrus tenderly looking at me from his miraculous icon. I spoke to him in my thoughts, “Why couldn’t you save those people, you who have caused so many miracles?” and left the church. “Tchotcho, Tchotcho,” Deddo Gueorgui was calling, “you shouldn’t go to church now. We have to visit the Egoumen first.” He took me to the building where the monks lived, where women were not allowed to enter. We walked through a hall beside the refectory furnished with long benches and tables. Everything was modestly arranged and the wood was freshly scrubbed. We climbed to the second floor, to the private apartment of the Egoumen. Many pots of flowers were blooming along the balcony. A very thin old monk with a long white beard and a cane in his hand opened the door. “God bless you, Deddo Gueorgui,” he said in a calm but feeble voice. “With God’s will we have survived to see each other this year. Welcome.” “Good-day, Otets Partenie. I am glad to see you in good health. How are you? For as long as I can remember, you have always looked exactly the same. Even during the time of the Plague you were old. I don’t dare ask how old you are. How are things here?” “Thank God, everything is fine. We are getting more honey this year than last. Some new people are coming, others are going. Yes, I remember those horrible days of the Plague. Thousands of people from the town ran here looking for safety and salvation. I remember your poor mother too, God forgive her.” The two old men started on their usual subject. The Egoumen who was considered a genuine Holy Man always insisted that only a miracle of God had saved 66 [pageend68]those who had not died. I knew that during the Plague Deddo Gueorgui lost his mother. It almost devastated the town. The image of thousands dead, the tragedy of those who survived one day but were caught the next, often returned to him. One of the peasant maids had taken him to her village somewhere in the mountain where the only thing that saved his life, he was convinced, was garlic. “This must be your grandson?” “Yes, this is Tchotcho and I am very proud of him. He is a real fighter. You know his mother. She came here with us last year.” “Oh yes, oh yes. I know all your children, but they don’t come up here any more.” “Well, they’re getting modern,” said Deddo Gueorgui nonchalantly, “and, to be truthful,” he went on, “one of the main reasons I keep coming every year is to see you. You know I don’t like many of your kind. Look at Father Tarapontie, for instance. Is he a priest or a drunkard? Look at Serafime who extorts money from the poor and then spends it at Bonio’s tavern. How could one approve of such examples of the clergy ? But you, you are different. I can respect you.” “Gueorgui, did you ever find the grave of your mother?” asked the monk, taking no notice of Deddo’s remarks. “No, never. Now after searching so many years, I’ve given up.” “I still repeat, only God’s mercy saved the rest of us,” said the Holy Man. “Of course, the lime helped, and the garlic, too!” insisted Deddo Gueorgui. I turned my head and saw a large bunch of garlic hanging over the door beside the Cross. I asked myself why the devil he needed garlic if he believed in miracles. I listened to these two talk about the Plague for 67 [pageend69]almost an hour. I already knew that my grandfather was not fond of priests although he was a deeply religious man. I began to realize that he did not make these pilgrimages to' this particular Monastery every year only for the sake of his soul. We left the Egoumen and took a path toward a rich meadow outside the Monastery where I counted more than a hundred light blue beehives, arranged in orderly rows. We crossed the meadow and reached a big pit with the remains of a huge fire at the bottom. Deddo Gueorgui stood silently at the edge of the deep pit, his face paler than I ever saw it before. I did not dare say a word. “Maybe she is here, who knows,” he murmured. “Some of our people said Father brought her here to be safe, but I could never find out the truth. You know, down in this pit are the bones of hundreds who died of the Plague. Their bodies were thrown in and covered with lime and earth. They still spread lime at least once a year.” Grandpa sat on a stone and stared into the pit as if he wanted to see the face of his mother. He was only five when the Plague carried her off. I moved around the edge of the pit and looked hard at the bottom too. Suddenly I began trembling. I saw a yellow spot moving. “Deddo, Deddo, look! Something is moving down there,” and I ran around to the lower side where I could climb down. “Stop, stop! For heaven’s sake don’t go down ! It’s dangerous! ’ ’ “But there is something moving down there. I want to find out what it is.” Foolish as it may seem, I had the idea that I could find a clue to the mystery of my great-grandmother. I had scrambled halfway down. Deddo Gueorgui ran after me in panic and pulled me back. 68 [pageend70]“Look, son, one cannot joke about this. It is dangerous, it is very dangerous. You know the Plague is still down there. No one ever goes down,” he said, “no one, you understand?” “But there is something moving down there, can’t you see?” “Yes, I can see that it’s a big turtle. That is the very Plague. Leave it alone.” Slowly a yellow and black turtle came out of a pile of rubbish into the clear. I was astonished at its size. It was almost twenty inches in diameter. “But how could a turtle be alive if the Plague is down there ?” I asked. “Well, who knows, but this must be an old one,” he answered in a firmer voice. “Let’s go. I don’t like this place and I don’t know why every time I come I spend hours. Let’s go.” Grandma was ready for the midnight mass which would continue far into the night. She was prepared to take Communion. “You were at that place again, weren’t you? I knew. I looked everywhere and could not find you. Can’t you forget that nasty pit once and for all ? What’s the use of coming here to this holy place if your mind is only at the pit?” Deddo Gueorgui listened to her mild scolding and did not answer. I was sorry for him. A healthy man, a former revolutionary who had fought with the Cossacks in 1878 to liberate our homeland, he was helpless and afraid when he brooded over his memories of the Plague. With this idea in my mind I walked to the church with Grandpa and Grandma. I could see the monks entering two by two. The bells were ringing with a mournful sound. It was the dark night before the Resurrection. Worshippers were flooding the little church. Deddo Gueorgui walked to the front, to the place re69 [pageend71]served for him on a wooden seat with arms like a throne. Grandma took another next to his. A deacon was reading the Psalms while the choir sang the Responses. Behind Grandpa’s seat I saw a case full of small wax candle, ends left over from those lit by worshippers before the icons for the souls of the dead. I moved close to the case which which in shadow. Looking around, I grabbed as many as I could and stuffed my pockets with them. I whispered to Deddo that I had to go out for a while and pushed my way through the crowds. I climbed up to our room and took the matches next to the oil lamp and ran out through the darkness toward the pit. I had no definite plan in my mind. The path was rocky and I fell twice before I arrived at the side where it was easy to' climb down to the bottom. Once there, I lighted a candle and started to descend. Would the turtle be in the same place? Would I have enough pieces of candle to find it? Finally I reached the bottom. Pieces of charcoal crumbled underneath my feet. It was very dark and the light of my candle end scarcely illuminated a square yard around me. Moving slowly I stepped on something round. Poking with my feet I discovered a human skull. It wasn’t pleasant, but I was too busy looking for the turtle to think of much else. I turned around with my light which was fast burning down when something else cracked ominously. I twisted three candle ends together and made a better light. The cracking came from more human bones piled one over the other. My body began to prickle all over. Was I afraid ? But I was too intent on finding the turtle which to me was the embodiment of the Plague. I had to catch it and finish off the legends of the Plague once and for all. But the cracking and scraping of the bones made me apprehensive. I tried to hurry over them. The turtle was not in the place where I saw it three hours before. Suddenly 70 [pageend72]I sank almost to my waist in loose earth and bones. The candle dropped from my hand and went out. In the complete darkness I felt two gentle arms slowly embracing me. Then I saw a woman in a white tunic rising before me, surrounded by a soft light. She looked infinitely sweet and young. She spoke softly and clearly, “Don’t be afraid, son, I’ll help you find your turtle.” Spmehow I knew her to be my great-grandmother. I asked without astonishment, “What shall I tell Deddo Gueorgui ?” yTell him he must stop thinking about the Plague and live his life. Plagues come and go,” she said and disappeared. I pulled myself out of the hole which I made, lit another candle end and walked on. I was getting impatient when I came upon a big rusty can and kicked at it. There was the turtle underneath, unmoving. Perhaps it was asleep. I put it under one arm and looked for the way out of the pit. I discovered that I was way over on the opposite side which meant another nasty walk over the bones again. However, my mood had changed and while I was frightened I was also proud that I had captured the Plague, this same Plague that terrified even my heroic grandfather. I stepped slowly over the bones and then had another horrible idea. Suppose I should accidentally break the bones of my lovely greatgrandmother ? I tried to' crawl, but soon gave up because my hands and knees got covered with small splinters and I was in danger of dropping the turtle. At last I reached the place to climb out and began the ascent without much difficulty. When I was about halfway up I discovered I needed to use both my arms. Without thinking, I stretched them out and lost the turtle and my light. I had to slide back. Then with more care I slowly reached the top of the pit. I moved in the dark wondering what to do with this dangerous Plague. Ha71 [pageend73]ving no other hiding place for it, I shut the turtle into one of the empty food baskets and hid it under the hay on my grandfather’s cart. I went back to the church and stood beside Deddo Gueorgui. “Where have you been for heaven’s sake? Look at your face and your clothes. They are all dirty,” he whispered in my ear. I sneaked out of the church once more and washed my face and hands in the Monastery fountain. Just as I went back the priest announced, “Christ is risen.” The choir burst into a glorious Alleluia and the bells rang out in wild joy. It’s all over at last, I thought. Now we could go back to town verj’ soon. People poured happily into the courtyard exchanging Easter eggs and sweet Easter bread. Groups of young people organized their choirs and played their mandolins and guitars for the rest of the night. We did not sleep more than two hours. When we prepared for going home Deddo Gueorgui was cheerful again, whistling and humming his old songs. “So, Tchotcho. I hope you liked our trip.” Grandpa said as I climbed to the seat beside him. “When we get back, tell them all about the Monastery but don’t say anything about the pit. That’s just between us, between men. Women shouldn’t know our secret; they wouldn’t understand.” “Sure, Deddo, but as men I think we shouldn’t be scared of the Plague any more,” I answered, trying to sound like a man. We arrived in Tirnovo early in the evening. I jumped from the cart to open the gate. “Sto-op, Beltcho-o-o, good boy, good boy.” Deddo Gueorgui unharnessed the horse, rubbed him down carefully, and stabled him. I helped Grandma unload the cart and took charge of the basket with the turtle. 72 [pageend74]Where should I keep it? Quickly I carried the basket to the cellar and hid it behind a wine barrel. When I started undressing in my room, lots of candle lends clattered on the floor. I looked across the balcony Í ward Rumiana’s house. As usual at this time in the ening there were guests on her porch but she was not be seen. I slept like a log all night. Early the next day morning I went to see my pals. I told them that I had captured the Plague in the Monastery pit but couldn’t show it to them until Deddo Gueorgui went to his shop. They were dying of curiosity. Eater in the day I exhibited the turtle. They were surprised but not frightened in spite of the fact that they were all familiar with many scary stories about the Plague. Just before supper I got the idea of what to do with the turtle. After we ate, I went as usual to listen to the choir singing in the square next to Rumiana’s house. Her parents and other grown-ups were on their terrace talking. Grandpa and Grandma were there too. Grandpa was telling about the trip to the Monastery. It was a dark, quiet evening. I went around the corner of our house and glued pieces of candles to the turtle’s back while my friend Detcho held on to it. Then I lighted the candles, softly opened the door in the gate of Rumiana’s house behind the walls, and let the turtle walk in. We climbed the wall and watched the majestic march of the big turtle with fifty or more little lights on its back. I don’t know how much I was excited by this scene in the dark night, but when the turtle was halfway to the terrace, I called out in a shaking voice : “The Plague! The Plague is coming!” Complete panic possessed the grownups. The women screamed, the men hollered as if at a mad dog, and everybody started running through the back door of 73 [pageend75]the neighboring house. I think at this moment I got scared too, not so much of the Plague I had produced as of the panic I had created. Detcho and I jumped down from the wall and started running away, forgetting all about the turtle. We ran to the upper part of the square from which we could observe what was happening. Suddenly we saw flames shooting from the shed where Rumiana’s family kept their dry wood. The flames rose higher and higher, and the old house caught fire, too. “Fire, fire fire!” We could hear cries everywhere. . . The next morning I stood before a young judge. He looked at me with a faint smile on his face. “Tell me all about this story, about the Plague. The whole town is excited. Who started the fire?” “Where is the boy ? Where is Tchotcho?” I heard the deep voice of Deddo Gueorgui bellow in the hall outside the courtroom. The door opened suddenly and Grandpa strode in. “Tchotcho, for heaven’s sake where have you been all night ? We couldn’t find you anywhere. Come on, let’s go home. Grandma is worried to death. Come on.” “Wait a minute, wait a minute, Deddo Gueorgui,” said the young judge. “Your grandson is under arrest. There was a big fire last night, a big fire, and it’s only luck that it wasn’t worse.” “Of course there was a fire. I know that better than you do. I saw with my own eyes how it started!” “What did you see?” asked the judge. “The Plague, of course, the Plague! It returned last night. It came into the yard the same way and went exactly to the same place. But now it is finished. All the vampires, all the plagues were finally burned out. Last night the Plague destroyed itself.” 74 [pageend76]I could see that the judge could hardly keep from bursting into laughter. Then he became serious again. “But there is a crime here and your grandson is involved in it.” “Crime! What crime?” asked Deddo Gueorgui in genuine astonishment. “Stoyane, you have studied for a long time. You have become judge in our town, but you don’t know anything about the Plague. How could you ? You weren’t even born at the time we had to fight it. I told you, and I repeat, it was the Plague which started the fire last night. If you don’t believe me, go and ask your father. He was there last night, with us. He saw it, too.” The young judge looked at us both and said, “I think it takes three generations to get rid of the fearful memory of a Plague.” Deddo Gueorgui took me by the arm and we left the court. I never could find out how many leva this cure cost him. 75 [pageend77]FORUM JOHANNES EDFELT PAIN IS THE GREATEST SCULPTOR Pain is the greatest sculptor, Greater than Phidias: Shaping from shadow and blood Monuments of regret.

Allwood and Carl Anderson) OSSIP KALENTER LEUTE IN PARMA Sonntagvormittags, in einem vornehm-altmodischen Café an der Piazza — dem Hauptplatz, um den im weiten Rechteck die öffentlichen Paläste Parmas stehen. Es ist die Stunde des Vermouths. Schwere Männer unterhalten sich, stehen, die feingeschliffenen Gläschen in der Hand, im Konditoreiraum, wo die Patisserie duftet. Schwere Männer sitzen rauchend nebenan im Salon. Aeltere Fussballertypen mit emilianisch runden Schädeln und kurzen runden Armen. Worüber unterhalten sie sich wohl, die Männer, die kühn und haudegenhaft aussehen, hart und nüchtern? Ich brauche keineswegs 77 [pageend79]die Ohren zu spitzen: ihre Rede geht offen und frei. Sie sprechen vom Glück. Nicht von der Fortuna, der leichten Göttin, die man im Spiel erobern kann, sondern von den Res secundae: den Dingen, die das Glück des Lebens ausmachen. In der Tat, ein philosophisches Gespräch! Man hätte es den sportlichen, massiven Männern nicht zugetraut. Und was nennen sie das Glück ? Worin besteht es für sie? Etwa in einem ansehnlichen Bankkonto oder in einem eleganten Wagen, einem Wagen, einem weit grösseren als dem bescheidenen Miniaturfahrzeug, das sie draussen vorm Café stehen haben? Besteht das Glück für sie überhaupt im Besitz? — Wenn man will: ja. Und was ist es, das sie besitzen möchten? “Eine treue Frau,” sagt der eine ruhig und ohne Aufhebens, “und eine Familie, die gesund ist, der es gut geht.” Die anderen stimmen ihm zu. Das ist das Glück. Es ist ein stendhalisch-holderlinisches Gespräch, das die schweren Männer im raucherfüllten Café-Salon führen. “Beglückt, wer, ruhig liebend ein frommes Weib, am eigenen Herd in friedlicher Heimat lebt,” sang Hölderlin. Und Stendhal, der Stadt Parma im Literarischen auf sehr persönliche Weise verbunden, schrieb in seinen melancholischen und gelangweilten Briefen aus Civitavecchia, wo er ästimiert war als französischer Konsul, aber alternd und einsam lebte : er bedaure, dass er nicht mit einer hübschen Frau verheiratet sei. Immer würde eines von seinen Kindern gerade ein wenig kränkeln, dann könnte er abends den Doktor holen, Herrn C***, der ihn zerstreuen würde. Statt dessen verbringe er seine Abende nur mit inhaltlosem Aufs-Meer- Hinausblicken. . . So weit der einsame Herr von Stendhal, der für einen Abenteurer galt. Glückliche Männer von Parma, die ihr “ruhig liebend ein frommes Weib” am Vormittag im altmodischen 78 [pageend80]Café sitzt! Anhänger einer epikuräisch-humanen Lebensauffassung, Nicht-Angeber, mit beiden Beinen fest im einfachen Leben stehend. . . Im allgemeinen sind die Männer von Parma hart und würzig —• wie ihr berühmter Käse, der spröde, goldkörnige Parmesan. Und gerieben, wie dieser, sind sie zuweilen auch. Man kann nicht behaupten, dass sie Naivlinge seien. Doch überwiegt ihr Sinn für das Redliche und Gerade bei weitem ihre Geriebenheit. Und in gewissem Sinne auch ihren Witz, der nicht spitz ist wie der toscanische, nicht derb wie der römische, sondern harmlos, ein wenig an den bitteren Realitäten vorbeizielend, und eher sich selbst als andere verspottend. Am Abend, in den kleinen Bars unter dem ehrwürdigen Uhrturm, steht und sitzt man lustig beisammen. Ein einfacher Mann mittleren Alters und kräftiger Statur bestellt Sekt, einen Gran Spumante, mit einer Anzahl Gläser und lädt ein, mit ihm zu trinken. Die er einlädt, wehren bescheiden ab: es sei zu teuer, er solle sich nicht solche Ausgaben machen. “Tausend Lire!” (7 Franken) ruft er. “Was ist das schon? Das ist nicht viel. Ich bin aus einer guten Familie. Mein Vater trug immer einen Hut.” Er selbst trägt keinen. Alles lacht, und er fährt fort, sich und seine grosszügige Einladung zu ironisieren. Ein gutgekleideter Gast weigert sich besonders intensiv, mitzutun. Er schiebt das Glas zur Seite und sagt, er sei nervös. Sekt mache ihn noch nervöser. “Du bist nervös, weil du Journalist bist,” ruft der Spendable und klopft ihm auf die Schulter. Das ist nun auch wieder kein richtiger Witz, löst aber schallende Heiterkeit aus. Sicherlich wissen die Eingeweihten, in79 [pageend81]wiefern dieser Journalist Grund hat, heute — oder überhaupt — nervös zu sein. Aber lassen wir das! Die Kommentierung von Witzen ist die Leidenschaft der Humorlosen. Die Männer von Parma trinken ihren weissen Spumante, der aus dem Piemont kommt, und als wäre nichts geschehen, gehen sie auseinander. Fast wortlos. Nicht laut. Wie in allen Städten der Emilia liegt auch in Parma das renommierte und zugleich verschwiegende Esslokal in einem verwinkelten Gässchen, unauffindbar für Orts- Unkundige, und selbst für noch so kleine Vehikel ohne Parkiermöglichkeit. Innen ist es kahl und grell erleuchtet. Der junge Wirt, der in weisser Kellnerjacke empfängt, ist reizend und lispelt ein wenig. Man isst als Vorspeise Tortelli di erbette, kräutergefüllte kleine Teigpolster, mit zerlassener Butter übergossen, eine Spezialität Parmas, und trinkt schäumenden lila-roten Lambrusco dazu, den Wein der Emilia, der spät geerntet wird, wenn schon die vorwinterlichen Nebel vom Po aufsteigen und sich über das flache Rebland legen. Und kehrt man wieder bei ihm ein — nach zwei Tagen oder zwei Jahren — ist der junge Wirt noch reizender, und er lispelt noch herziger und streicht, ehe er die Rechnung bringt, die letzten zwei, drei Posten kurzerhand weg, wie man es für “alte Kunden” immer tut. Es kommen gute Leute zum Essen, solide Leute: Beamte, Advokaten, auch Bauern von draussen, die in der Stadt etwas zu erledigen haben. Man unterhält sich mit dem Wirt. Man kann sich bei ihm wohl informieren: über Parma, und über Gott und die Welt. Was die Welt betrifft, so ist er einmal, wenn ich komme, sehr mit ihr im Einklang, infolge der gerade neuesten astro80 [pageend82]nautischen Meldungen. Er ist froh, dass nach Gagarin und Titov schliesslich auch Glenn die Erde mehrmals im Raumschiff umkreist hat. “Aber wir sind reichlich spät gekommen,” sagt er leise. Und mit “wir” meint er die Amerikaner. Was in Parma, das -— zu Recht oder Unrecht — als eine Hochburg des Kommunismus gilt, geradezu revolutionär wirkt, zumindest stark nonkonformistisch. “Eine Hochburg des Kommunismus, ach, ja,” sagt er achselzuckend auf meine Zwischenbemerkung. “Wie Parma ehedem eine Hochburg des Fascismus war. Sempře un baluardo. . . Die Deute von Parma übertreiben immer. Sehen Sie sich doch an, wie sie den Hut aufsetzen — falls sie überhaupt einen tragen. Wie sie ihre Zigaretten rauchen! Und vor allem: wie sie sie wegwerfen ! Radikal um des Radikalismus willen sind sie. Feuerköpfe! Und immer sind sie ‘dagegen’. Grundsätzlich ‘dagegen’ sind sie. Sie wären auch gegen den Kommunismus, wenn sie ihn hätten.” Die Worte des Wirtes aus der engen Gasse klingen mir noch im Ohr, wenn ich an einer Bus-Haltestelle am breiten Torrente Parma, dem Stadtfluss, der nur zu gewissen Zeiten im Jahr Wasser führt, einen Handzettel an einem' Leitungsmast kleben sehe : klein gedruckt, unterzeichnet von den Anarchisten. Sie erklären sich gegen die Antikommunisten, die Beschützer der Kirche seien, und gegen den Kommunismus, der den tyrannischen Bolschewismus mit sich bringe — und für die Freiheit. Für welche? Es gibt verschiedene Arten. Zwei von ihnen, die politische und die existenzielle Freiheit, sind den Parmesanern durch die Verfassung der Republik Italien garantiert. Und sie machen, wie man sieht, reichlich Gebrauch davon. 81 [pageend83]meme on se range et de ľ ambition qu’on a; en détail cependant, cela demande un examen plus attentif, car il y a un probléme du talent forcé qui ne concerne pas seulement les fines. On ne fait bien que ce qu’on fait avec aisance; et les ceuvres parfaites, en tons les domaines, se recon- naissent ä je ne sais quoi d’beureux, de souple, d’aéré. Nous demandons ä un danseur de ballet non seulement de réussir avec précision ses pas les plus difficiles, mais encore de n ous donner ľ impression que ses mouve- ments lui sout tout naturels et qu’il n’est pas soumis aux lois de la pesanteur. De meme, nous exigeons ďun écrivain que son style semble spoutané, comme si 1’expression juste lui était toujours venue du premier coup, jaillie du seul besoin de nous communiquer sa pensée. Nos peres savaient fort bien que cette ap- parente facilité n’est, le plus souvent, que le fruit ďun métier patiemment appris et qu’elle représente le juste équilibre entre les dons innés et 1’entraine- ment professionnel. Mais nous sortons d’une époque si éprise de spontanéité qu’elle a repoussé avec impatience l’idée du métier et de ľ effort, comme si toute élaboration ne pouvait que f äusser ľ accent de la vé- rité. De cette répugnance eile a tiré des théories; et dans les moeurs aussi bien qu’en art, eile n’a plus rien accepté qui ne fút ľ expression toute crue des tem- péraments. Apres les contraintes et I’usure nerveuse de quatre ans de guerre, il était excusable qu’on fut impatient de retrouver, en toutes choses, 1’expression du pur naturel. C’était le temps oů, bons derniers en Europe, nous venions de découvrir le freudisme. Quoi qu’on pense de ce systéme, il faut bien mettre ä son actif un certain nombre d’observations psychologiques trés pénétrantes, notamment sur la facilité avec laquelle un caractére peut étre dévié de sa ligne autonome. 84 [pageend84]Ces cas cliniques, alors trěs neufs, fournissaient des arguments captieux aux ennemis de toutes les disciplines un pen ardues, considérées comme autant d’at- tentants au libre développement de la personnalité. C’est alors qu’on a vu proliférer toutes sortes de doctrines pédagogiques, le jeu se substituait au travail et le caprice a la méthode, comme si une des grandes forces de ľ honíme d’action, n’était pas justement ď avoir appris a faire, quand il faut, des choses qui ne l’amusent pas. On aurait dit un retour a I’esprit de Rousseau, avec la meme défiiance envers la so- ciété, réputée incapable ď autre chose que de pervertir la saine nature. Les éditeurs se disputaient les confidences des gardens de vingt ans; ils y cherchaient les messages de la jeune génénation, comme si les col- légiens étaient porteurs ď une sagesse qui ne pouvait aller plus tard que se flétrissant. Ce qui se manifestait de famous diverses, c’est un meme doute quant a la valeur de toute construction, doute qui cachait, sous des prétextes de sincérité, une sorte de pessimisme fatigue. Il faut suivre sa pente, mais en la montant, a écrit André Gide. Dans son raccourci, la formule dit tout ce qu’il faut. Monter, mais trouver moyen de le faire sans quitter son propre chemin. Car le probléme est double, et la phobie qu’on a eue, durant 1’entre-deux- guerres, ä ľégard des contraintes ne doit pas main- tenant nous jeter dans la superstition que 1’effort suffit a tout. Un cimetiěre d’oeuvres mortes marque chaque siěcle de 1’histoire: laborieuses épopées auxquelles d’exquis poětes ont épuisé leurs forces, froides tra- gédies éerites selon les regies, toiles et miarbres ou de petits maitres se sont vainement courbaturés en tachant d’etre des Michel-Ange ou des Rubens. Jusqu’a ce malin de Voltaire qui s’est si naivement fourvoyé avec sa Henriade. Et noire Chabrier qui a perdu tant 85 [pageend85]ďannées á nous donner ď autre musique que celie que lui souffliait son joyeux génie! Probléme qui passe infiniment celui de l’art. Il in- téresse la vie de chacun; il se pose dans les moments critiques ou un peuple choisit sa voie. L’ivresse qui porte á penser que la volonté peut tout, réserve des lendemains redoutables. L’ogre, saisi de repentir, aura beau se faire arracher sa double denture, il ne deviendra jamais un parfait précepteur pour petits enfants. Qu’il cherche autre chose. Il y a une pente a monter, meme pour les ogres. Probléme de la con- naissiance de soi-meme, de ce qu’on peut exiger de ses forces, de ce qu’il serait présomptueux et sot d’entreprendre. Socrate n’a pa eu trop de toute sa vie pour coinmencer d’y voir un peu clair. DIPTYQUE Un hasard m’a fait rouvrir Amori et dolori sacrum. J’y ai relu La Mort de V emise. Quel sinistre embau- mement d’un spleen dans une suffocante parfumerie! Certes, on troupe au cours de ces pages de beaux échantillons de ces cadences langoureuses par les- quelles Barrés en remontre ä Chateaubriand, lentes volutes qui s’enflent, ondulent, retombent, avec des hesitations savantes et des chutes pámées. Cette musique plait, quelque instants, par ses accords subtile- ment altérés, par son chant qui semhle un theme de Tristan, aminci, étiré, féminisé sous un archet tzigane. Mais bientôt un malaise vous gagne. Tout cet appret trahit un trop visible effort pour mettre en branie une 86 [pageend86]A sensibilité débile, qui ne s’éveille que sous Faction ďétnanges excitants. “Cherchons plus avant des images plus funěbres et plus rares. . . Cette agónie pro- longée, voila le charme le plus fort de Venise pour me séduire.” En respirant “la mélancolie délicieuse de ces palais déshonorés”, en allant choisir pour sa reverie, “entre mille perieš malades”, telle église dé- laissée, en savourant ‘‘le tournant équivoque” ou les murs des palais “commencent leur decomposition”, Barres arrive ä se donner les quelques dixiemes de fievre physique, de paludisme imaginatif, qui lui per- mettent ďéchapper a un état ďindifférence ‘‘tout glacé de morne”. On ne songe pas ä lui reprocher d’avoir trouvé ä Venise, comme tant de glorieux prédécesseurs, une atmosphere favorable a son exaltation ď artiste; ce qui est pénible et devdent vite intolérable, c’est cette la- borieuse intoxication, chez un homme qui a derriere lui un Roman de VEnergie nationale et qui, ägé de 41 ans, doit etre en possession de touš ses moyens. Il a beau écrire: “Le centre secret des plaisirs, tons romanesques, que nous trouvons sur les lagunes, c’est que tant de beautés qui s’en vont ä la mort nous excitent á jouir de la vie”, on ne croit pas une minute a un gout de la vie qui a besoin de tels stimulants. Au reste, l’aveu est lá sans aucun fard: “De plus en plus, si je suis seul, je ne sais plus me sous- traire au roman vaporeux de la mort. Durant des jours et des semaines, un philtre d’insensibilité m’isole de la vie.” Il y a un air de déloyauté á s’emparer d’une telle confession pour éclairer une carriěre qui a eu de Faction sur toute une génération, et Fon ne doit pas oublier que plus ďun écrivain, plus d’un chef politique ont tiré leur force de leurs faiblesses memes, qu’ils s’efforqaient de surmonter. Mais ici 1’abandon 87 [pageend87]“aux puissances de la plus stérile mélancolie” est sa- vouré si complaisamment, mis en valeur avec une telle surenchěre de miěvrerie macabre, qu’on est forcé d’y voir tout autre chose qu’une faiblesse centre laquelle ľauteur se défend. Assurément, le désert intime, I’orgueilleux ennui de Barres livré au tete-á-téte avec lui-meme ne ľempecheront pas de publier des livres indemnes ďesthétisme et hantés par le souci de la grandeur nationale. Pendant quatre ians de guerre, il apportera au pays de beaux accents de réconfort. Il saura grouper autor de lui les amities les plus nobles. Mais quand on le voit revenir sans cesse au theme de “la terre et les morts”, chercher dans cette formule une sorte de sagesse définitive, on ne pent s’empecher de soupgonner, derriěre ce programme déja terrible- ment détourné de la vie, une secrete delectation dans le funěbre. Il lui faut bien de la supériorité d’esprit, il faut á son style bien de la hauteur, pour compenser ce que cet évangile de cimetiěre a de désespérant. Amori et dolori sacrum eut á son époque bien plus de retentissement que les N ourritures terrestres ď André Gride, destinées a une fortune plus lente, mais aut- rement prolongée. Pourtant ces deux livres sont com- me les symboles symétriques de deux tendances qui se sont opposées pendant le début du xxe siěcle. En face d’une littérature pauvre en joie vitale et qui regarde vers le passé plus que vers l’avenir, s’en dresse une autre, vivante, avide, novatrice, mais qui ne veut rien savoir de Phistoire et ďoů l’idée de la mort, avec tout ce qu’elle comporte de fidélité sentimentale et ďap- profondissement métaphysique, est presque absente. En méme temps que naissaient ces ceuvres libérantes, nous assistions, dans les moeurs, a Pexplosion ďun “vivre sa vie” qui poussaib en tout sens ses revendica- tions: nous voyons montér un culte de la jeunesse, ďune jeunesse a tout prix, qui semblait dénier toute 88 [pageend88]vialeur ä la maturitě, outlier les moissons qui “lasse- ront les faucilles” et les fruits qui “passeront la pro- messe des fleurs’ ’. Et certes, quand on sort de respirer des effluves de laguně ou Barres trouvait ses suspectes délices, on ne pent que saluer avec Soulagement le grand courant d’air frais qui est venu balayer ces miasmes. On mesure mieux ce qu’il y avait de lassitude, de courage galvanise, de sang bleu qui bat f ébrilement, dans la discipline barrésienne. Et 1’on pardonne sans trop de peine les exclusivités et les exces d’une reaction qui ouvrit maintes fenetres, quit- te á faire sauter les vitres de celieš qui résistaient. Mais il est temps de réconcilier en nous-memes les deux tendances. L’liomme ne pent étre ni un éternel adolescent, ni toujours penché sur des cendres. Le vieux qui fait ľévaporé est aussi déplaisiant que le précoce petit vieillard. Chaque age a son role a remp- lir, et chacun pent avoir sa beauté, s’il est vécu selon sa vérité propre. Plus que jamais il nous faut I’hom- me dans sa complete trajectoire, de son aurore a son couchant, dans toutes les lumiěres de son jour. Nous avons long-temps fait partie d’un monde qui semblait ignorer 1’enfance, qui n’y voyait qu’un état larvaire, a dépasser le plus vite possible, sans valeur par lui- meme et dont le bonheur n’importait pas au meme titre qu’un bonheur ď adulte. On a rendu ses droits a 1’enfant, on ľ a entouré de sollicitude, on lui a confié un dépôt d’immenses espoirs. Mais il y a trop de minceur dans cette juvénilité pour fournir la note fondamentale d’une époque. Il faut que ce volet du diptyque soit complété par ľ autre, celui que chargent les couleurs fortes et graves, y compris celie de la mort. Car la mort aussi fait partie de notre destin, la nôtre, et celie de nos proches, et I’universelle con- sommation de toute vie. N’eussions-nous aucune pen- sée d’outre-tombe, fussions nous tout entiers tournés 89 [pageend89]vers Faction présente, la mort n’en serait pas moins, pour Fhomme qui veut tenir en main touš ses pou- voirs, bien autre chose qu’un simple point final: eile est le poids décisif qu’il pent á tout moment jeter dans la balance et qui lui donne une force surhumaine lors- qu’il consent a la hasarder. Mais, assurément, cette mort-lä n’a rien á voir avec ce que Barres appelle, d’un mot assez scandaleusement frivole, un ‘‘roman vaporeux”. 90 [pageend90]ANNALS OF EXILE ALEXANDER LENARD A FEW WORDS ABOUT WINNIE-ILLE-PU Nothing more difficult, than to tell, when we met our best friends for the first time. I am quite sure, I did not meet Winnie ille-Pu (my companion in Gestapo-occupied Rome, in the forests of Brazil and now in the greenest valley of the world, in the State of Santa Catarina) as a child. I am quite sure about it; he was not yet born, when I went to school. We Hungarian children of the pre-Winnie era had quite a different bear, whom we did not love less, but he did not reach Winnie’s international fame, probably because his name was less suited for export. He was called Dörmögo Dömötör and his passion for honey and good food was absolutely Winnie-like. Thus Winnie was—if I am allowed to vary a theme from many biographies—the second bear in my life. We met in a dramatic moment. Even Nostradamus, the great prophet could not have foreseen the situation of 1943. The city of Rome was defended by its archenemy, the Germans, and attacked by its friends, the Anglo-Americans. General Kesselring sat in the belly of Mount Soracte, listened to his private Don Cossack choir and phoned into town, when he wanted hostages shot. Arabs in French uniforms, Afrikaans-speaking Bushmen, Texans and Californians fought their way from Naples up. Germans with emblems showing a jumping tiger and the inscription “Free India”, Italians in newly invented fascist uniforms roamed the town. Nobody was really happy about it. 91 [pageend91]Those least happy were the refugees, hidden in Rome without bread tickets and defended by nothing, but some forged document, (an employee of the Royal Hungarian Legation which represented no king at the court of the King of Italy, changed his policy after the Salerno landings and furnished such papers as a defence against head-hunting Gestapo-men)—and the British prisoners of war, freed on September the 8th and waiting for the 8th Army. Small wonder, if the least happy look for each other and finally meet. "They’ll come in a fortnight” we used to say to each other for nine long months, every time we met. Sometimes we met on a rooftop, waiting for the German patrols to finish their search downstairs. We had to live on something—and that’s where the Bear came in. We lived on teaching English. Everybody wanted to learn English. Some even promised a piece of bread and cheese for a lesson! There were no books to be had and we had to provide reading material for our pupils. My only English book happened to be Winnie the Pooh. On a hungry autumn day I got a new pupil. He spoke the melodious accent of Venice and said: "I know no English at all. We had it in school and you do not learn languages in schools. I do not want to hear about grammar. I don’t want to memorize words. But I want to know English well enough to talk to the Allied authorities, once they are in Rome.” "When do you think they’ll come?” I asked. “In a month or so.” I was relieved to find a pessimist and said: “Yes, Sir.” “You have to get a suitable book for me?” “Yes, Sir!” I said. “We start tomorrow at eight.” “Yes, Sir.” When he was gone I dived desperately into Winnie, 92 [pageend92]in order to see if I could use it. Soon I was relieved to see that I could. The book contains remarks about the present and expected weather, which—I felt—would be a perfect introduction to conversations with Allied officers,—although I was not quite sure about the American attitude in this matter. The book contained information about the transmission of messages—by air, by means of bottles or whistling in a particular way. It contained a plan, general staff-style, to capture something or someone by means of deception. An ambush was defined and an expedition explained. Finally there was the description of a banquet with an appropriate speech one might hold if honoured in a particular way. “Here is the book I chose among many,” I lied next morning at eight o’clock sharp. We started with the chapter on the heffalump, as I thought the conversation between Pooh and Piglet could prove useful in contacts with senior officers: “Piglet said: if you see what I mean, Pooh-—and Pooh said: it’s just what I think myself, Piglet—and Piglet said: but on the other hand, we must remember, and Pooh said: Quite true, Piglet, although I had forgotten it for moment. . We made speedy progress. When we reached the cunning trap, I already knew, that my pupil had come from Venice, sent by the underground, in order to obtain arms from the Allies. When Piglet saw the horrible heffalump I had already found a helper in improving my friend’s accent: Major Darry Mander, parachuted behind the lines to organize help for the hidden P.O.W.’s. The day Piglet took his bath, Monty left the command of the 8th Army. The Americans were stuck at Cas- sino, very much like Pooh in Rabbit’s door. My pupil’s E'nglish improved rapidly, although it was we, who were getting slenderer and slenderer. Eeyore’s balloon exploded and the island of Leros fell to the Germans. 93 [pageend93]Roo took a swim and Leipzig went up in flames. We lived interesting times and General Maelzer, the town commander as well as Gestapo chief Dollmann (to-day a happy citizen of Munich) tried to do their best to make life more exciting. Pooh had not yet received his pencil case, when my friend said: “No more lessons.” I objected: . . the irregular verbs! . . He said : “I think my English is good enough by now.” We met after the war, after the ending, which was happy indeed for those not shot or deported. My friend Pietro Ferraro had really contacted the Allies, had received the arms, was parachuted back to Venice, where he had led the insurrection and prevented the Germans from carrying out their sabotage plan. He was awarded the “gold medal”, the highest Italian military decoration. “I had no difficulty in treating with the British,” he said. “On the contrary. They complimented me upon my English.” Bears sometimes sleep for a season. Winnie disappeared from my life when I worked as consultant physician to the U.S. Claims Service and then (as there were no more civilians hit by U.S. Army vehicles) as Chief Anthropologist of the U.S. Graves Registration Service. The supply of “skeletal remains”—that was the official name for bones—lasted longer. But finally there were only the isolated ones, with a little round hole in the skull, found here and there in Italy. By 1950 the service folded up. I had passed my spare time, during the dark years, 94 [pageend94]in the great libraries of Rome, reading old Latin medical books and writing essays on the history of medicine. The best defence against fascist propaganda was listening daily at 6 to the B.B.C. and not touching printed matter unless it was 200 years old. Now I hoped to get a chair as professor of the History of Medicine in Hungary. The iron curtain, however, did not hinder news comming out and I decided to try my fortune elsewhere. The International Refugee Organisation offered to send me somewhere. Brazil looked big and green on the map. So I chose it. The IRO was a very big organisation, financed by the U.N. It is my conviction, that the U.N. would have saved a lot of money, if instead of organising they would have paid a first class ticket on a luxury liner to every refugee who asked for it. We were dumped into an old coal-freighter and marooned on an island in the Bay of Rio de Janeiro. This stinking spot of the globe got some publicity later on, when the Hungarian freedom fighters were landed there. They protested, there was a sort of mutiny, quite a few wanted to return to Hungary and some re-entered Great Britain illegally. They told the island story and were allowed to stay. As a pupil of the Stoic philosophers I had learned to divide the things into two groups: those which depend upon us and those which do not. To get away from the “Island of Flowers” as this tropical dustbin was called, did not depend upon me. So I waited. One day an agent from a lead mine appeared in quest of useful greenhorns. He wanted mechanics, miners, bricklayers and a doctor for the first-aid-station, willing to accept the pay and the title of a male nurse. Enthusiastically, I signed up. The lead mine had the advantage of not being surrounded by water. Otherwise it combined the dangers 95 [pageend95]and disadvantages of the virgin forest—such as spiders and snakes—with smoke, noise and filth of an old fashioned factory. A matter of fact description of the place would sound hackneyed ideological propaganda: “The workers suffered from lead poisoning, their children were so full of worms, that they kept creeping out from their mouths and noses and the Portuguese who owned the mine brought precious race horses for his stud from Argentine.” The superintendent played the role of the man, who wanted to help the workers, but could not. The French engineers suffered from the illusion of commanding an outpost of the foreign legion. Every gambler (and every refugee) knows, that Fate sets a limit to good luck. After that you lose. But there is an identical limit for bad luck. Once you have served your time of distress things change—and I had twelve years of utter misery on my account. Thus the tide turned. The French urgently needed a teacher for their daughters—somebody, who was willing to teach English, Latin, history and mathematics in French in the Brazilian forest—and that was my very humble self. Aside from working as surgeon, obstetrician, paediatrician and what not, I taught, and got even paid for it. My teaching experience was small and that’s where the Bear comes in again. I remembered what Winnie had done for freeing Venice and I started teaching English with Edward Bear coming—bump, bump, bump—downstairs. The young ladies liked the story and made rapid progress. They showed considerably less enthusiasm for the declention of Latin nouns. Lead-poisoning, burns, explosion wounds and the rest kept me busy. I had to save time and simplify my teaching. “I’ll translate Winnie into Latin and read a twin Bear,” I decided and started translating right away. I would not dare to say that the first version was any good, but it worked. Les demoiselles accepted wil96 [pageend96]lingly Cicero’s words, as long as they were pronounced by Eeyore. I carried on. One of the Frenchman, chief engineer Jean Watin, a brilliant humanist, who at the first occasion fled the place and flew to Paris, got so enthusiastic about the undertaking, that he sent me Quicherat’s priceless French-Latin dictionary. My idyllic existence came to an end, when I was fired. I had suggested to the lead-poisoned miners and smelters to get the hell out of the place and that was not was the superintendent wanted me to do. I left the mine with my dictionary and the fragment of the Latin Pooh and went to Säo Paulo, the hope-city of all European immigrants in Brazil. My bad luck seemed definitely gone. Soon I worked as assistant to the excellent Brazilian surgeon dr. Egberto Silva. He paved my way back from a refugee’s romantic misery into the agreeable, uninteresting existence of the average citizen. The only reminder of the difficult start was Pooh, the Bear. I had caught him and he had caught me. I had not only a safe job—I had also a hobby. Säo Paulo has a public library. I read slowly and with infinite pleasure Horatius and Petronius, Apuleius and old Cicero, I had once considered so dull. Every one of them willingly furnished words and phrases for Mr. Milne’s zoo. After seven short years I was tempted to say that the translation was printable. This view however was shared by but a few. Robert Graves, to whom I had sent a copy replied in elegant Latin that he was going to use it teaching his two boys. An expert on teaching Latin, an eminent member of the Orbilian Society wrote: “Children do not begin the study of Latin till they are 11 or 12, and certainly learn nothing about some of the constructions that you very properly use in your translation until they are 13 or 14 years of age. For instance the accusative-and-in- finitive and the Ablative Absolute are not used in our 97 [pageend97]Latin teaching till the end of the pupil’s second year, the gerundive and gerundium not till the third year and some of your subjunctive uses not till the third or even the fourth. So at the time, when pupils would be expected to understand your Latin properly they would already have reached the age, when the subject matter would be of no interest to them.” Publishers shared the latter view wholeheartedly. By that time I loved the Bear so much, that I did, what hopeless poets do the world over: I decided to print the book at my own expense. Translating the record of an Interamerican Congress of Pathology I earned the money; the agents of the book sold me (for 3 cheap guineas) the right to distribute it free of charge—a right which I thought to possess already—and a Hungarian printer set the type on the machines of an Italian daily in Säo Paulo. My friends accompanied my undertaking by explaining what I should have better done with the money. They widely disagreed in their suggestions, but agreed in one point: that nobody would ever read the book. Today, I deeply regret I refused to bet upon it. I could not only buy the astronomical telescope, I am longing for, but could build a nice observatory too. . . Printer’s ink has magic properties. The small, white- covered Säo Paulo edition with its innumerable misprints and errors was well received the world over. Humanists from Australia asked for a copy, booksellers from Oxford for 50. At Christmas 1959 the great Swedish publishing house Svenska Bokförlaget published 2000 copies. Touching letters from Scandinavian latinists and 2000 more copies followed. Now Methuen—who two years before had refused to run the risk—reconsidered his decision: Winnie got a sword and a helmet, and Piglet—vexillifer Porcellus— 98 [pageend98]set out with him to conquer the world—or, at least the Republic of Humanists. I am, of course, very proud, but feel rather lonesome now. “Just like him’’—Eeyore would say.—First he left his father, good old Mister Milne. You were a good stepfather to him—but off he stumped again. It is very nice to hear, Winnie-ille-Pu is read and commented upon. “At pulchrum est digito monstrari et dicier: hie est”—(it is wonderful to be pointed at and hear the people say : that’s he)—he probably quotes Persus. But what should I do without him ? He won’t come back.—He might get a teaching job, exchange his warlike attires for cap and gown and forget me. . . Perhaps I could catch him again by means of a trap. And it must be a cunning trap : I think if I started to translate him into Greek he would stay with me during my lifetime. After all I am past fifty . . . and it would take some time to get Pooh into the company of Achilles, Odysseus and the other Homeric heroes. 99 [pageend99]ARGUMENT We have already published a short account of the Stockholm Conference of the P.E.N. Centre for Writers in Exile. We are now presenting some of the opening speeches of this meeting. JOHANNES EDFELT It is well known that we are living in a new age of national migration. Wie know, too, that this frontier traffic and these transplantations of people from one country to another are not due to any innate Wanderlust. No, this traffic is a direct result of the peculiar dynamism of the dictatorships. Entire social strata are rooted out, and we have consequently seen people driven from their native lands where they have had their lawful work and have built and lived for centuries. This all gives rise to a grievous international problem, the implications of which we cannot foresee. The fate of emigrants is always a hard one. They must carry on a struggle for existence in an inferior position. Robbed of citizenship in their own country, outcasts from the community created by long traditions, these people, our fellow men and women, are relegated to a right of asylum which all too often may be based on caprice and relative goodwill. Loneliness must often close round them like a ring of ice. Their lives must forfeit the feeling of oneness and continuity which is so precious to a natural and organic course of life. This, perhaps, is the most deeply tragic factor. It so happens that a comparatively large percentage of these people who have been turned out of their homes belong to the intellectual vocations, and the number of writers and artists is particularly high. The 100 [pageend100]stateless writer’s situation opens up a wide field of unique problems. In the new cultural environment he is put to a severe test—an endurance test of his spiritual vitality. The asphalt of foreign cities as a rule becomes the ground where the exile’s footsteps echo. His is the lot of the b out ev ar di er, which is no bed of roses. A hotel room or a corner in a boarding house becomes his workshop and spiritual headquarters, sometimes for long periods. Moreover, he must learn to express himself in a new language, a foreign language. The exiled author never gets away from his native land, the environment which once moulded the pattern of his consciousness. But only in memory and in his dreams can he once again see and feel his homeland, his home town. An Austrian writer who had to flee the country, Franz Werfel, in his poem Traumstadt eines Emigranten has expressed moods and experiences which many an exiled author no doubt recognizes as his own: Ja, ich bin recht, es ist die alte Gasse. Hier wohn ich dreissig Jahr ohn Unterlass. . . Bin ich hier recht ? ? Mich treibt ein Irgendwas, Das mich nicht loslässt, mit der Menschenmasse. Da, eine Sperre starrt. . . Eh ich mich fasse, Packt’s meine Arme: “Bitte, Ihren Pass!” Mein Pass ? Wo ist mein Pass! Von Hohn und Hass Bin ich umzingelt, wanke und erblasse. . . Kann soviel Angst ein Menschenmut ertragen ? Stahlruten pfeifen, die mich werden schlagen, Ich fühl noch, dass ich in die Kniee brach. . . Und während Unsichtbare mich bespeien: “Ich hab ja nichts getan,” — hör ich mich schreien, “Als dass ich eure, meine Sprache sprach.” 101 [pageend101]Now that the P.E.N. Centre for Writers in Exile has chosen Stockholm for a conference, it is a joy and an honour for the Swedish P.E.N. Club to bid them welcome to our country. Your chairman, Peteris Aigars, once wrote the following words: “We have brought to the West not only our battered bodies but also the deep conviction that freedom is the common heritage of all mankind, which is one immense body. If part of this body is paralysed, the well-being of the whole is in danger. In their souls the exiled writers still carry the fragrance of the limetrees of the Baltic, the softness of the green meadows of the Carpathians, the beautiful blue horizons of the Hungarian Puszta and the rose gardens of Bulgaria.” It is the hope of the Swedish P.E.N. Club that you who are attending the congress will also be able to cherish the memory of a few profitable days of good fellowship in our land. Welcome to you all! PETERIS AIGARS The P.E.N. Centre for Writers in Exile, founded in 1951, brings together more than 250 writers who have found refuge in nearly all the countries of the free world. It publishes a bimonthly literary magazine “Arena” in three languages—English, French and German—and it has independent branches in New York and Paris. Among us are authors who have suffered long years of imprisonment in the countries of their birth and among us are writers who have experienced the savage climate of the Siberian labour camps but have not lost faith in the maxim of Goethe—Stirb und. Werde. With your kind permission we want to discuss here in Stockholm the theme : History and the Writer’s Imagination. 102 [pageend102]\ A t present Ercrope, and it seems the whole world, has before it the decision whether to go for or against the spiritual constitution which forms the basis of our civilisation. A new kind of paganism, armed with the achievements of modern science, is trying to inflict on us an inhuman materialism. Never before has a writer beeh subjected to such heavy duties and responsibilities. Storms in the souls which spring up from time to time in the countries of our origin have not been forecast or explained by any scientist or psychologist. Science has not removed any part of the responsibilities of a 20th century’ writer. On the contrary, it has increased the load. New moral concepts do not result from the co-existence of different ideologies but from the clashes between them. Ideologies and the powers which represent them are always at war, they never co-exist. Dictatorial doctrines cannot be liberalised, they can only degenerate and collapse, and similarly dictators cannot change their personalities. Illusions about the wolf’s love for sheep and a snake’s love for mice belong only to the sphere of blind fantasy. Doctrines about the social relations change their attractive colours in every century. A writer cannot take them as a foundation for his creative work. He has to dig deeper. He has to return to Plato and other wise men of antiquity. Beauty and love are the unchanging values for humanity. Modern science, which all admire and rate highly, has solved the problem of total death, but has not solved the problem of life. The demons of nature are easily summoned but are not easily recalled. However, if a man is to live on this planet, he needs more than analysis, his soul thirsts for love and for creative synthesis. The wonders created by man are surpassed by the wonders which have existed long before us and will exist until eternity. The duty of a writer is not only to master his art but also to develop and enrich the ideas 103 [pageend103]first expressed on Assyrian clay tablets and by Runic writing. The chain cannot be cut. We who have been forced to leave our countries, do not live to shed tears about the past, but we are searching for a better future. God has created large and small nations and they all want to live. People who are not satisfied with bread alone look upon us and ask: You have seen danger and death, where is the solution for our generation ? Those fateful questions can be read in the faces of nearly all men. The answers can possibly vary but nearest to the truth is the one which states that trouble always starts when a man thirsting for power proclaims himself to be infallible. Each century has to deal with its own problems.—We and you, who enjoy the flourishing freedom of your own country, we all are invited to prepare a spiritual renaissance of Europe. If this will not happen, the world will experience the tragedy of the whole Christian civilisation. This is not only the problem of the small or the great, the free or the captive nations. Today the greatest and strongest countiy is not strong enough to withstand the immense threats. If we could be able to solve one hundredth part of the problems at our congress, we would accomplish a lot. The summer days will soon pass and we would be happy if we could leave your country with the conviction that the bridges of friendship built here this summer will not be carried away by the ice and storms of next winter. I, as a Latvian poet, am convinced that the bridges will survive. There are traditions which are older than an era. I have in mind another century when the Swedish King Charles XI donated 7,500 dalers to translate the Bible into Latvian. The new European traditions are not new at all, really. We should take over the best from our common heritage and enrich it with our new contributions of friendship and mutual understanding. 104 [pageend104]JOHANNES AAVIK J’ai l’honneur et le plaisir de saluer tout d’abord le P.E.N.-Club suédois et de lui exprimer notre gratitude poür ľ extraordinaire hospitalité qu’il a bien voulu nous donner, et puis de saluer, de la part du cercle estonien, les représentants ici présents des P.E.N.-Clubs en exil. Nous autres, membres de P.E.N.-Clubs en exil, nous sommes dispersés par tout le monde libre et dans de divers pays. Bien entendu, dans de telies conditions défavorables notre táche de continuer la production de nos littératures nationales est rendue assez ardue et difficile. Mais malgré tout, nous y avons réussi, car meme en exil des romans, des recueils de nouvelles et de poésies ont été publiés dans nos langues maternelles. Nous espérons que cette activité va continuer aussi pendant les années futures. Que dans cela un sort bienveillant nous soit encore propice. Cela, je le crois bien, est le souhait et le voeu de nous tous. MICHAEL PRAWDIN HISTORY AND THE WRITER’S IMAGINATION It is beyond any doubt that history provides us with certain facts and the point under discussion is only what the writer’s imagination may or may not do with them. Let us say for example that in a future generation somebody will want to write about our ‘Centre for Writers in Exile’. History will provide him, among other things, with the facts that we held international conferences abroad in 1958 and I960, one after the other, in Germany and then only, in 1962, in Stockholm. He will immedia105 [pageend105]tely be set wondering: “Why Germany twice running?” and the writer’s fertile imagination will naturally produce the answer: “cherchez la femme”. The writers wanted to meet some ladies who failed to turn up, and so the Centre had to go the second timé to Germany when the writers either did meet their girlfriends or, disappoined about their faithlessness, gave up trying. But then: “Why to Stockholm?”.—The writer’s rich imagination dislikes repeating itself and so he asked: what do foreigners know about Sweden ? Certainly ‘smorgasbord’. And the proud writer will be able to furnish proof that love for ‘smorgasbord’ is more satisfying than love for women, and perhaps produce a beststeller if not for the author, then for restaurants serving ‘smorgasbord’. The only painful thing would be that the product of his imagination would have nothing whatever to do with history, although he started straight from historical facts. If he is conscientious enough to investigate the facts in detail and finds that we went first to Munich and the second time to Düsseldorf, his imagination could conclude that in the first instance we wanted to sample Munich’s beer and in the second taste Rhine wine, and leave his “cherchez la femme” for Stockholm. Now, we have got two completely contradictory pictures of the same historical events painted by the writer’s imagination, and who would dare to say that the writer had consciously falsified the facts? He may even have been intrinsically right when he saw in the minds of the participants the subconscious wish for beer, for wine or for ladies. Yes, he may even have committed a lesser historical perversion than a so-called English historian who published a book insisting that Hitler did not want war. Our writer’s fault would only have been that he applied his imagination in a fictional way as free roaming fantasy. 106 [pageend106]A worthy counterpart to this imaginative historian describing the Centre of Writers in Exile is the much more concrete historian who thinks that imagination is a dangerous intrusion into the context of history and who is content to stick to the facts and to the facts alone. Theoretically he is right. What guarantee can we have that even the most ingenious and logical deductions of a man’s imagination are correct? Simply put the facts, the acts, and the actors in chronological order—and you get a book which is a guaranteed killer of any interest in history for life, as the many-volumed so-called compendia are. The facts and acts with which history supplies us are the product of planning engendered by the aspirations and characters of human beings and of the general conditions under which they are forced to act. The historical writer’s imagination has therefore to perform quite a different task from the writer’s usual one of inventing characters, situations and conflicts. Every serious historical writer is a writer in exile. He lives far away from the people who occupy his thoughts and engage his feelings even if geographically he lives in the same country. The Sweden of the 20th century differs more from the Sweden of the time of Gustav Vasa or of Charles XII than for example from Britain in the 20th century. The last 100 years have broadened and unified the basis of our civilization, and the existing differences, which it is not my intention to minimise, are more or less regional. These differences are nowadays particularly stressed—but that is done in the interest of the tourist trade. The Londoner will find it easier to understand the views of the far-away Spaniards or Italians of a comparable educational standard than those of a Londoner of Tudor times. A historical writer, if it is not his idea to produce a carnival procession with Tom and Harry dressed up in 107 [pageend107]clothes from the Victoria and Albert 'Museum and acting a story of love and hate according to a film scenario, must leave his exile of the 20th century and give his imagination the opportunity to do some digging into the country and the cultural and social period which he has chosen as his original true home. He has the same advantage over the people of this country and period as every exile has over his previous compatriots who have remained in their native land. He has come to know the climate and achievements of other cultures and can judge the movements and fluctuations in his original country as an observer by drawing on the experience of both. As an historian, and an exile in time, he has the added advantage of knowing the results of their endeavours and pursuits. But this is a dangerous knowledge which can easily affect his judgement, and he must use it only as a tool for the investigation of the reasons for success or failure. The work his imagination has to perform is prescribed by history. The facts of history are events and the names of people involved in the events. The pictures of the characters of the persons who caused or influenced these events are handed down by their followers or their adversaries and are accordingly contradictory. The basic conditions from which the events grew are only partially or not at all understood by the contemporaries, and so we cannot rely on the information given by them. And the ideas born and propagated by the events bear implications naturally unknown to their proclaimers. To give you only a short example: in spite of Marie Antoinette’s famous diamond necklace, it was not the necklace but the help given by France to the first anticolonial movement, the American War of Independence, that produced the ruinous State deficit; and the treasury’s urgent need for money was seized upon by the aristocracy who tried to re-inforce their influence upon the govern- 108 [pageend108]ment. When instead the Third Estate proved to be the real power in the land, its leaders proclaimed the 'Rights of Man’, ‘Liberté, Egalité, et Fraternitě’, and in order to extend and consolidate their power: the idea of ‘La Grande Nation’. ‘Fraternitě’ led to chopping off the heads of people who took the ‘liberté’ of thinking otherwise, with complete ‘egalité’ whether it was some silly marquis or a Danton and Robespierre. The ‘Rights of Man’, however, inspired the developments of the 19th century, and where they have not been totally suppressed in the 20th, the historians fully acknowledge that the roots of our way of life lie in the French Revolution. At the same time they completely overlook that the other idea which, produced all the havoc for at least a century also stems from the French Revolution : I mean the idea of ‘La Grande Nation’. This device was much too expedient not to be taken up by other countries. If it could produce, out of Burgundy, Brittany, Gascony, Provence and other only nominally cohesive countries, the power and glory of France, it could certainly make of Piedmont, Lombardy, Tuscany, Sicily and so on, the Italian Grand Nation, or do the same for Bavaria, Hessen, Saxony and Prussia. We became a Europe of Grandes Nations; the struggles which since the religious wars had not concerned the mass of the peoples at all, became national wars in which the destiny of everyone is involved. Lately, inspired by the European example the idea of the Grande Nation spread to Africa, and what is good for the Arabs is just as good for the Congo tribes, and a direct heritage of the French Revolution may in the end be La Grande Nation of Mr Tshombe, though the men effecting it may not even imagine its connection with the French Revolution. You may draw other conclusions, but my example was only intended to show how the writer’s imagination has to work simply to establish the causes and the effects 109 [pageend109]of historical events, and how he has to track down the objective facts even before he touches the investigation of the personal characters who determine the timing and the shaping of these events. France was the first country to suffer from the Grande Nation invention because in 1871 Napoleon III pursued the glory appertaining to this image without understanding that circumstances had changed because in Prussia there was a Bismarck with a whole generation of teachers of the ‘wie herrlich weit wir es gebracht’ type. Thus the writer’s imagination, once he has assimilated all the source materials at his disposal, must set to work to extract from them as true a picture of history as possible, taking everything into account concerning the period and the events he deals with. Naturally I do not know how other historical writers proceed with their research, and so I am sorry that I must now speak ‘pro domo’, if I am to present to you the way how a writer tries to solve the baffling problems which he encounters when writing history. When I wrote ‘‘The Mongol Empire” everything seemed clear to me : the primitive nomadic society, the impression Chinese traders made on the imagination of the boy who afterwards became Jenghiz Khan, the adaptation of nomad life to a supermilitary organisation and their triumphal onslaught on the soft world of the towns, where only a small caste pretended to be warriorlike. But then, over a century later, Tamerlane’s stupendous effort to re-create Jenghiz Khan’s empire put me before the problem : why did Jenghiz Khan’s empire last for over three generations, while in Tamerlane’s empire his death was a signal for civil war, and all the subsequent restorations were achieved only after chaotic struggles? Jenghiz Khan’s heirs were just as quarrelsome, the wars were fought by the same types of tribes, and the comfortable answer that the one empire just 110 [pageend110]lasted and the other did not, is historically not satisfactory. And so the writer’s imagination went to work comparing the similarities and the differences and studying the ramifications, until I found the answer: Jenghiz Khan gave his peoples a single purpose: the domination by the nomads over settled countries, and that could only be achieved through unity among the Mongols. If you like, it was a principle of la Grande Nation of nomad tribes. Tamarlane’s conquests were made by mercenaries who followed his personality for payment and spoils. The interest of each tribe remained isolated, just as that of his numerous heirs, because the driving power was not the conviction that the nomad warrior is superior to the effeminate town-dweller but the desire to enjoy the foreign, Persian, superior culture to the full. To solve such a historical problem, the working method of a writer’s imagination is that of a kind of investigator, of a psychologist, of a detective. The facts are given, the symptoms show this or that possibility and his job is to follow all trails to the end. Or in another case : to find out who laid this or that false trail and with what purpose in mind ? Such a case I had in the book “The Mad Queen of Spain”. Her reactions showed a hotblooded, jealous woman, but all her suspicions were perfectly well-founded, and the Spanish people nicknamed her “Juana la Loca, loca de amor”. But she was the heiress of Castille, and being crazily in love was not enough to deprive her of her kingdom. So in order to lay the hand on the riches of Castille, first her husband, then her father, and finally her son presented her as insane. The final gain was the Empire of Charles V in which the sun never set. Such historical detection is often unrewarding because it goes against the traditional tendency of the official historians whose task it always had been to justify the great and their actions; and by showing their falseness you upset a long standing tra111 [pageend111]dition, the interests of the establishment, the prevailing official views. And your discovery will be passed over in silence or opposed. However, the efforts of the historical writer are not meant to justify or to condemn. In my example: it was for me not the question to show that the three acted criminally, but only to establish the fact that the woman was a sacrifice made in order to enable them to fulfill what they regarded to be their historical mission. Whether the task was worthwhile, whether they had the right to sacrifice her, is another question. The historical writer should not be a judge. His mission is only to show by what means and in what way a historical event happened precisely in this or that guise and not differently. In addition to this historical method of presenting history there exists another one which is considered legitimate, which often promises a much bigger reward to the author and provides even greater enjoyment to a wider circle of readers. This method, too, requires from the writer a thorough study of the conditions and customs of the historical period in question, but it allows him to use his knowledge only as a basis where he can let his hero speak and behave at the writer’s pleasure so long as it is done in accordance with the historical character. The result will be a historical drama or a historical novel, and its quality will depend entirely on the writer’s imagination and creative ability. He populates the readers’ mind with a multitude of fascinating personalities from Shakespeare’s Richard HI, to Schiller’s Jeanne d’Arc or Mereshkovski’s Leonardo da Vinci. Works such as these stimulate general interest in history, they provide the readers’ fantasy with rich food and may awaken his thirst for education. There is only one disadvantage in this method: it does not give a real portrait of that particular historical figure, but instead a painting or a drawing seen through the artist’s eye. 112 [pageend112]If the eye is that of a Rembrandt, it may immortalise quite a common face, if it is seen through the eye of a Picasso, the face may be dissolved into half a dozen contradictory features. In any case we get the past populated by heroes, criminals, angels or beasts but scarcely by men as they really lived and worked in history. Generally still better loved is a variation of this kind of treatment of history, in which the writer does not put a definite historical personality into the centre of his book but lets the one or the other appear at random filling his book with invented plots and heroes. By this method magnificent stories can be produced: I think of ‘The Three Musketeers’ by Alexander Dumas, of the novels of Walter Scott. In the novels of this type history is used for a very definite purpose. The historical background is usually correct, the plots are in the character of the period, but everything is subordinated to a romantic purpose, namely to show that an ideal form which was admired at the time really existed and dominated life. It may be as in Scott’s novels the ideal of chivalry in accordance with the legends of the knighthood, it may be dedication to fighting injustice perpetrated by the powerful, it may be the noble passion of love overriding all other interests in life. In any case the product is didactic literature, praising some romantic feeling, be it nothing more than reckless courage in adventures, which triumphs over the seamy sides of life that were usually rife just at the time when these books were written. The reader’s fantasy was to be raised to a higher level and given some more beautiful ideals than he could see in his surroundings. And the historical background was chosen to convince him that this ideal not only could exist but that it really existed. In other words History provides an enormous range for the writer’s imagination. It can be a wand to conjure 113 [pageend113]up a world in which he would be happy to live. It can be a tool to create actions and plots more daring and tenser than any crime story could support. And it supplies him with innumerable heroic names in comparison with which the names Sherlock Holmes, Poirot and Maigret pale into insignificance. In my opinion, however, its greatest attraction is that it stimulates the writer’s imagination to search for an understanding of the causes, effects and turns in the development of our human society. And the writers for whom all this is not enough can make out of history a magnificent part worthy even to be played by Elizabeth Taylor! 114 [pageend114]John Masters his new novel is set in India after Independence TO THE CORAL STRAND (18/-) C.

Bates “more pleasure than in 100 other novels” (The Bookman) A CROWN OF WILD MYRTLE (15/-) MICHAEL JOSEPH [pageend115]NOTES AND REVIEWS THE PLOT GOES ON (Egon Hostovsky: THE PLOT, translated from Czech by Alice Backer with Bernard Wolfe, Cassell, London, 18s.) The Plot is so far the longest of Egon Hostovsky’s novels and perhaps also the most interesting and mature. Reading this book intoxicated me : the taste which the novel left me with was that of intoxication after a heady wine. I was intoxicated by the sheer ruthlessness of Hostovsky’s ripe and accomplished art. I was deeply impressed by the very fine balance which the author contrived between the factual elements of the plot and the other, deeper meanings of the story. His mastery as a story-teller helps him in his quest, the search for something of supreme value not only to the writer himself but to the reader as well. The quest is for the freedom of the will, in the metaphysical, not in the political sense. Hostovsky lives in the United States, in a new space-time which he depicts in his novel with uncanny skill. Yet his roots, resembling the aerial roots of certain tropical trees, still seek and find their anchorage in his native soil, draw their sustenance from there, both from his childhood and his later experiences. I admired the way in which Hostovsky has brought into his novel various elements—very thorny ones at that—of the recent political history of Czechoslovakia, including his experiences of a civil servant and of a man who had known Dr. E. Benes. To introduce recent political events into a novel, particularly events of such tragic magnitude as in this instance, is at all times a pretty dangerous thing for an artist to do. It requires complete detachment, an attitude of “sine ira et studio”, no matter what the artist himself may have suffered in those events. Hostovsky has solved this problem very well for he never allows the story he is telling to be tinged by personal bitterness. He has placed 116 [pageend116]those Czech political sequences in their proper perspective in the twin-world of the writer’s mind and of the international scene. To tell the story of The Plot is exceedingly difficult : The Plot evolves on several levels of human experience and consciousness, and these various levels frequently clash'. The reader is often forced to pause and ask himself : Where does the writer take me? Am I on solid, realistic ground? And of which reality—outer or inner? Do I now, following the author, perhaps also proceed along both levels, a little lame, as Cocteau once said the poet always is? As to the characters of the novel, I had to ask myself to what extent they are independent, apart from the author, and to what extent they are a projection of his mind? There is considerable authenticity in these characters; but suddenly and disconcertingly they change and act in such a way that one cannot be sure whether they have been taken only from real life. Every good artist, of course draws his characters partly at least, and in his own unique way, from his imagination. Rostovsky’s ambiguous characters are friends, fellow-men, but also his enemies, his vampires, as he calls them. Jan Bares, the hero of the novel, needs enemies for him to grapple with. Then again : oneself is of course, one’s own bitterest enemy. Thus Bares’s friends, the publisher, the doctor, the film magnate, stem from the same kind of phantoms which, in the disguise of Eros, Pluto and Fame tempted Charles Baudelaire. Jan Bares, the hero, is saved from the general plot with the help of Robert, his closest friend but again a projection of one of the possible selves living in the subterranean hideouts of the artist’s soul. Bares is also aided by the two women of the novel, by the mysterious blonde, a modern Belle Dame sans Merci, and by the definite, positive Czech girl Milada. There is also the tremendous and helpful push Bares receives from a little girl, the ghost of his sister, in a snow storm which gives Bares the “clean sheet” on which his sister can teach him how to sign his own name properly—how to get back his former personality which is entirely different when made whole. Bares himself, during his tight-rope journey to salvation from the net of the plot, hovers many a time over 117 [pageend117]the abyss of cruelty. The sequence of Bares and the bartender’s death, or the Portuguese experience, the whole relationship with the enigmatic figure of Father Lutkens seems to derive from this. One of the pleasures the book affords is the reappearence of the old romantic presences, like that of the Fatal Woman, in Theophile Gautier’s, or Swinburne’s, or Flaubert’s sense. This is not artificially contrived. These types, so real in art, quite naturally spring from Hostovsky’s creative mind and undergo before our eyes a fascinating metamorphosis, for instance into a modern descendant of Gautier’s Cleopatra. Jan Bares of the novel is purposely very closely modelled on the autHor himself. Hostovsky-Bares, the narrator, recklessly brings to the mill all the harvest he has gathered. All the elements he introduces into his novel are grapes which he crushes with a cruel indifference both towards himself and “the gentle reader”. The past lives and ramifies in the present; the torment ferments into the heady clear wine of a work of art, a wine that is the essence of human personality as. Hostovsky conceives it, and its salvation by means of the reintroduction of the freedom of the will so that irrevocable decisions can be taken by Bares. Ultimately, these decisions, the change of heart, are found to be very, very fragile. Everything is “on loan” ; it is always endangered by the dark forces of ambiguous man. There is no end, really, to this novel. Hostovsky’s hero will go on with his fight to free himself from “the plot”. It is like walking in a maze where all the walls are mirrors.Pursuing his metaphysical quest, Hostovsky wants to release the inner man. “All of a sudden I was Bares, the timeless, ubiquitous witness and personification of all that had ever happened to me. Such self-knowledge differs only by a hairbreadth from being burned alive. To know and remember everything—this a man can stand for only a fraction of a second, if his deepest being is not to be consumed by the white-hot heat of his spirit, like a single reed in the conflagration of a village. Yes, 1 lived through a split- second miracle such as is given to most men only in their last moments, when their lives come back to them in totality. I would say all this took place on some remote mental fringe away from the world of the senses, through some cosmic 118 [pageend118]I shock. Two sparks of a, single creative force flared up before my eyes—that of Birth and that of Annihilation. In their awesome yet serene glow 1 saw, mysteriously, the alpha and omega of my being." Here, clearly, a romantic comes very nearwo being a mystic. Throughout the novel, the various characters scatter subtle key messages. One of these principal messages is given by George Beck, the phantom with whom Bares hobnobs but who is also partly a projection of the author’s, or Bares’s, conscience. Beck, the phantom, has caused Bares to change his handwriting and to assume his own spidery scrawl. Bares urges Beck to write something on a piece of paper, to prove himself real. Beck retorts significantly : “I'm as real as your life that I’m a part of.” Bares must make his life real by fighting. When he asks Beck what he ought to fight against, Beck tells him, “Against the affliction of your eyes and ears -—for freedom of volition and loyalty.” Another message is delivered to Bares by his old familiar taxi-driver who tells him : “The atoms are bursting loose in us and in no time we’re going to be torn into rags and shreds. . This man, courting chaos—what does he aim at? Hostovsky puts it like this, “Hadn’t 1 been listening to the particulars of a foul crime in which I’d played a feature role ? . . It didn’t matter that in my dizziness I scarcely knew what I was doing. No criminal ever sees all the dragon’s claws hidden in his deed." This man lives in disintegration, in between spurts of terror, like a criminal on reprieve. Inevitably, we ask ourselves what the substance of “the plot” is. The hero explains it as follows, “AU my so-called successes as a television and movie writer . . all of that came exclusively from the decline of the man and the writer, Jan Bares of Náchod. I became a collaborationst-—collaborating with the conspirators. A travelling salesman of ideas, a hairdresser of nations. . . I told myself, ’What’s your name, you cardboard skull, who’re you to be proud of your ideas and discoveries ? Who says you’ve got to follow your private will- o’-the-wisps ? . . So I became the public address system for a lot of nice theories, the humdrum opinions of empty-headed dolts. . This treason—which took a long time to develop— didn’t pay off. In the end, reality betrayed me. . . I’m not 119 [pageend119]I fighting the plotters around me and within me out of some sort of ethical or aesthetic stubborness, 1 do it because 1 can’t let myself rot away. My humility was a sham—since I turned my back on my own visions. These visions aren’t of my own making so 1 had no right to give them up.” In another place, Bares’s friend, Doctor Stevens tackles “the plot” in the following manner, “. . . each person in particular, there’s a conflict going on between sanity and anarchic delusion. You call it the global plot. People in whom sobriety and sanity prevail seem artifacts to you, monsters rushing into self-purposed crime. Anarchic fools or phantasists, on the other hand, these you hold to be the last standard-bearers of humanity on earth.” Then the same Stevens says, “If we could pursue your sanities along with our insanities, we’d discover a space where the global conspiracy took root. . . The global prison! From this prison there’s no escaping alive; it’s immense and endless. Yet each of us keeps trying to break out. Each such attempt is conspiracy. . . But nobody gets out of the prison. There are no jailers—we’re all inmates . . . the sane and the insane get wise only if they reconcile themselves to the prison. Such resignation is another kind of~rebellion. The secret of this form of revolt is that we’re able to say no to ourselves—not to our neighbours, for once—NO.” When finally Bares, tormented by his friends, or vampires, as he calls them through Milada, “dies to himself”, as it were, in a snow storm during which another ghost, his small sister, teaches him how to overcome the obsession of George Beck, Bares at last wins with Milada “fragile” happiness. Milada remains : “I am afraid it won’t last. Everything’s so fragile.” Bares says: “Everything’s being loaned to us.” Then he adds : “It’s my theory whatever isn’t miraculous isn’t real." A few more words about Rostovsky’s Fatal Woman. This type, true to Gautier’s Cleopatra, cannot of course be dissociated from the snake. Bares, looking for the first time at the blue-eyed American, thinks : “. . . she shifted her weight from side to side as if moved by a silent rhythm, as though snake-dancing, still looking up at me with the moist and absent eyes and tonguing her half-open lips. The index finger of her right hand, which was now curled in her lap, called provocatively to me—the gesture one uses to invite a child 120 [pageend120]to come to play.” Here we have a threefold image of Cleopatra’s snake. Yet Hostovsky’s Cleopatra is modern, even if her ancestry is ancient. She says : “I’m a self-sufficient mo- dern woman and a forerunner of the future woman—as de- terfiined not to suffer in childbirth as to avoid shoes that are too small for me. . . I don’t resent vitamins, television, psychoanalysis, I don’t bemoan machines that compute and translate and detect lies—the one thing I detest is superstition of any kind. . . I don’t need dreams or even happiness to make me feel good. . .” She is given another slight twist by Hostovsky and exhorts Bares in Baudelairean fashion to go on a journey, “Oh, Jan, why can’t we go to Norway, you and I! What solitude—you fuse with the elements! One day you feel the surf lapping into you. . . If you have any sorrow it gets washed clean of pain, it takes on cosmic proportions. . .” Then comes the final twist, the final transformation of this Belle Dame sans Merci: after hearing the cry of her child, completely changed, she rushes out from the love nest and the face of the Medusa is now visible in her countenance. Hostovsky puts it like this : “From the open window, crouching like a witch, a woman tore across the room. . . She had an aquiline nose, long thin lips, dark chestnut hair. I had never seen her before . . . the growls of the monster were gone. 1 lost consciousness.” Ivan Jelinek Pál Táborí: KEREK A VILAG (Utinapló) Griff Verlag, München. Pál Táborí, der ungarische Schriftsteller, ist mit dem englischen Schriftsteller Paul Tabori identisch. Kerek a világ (deutsch etwa Rund ist die Erde) ist nicht nur ein Reisetagebuch, wie Tabori es bescheiden nennt; dieses Werk ist eine Erzählung eines hochgebildeten Schriftstellers — der auch eine vorzüglicher Journalist ist — über alles, was er während 20 Jahren in der Welt gesehen, gehört und erlebt hat. Den ersten Bericht schrieb er im Jahre 1937, den letzten im Jahre 1957, und in diesen 20 Jahren bereiste er das ganze Erdenrund von England bis Burma, von Los Angeles bis zu 121 [pageend121]den Philippinen, sprach mit Staatsmännern und mit Bettlern, mit Wissenschaftlern und mit Arbeitern. Während der zwei Jahrzehnte veränderte sich die Welt, als wären Jahrhunderte verflossen, Táborí veränderte sich aber nicht. Vor 20 Jahren riss ihn die Hitze der Jugend nicht hin, und heute kann er noch immer begeistert sein wie der Jüngste. Wie vor 20 Jahren, interessieren ihn auch heute noch die Menschen mehr als die Gegenden, und er weilt lieber auf einem lärmenden Markt als in einem Museum. Photos und Filme stellen uns Berge und Flüsse, Städte und Schlösser dar; mit den Menschen, mit ihren Gedanken, Hoffnungen, und Enttäuschungen, üeberzeugungen und Sehnsüchten kann uns aber nur derjenige bekannt machen, der — wie Tabori — mit Hunderten von Menschen überall in der Welt nicht nur gesprochen hat, sondern auch in ihren Seelen lesen konnte. Dieses Buch enthält Offenbarungen der menschlichen Weisheit und der menschlichen Fehler, der menschlichen Solidarität und des menschlichen Lasters. Das Buch enthält aber keine statistischen Daten, keine Zahlen und kein uninteressantes Datum. Ein Lob dafür dem Autor! Tabori charakterisiert die Personen seines Buches mit 2-3 Zeilen so frappant, dass wir sie beinahe sehen; er lässt die Leute reden, so dass wir sie fast zu hören vermeinen. Der Leser wird an Taboris Humor und Erfindungsgabe viel Freude haben. Der Autor dieses Werkes bereiste die Welt nicht um ein Buch zu schreiben; er schrieb ein Buch, weil er dreimal die Erde umflog, weil er vieles sah und hörte, und weil er versuchte das grösste Geheimnis, den Menschen, zu erkennen. In meiner Jugend las ich alle Reisebücher, die mir unter die Hand gerieten; ich muss aber gestehen : von Taboris Buch habe ich mehr gelernt, als von all diesen Werken. Tabori widmet sein Buch dem Andenken seines Vaters. Die Nazis ermordeten Kornelius Tabori, diesen hervorragenden Journalisten und Weltreisenden. Ich bin einer der wenigen, der dem in den Tod gehenden in der letzten Minute noch die Hand drücken konnte. Kein Wunder also, wenn dieses Werk mir immer ein liebes Buch sein wird. Ernö Halász 122 [pageend122]ELIZABETH BALLA: THE LAST VISION (published in Hungarian, Buenos Aires.) Sholem Asch, Bialik, and many others did not bring the tragedy of the Jews closer to us than Elisabeth Balla, a sensitive, tortured writer. Every line of her books is shadowed by the nightmare of a repetition of the Nazi horrors. Her stories are grim and often unbearably poignant. “A Child Was Born” is a striking evocation of an oppressive mood. “The Man in Labour Service” mirrors the tragedy of a whole generation. “Janika is Five Years old” is the tale of a little boy who offers the leather-jacketed Nazi officer all his coloured pencils so that he should not be drowned in the Danube (as the other children were)—because next year he would love to go to school. “The Warsaw Ghetto” was published several years before the great popular success of “Exodus”. Elizabeth Balla’s little David and the Dow of Leon Uris come to life in a marvellous and shattering identity. “Herskovits digs fortifications”, however grim its contents, is an enchanting tale, reminding one of Ilya Ehrenburg’s Lazik Roitschwanz. “Aaron with the Flute” approaches the mastery of Sholem Asch’s “Motke the Thief.” Elizabeth Balla is a many-sided writer. Her story “The poor relation” is a naturalistic study of the dirty corridor of an old tenement house, evoking the smell of insecticide, the bedlinen lying outside, the vulgar screaming of the janitress. “Mother Sarah” is another outstanding tale which is a touching fulfilment of Mrs. Balla’s talent. Writing in a language which finds few readers outside the country of her birth, Elizabeth Balla has still achieved a lasting effect, an apocalyptic power and her stories—of which “Yellow Sand in the Wind” was published in an earlier review of P.E.N. in Exile—would well deserve to be translated into the major languages. Dr. Ladislas Zsürger 123 [pageend123]JAN LECHOŇ: AMERICAN TRANSFORMATIONS. Introduction by Kazimierz Wierzynski; edited by Clark Mills and Mary Phelps; Frontispiece by Zdzislaw Czermanski. New York: Voyage Press, 1959; pp. 36; regular edition $2.00; limited, signed edition $5.00. It was the late George Santayana who remarked that the American desire “to teach everyone” could cause the failure of the American experiment. But, of course, as Jan Lechoň reminds us, Santayana was “more European than American,” and it may be that Santayana’s remark shows a less assured knowledge of America than does that of the Polish author of the present work when he tells us that rather than suggesting of Americans that they are overfond of teaching, we should be disposed to recognise the fact that, often enough, they appear not to know what it is they wish to teach. Lechoň’s purpose in this essay—and his fulfillment of that purpose- may point an answer which is, at least, worthy of being pondered by those to whom the question gives pause. He seeks here to offer an analysis of America in its role as a preserver of civilization and a bastion of the cultural values of a free society. It is with what some will consider an American sense of reality that he bids those who seem absorbed in contemplating the lasting worth of European cultural achievement that they should “understand that they cannot remain satisfied in the contemplation of their own great past, but must make efforts comparable to that past.” He thinks, in fact, that it is by making such an effort that they may attain a synthesis which will result in “the integration of the European cause with America’s historical role.” That some Europeans appear to Lechoň to be proudly convinced that “the only possible culture lies in manners, attitudes, superstitions, and achievements that provide the individual exclusively with the greatest scope for aesthetic and intellectual insights,” is a condition that impresses him very unfavorably. He would, evidently, prefer that they look rather to “a civilization whose purpose is to resolve the con- ffict between individual and collective interests.” It is in such a way that, as he thinks, they will show themselves ready 124 [pageend124]to understand just what it is that constitutes the real greatness of America; and Lechon’s own probings of characteristic concepts seek to demonstrate qualities underlying American transformations of ideals and notions which are fundamental to both civilizations. The America of which he writes is emphatically not the “America of one hundred years ago—conveniently isolated from old world epidemics by the Monroe Doctrine—” but “the America of today which maintains to the world that the affairs of all continents are of legitimate American concern.” “The American experiment,” Lechoň goes on to declare, “was undertaken as a practical embodiment not so much of rationalism as of the humanitarianism of the great European reformers, and guided—almost like Plato’s ideal Republic— by men whose equals Europe has never produced in such unbroken succession, men like Adams, Jefferson, and Monroe, who were true men of thought and quite unlike the incendiaries who led the French Revolution. This experiment was given solid reality by Lincoln in a tragic war that was followed by an extension and advancement of freedom, and reinforced by the impractical Woodrow Wilson, whose importance is still underestimated. Later it was to dispatch beyond the American borders military forces to rescue the liberty of the world. Whatever deformations its main theme has undergone, whatever its inner contradictions, it cannot be compared with the Marxian experiment, bred in the penumbra of perpetual slavery, which is pathological and, in its so-called rationality, insane. “Against all tradition and almost against its own will, the United States has set out to undertake tasks which Europe can no longer discharge and to achieve aims on which the fate of our civilization depends; in doing so, it must avoid the errors Europe has committed in the failure, or loss, of its basic instinct—a loss that remains the most powerful ally of the totalitarians who threaten it. A country of almost unrestricted liberties, of harbors open to all, the United States must nevertheless, in order to preserve and extend these liberties, compromise and impose the disciplines that go with any great achievement. Such restrictions have their equivalents in the structure and customs of all great nations, even 125 [pageend125]those that profess to be rudely shocked today by so-called American reactionism. “We should of course not blind ourselves to changes that result from some of the restrictions being imposed on American freedom; we should even recognise that the threat to some American liberties is not merely temporary. Legitimate fears have been expressed that restrictions imposed only as means to higher ends might becomes ends in themselves. Against these fears, however, we do well look at the main, enduring fact—the American tradition of liberty, never essentially endangered since it can always compromise with common sense. This tradition has endowed the President with prerogatives so wide that they would be regarded in other countries as almost dictatorial. And yet they in no way infringe upon the legislative power, and give full control of the nation to its true rulers, the electorate. “The certainty of the average American that his political system assures him a decisive influence on the activities of the government; his attachment to the two-party system, which the predominantly Anglo-Saxon voters do not intend to abandon; the well-tested possibilities of bloodless and yet revolutionary adjustments in labor relations, and, not least, the material wealth that history was good enough to give to America—these factors ensure that the United States will escape the medieval convulsions that have seemed inevitable to those w’ho give in to the fatalism of our times— a fatalism that really arises from such causes as the decline of parliamentary institutions, the continued existence of social ulcers, and revolutionary changes in the world hierarchy of wealth.” Whether or not readers agree with all the observations made by Mr. Lechoň in his attempt to understand and express the undercurrents which exist in American life and thought and to relate them to their manifestations as affecting world society, his essay deserves the serious attention of all who are concerned with the survival of values threatened today, by an enemy whose unlikeness to both American and European is so great as to dwarf whatever irritations sometimes seem to divide the vision and sunder the action of those two great partners in mankind’s search for whatsoever things are true, lovely, noble, pure, and of good report. It is their partner126 [pageend126]ship which may truly be expected to remove the obstacles which stunt and cripple the mind and throttle the heart. The disposition to learn from each other is the true mark of reasonable men, and both Americans and Europeans have need to stop to consider if what we sometimes hug to ourselves as our pieties are not really our prejudices. No one will exert himself too strongly to defend his prejudices once he has sensed them to be such; and if peradventure we should discover that some even of our pieties are mistaken, it is then time to remember how fond Dean Inge was of cautioning us that when piety has to suffer in the process of being honest with ourselves and others, then our duty is to a stronger interest than that of piety—namely, that of truth. Alastair Guinan EIN EXILMALER SCHLENDERT DURCH DIE GROSS- STAEDTE Die “New York Times” nannte an erster Stelle der zehn besten Bücher für die Jugend das Buch des tschechischen Exilanten Miroslav SASEK, “New York”. Sasek wurde das Diplom der amerikanischen Society of Illustrators verliehen, das einmal im Jahr an den besten Illustrator der USA vergeben wird. Saseks “New York” ist eines aus einer ganzen Reihe von Büchern, die das Leben in den Weltmetropolen mit allem Typischen und Beachtenswerten einfangen : Sasek besucht die Weltstädte und malt für gross und klein seine “Führer durch die Metropolen”. Paris, London, Rom, New York, München (alle Bände beim KINDLER Verlag, München, vierfarbig, jeder Band 12,80 DM). In Paris begann Sasek 1957 an seinem ersten Buch zu arbeiten. Sein Sinn für Details der städtischen und menschlichen Charaktere, seine bildhafte Darstellung der Materie und 127 [pageend127]der Seele, seine Fähigkeit das Ganze im Mosaik festzuhalten und sein Humor brachten seiner ersten Publikation grossen Erfolg. Seine Porträts der Weltstädte sind schon in Paris, München, London, in den Vereinigten Staaten, Italien, Finnland, Schweden, sowie spanisch und portugiesisch in Südamerika erschienen. Zwei neue Bücher sind in Vorbereitung : Edinburgh und Venedig. Jedes Buch umfasst 80 Zeichnungen, an denen der Maler drei bis vier Monate arbeitet. Zwei Bücher im Jahr soll er laut Vertrag mit seinem Verleger malen, und eben beendet er das Porträt San Franciscos. Und man erwartet ihn schon in Kanada, Hongkong, Tokio, Rio de Janeiro, Indien und in Europa in Wien, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Kopenhagen, Berlin. Aber Sasek hat zunächst vor, nach Israel zu gehen, wo er zum erstenmal nicht nur eine Stadt, sondern das ganze Land mit seinem Stift festhalten will. Nicht nur Städte, auch Länder haben ihre Poesie, ihre Seele — es ist der Geist vieler Städte und eines ganzen Volks. Sasek ist ein malender Psychologe. Er selbst sagt über seine Arbeit: “Zunächst studiere ich etwas Literatur über die betreffende Stadt, dann fahre ich hin und gehe mit offenen Augen durch die Strassen, zeichne, was mir wichtig und typisch erscheint. . . .” Und wenn wir in Saseks “Führern” blättern, sehen wir, dass er die Augen offen hält und das Typische wahrzunehmen weiss. Seht euch nur seine Hüte an : die Melonen der Engländer, die Baretts der Franzosen, die bayrischen Gamsbarthüte, die Zweispitze der römischen Polizei; — das Rot der Londoner Busse, die Kinder mit ihren rosigen Wangen, die Türme der Münchner Frauenkirche, den Londoner Nebel! In Saseks Büchern wird der Text durch Bilder ausgedrückt. Der knappe und treffende Text ist mit seinen wenigen Worten eigentlich die kleine Illustration zur Zeichnung. Sasek kehrte die Funktionen von Wort und Bild einfach um. Der Maler liebt die Städte in ihrer Pracht, ihrem Stolz und ihrer Tradition, ihre Strassen und Boulevards, ihre Plätze und ihre Prachtgebäude. Trotzdem bleibt ihm immer Zeit, in die Vergessenheit abzuschweifen, verträumte Gässchen ausfindig zu machen. Auch sie sind ein Teil des modernen, brodelnden Babylons. Er nimmt sich auch die Zeit, den Menschen zu finden, die lebenssprühende Masse der Gross128 [pageend128]städte, Kaufleute und Arbeiter, Bürofräuleins, Polizisten, königliche Gardisten, Mädchen, Matrosen, Milchhändler, Redner, Reisende, Wartende und Abreisende, in Droschken, U-Bahnen, Autobussen, Wagen und Kinderwagen. . . . Es sind keine Papiermenschen, sie leben ebenso in der kindlichen Phantasie wie in der Wirklichkeit, in ihrer ganzen Menschlichkeit. Sasek hat als Exilant die Verbindung zu seiner Heimat verloren, was ihn aber eigentlich befreite und weshalb ihm so viel Liebe, Verständnis und Entdeckungsgeist für andere Städte und fremde Menschen übrigbleibt: Sasek ist einer von ihnen und doch auch nicht. Die Bücher Saseks haben das gleiche Schicksal wie das Kinderbuch von dem Hündchen Daschenka seines Landsmanns Karel Capek: die jungen Leser und Beschauer bekommen sie erst in die Hand, wenn sie die Eltern selbst gelesen und angesehen haben. Das sind wohl die besten Bücher für die Jugend. Saseks Bücher entfalten wie kein Reiseführer und keine Photographie die bunte, weite Welt. Jaromir Mestan LES ECRIVAINS EN EXIL (Ra d io Br u s s e l s, 4. Ma i 1962) — Gerrit van de Wiele a assisté hier soir ä une réunion des écrivains en exil? — En effet, á ľinitiative de la Section des Écrivains en Exil du P.E.N. Club International, une soiree de con- férence-débat a eu lieu hier soir dans les salons du Centre Culturel Européen ä Bruxelles, 213, avenue Moliere, sur le thěme : “Ľécrivain en exil dans le monde ďaujourďhui”. Cette conférence était présidée par Miss Margaret Storm Jameson, Vice-Présidente du P.E.N. Club International. Comme orateurs, nous avons note la présence de MM. 129 [pageend129]J. Gorkin, écrivain espagnol, K. A. Jelenski, écrivain et journaliste polonais et P. Tabori, délégué permanent du Centre des Ecrivains en Exil. Divers problémes ont été examines, entr’autres la question des ecrivains en exil qui ont pour devoir de défendre les idées de leurs confreres restés dans leur pays et qu’ils ne peuvent pas y exposer, ainsi que la question de la formation originelle de ľauteur qui n’est pas dénaturée par ľobligation d’écrire dans une autre langue que la langue maternelle. A la premiere de ces questions Mr. Jelenski a répondu que les ecrivains en exil ont choisi ľexil pré- cisement pour pouvoir rester au-mémes. En liaison avec le deuxiěme probléme Mr. Gorkin a affirmé que sa formation spirituelle et měme son style ont subi 1’influence du travail ďidées qui rěgnent dans les pays oů il a trouvé asile. — Quelle est votre impression personnelle au sujet de ces questions ? — Ce qui m’a profondément impressionné est ľimportance que ces ecrivains en exil attachent ä leur langue maternelle. En ce qui concerne Mr. Gorkin la situation est speciále. Il reside hors d’Espagne, mais peut publier en espagnol en Amérique du Sud. Mais pour les Hongrois, Polonais, Tchěques, etc. qui étaient présents il est apparu que ľimpossibilité de s’exprimer dans leur langue est ce qu’il y a de pire dans leur exil. Toute autre langue — qu’ils parlent d’ailleurs trěs cor- rectement — reste un simple moyen de communication, mais leur langue maternelle était la langue dans laquelle ils sentaient, pensaient, par laquelle ils prenaient racine dans la societě. Leur langue maternelle était la langue dans laquelle ils puisaient Part d’écrire — maintenant ils doivent tout traduire. — Parlez toute langue que vous voulez, disait une femme auteur ágée, mais une maman ne parlera jamais a son enfant dans une langue étrangěre. . . car dans ce cas il s’agit de bien plus qu’un simple moyen de communication. C’est ici, disait-elle, que débute Part de s’exprimer. 130 [pageend130]INTERNATIONAL P.E.N. Ir in a Iv in s k a y a , the twenty-one-year-old ‘adopted daughter’ of Boris Pasternak, was sentenced in December 1960 at a secret trial to three years’ imprisonment for illegal currency offences; at the same trial her mother, Olga Ivinskaya, who was the close friend and literary collaborator of Boris Pasternak, the poet and author of the Nobel Prize winning novel ‘Dr. Zhivago’, was sentenced to eight years. These sentences greatly shocked opinion in the West, and many protests were made both by individuals and by national and international cultural bodies, including International P.E.N. It has now been reported and confirmed by Mrs. Furtseva, the Soviet Minister of Culture, that Irina Ivinskaya has been freed from a Soviet Labour Camp after serving only half her three-year sentence. It is believed that her mother has been transferred from a labour camp to a prison hospital where she is living in reasonable conditions. The following telegram has been sent by the General Secretary, Mr. David Carver, for International P.E.N. on behalf of its thousands of members throughout the world : ‘N. F. Kruschev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the U.S.S.R., Moscow. Members of International P.E.N. throughout the world rejoice at release of Irina Ivinskaya. Believe this act of clemency is a significant contribution to international amity and understanding. (signed) David Carver, General Secretary, International P.E.N.’ Ma n c h e s t e r Ev e n in g Ne w s about Ar e n a : It has a great appeal for serious lovers of literature, offering poetry, plays, reviews, stories, and intellectual opinions in several languages. Highbrow. 131 [pageend131]OUR CONTRIBUTORS Dr a g o mir NENOFF was born in Bulgaria.

Cr ist o OGNYANOV, a poet, born 1911, at Tressontche, Macedonia. Collaborator of Sofia newspaper ‘Zora’. Graduated from Sofia University in law; at Innsbruck University won degree in political sciences. His books include “Südwinde” (Sofia, 1938) and “The journey” (Munich, 1954).

Translator of Valéry’s ‘Charmes’ and ‘La Jeune Parque’ into Bulgarian, also of French, German, English, American, Italian, Hungarian and Russian authors. Adapted ‘My Fair Lady’ in Bulgarian. Mic h a e l PADEV was born in Bulgaria and became one of its best-known newspaperman. He was the correspondent of The Times and of the Daily Express when war broke out, was sent to a concentration camp because of his anti-Nazi attitude, escaped to Turkey and later went to England where he spent the last three years of the war. His ‘Escape from the Balkans’ from which we have taken a chapter was published by Cassell & Co. in 1943. Padev served for several years on the executive of the P.E.N. Centre for Writers in Exile and was the original editor of our first anthology. In the early fifties he went to the United States and became foreign editor of an important group of papers in Arizona. He now lives in Washington as a foreign affairs expert; he has visited Europe and Russia in the last year or so. 132 [pageend132]Vl a d imir KOSTETSKY (see Arena No. 8.). Born in Russia in 1895 and after matriculating in 1913, entered the famous Mikhail Artillery Academy. On graduating, he fought on many fronts in the First World War. When the army disintegrated due to the Russian Revolution, he joined General Kornilov and fought on the side of the Whites against the Reds (taking part in the famous “Ice March”). He ended his Army career with the rank of Colonel. He has also studied at the Sorbonne in Paris and has worked on various Russian émigré papers and magazines. His first work was published in 1921 and since then he has been a regular contributor to many émigré publications. He now lives in New York. His story “Adam, I and ‘Kapitashá’ ” shared Third Prize in the Short Story Competition organized by the International Writers Fund of P.E.N. Ge o r g e SAVA (the pseudonym of Dr. GEORGE BANKOFF) was born in 1908. Educated in Bulgaria and Russia, at the Russian Imperial Naval Academy; studied medicine at Paris, Florence, Rome, Munich, Berlin, Bonn, Manchester, Edinburgh and Glasgow. His many books include the famous bestseller ‘The Healing Knife’, ‘A Surgeon’s Destiny’, ‘Donkey’s Serenade’, ‘Surgeon’s Symphony’, ‘A Tale of Ten Cities’, ‘A Ring at the Door’, ‘Valley of Forgotten People’, ‘Rasputin Speaks’, ‘Gipsy’, ‘Call it Life’. A brilliant plastic surgeon and researcher, Sava divides his life between literature and medicine. His home is in England but he travels a great deal. Jo h a n n e s EDFELT, President of the Swedish P.E.N. Club, was born at Skaraborgslän, in December 1904 and is both poet and critic. His early work, we are told, breathed typical twentieth-century pessimism and defeatism but with Hög- mässa, matured into more positive values: contemplative resignation and faith in man’s essential powers of endurance. His style is laconic but forceful. Edfelt has also translated much English and German lyric poetry and edited the works of Maxim Gorky and Agnes von Krusenstjerna. His books include Gdy mingröst er (1923), Unga dagar (1925), Ansikten (1929), Aftonunderhällning (1932), I denna natt (1936), Jär- nälder (1937), Vintem ärlang (1939), Sang, for reskamrater (1941), Elden och klyftan (1943), Braddjupt eko (1947) and the essays Strövtag (1941). 133 [pageend133]Je a n SCHLUMBERGER, a vice-president of International P.E.N., was born at Guebwiller, an Alsatian Protestant, in 1877. He was a friend of Gide whose psychological curiosity and moral preoccupations he shared. But with him this state of mental disquiet usually falls into a pattern of tranquillity, thanks to a moral sense, which relates him to the ‘heroic’ tradition of Corneille. His style is quiet and disciplined and the natural nobility of his character shows itself at its best in his finest novel, Saint-Saturnin (1931), the tragic story of a family. His many books include the novels Ľ inquiét e pater- nité (1913), Un homme heureux (1923), L’enjant qui s’ac- cuse (1927), Les yeux de 18 ans (1928); Histoire de 4 poitiers (1935), and the essays Plaisir ä Corneille (1936), Jalons (1941), Nouveaux jalons (1943). The two essays we publish are taken from the two last-named books. Al a st a ir GUINAN is a member of the Department of English, Hunter College of the City of New York. He has contributed articles and essays to The Polish Review, The Downside Review, The Harvard Theological Review and other journals, and is the translator of numerous volumes from the French. Pa u l TABORI, born 1908 in Budapest, was Chairman of the P.E.N. Centre for Writers in Exile 1954-57 and has been since then its Permanent International Delegate. A novelist, broadcaster, screen and television writer, he was educated in Hungary and Switzerland, obtaining a Ph. D. in Berlin and a doctorate of Economics and Political Science in Budapest. In Hungary he worked as an editor, translator, literary agent and author of over fifty books for boys. He was also the Hungarian translator of Priestley, Hugh Walpole, Dreiser, Aldous Huxley, H. G. Wells, Jakob Wassermann, Fannie Hurst and many others. He settled in London in 1937 and was, successively or simultaneously, assistant editor of World Review, diplomatic correspondent, Britanova, film critic, Daily Mail and European editor of Atlas Features Ltd. (Reuter’s) for whom he made a long tour of the Middle East and the Balkans just after the war. Contract writer for Sir Alexander Korda, 1943-48, in Hollywood 1950-51, Tabori wrote thirty feature pictures and over a hundred TV films. Of his forty English books (which have been translated into seventeen languages) the most recent are “The Natural Science of 134 [pageend134]Stupidity”, “The Art of Folly”, “The Green Rain” and three forthcoming works called “Companions of the Unseen”, “The Book of Hands” and “The Cleft”. ARENA NEWS A. Guershoon Colin’s essay “Ivan Bunin in Retrospect” which we published in our last issue was reprinted, in a shortened version, by kind permission of the Editorial Board of The Slavonic and East European Review. The plans for interrupting the sequence of national anthologies, for the sake of greater variety, is well advanced. The next number will be devoted to poetry (edited mainly by J. C. Arkay), and, while we intend to continue our series of anthologies, there will also be numbers devoted to the short story (edited by Ivan Jelinek), to books by exiled writers in the manuscript stage (to be edited by Dénes Kovács), and Velta Snikere plans to provide a ‘surprise’ number. Dénes Kovacs (who can be contacted c/o the Népszava Newspaper, 3, Kenton Street, London W.C.l) plans to act as an unpaid literary agent by displaying the best that our writers can offer : he wishes to publish largish chunks from unpublished manuscripts and circulate copies of Arena among publishers, etc.; since he would also like to print a directory of authors and their works available for publication, it is requested that those of our members who can contribute to such an issue should contact him as soon as possible. Since we have reached what we can legitimately call the second phase in the history of our magazine, we have decided to ask for manuscripts which our readers think may be suitable for Ar e n a . We address this request to all our readers, whether members of the Centre for Writers in Exile or not. Manuscripts should be sent to J. C. Arkay (71 Stanley Road, East Sheen, London, S.W.14); those accompanied by stamped 135 [pageend135]self-addressed envelopes (or containing international reply coupons) will be returned to their authors if not accepted for publication. Let us conclude, (as ever!), on a note of warning: the problems of translation interfered considerably when attempting to compile a number devoted to what is understood by the conservative when he hears the word ‘poetry’ : we had to play with our definitions, extend areas covered by dictionary definitions and pretend that all good writing was, in fact, poetry — if it was also evocative in the poetic sense. Although some of the prose in the issue is devoted to the problems of poetry, we hope to provide items which may (very superficially) look like prose, and (we contend) are not. However, (to whet appetites), we are glad to confess that we have also found a large number of very fine poems,— possibly a few that will even be remembered. And we have discovered a new poet.
