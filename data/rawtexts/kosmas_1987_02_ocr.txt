ABSOLON, co-author of the essay on Slavic influences to be found in the work of Johannes Brahms, holds an M.D. diploma from Yale University and a Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota. A well-renowned specialist in the field of medicine, especially cardiology, Dr. Absolon has extensively researched the life of another famous surgeon of the XIXth Century whose hobby had been classical music: Theodore Billroth. He also published several studies on this theme. WLADYSLAW ADAMSKI is a well-known Polish social scientist who earned his Ph.D. in Journalism and Political Science at the University of Warsaw. He joined the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences and was director of the sociological section of this institute until 1981, when martial law was introduced in Poland. Dr. Adamski studied and researched in the fields of sociology of work and education, in Poland and Eastern Europe, as well as in the West including the United States. This effort yielded several volumes and numerous articles, written or edited by him in Polish, Russian, German, French and English. He also launched and edited the English-language review Sysiphus dedicated to Polish sociological studies. Since 1980, he has acted as Project Director of a multidisciplinary survey series “The Poles in the ’80s”. Dr. Adamski’s contribution to the present issue of Kosmas is based on data acquired from these surveys. ARNOLD KATZ earned his Ph.D. in Economics from Yale University and worked as analyst and advisor with the U.S. Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Board of Governors of [pageend5]iv KOSMAS the Federal Reserve System in Washington, D.C. He is now Professor of Economics at the University of Pittsburgh. His research and publications in various fields of economics include application of economic statistics, unemployment, and worker’s participation in management. The extensive field work which Dr. Katz has undertaken in Yugoslavia drew his attention, among others, to the problem of compatibility or “congeniality” of economic mechanisms with the different socio-political orders and systems. The essay published here is complementary to the paper presented by Dr. Mencinger to the Bicentennial International Symposium on Global Structural Change in Pittsburgh in March 1987, and to a large extent based on observations made by Dr. Katz during his scientific visits in Belgrade, Ljubljana and Zagreb. ERNST KERN, principal author of the essay on the Slavic elements in the musical work of Johannes Brahms, is Professor and Chairman at the Department of Surgery of the Medical School of Würzburg University in West Germany. He is a recognized student of Brahms and himself a chamber music player. In addition to his writings related to his professional specialization as surgeon, which we will not mention here, Dr. Kern published extensively on Brahms in various musical journals of the world. Among them, his essay “Dokumente der Freundschaft: Johannes Brahms und Theodore Billroth,” printed in Musica vol. XII, 1958, was listed in the repertory New Grove’s. CSABA MAKÓ holds a Ph.D. in Sociology from Lorand Eötvös University in Budapest, as well as the diploma of Candidate of Sciences. At present, he is Research Director at the Institute of Sociology of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. His areas of specialization include organizational sociology and sociology of management, with particular emphasis on workers’ participation and control. He carried out several theoretical and empirical studies of problems related to these areas and published a great number of analytical articles, in Hungarian, French, German, and English. His essay on the institution of enterprise councils, recently established in Hungary, is part of the material dealt with at the Bicentennial Symposium in Pittsburgh in March 1987. JOŽE MENCINGER is Associate Professor of Economics at the Law School of Edvard Kardelj University in Ljubljana, Yugoslavia. He received his M.A. diploma in Economics from the Institute of Economics in Belgrade and his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. The most important subjects of his scientific interest, research and study are labor economics, economics of dis- [pageend6]ABOUT OUR AUTHORS V equilibria and comparative economic systems. Dr. Mencinger has published in these subfields both in Yugoslavia and in the West. His educational background and research experience, which comprise elements from both East and West, make him an authority in matters of evaluation of the performance of the Yugoslav economic system and mode of economic management. Dr. Mencinger’s discussion of the overall record and prospects of the socialist market economy, which we carry in this issue of Kosmas, stems equally from the transactions of the Bicentennial Symposium of the University of Pittsburgh, held in March 1987. OTAKAR JAROSLAV POLLAK is a retired pathologist, interested in all branches of his profession, including history of medicine. He received his M.D. and RNDr (Doctor of Natural Sciences) diplomas from Masaryk University in Brno, Czechoslovakia. He held important posts at hospitals in Czechoslovakia and the United States. He also taught and researched at Masaryk University, Harvard Medical School in Boston, Women’s Medical College, and Hahnemann Medical College in Philadelphia. Of his 233 publications, 150, including two books, deal with various aspects of atherosclerosis. He initiated the American Society for the Study of Arteriorsclerosis and during 14 years was its secretary treasurer, vice-president, and president. He also created similar societies in Argentina, Italy, and Japan, and received many honorary memberships and a Lasker Award. Since 1969 he has edited Monographs on Atherosclerosis. The second article on J.E. Purkyně, which we include in this edition of our Journal, is a collective work of Dr. Pollak and two of his Czechoslovak colleagues: Dr. Ivo Steiner from Pardubice in Bohemia, and Dr. Josef Šajner from Brno. I HOMAS SOI ÍK is Assistant Professor of Music Theory in the School of Music at North Texas State University. He received his Ph.D. from The Ohio State University. His particular area of specialization is the history of music theory in Central Europe during the Medieval and Renaissance eras. His doctoral dissertation includes the first translation and critique of the first music treatises printed in the Czech language. Dr. Sovik is presently translating Latin music treatises written by Czechs during the Renaissance. He plans to publish these translations, with as much biographical information about their authors as possible, as a history of music theory during the Czech Renaissance. The material included herein is therefore to be viewed as a small part of a much larger project. JAN ŠVEJNAR acquired his Ph.D. in Economics at Princeton University. He is Professor of Economics at the University of Pitts[pageend7]KOSMAS burgh and Director of the Program on Participation and Labor- Managed Systems, as well as of the Program on Comparative Economic Development, at Cornell University. Dr. Svejnar has an impressive record of research work in many developing countries of the world, as well as in the United States and Europe. He is author and co-author of several volumes and articles dealing with the problem of economic performance of participatory, labor- and selfmanaged firms. His study included in this issue of Kosmas was submitted to the Bicentennial Symposium at the University of Pittsburgh in March 1987 as theoretical comment and counterpart to the presentation made by Dr. Makó. [pageend8]THE ACID TEST: RIVAL SYSTEMS FACING GLOBAL CHALLENGE The Editor The following five items represent a selection from the material submitted to a symposium which was part of a conference series held on the occasion of the bicentennial of the University of Pittsburgh, in March 1987. The central theme of the series was “Global Structural Change.’’ The symposium that yielded the five essays here focussed on the specific approaches adopted by the two main types of socioeconomic systems—capitalism and socialism—to the problems of global restructuring. Your editor had the privilege to organize and to chair this symposium, as well as to make the concluding comments on the various presentations and discussions. The subsequent few lines sum up the essential points addressed by his comments. In addition to the contributions published in this issue and dealing with the experience of three nations of Central and Eastern Europe— Hungary, Poland, and Yugoslavia—the symposium heard also presentations by two social scientists coming from the Soviet Union. If we did not include the latter, it was not because they would not be interesting enough or pertinent to the main theme of the session. On the contrary, already the point in time at which they were written and presented made them highly topical: they coincided with the discussion, still alive in the USSR, on the thus far most radical program of economic and social reforms. These reforms are often justified by their proponents on the grounds that the Soviet economy [pageend9]2 KOSMAS and society have to adjust to significant changes occurring on a global scale. However, much as the input from the Soviet participants was relevant to the principal concern of the symposium, we felt bound to respect the subject area of our journal, circumscribed by the boundaries of Czechoslovakia and Central Europe. This limitation, on the other hand, gave us an opportunity to highlight some particular lessons and insights which the symposium had yielded. The challenge posed by the continuing globalization of industrial economy to various socioeconomic systems took in the three communist party-states, from where our selection originated, some very special forms. It was met too, in each single of them, by a special set of responses. These responses, whether or not adequate, in turn testified to the degree of adaptability to external change, but also to the resilience of the idiosyncratic national political cultures. Distinct political cultures continue to co-determine the subjective perception of the global challenge, and thus also the choice of the policies aiming at its mastery. It can be argued that in handling the problems exposed in the following essays, the “real socialism” system built on the Soviet model, which prevails in Central Europe today, undergoes an important test of its own viability. In more general terms, it could be also argued that this test reveals the significance (and the limits of the significance) of the socioeconomic system as a variable in the process of universal social change. It is easy—and our readers undoubtedly will concur—to read the papers included in this issue as an admission that the “classical" or “dogmatic” type of socialism, inspired by the Soviet model (even though it may have deviated from its model in some important ways) has failed in all three cases under discussion, and as an indication of serious and insistent search for its replacement. In all three instances the awareness is keen that very far-reaching reforms are necessary. In the case of Yugoslavia the incisiveness of the critique suggests that these may go even deeper, that the very premises on which the system had been built are open to question. That is momentous indeed: the doubt appears to be the most gnawing there where, unlike in Hungary, Poland or Czechoslovakia, the examination and the reforms in the past had been the least inhibited by foreign interference. To summarize, the testimony of the scholars from the three socialist countries appears to support the position that socialism—of whatever vintage—as a suitable socioeconomic order for industrial societies is still sub iudice, that it still owes the world the proof of being able to better solve the economic and social problems of industrial civilization. [pageend10]THE ACID TEST 3 Does this mean, in and by itself, that its major rival, capitalism, has been vindicated without qualification? Had the crisis of the socialist world occurred some twenty years earlier, many analysts might have been prone to answer in the affirmative. At that time the confrontation of the two systems could have been viewed as a zero-sum game: a loss or failure of one became automatically a gain or success of the other. Even then it would have been an oversimplification, also in reverse: to see the weaknesses and problems of industrial market economies, such as recessions, depressions and unemployment, as vindicating the institutions of public ownership of the means of production and central planning has from the start been a non sequitur, a case of faulty logic. Today, however, oversimplifications of this kind would be patently absurd. Today, the two types of the organization of industrial economies do not only challenge each other; they are both challenged by a third partner in a trilateral interaction, namely global structural change and the emergent universal industrial system, where the markets—including the labor markets, absolutely vital on account of their political sensitivity—are becoming global, too. The irreversible trend towards the globalization of the modern economy is further reinforced by the parallel process of technological change with which it is closely connected. For example, only the recent progress of informative and communicative techniques made it possible for the enterprises in the advanced nations to tap the labor reserves in the less developed countries; multinational corporations, too, can successfully operate only thanks to the sophisticated new methods of communication. This process, among others, puts to serious doubt some assumptions, believed to be almost axiomatic by many and constituting the backbone of various economic and social theories, for instance the belief that employment opportunity will always approximate—except at the downturn of the economic cycle—the number of people willing to work. Curiously enough, this expectation played an important role not only in the classical schools of liberal or "laissez- faire” economics. The assumption that workers will always be needed in large numbers and that they will always work in large teams in the same place, which is but a variant of the former assumption, has since the times of Karl Marx inspired the strategy of the workers’ movement, both economic (unions) and political (socialist and communist parties). The recent structural employment crisis in the smoke-stack industries, such as coal and steel, seems to teach us a different lesson. Technological change—less use for the typical product of heavy industry—deprived the organized workforce of much of its leverage. [pageend11]4 KOSMAS Furthermore, the employers have now access not only to national labor reserves but also to those in other parts of the world. The most modern employment sectors exhibit a completely new pattern of the organization of the workplace, either because they belong to the category of services, where by the very definition the workers are seldom massed by hundreds or thousands at the same site, or because the new technologies, even in manufacturing, allow or require the worker to perform his or her duties in isolation from others. These circumstances greatly reduce the opportunity to easily and quickly mobilize the workers for collective action, which had been taken for granted by the founders of the workers movement. They also make the workers much less eager to join a formal interest group. This should provide food for thought to those who keep subscribing to the original Marxist theory of class struggle and revolution. However, the by far most essential fact in the present phase of the competition between the socioeconomic systems is a major change, or rather complication, of the original stakes. Instead of merely showing their ability to perform to the satisfaction of the largest number possible of social actors, that is, to produce goods and services in sufficient quantity and acceptable quality, and to distribute them equitably, which previously had been the main criterion in the East- West rivalry, the socioeconomic systems today have to show how well they are adapted, and how adequately they respond, to the globalization of the hitherto nationally circumscribed needs and problems of industrial economy: investment and control of the means of production, access to raw materials, outlets for manufactured goods, labor markets, etc. It has become more or less common knowledge that in the earlier phase of this contest the system instituted in the USSR and Central and Eastern Europe did not fare well. Now it has been conceded by its own representatives; indeed, Western observers often seem not to fully realize how deeply has the awareness of the inadequacy of "real socialism'' penetrated the thinking of the elites of the communist party-states. At the same time, in the perception of their own crisis, there appears to transpire the notion of the inability of the system to meet the challenge of the globalized economy. If it is truly so they could, despite their formidable predicament, have an edge over the defendants of the status quo in the privately owned market system who continue to believe that "business as usual’’ is the answer. The complex and awesome defy of globalization tests the socioeconomic systems as to their adaptability to change, not solely as to their standard performance with "other things remaining equal.’’ Thus it lays bare an important denominator, common to all of them: modern [pageend12]THE ACID TEST 5 socioeconomic systems, namely, represent distinct strategies how to respond to the forces of the market. This particular property of socioeconomic systems has not always been obvious to economists and sociologists. It is the current transition from a motley of more or less self-contained national markets to an universal market which brings it into the focus of attention. There is little doubt that, face to the globalization process, the definition of socioeconomic systems as strategies aiming at the control of the market mechanisms appears much more meaningful than when the systems are seen as mere variants of ownership relations (We would even argue that their approach to the markets has always and under all conditions been their most essential distinction). One of the fundamental dimensions of the contemporary crisis of the economies of “real socialism” is the now universally perceived insufficiency of the state-owned and bureaucratically operated production and distribution networks to meet the demands of modern societies, together with the unwillingness or reluctance to abandon the emphasis on ownership title and political control of economic life. It among others betrays the ignorance—possibly deliberate—of what truly matters in advanced industrial nations when the markets are becoming global. Successful adaptation of socialist economies would certainly involve the acceptance of inequality of rewards and expose whole categories of social actors to the risk offailure with the inevitable economic penalties. The resistance which the reformers in all countries of “real socialism,” including Czechoslovakia, have thus far encountered on the part of the establishment has often been justified by the opponents of reforms as legitimate concern about the weak and about equality in general. Equality has been presented by them as a supreme value, not only as part of the Socialist credo but also as a heritage of the American and French revolutions. There is, however, an alternative and admittedly more plain, if not cynical, explanation of this continuing opposition: it may be rather the resistance of an entrenched privileged elite which is unwilling to part with one of the most vital sources of power, namely the control of the economy. Not equality is for them at stake here (which anyway must appear as a farce if the privileges of the nomenclature are considered) but the grip of the party-state over every individual, which would be seriously weakened if the actors could in one way or other co-determine their economic situation. It is not the compassion for eventual victims of the market forces, but a desperate effort to maintain the hold over the weak and the helpless who in fact have been rendered weak and helpless by the system itself. [pageend13]6 KOSMAS A necessary condition of the success of any reform in the orbit of “real socialism’’ is the recognition of the basic dilemma of modern societies, of the price to be paid for progress in freedom. It is the readiness of both the governing and the governed to live with uncertainty. Yet this applies to all systems without exception. As we have suggested earlier, there seems to be a certain paradox in the fact that the proponents of the reforms in the socialist universe—the mighty opposition they have to deal with notwithstanding—see this necessity very clearly, perhaps more clearly than their counterparts in the countries where the means of production are privately owned. The illusions of the latter about the strength and sovereignty of national economies which actually are rapidly dwindling, continuing appeal to obsolete remedies in the face of unprecedented problems generated by the globalization, among which isolationism and protectionism are not lacking, parallel and sometimes even outdo the obstinacy of the conservative dogmatists in the communist party-states. While the “first round’’ of the great confrontation of the socioeconomic systems yielded an indisputable proof of the superiority of the market-oriented, private-initiative based order over the bureaucratic economies of “real socialism,’’ both systems now enter the new phase, the phase of globality, with handicaps. Although the challenge is of different nature, the prize nevertheless remains the same: the systems must show to what extent they can secure—this time under the conditions of an economy that ignores national boundaries—human life in dignity, free from want and oppression. Maybe the greatest difficulty here will be the need to give up thinking in national terms, to abandon the dreams about national oases where economic problems could be resolved in isolation from the rest of the world, or simply ignored. This need, it cannot be emphasized enough,concerns both major types of the modern socioeconomic system. Particularistic, narrow horizons are not the monopoly of Western Europe, Africa, or Latin America. The systems established in the former Russian empire and in Central and Eastern Europe on the Soviet model would not be so deeply entrenched today if they had not profited of the seclusion behind the walls of sovereign nation-states. In this part of the world these walls took a very concrete and ominous form of what came to be known as the Iron Curtain. Overcoming such barriers may be even more difficult than surmounting the age-long habit of parochial thinking to which the leaders of the national states have been subject. The task will be rendered still more delicate by the circumstance that in the USSR and other communist states the bottled-up, suppressed nationalism is now coming to the fore, along with other important [pageend14]THE ACID TEST 7 aspirations, political and economic, of the various populations. It may interfere with—and even threaten—the success of any reform. Yet there is no escape from this dilemma. The global challenge can be met only by instruments and policies which are commensurate, that is, also global. In the East, as in the West, this will be the acid test of the viability of all basic social institutions. [pageend15]EDUCATION AND ASPIRATIONS VS. WORK OPPORTUNITIES: THE YOUNG GENERATION OF POLES IN COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE Wladystaw Adamski 1. Main Trends of Demographic and Educational Development in Postwar Eastern and Western Europe In most European societies after the end of World War II, we have observed an almost spectacular rejuvenation of the population. However, due to the fact that human losses were not the same everywhere, the impact of the “baby boom” has been different in different parts of Europe. Since the late fifties the age cohorts belonging to the category of youth have become much more prominent and their importance has been felt much more in the Eastern than in the Western part of the continent. What really mattered from the point of view of the employment chances for youth was not only the absolute growth of the age cohorts that belong to the ascending generations, but above all the ratio between the ascending cohorts (15-29 years of age) and the established cohorts (30-59 years of age), as well as the variations in this ratio as it changed from one decade to another. The available data demonstrate the following regularities, which are fairly important from the point of view already mentioned:1 In the first postwar decade, (until the late fifties), the highest proportion 9 [pageend16]10 KOSMAS of youth in society was found in Eastern Europe—particularly in Romania and Yugoslavia, where the numbers of young, ascending cohorts almost equalled all the older, established cohorts put together.2 This picture changed substantially in the seventies and eighties: now the most impressive ratio of rejuvenation developed on the one hand in Poland, and on the other in the Netherlands.5 The lowest ratio of youth to the rest of the population is currently found, for the Western part of Europe, in Sweden and the Federal Republic of Germany, and for the East, in Hungary and Romania. This may simply be evidence that in those countries the pressure of demographic factors on employ ment is especially weak.4 To the extent that the ratio in the eighties changed in comparison to the seventies, the highest increase was again shown in Eastern Europe, mostly in Czechoslovakia, followed by Bulgaria and the GDR. In the West in this respect, stagnant or decreasing tendencies prevail.5 However, when we try to correlate both the rates of absolute growth of youth cohorts and the variations in their proportion to the total over time. Poland exhibits the strongest cumulative and long lasting effects of the process of demographic rejuvenation. Among these the pattern which deserves special comment is mostly linked to the cases of pronounced rejuvenation and their social implications. It goes without saying that any sudden increase or fluctuation in the size of youth cohorts must exert a heavy pressure on older generations of a given society and on its state social policy as well. It is quite obvious that this pressure will also affect the educational system. How successful have the countries of Eastern Europe been in coping with the demographic tide? To properly interpret the statistics relevant to their educational development, one has to take into account at least two. historically specific, social determinants: 1.) An enormous cost of reconstruction of national economies, which had been virtually destroyed by the war. 2.) The need for most East European nations to build up and modernize not only their educational sy stems but. first of all. their backward, or for all practical purposes non-existent industries. W’hat has been achieved in the postwar period given these circumstances might justly be called an educational revolution. For the contemporary youth of Eastern Europe it meant, above all. a broadening of opportunities for secondary, general and/or vocational education to the point where it became universally accessible. Not equally impressive, but nevertheless notable progress has been made in opening the institutions of higher education to children from peasant and worker families. [pageend17]EDUCATION AND ASPIRATIONS VS. OPPORTUNITIES 11 When trying to compare East and West European ratios of student enrollments, one should keep in mind not only the relative weight of the youth cohorts in demographic terms, but also the levels of economic development of the various nations. Except for Sweden, the countries of Western Europe show on the average slightly better ratios of post secondary schooling than does Eastern Europe. But one must not overlook such facts as that of the German Democratic Republic showing better educational achievements than the Federal Republic, or Bulgaria and Poland in this respect ranking better than,or equal to, the United Kingdom. As for the socialist countries, one might also refer to the chances of women to accede to education which shows Eastern Europe in a favorable light. Except for Yugoslavia, these chances are equal, or even higher than in Western Europe, where the system is highly selective (except in Scandinavia). Why have the educational policies of people’s democracies, since the very beginning, been so much concerned with the equalizing functions of the school system? The first reason was the need to rebuild the social stratum of the intelligentsia and to commit this stratum to the goals set forth by the social revolution. In order to achieve this objective, a system of privileged treatment for students of worker and peasant origin was established. Beside introducing special admission procedures, such as a “social premium” for applicants coming from working class and peasant families (1), the most instrumental factor in this respect appears to have been a particular, carefully developed system of evening and external [nonresident] courses for young employees desirous of completing their secondary or higher education. The development of special schooling for working people has been quite impressive in Eastern Europe. On the eve of the eighties, the proportion of students enrolled in external programs was the highest in Hungary and Poland. This type of student constituted more than one third of the total student body in those countries, while in the German Democratic Republic and Romania their share has recently dropped to the level of one fifth of the whole student population. Despite this downward trend, there is no doubt that the enlarged system of external studies has substantially enhanced the overall educational chances of the young generations. This holds true especially if we consider the system of education to be a vehicle of intragenerational mobility. The empirical data at hand (2) allow us to conclude that the educational achievements of young East Europeans have dramatically surpassed the level of the education reached by their fathers’ gen[pageend18]12 KOSMAS eration. This conclusion is true for all the countries observed, except in the case of Czechoslovakia, where significant differences between age cohorts appear only on the lowest level of education. However, the most impressive achievements in this respect are those on the secondary level of schooling, which proves that a serious generational gap in education was created first in Bulgaria, then in Hungary and Poland. 2. The Workplace and the Revolution of Rising Expectations Among Young Employees: Poland, as Compared to Hungary and Czechoslovakia One would expect that, being in such a privileged position concerning education, the younger generations in Eastern Europe would display nothing but sheer enthusiasm about what they were able to achieve. Unfortunately for the politicians, the relevant empirical evidence does not confirm that expectation. In all three countries under study there is still a remarkable gap between the level of schooling attained and the aspirations among gainfully employed youth to enhance it further. This concerns higher education above all. The desire to acquire university or equivalent credentials seems to be strong enough in any socialist society, but it might come as a surprise that on the one hand, this aspiration is relatively weak in Czechoslovakia, and that on the other hand, it seems to be unusually strong in Poland. If we try to assess the social dynamism revealed by the aspirations to further education [See table 1], the following pattern appears: 1. When compared to their Czech and Hungarian counterparts, the Polish age cohort under 30, while less often possessing a university diploma, includes twice as large a proportion of secondary school graduates: 2. What substantially differentiates the national samples is the level of desired education: while the Czechs and the Hungarians reveal a rather modest level of expectation in this respect [about three times higher than that achieved in reality], among the Poles the ratio of university aspirations surpasses the level of actual educational attainment more than seven times. 3. Comparing the most striking aspects of educational goals in both their real and their desired dimensions, we feel entirely justified in concluding that, unlike the Czechs and the Hungarians, whose aspirations were more or less evenly distributed, the young Polish workers with their extremely strong commitment to further education show quite a different pattern of behavior. Among the factors that might be identified [pageend19]EDUCATION AND ASPIRATIONS VS. OPPORTUNITIES 13 Aspirations: Poland as Compared to Hungary and Czechoslovakia Table 1.

Shubkin, Budapest 1980. as the sources of relatively higher aspirations, and also of keener disappointments for young Polish workers, probably the most important is the fact of the limited career opportunities available to all school leavers in Poland. These affect especially those who were forced to choose the vocational programs of post-compulsory education. This will come out quite clearly when we try to compare the educational backgrounds of the Polish and the Czechoslovak samples and a set of socio-occupational positions acquired by both groups of young professionals in the workplace [Table 2].

Source: see Table 1. KOSMAS [pageend21]EDUCATION AND ASPIRATIONS VS. OPPORTUNITIES 15 of this comparison will contribute significantly to our understanding of the current dissatisfaction with their job assignments among Polish professionals. In contrast to their Czech and Slovak counterparts, they were on the average assigned to relatively lower ranks and positions. It holds true, above all, for the graduates of secondary general and secondary vocational schools. While their Czech colleagues of equal educational levels nearly always enjoyed the very prestigious status of “white-collar workers with professional qualification," the majority of the Poles with cither of these educational credentials had good reasons to consider themselves downgraded or underemployed. The lot of graduates with basic vocational education should draw our special attention. While in Czechoslovakia a substantial percentage of these graduates were placed in white collar positions, in Poland almost all of them entered the ranks of blue- collar workers, thus creating a separate generational stratum within the working class. Such a serious discrepancy between the skills provided by vocational education and the skill requirements of the positions offered, could not but negatively influence the occupational and social attitudes of young graduates of the vocational schools. Again, the crucial question is why in Czechoslovakia there was no such sharp discontinuity between the skills learned in the vocational schools and those needed in the workplace, as in Poland? Was educational planning in the formerly named country more accurate than that in the latter? Possibly, but many spectacular variations, revealed by the comparisons between the two neighboring nations, can also be attributed either to structural variables (including the stage of industrialization of the country) or to cultural variables. In order for us to understand why a graduate of a vocational school, when forced to do a manual job, regardless of how skilled he or she may be, feels downgraded in one country but may feel less or not al all downgraded in another, it is necessary to consider how different the cultures of both countries are. Of crucial importance here are the various patterns of work ethics. In Poland this ethic has been built upon the foundations of the still vital rural-Catholic and aristocratic traditions, while in Czechoslovakia a more secularized industrial culture prevailed. The continuing impact of cultural traditions in both countries can also be detected in occupational choice. There again, national characteristics seem to perfectly fit the patterns mentioned earlier. If we look at occupational motivation, it is rather astonishing to find how consistently different, from country to country, the aggregated motives which determine occupational choice, appear to be. If we [pageend22]16 KOSMAS disregard the peculiarities due to sex differences, which can be observed everywhere, the younger generation of Polish workers in choosing their occupations, tend to prize highly the following work attributes, and expect to find them in their jobs: First and foremost, the occupation has to be congenial with the interests of the worker; almost equally important is the requirement that it should be well paid; third, good employment opportunities should be available, and every occupation should be useful socially. Surprisingly, closely followed by these rather practical features is the desire of sufficient free time on the job, an expectation which, in a sense, is the opposite of the preceding one. As the fifth among the desired occupational traits, ranks high social prestige, i.e., occupational status. This typically Polish set of values determining occupational choice might appear to be inherently inconsistent and contradictory. This becomes evident when we compare it with the much more pragmatic, typically Czech patterns of choosing an occupation. As a rule, this choice is made among rationally predictable job opportunities or in the expectation that the future job will fit the interests of the individual, as well as the talents or the skills acquired by him or her. While the Czechs appeared to display a higher degree of pragmatism at the time of the selection of their occupation, they also proved to be strongly attached to the chosen profession. The young Polish professionals, however, seemed to demonstrate a striking ambivalence in this respect. In contrast to their Czech and Slovak counterparts, who remain loyal to their profession once it has been chosen, a significant proportion of young Polish professionals (one out of every four respondents) were so seriously disillusioned that they would have chosen another occupation if they had been given another chance. Consistent with this response seems to be another finding which shows that contrary to the Czechs, the young Polish professionals appear to hold their jobs for a much shorter time. From this point of view comparing the national samples of skilled manual workers and university level professionals seems to have been a sound approach. Thus while the Czechs and the Slovaks exhibited a degree of employment stability approaching 90% (measured by the length of tenure of the job), their Polish colleagues were at least 20% below that level. The empirical data shows us clearly that the high educational and occupational aspirations of the young Poles should be attributed not only to the features of the socio-political system, common to all East European societies, but also to the distinctive cultural and [pageend23]EDUCATION AND ASPIRATIONS VS. OPPORTUNITIES 17 historical factors that prevail in the individual countries and influence occupational choice as well as motivational patterns. 3. The Generation Gap as a Source of the Polish Crisis and Conflict It seems that one of the specific traits of the Polish crisis and conflict-breeding situation of 1980 was due to the fact that the growth of social needs and aspirations had not been directed toward releasing energy, creative ingenuity, or efficient work and motivation, but rather toward better access to the goods and careers distributed by the State. The explosive nature of this situation can best be illustrated by reference to the socio-psychological mechanisms of alienation or deprivation which account for the fact that in such cases people’s basic needs and aspirations cease to be related to their own occupation and activity. It is not by chance that the alienation of needs and aspirations from the social context had developed in the 1970’s, and reached its peak at the end of that decade. For it was then that we could observe a coincidence of structural and psychological factors that, to an exceptional degree, favored this conflict-generating situation. These factors manifested themselves, all at the same time, in the context of a completed shift of generations, which we have discussed earlier. In particular, it is necessary to emphasize the effect of the incursion into adult, vocational and political life of the baby boom generation, that is, of those born and educated under the socialist system. It seems to be undisputable that this generation played an essential role, not only in triggering the crisis and creating a conflict situation, but also in challenging the very function of the social and political system. As can be seen, the structural determinants of the socialization process of the post-war generations and of their integration into Polish society at large must also be considered as conducive to the development of specific attitudes in these generations. These had to do with a sense of independence and of certainty about the forthcoming fulfillment of their social aspirations. Later, a feeling of being thwarted in the realization of their expectations evolved. It was evident that both promoted generational self-consciousness. In this respect wide circles of industrial workers and employees exhibited a pronounced tendency to form a separate generation. The fact that the access to socio-vocational and political roles corresponding to their educational achievements and career aspirations was on the [pageend24]18 KOSMAS whole closed to them, combined with another fact, namely that in their general life orientations these age classes had developed rebellious rather than passively adaptive attitudes, could not but be very strongly felt in a crisis situation. This conflict-laden background of the social scene of the 1980’s could perhaps be better identified by a microlevel type of analysis, and particularly through studying generational relations in the workplace. My own findings on two generations of Polish industrial workers show the following outline of potential conflict situations: When we measure the impact of education in the workplace on the level of job satisfaction reported by the young [17-30 years], as compared to older [45 years and more] industrial workers, the results are surprising. The younger generation seems to be much more dissatisfied than the older one. Defined by the level of satisfaction, the gap between the younger and the older cohorts appears to be very wide, especially on the higher rungs of the educational ladder. While age plays almost no role among workers with only primary school education, as far as job satisfaction is concerned, the different amount of education sets apart sharply those with basic vocational, secondary vocational and higher technical education. The relatively stronger discontent with the job assignment, experienced by young professionals is evident from the much lower number of individuals who are “highly satisfied,” if we compare them to the older generation, and from a far greater proportion of those “partly dissatisfied” or “extremely dissatisfied.” As these data clearly proves, the general indices of job satisfaction in our sample drop drastically with increasing levels of worker education. This negative correlation between the quantity and quality of schooling received and self-reported job satisfaction runs exactly counter to the results shown by research done with West European and North American samples (3). Here it is worth emphasizing that Polish blue-collar workers, especially those young and skilled, on the average report almost twice as high a level of occupational satisfaction as engineers and other college-trained professionals employed at the same enterprises. The low level of job satisfaction experienced by young employees was understandable. Having been given, in many cases, as much as twice the amount of education when compared to older employees, they were at the same time both dramatically underpaid and denied the opportunity to utilize their educational qualifications. The young professionals with secondary school and university credentials appeared to be extremely disadvantaged financially. While doing the same work and occupying the same socio[pageend25]EDUCATION AND ASPIRATIONS VS. OPPORTUNITIES 19 economic positions, they were paid much less than their equals in the same field who belonged to the older generation. Their discontent was also due to the application of the seniority rule, which prevented their access to more challenging positions, especially at the decisionmaking levels. We would have expected that this kind of generation gap among workers would have its roots in the hierarchies of people’s basic needs and their life orientations. Our empirical data do confirm such an expectation (4). There has been an impressive shift in the hierarchy of these needs and aspirations in Poland. The comparison between white-collar and blue-collar workers employed in the socialist sector of the economy in 1975 and representative samples of city dwellers in 1980, 1981 and 1984, shows that in 1975, regardless of social class, all employees of the socialized sector of the national economy, tended to busy themselves exclusively with personal and family matters, and no more than 12-14% gave priority to other problems, such as housing or household equipment. In 1980-1984 this hierarchy of perceived needs changed radically. The housing and related problems gained absolute priority over all other goals and aspirations. It comes as no surprise that those most deeply affected by this shift are the younger generation, those in their twenties and thirties; for 37 to 43 percent of them adequate housing still belongs to the realm of unfulfilled goals. How far does this shift of aspirations that occurred during the economic crisis, affect the rank assigned by the young to education, professional qualifications and occupation? Here the most conspicuous change is related to the drop of interest in higher education. But this trend seems to have only a temporary character, and probably would not threaten the future of the universities (5). On the basis of these premises we may conclude that the perceptions of relative deprivation which produced contentious attitudes and behavior in the young workers was observable primarily in the post-war baby boom generation, especially among skilled workers and professionals who felt cheated because the road to the satisfaction of their ambitious economic, vocational, and socio-political needs and aspirations had been blocked. It was found, above all, in those socio-vocational groups which of necessity, and not of their own choice, remained socially young beyond the usual period believed to be reasonable. Contrary to many theories of conflict-breeding socialization. the feeling of deprivation and the rebellious mood of the Polish workers and professionals did not become manifest in their families, but in their work places. Thus their demands and blame [pageend26]20 KOSMAS were addressed not to their parents, but to that part of the older and established generations which, having exclusive access to power and to the means of production, can decide about the chances of the satisfaction of the needs and aspirations of the younger generation. If so, we may hypothesize that the Polish conflict of August 1980 and its later stages are to be treated neither as a pure class conflict nor as a strictly generational conflict. On the contrary, it seems legitimate to infer that the combination of criteria based on socio-vocational status and on the membership in the given generation may prove the most fruitful method of identifying social groups which played the principal role both in the creation and in the further evolution of the conflict situation. 4. Extended Youth Aspirations, and their Social and Political Implications. It is common knowledge that in today’s Europe—and this applies much more to its eastern than its western part—the notion of youth tends to rapidly expand in both age and social categories dimensions. As far as age is concerned, this expansion occurs mostly at the upper limits of the young cohorts. Contrary to many well established definitions, the dividing line between youth and adulthood has moved beyond the once accepted boundary of 24-25 years and now more often includes those who approach 30, or even are 35 years of age. This means that the young category of the population, except students of all levels belonging to this category, will eventually embrace the majority of young people who are gainfully employed, but who in spite of this remain for many years far from achieving the status of economic and social independence, typical of full adulthood. One of the consequences of this process is that it is not so much dropouts or students who will attract the interest both of resarchers specializing in youth problems and of politicians, but ever more often those who are searching for, or just embarked upon the road to, the integration into the society at large by entering into a permanent employment relationship. If we attempt to define the process of transition from school to work, we may find it quite easy to establish when the transition starts, but much less easy to decide when it is completed. In most Western societies it is explicitly or implicitly assumed that the act of entering an employment position, particularly, a permanent one, marks the end of the process under consideration. This, however. [pageend27]EDUCATION AND ASPIRATIONS VS. OPPORTUNITIES 21 does not apply to all the societies of Europe, especially not to the East European countries. Any serious effort seeking to integrate into society at large the cohorts of young people who today enter the stage of extended youth has to go beyond the simple employment—unemployment dichotomy, and penetrate deeper to the roots of the phenomenon which we want to discuss here. In all countries of contemporary Europe—irrespective of cleavages of an economic, cultural and political nature—we now observe rather aggravating perturbations in the process of the transition from school to work. Hypothetically, these perturbations may be symptoms of a crisis; yet another, much broader process of the transition from youth to adulthood is taking place here, which concerns more than the narrowly defined educational institutions and labor market. We can show that this transition tends to develop in two directions, namely: 1. The transition embraces an increasingly broad social space, i.e. it is rooted not only in the family, at school and in predominant work organizations, but also in some intermediary institutions, such as part-time employment, forced or voluntary unemployment. underemployment, deferred entry into the labour force through continuing education etc.; 2. The transition takes a longer and longer time and.in order to be achieved, often requires global strategies and comprehensive political interventions. The post-war development of all countries of Europe shows certain striking similarities, in spite of the civilizational and systemic peculiarities of the individual regions. It is our hypothesis that the most important of these similarities has been the vastly increased magnitude of social aspirations. Striving for better education, higher socio-vocational status, and higher standards of material and cultural consumption, has become a mass phenomenon among all social classes. This revolution of rising expectations has manifested itself mainly in the consciousness and the behavior of the younger generations, and especially of the “baby-boom generations” whose life orientations had been shaped during the longer period of uninterrupted economic expansion. The experiences of the 1960s, and in some countries those of the early 1970s, seemed to confirm an optimistic view of the possibility to satisfy these growing aspirations. An almost explosive expansion of the school system, an incessant increase of employment oppor[pageend28]22 KOSMAS tunities and great social mobility offered, if not a guarantee, then at least a chance of rapid satisfaction of ambitious career goals. That situation later changed, however. The present trend of economic development has brought not only a slowdown or even a disruption ot growth, but also has cast doubt upon the possibility of the return to a period of expansion in the near future. One important consequence of this development will be further deterioration and complication of the conditions under which the transition to adulthood occurs, and will adversely affect the careers of the members of the younger generations who belong to the category of extended youth. A shrinking labour market in general, and a decreasing supply of jobs commensurate to acquired qualifications in particular, account for the difficulties in absorbing the inflow of young people who leave post-secondary schools and universities. These trends oblige us to view the 1980s as a separate period of social development for all countries of Europe, irrespective of their socioeconomic system. This period has been marked, on the one hand, by an unabated, or even increasingly high, aspirations and socio-vocational needs, and on the other, by clearly reduced or limited opportunities to satisfy them. These limitations are especially acutely felt in the area of incomes and material consumption and in the access to higher positions in socio-vocational structures. They also are the stimuli of a growing interest in the right to participate in economic or political decisions that may affect the future of workers and citizens. It seems that in the case of both socioeconomic systems represented in Europe today, further development will depend, more than it did in the past, on the outcome of a confrontation of the unsatisfied expectations with existing socio-economic and political opportunities. In both parts of Europe the origin of the growth of the aspirations of the young is to be seen in the post-1945 socio-economic changes, marked by the spread of the ideology of “equal chances” and “social justice.” But, contrary to what is claimed by those who believe in technological and economic determinism, we do not think that aspirations should be examined as mere products of structural change. Social aspirations, viewed from the historical perspective of the 1980s, deserve to be treated as a more or less autonomous phenomenon capable of affecting the course of the fundamental changes within societies. Comparing the problems connected with the transition to adulthood in both systems, we find it easy to identify separate patterns of socialization through work in each of them. While in the West [pageend29]EDUCATION AND ASPIRATIONS VS. OPPORTUNITIES 23 the most important element seems to be the access to permanent employment that could provide a basis for social security and fulfillment of further higher aspirations, in the East the main weight is attached to certain privileged positions [better, more prestigious jobs, etc.]. However, due to low work productivity and frequent underemployment, achieving this position would not necessarily make a young person economically independent. In both West and East Europe alike, the will of young people to acquire better occupational qualification in schools is not rewarded by access to socio-occupational positions. In some socialist countries the individuals who have “invested” in education and acquired university-type credentials or sometimes only a secondary school certificate, have produced a “graduate glut” in the labor market. One of the most harmful consequences has been a high labor turn-over, especially in the initial years after the transition from school to work. Another consequence has been decreasing interest in secondary schools and universities with general curricula. There also has been some evidence that in the labor market the older generations constitute a kind of obstacle to the advancement of the younger ones. This is clearly visible if we compare the access of the two age categories to more qualified and responsible positions. The ideology of upward mobility and of the openness of the social structure would seem to be, in the face of the above-mentioned structural obstacles, rather divorced from the social experience of the young generations. There is no doubt that our societies have to pay for any deprivation experienced by the young generations at the moment of the transition from school to work. In the East European countries the policies of full-employment protect the youth against the most serious form of it, namely against simple unemployment, but the unexpected result of this is that the young quite often are employed not only without regard to their qualifications and aspirations, but often are also paid below the reasonable level of the social minimum. Under these circumstances the responsibility of satisfying the needs of the young generations often falls to the parents’ generation, and this further prolongs the stage of youth in an artificial way. On the other hand, the economic system of the East European countries pays a high price for adhering to the policies of full employment. One of the most severe consequences is low economic efficiency. Different policies in the West European countries produce other deprivations among the youth seeking to enter the labour market. A rather heavy burden of unemployment benefits must be borne by the [pageend30]24 KOSMAS state treasury and the trade unions. This also adds to the prolongation of the period of youth or even excludes entire categories of young people from the society. The extension of the stage of youth in both systems is a source ot the most serious deprivation in the young generation, i.e. the deprivation of the aspirations related to the distribution of consumer goods. This phenomenon is particularly severe in East European countries where the volume of goods available for distribution has been in short supply. The lack of economic independence of young people due to unemployment in the West, and to underemployment and/or underpayment caused by the policy of full employment in the East, have been important factors responsible for youth becoming a separate category within the social structure of all these countries. This allows us to submit that the young generations of contemporary Europe tend to constitute a distinct, quasi-class, social category. References 1. Cf. L.

[pageend31]ENTERPRISE COUNCILS IN HUNGARY: TOOLS OF MANAGEMENT OR TOOLS OF WORKERS? Csaba Makó This essay is divided into the following sections: I. On institutional change in broad terms II. On new forms of management in a nutshell III. Workers and managers in the enterprise council: “partners” or “adversaries”? IV. Loopholes in legal regulations V. Inconsistencies of economic regulations: the possibility of a change in reverse I. On institutional change in broad terms In an era of organizational reforms we are often confronted with the following problem: why is it so difficult, if not impossible, to work out general models of organizational change? Before we turn to the first experiences with the introduction and the operation of new forms of corporate management, let me refer—in a somewhat sketchy way—to some simplistic ideas of organizational change which are often the source of high and unfounded expectations. If these expectations are not, or not fully, met disappointment and often total rejection of the original social, economic, or ideological goals may ensue. 25 [pageend32]26 KOSMAS The following quotations are illustrative of such euphoric expectations in the context of management reform. * Nobody can deny that the most spectacular event of the last few years in the area of reform of the economic system has been the introduction of new forms of management at the firm level. In accordance with the instructions on the implementation of the law on state firms, issued at the end of 1984, several hundred state firms have adopted [following the data of early 1986] new forms of management.”1 . . . the new enterprise councils change the boundaries of authority . . . which is favorable to intrafirm interest relations and strengthens industrial democracy?'2 "... the introduction of new forms of management is a qualitative change. Now it is clear and unambiguous that operative economic decisions are the prerogative of the firm and are no business—except in special, extraordinary cases—of the ministries . . . New property rights have been vested in the collective of the firm . . . Thus the enterprises became battlefields for industrial democracy whose experiences may later be utilized in the development of political democracy?'2, “The new management organization is favorable to the maintenance and long-term enhancement of the firm’s assets. This strengthens ownership attitudes and behavior in the workers and revitalizes the old, forgotten slogan: “yours is the factory, it is for yourself that you build it.”4 All the above quotations are expressions of the opinion that the new forms of management are decisive for the implementation of the required changes in the economy. Some people hope that these new forms will radically change the relations among various interest groups, thus contributing towards a better performance of the enterprise; others stress their favorable impact on the workplace, and later on political democracy. But none of them takes acccount of the rich social experience accumulated during four decades of organizational and institutional changes under socialism, whose lesson may be summed up as follows: the leaders of society cannot mould personal relationships as they please, even in the case where the majority of those concerned are ready to follow their programs. The explanation of this limit lies in the fact that modern society is a very complicated system of human relations, and to change it in one or two points is not enough to ensure success. Successful social and economic innovations [e.g. the combination of private and collective farms in Hungarian agriculture] have always depended on [pageend33]ENTERPRISE COUNCILS IN HUNGARY 27 something beyond the good will of the participants. Such innovations also presuppose the individual and collective ability to turn participants into partners who regulate their relationship in a way which promotes initiative. The success of the new forms of management depends basically on how the participants will regulate this partnership. If troubles arise in the process of their implementation, these are not necessarily the result of individual or collective ill-will, incompetence or lack of interest on the part of managers or of elected workers. High expectations relative to the new forms of management cannot come true if the managers and the representatives of the non-managerial workforce do not develop new ways of communicating. The professional, social and political skills, necessary to this purpose, may be acquired only through investment in human relations. From this perspective, the success of the new arrangements is a question of cooperation rather than of dominance.5 As many successful organizational changes testify, the various groups affected by the change are adversaries and allies at the same time, and the struggle between them does not rule out cooperation. Competition and cooperation are not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary modes of behavior. The success of the new forms of management depends to a large extent on whether it is possible to establish regulations favoring both competition and cooperation. According to the most recently accepted view, not every conflict which accompanies change is in itself positive. It is necessary to make a distinction between destructive conflicts and constructive conflicts. The former perpetuate the existing organizational and social relations, and only the latter promote social-organizational innovation. Unfortunately we do not know exactly through what social and economic mechanisms constructive conflicts actually do regulate development and change. An important lesson of small ventures in innovation, undertaken in the early ’eighties, was that the conflicts emanating from organizational change initiate positive processes only if the mechanisms of social and economic regulation favor individual and collective initiative in the long run; otherwise any positive economic and social phenomena which may accompany the most diverse organizational changes—such as better performance, improved quality, individual and collective initiatives—remain isolated and soon expire. Although such constructive conflicts sometimes open up possibilities for organizational and social innovations, their impact on firm-level organization as a whole (and, within it, on the [pageend34]28 KOSMAS structure of management) remains partial (residual), serving in the final analysis only to its preservation.6 In a time of institutional reforms, investments in skills that can be acquired through social experimentation gain in importance. Therefore we have to take into account the possibility that the risk of errors and collapses during the transition to new forms of management cannot be ruled out. The leadership has to tolerate organizational experiments even if the organizations go sometimes bankrupt. Abortive experiments also may be instrumental in providing better knowledge of the supportive as well as the obstructive components of the “tissue” of social relations, as regards organizational change. [E.g. foreign organizational techniques applied to the work process in the early ’seventies highlighted the difficulties of organizational change from human, technical and economic points of view.7 Experience gained through social-organizational experiments is an investment in better knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms of human relations, and as such is best thought of as a necessary cost of change. II. On new forms of management in a nutshell8 The political decision to start the conversion to new forms of management on the level of the firm, plus the joint directive of the Council of Ministers and the Trade Union Center, initiated a process in which the methods of management will change in four manufacturing firms out of five. The explicitly declared objective of the party document and the government decree (which followed the former with a delay of more than half-a-year) was to change the relationships between the central economic organs [e.g. ministries] and the individual state firms, to improve the efficiency of central management and at the same time to enlarge the authority of the firm. In order to attain these goals, the rights over socialist property were redistributed between central organs and “competitive” firms. Employees now have institutionalized possibilities to act as owners.9 The new forms of management, established in state firms in the period from January 1985 till December 1986, are the following: 1. Enterprise Council The Enterprise Council is the strategic decision-making unit in medium-size and large enterprises. It has dispositional rights over [pageend35]ENTERPRISE COUNCILS IN HUNGARY 29 the firm’s property and employer rights over the chief executive office (CEO). Operational decisions, necessary for the implementation of the firm’s strategy, are the prerogative of the CEO. The matters which the Enterprise Council has to decide are: • to elect, to oversee and qualify, in short to act as employer against, the CEO. (The founder of the firm—the ministry—however, has the veto power in the appointment and the dismissal of the CEO.) • to substantially modify the firm’s organization; to decide about major splits and mergers. • to modify the field of activity of the firm • to approve the end-of-year balance report-to approve yearly and medium-term plans • to approve the principles of income distribution • major decisions concerning manpower [e.g. reemployment, training, lay-offs] • major decisions concerning firm funds and physical assets • to approve the firm’s statue The membership of the enterprise council consists of representatives of management and of the workers. Members without voting rights are the secretaries of the firm’s communist party organizations, of the trade union, and of the youth organizations. The CEO is a member—but not president—of the council. More than half of the membership are the representatives of the workers. They are elected by a direct vote of the whole collective for a definite period—usually five years. The remaining members of the council are management representatives; two-thirds of them, the leaders of major independent organizational units [plants, factories], are ex officio members, the remaining third are men of the CEO. The council elects from among its own members a president and a deputy who act as employers of the CEO between the council meetings. The size of the council depends on local circumstances but—in order to remain operative— cannot exceed 50. 2. Elected leadership This is a form practiced in smaller state and local council firms. The leadership exercises dispositional rights over the property and employer rights over the CEO, as the representative of the general [pageend36]30 KOSMAS or electoral assembly of the whole collective. The general assembly is convened by the CEO and every employee of the firm takes part in it. A general assembly must be held at least once a year. In the case of management by assembly of delegates the members of the latter, the delegates, are elected in assemblies held jointly or separately by the different organizational units. The delegates—like their counterpart, the enterprise council—report on their activity once a year (The secretaries of the communist party, of the union, and of the youth organization may take part as non-voting members in the assemblies of delegates. The assembly or the enterprise council may invite outside experts and ask their advice). The members of the leadership are elected by the general assembly or the assembly of delegates for five years. Their number is established by the firm’s statute, the president being the CEO ex officio. The powers of the elected leadership are more or less the same as those of the enterprise council.10 Among the three forms of collective leadership (enterprise council, assembly of delegates and general assembly), the most popular is the enterprise council. Eighty percent of the firms included in the program of the new forms of management, now have an enterprise council; 16% have an assembly of delegates, and 4% a general assembly. III. Workers and managers in the enterprise council: “partners” or “adversaries”? In this chapter I shall try to present some empirically identifiable tendencies, discernible in the constitution of enterprise councils. I have to stress that these are only tendencies, and not established social facts. The expectations of the society’s political leadership, concerning worker participation in the new forms of firm management, can best be documented by the following statement: “ . . . we are convinced that, if we rely largely on industrial workers for the execution of these rights, things will—if we do it well—certainly improve, because the employees will assume greater responsibility and their attitude as owners will be strengthened”.11 Industrial workers, however, did not make much use of the opportunities for participation, as our data on the composition of the enterprise councils testify. The experiences from the first year of the transition to the new forms of management are summed up in the table below. [pageend37]ENTERPRISE COUNCILS IN HUNGARY 31 Composition of enterprise councils Responsibilities: Occupational Skills: Managerial: 79% Technical 52% (among these high-level 49% Economist 10% medium-level 14% Administrative 17% low-level 16%) Manual workers 21% Non-managerial 21% (among them: foremen 72%) Source: Bossanyi Katalin: Demokrátizalodô gazdaság- Atallás a kollektiv vezetésre az iparban /The democratization of the economy - the new forms of collective management in manufacturing/ Gazdasáq, 1986. No. 2. p. 119. The data on the composition of enterprise councils show low worker participation and a dominance of the managerial element, mainly high-level. The distribution by occupational skills shows the preponderance of technical personnel, followed by administrative and manual workers. More than seventy percent of the latter are foremen, i.e. low level managers. “At the end of 1985 almost 60% of all enterprise councils’ presidents were high-level managers of some kind, deputies of the CEO or plant managers.”12 The arguments put forward to explain the low worker representation in collective leadership is the following (this list is by no means exhaustive): • compared to other activities [e.g. working in the so-called second economy], taking part in the council as a volunteer, or at most earning the average hourly wage, “does not pay”; • managers and engineers have better, more adaptable skills necessary for participation, than do workers; • the work of the enterprise council does not really ensure participation in decision-making. Worker participation has purely ideological-statistical importance; [pageend38]32 KOSMAS • workers are interested only in decisions which have a direct effect on their own work situation. As long as there is no progress in this area, they are understandably distrustful of all forms of participation on a higher level than that of their own shop (plant). The above reasons for staying away from the enterprise councils [this list could be continued] suggest that the structure of the decision-making bodies did not change radically under the new forms of management. All this notwithstanding, it would be worth reflecting upon some observable tendencies [and to monitor them in future research], tendencies which may have been neglected in the past. Workers’ presence in the enterprise councils will appear more pronounced than their share indicated by the statistics, if we take into account the special way in which this new institution was developed and introduced: 1. Although the actual introduction of new forms of management was a trade union task, workers [and even concerned managers] were not properly informed about the purpose and the substance of the new arrangements. There was not enough time for workers delegated to enterprise councils to get acquainted with, to discuss, or qualify, let alone to modify, before the elections, the principles governing the new management forms. Therefore the majority of employees could not assess or decide how the new managerial forms would influence their individual and collective situation. Without this, however, it could not be expected that the workers would identify with the new organization of management. 2. At the end of the first year of the transition period, the unions complained about poor preparation. A union-sponsored study on the first year’s experience with enterprise councils speaks of insujficient preparedness of worker delegates: “The activity of the enterprise councils concentrates, first of all, on long-term strategy and control over its implementation. We have to admit that these tasks require from nonprofessional members of the council skills and knowledge hitherto unavailable.”13 3. Those who initiated the new forms of firm management did not make use of the vast knowledge about worker participation [most of it gained through empirical sociological research] which had been accumulated by social science. The most important lesson that can be drawn from this is that workers’ attitude towards participation cannot be positive unless proper material incentives and a true partnership are established. In the period of the introduction of the [pageend39]ENTERPRISE COUNCILS IN HUNGARY 33 new institution of enterprise councils, these problems could not be solved satisfactorily. Moreover, the new forum is merely expressing opinions, which is much less than true participation. Neither must we overlook the fact that participation in management involves considerable opportunity cost for the workers because it requires additional effort without pay (only “managerial” members of the enterprise council receive their “ordinary” wage for the time spent in the council).14 4. The experience with labor-managed firms in a capitalist setting shows that less attention is often given to the social premises of effective worker participation than to other, e.g. legal or financial problems. The result is that the level of worker participation in labor-managed firms is not higher than in owner-managed ones. The most important social (“infrastructural”) mechanisms, necessary for the success of worker participation, are the following:15 • setting up consultative groups which aid workers in acquiring the necessary planning, management etc. knowledge, and evaluating their performance; • summing up local experiences and circulating them nation-wide; • preparing the managers for a continuing “co-existence” with worker participation, and making the workers acquainted with the methods of managerial work; • teaching the young in school the basics of organizational science, the requirements of collective work, and how to perform a public role; • introducing a labor policy that favors systems of incentives and promotions, which are based on mutual recognition of competition and co-operation. 5. Excessively hierarchical and bureaucratic firm organizations hinder the formation of communicative skills, necessary for efficient participation. They can, following their inner logic, put up easily with lack of individual and collective worker initiative. The rigid distinction of “managerial” and “non-managerial” roles produces an affirmative culture at shopfloor level. The essence of this culture consists in that the manager-worker relationship, as laid down in organizational rules and norms, is not the negotiated outcome of the competing goals and aspirations of the two partners. Under these circumstances, it is management’s prerogative to determine the forms of interaction. Organizations set up in this way cannot tolerate criticism, and are unable to stimulate a real dialogue between the superiors and their subordinates.16 [pageend40]34 KOSMAS If we take into consideration all the above-mentioned factors, we cannot label the actual worker participation as particularly low. In analyzing the share of the different strata of the workforce in the enterprise councils it is better to start from social-organizational preconditions of participation than from purely ideological-statistical considerations. From this perspective the new enterprise councils do not seem to be mere "excrescences" of former boards of directors: this is in fact the first time that workers and shopfloor managers [foremen, their natural allies] appear in a decision-making body. The development and later disappearance of the coalition of workers and lower management is the result of changing opportunities for the articulation of group interests on plant and firm level.17 In the case of autonomous work teams [VGMK], the shopfloor management is usually conscious of the benefits of its alliance with workers in key positions: work done on schedule and without quality problems, low worker turnover, etc. At the same time the relatively high wages of this group of workers, as compared to those of the foremen, lead to tensions. For some shopfloor managers the existence of autonomous work teams only means extra work and no advantage. All these problems influence the future of the alliance between workers and the shopfloor management.'8 Foremen and supervisors who are sent by workers into the enterprise council, can, if they unite with worker representatives (who statistically are a minority there), have a very important role in the new managerial body.19 They can draw the attention of high and middle level management—the representatives of the various departments—to the complexities of the production process, and thus to the importance of workers’ knowledge and initiative. The autonomous community of the shopfloor is a living reality, often indifferent to the subtleties of technology, work process or management strategies. Top management by itself is unable to recognize and to make use of the collective knowledge and experience of the workshop, and the many norms and prescriptions regulating it. The presence of shoptloor managers and workers in the enterprise councils is an opportunity for the top management to discover the "hidden community” of the shopfloor. Today, the possibility to take advantage of this discovery is barred by several circumstances, a few of which I shall enumerate in the following section. IV. Loopholes in legal regulation According to the new law on enterprises, the enterprise council has the right to elect, appreciate, qualify and dismiss the CEO. If, [pageend41]ENTERPRISE COUNCILS IN HUNGARY 35 however, the collective body chooses to dismiss a CEO elected for a five year term, it cannot decide on its own. Before voting on dismissal (e.g. in the course of disciplinary procedure instituted against the members of the CEO) it has to consult the founding body (in the case of a state firm, this would be the ministry). In addition, it must consult the personnel departments of the party and the union. Thus the elements of the previous practice of CEO nomination and qualification are preserved. This could facilitate the return to the old system. A further complication arises from the fact that no CEO can be elected without the prior consent of its founder, but there is no legal stipulation of specific conditions in which the consent could be denied. The right of the founder to exert legal supervision over the enterprise contributes to the continuation of pre-existing regulative practices. Firms do not have general recourse to judicial aid in case of ministerial abuse. It is rather unclear who is responsible for eventual wrong decisions of the enterprise council [the council or the CEO?]. What is to be done if a firm’s difficulties are caused by a CEO strictly obeying a wrong decision of the enterprise council or of the founder? The responsibility of the council members is even more unclear than that of the CEO. Without some kind of profit sharing arrangement, the personal involvement of the council members cannot be secured. The idea that wages also depend on the firm’s profit, and that this circumstance may moderate the council’s decisions, is illusory. With the present confusing system of various taxes, exemptions, and subsidies, there is almost no direct correlation between profits and personal incomes. At the same time, we have to admit that the above-mentioned inconsistencies in the legal regulations result directly from the inconsistencies in the economic regulations. V. Inconsistencies between economic regulations: the possibility of a change in reverse One of the most serious deficiencies of the new forms of management [including enterprise councils] is the lack of long-range material incentives for participants. Both the managerial and nonmanagerial class of the members of the enterprise councils are interested (as they have always been in the past) only in instantaneous gains.20 From the viewpoint of the enterprise councils, the main problem in the complex area of economic regulation is the lack of a true [pageend42]36 KOSMAS profit motive. Although Hungarian firms during the last two decades have lived in a profit-oriented environment, the true mechanisms of the profit motive and its consequences were largely suppressed.21 1. The level of realized profits is independent of the competitiveness and innovative content of the products. It depends rather on many kinds of preferences accorded by the central authorities, especially to firms in strong bargaining positions.22 2. The rate-of-return criteria do not assure a rational combination of production factors. These are replaced by a kind of “manual” regulation, i.e. in that the central economic organs themselves decide [using several indices] on investment projects. 3. The aim of economic regulation is not to enhance, but to constrain firm activity. If there is no real change in firm's autonomy in the near future, it is not only that the hopes, economic and social, attached to enterprise councils, will be dashed. The principal danger of this approach in the long run is that the social partners cooperating within the firms will lose their optimism as to the possibility of a change for the better. As a consequence, the readiness of different groups—within the firm or in the relation between the firm and the central organs—to communicate, and to respect each other’s values and interests, will diminish. Parallel to this narrowing of the range of activity of the firm, ambivalent and passive behavior will spread through the circles of both managers and subordinates. I have ventured this short exposition of the problems related to the new forms of management, in full awareness of the fact that it is always easier to criticize existing schemes than to propose new ones. Unfortunately, thus far we possess important and convincing scientific data only about participation on the level of a work group, but not on the level of a big, complex organization. The progress of research on participation is hindered by recent contradictory experiences which show that the original organizational hierarchy is reproduced even in those cases where the activities of the enterprise are formally under worker and employee control.23 However, the persistence of these and similar problems does not call into question the fact that relative progress can be achieved, if only by workers’ acquiring management skills—something which was unimaginable under the traditional system.

According to a recent study on the representation of worker interests [initiated by the Japanese trade union Denko Roven], the majority of Hungarian workers in the electrical and electronics industries held that their interests in areas like working conditions, safety, organization of the work process, manpower planning, redeployment etc. are best defended by shop- floor management.

At this point I would like to reflect on some apprehensions concerning the possibility of the rise of corporatism, or more eactly of corporative syndicalism, in the new enterprise councils. Corporative syndicates were originally alliances of a firm’s management and employees against other, [pageend45]ENTERPRISE COUNCILS IN HUNGARY 39 competing firms. The essence of the potential corporatism in the case of enterprise councils is totally different: the alliance of workers and managers here is favored by the unpredictability of economic and other regulators. 23.

[pageend46]ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF WORKERS’ PARTICIPATION IN MANAGEMENT, PROFITSHARING AND CAPITAL OWNERSHIP: THE WESTERN EXPERIENCE Jan Švejnar This paper presents a selective summary and an evaluation of the main theoretical and practical developments with respect to worker participation in management in Western economies. Its main goal is to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the theoretical and empirical knowledge relating to the economic performance of participatory firms and to draw conclusions about the role of public policy and institutional design. Interest in Worker Participation in Management, Profit-Sharing and Ownership of Enterprise Capital Following decades of debates and attempts to introduce participatory forms of management in Western Europe before World War II, the first large-scale introduction of employee participation in management occurred in the Federal Republic of Germany in the early 1950s. as a result of the Codetermination Law of 1951 and the Works Constitution Act of 1952. The 1951 Codetermination Law provided for equal representation of shareholders and workers on the enterprise Boards of Directors in iron-steel and coal-mining industries while the 1952 Act gave worker representatives one-third 41 [pageend47]42 KOSMAS of the seats on Boards of Directors in firms with 500 employees or more. The 1952 Act applied to all remaining industries with the exception of air transport and shipping.1 The German system served as a case study for other Western European countries, many of which later adopted the minority worker representation scheme in their own environments.2 After two decades of experience. West German Parliament extended the codetermination system through the Works Constitution Act of 1972 and the Codetermination Law of 1976.1 The 1970s and 1980s have in general witnessed a reawakening of interest in organizational forms that are radical alternatives to capitalist and state-owned firms, especially in the producer (worker/ industrial) cooperatives (PCs). Interest has also blossomed in schemes providing jointly for some degree of worker participation in decision making, in ownership, and in the surplus (profits) within traditional firms. Typical of these schemes, which usually—though not always— do not fundamentally challenge the existing structure of power, are employee stock-ownership plans (ESOPs). Various factors have contributed to this recent development of interest. These include a desire for better industrial relations and a response to the “democratic imperative” (Bullock 1977, chapter 3). Increasing awareness of the apparent viability of long-established schemes, such as the U.S. plywood PCs and German codetermination, undoubtedly played a part too. Additionally, it was claimed that participatory firms not only preserved but also created jobs. Most of these arguments, however, are not new. Sometimes, as with Christian socialists, anarchists, guild socialists, and industrial unionists, similar views were central features of influential doctrines and powerful social movements4 But in the past, most of these arguments, as well as the associated doctrines, have tended to be discredited. In part this resulted from early empirical analyses of participatory forms, such as that of Potter (1890) of early British PCs. These studies suggested that all participation schemes would inevitably be unsuccessful and short-lived. And indeed many did fail. Similarly, previous impulses for systematic study of participatory phenomena, including economic analysis, were never sustained. Futh- ermore, in response to the claims made by the advocates of participation, there have always been counterarguments that seemed more persuasive. In Britain and in the United States, for example, the Webbs and Commons, respectively, championed collective bargaining as the most practical and expedient strategy for labor. These views [pageend48]THE WESTERN EXPERIENCE 43 were buttressed by the development of doctrines that disdained workers’ participation and self-management, regarding such ventures as inherently unstable (see Jones, 1976). But today the tide seems to have turned. Worker participation is an idea that has captured the imagination and sustained the interest of a growing number of academics and practitioners. In explaining the sustained recent interest in participation and labor-managed firms (LMFs), six factors loom large. First, there is the productivity and unemployment crisis faced by Western industrialized nations in the 1970s and early 1980s. In less developed countries (LDCs), too, there is mounting evidence that traditional models have not worked well. Hence, in both North and South there is a search for alternative organizational models that might not only improve national productivity and employment but also help to produce more generally acceptable income distributions. Second, and differing from the largely pessimistic economic doctrine of yesteryear, the 1970s saw the development of a body of formal economic theory that was often optimistic as to the potential of participatory and labor-managed firms. There also have been developments in other disciplines that pointed to the potential for participatory firms under certain conditions (Bernstein 1976; Pateman 1970; Rothschild-Whitt 1979). The development of the outline of a new conceptual framework for the theoretical analysis of participatory firms and self-managed economies is of great significance in accounting for the outburst of academic interest in the area. Third, support for the new optimistic position that was grounded in formal economic analysis was provided by empirical studies which suggested that participatory firms can outperform their capitalist counterparts. Fourth, there has been a major spurt in the rate at which participatory and self-managed firms have been established in the last decade. Even after allowance is made for both the exaggerated claims of some enthusiasts and the fragility of available data, there remains an impressive documentation of the spread of the phenomenon of worker participation in recent years. Fifth, and in part caused by the above factors, the traditionally hostile position of many organizations toward participation has been modified, and in some cases has been reversed. For example, in their representations to the Bullock Committee (see Bullock, 1977), many British labor unions reversed traditionally antipathetic attitudes toward codetermination, the Welsh Trade Union Congress (TUC) began giving serious consideration to committing union funds and its [pageend49]44 KOSMAS prestige to the establishment of PCs in Wales, and in many Scandinavian countries trade unions began encouraging codetermination. The position of many other groups on PCs is also being intensely debated and support by political parties for different species of participation seems to be growing. (In Britain, for example, all major political parties have gone on record as favoring PCs of one kind or another.) Extent of Worker Participation in the West Unfortunately, there is very little systematic evidence on the extent of various forms of worker participation in different Western countries. As was already mentioned, parity or minority codetermination is practiced in many Western European countries and it affects a large proportion of the Western European industrial labor force. The early post-World War II period and then the decades of the 1970s and 1980s also witnessed a rapid rise in the number of PCs in several western countries.. The best available evidence suggests that the number of workers employed in producer cooperatives stands at about 7,000-10,000 in the United States, 7,000 in Great Britain, 35.000 in France, 19,000 in the Mondragon complex of Spain, and 430,000 in Italy. These figures represent minimal estimates since unregistered (unrecorded) coops may exist in many of these countries.5 Many traditional firms also offer significant profitsharing schemes to its non-managerial employees. While the existence of such schemes has been well known in some of the few celebrated cases (e.g. IBM, Chrysler and Ford), the statistics of the U.S.-based Profitsharing Foundation that over 2,000 U.S. enterprises now offer profitsharing to non-managerial employees comes as a surprise to many observers. In sum. the data on the overall extent of worker participation in management, profits and capital ownership do not exist, but available evidence suggests that these phenomena have become important in many Western countries and that their impact deserves careful analysis. Theoretical Predictions The formal economic theory of the effects of codetermination examines the interaction between workers, managers and shareholders. It conceptualizes the introduction of codetermination as a rise [pageend50]THE WESTERN EXPERIENCE 45 in workers’ bargaining power which is likely to result in a higher wage (labor cost) and which, depending on workers’ preferences, may or may not result in misallocation of resources (fall in employment).6 The theory would hence equally apply to the case of an increase in trade union power—a view of German codetermination that is espoused for instance by the management and shareholder associations. Another strand of the literature examines the effect of codetermination on productive efficiency. The motivation for this literature is both economic and noneconomic and it applies to participatory and fully labor-managed firms (or PCs) as well. The literature addresses the issue of whether the introduction of some form of participation enhances or diminishes the productivity of the firm. This is of course an important issue from the public policy standpoint and the literature has therefore received considerable attention. The theoretical arguments in this area have not been formal and no unifying framework has so far been developed. The main arguments may be summarized as follows.7 The introduction of effective forms of worker participation in management, profit or capital ownership may affect productive efficiency by altering (a) the productive skills of the labor force, (b) workers’ effort or intensity of work, and (c) the firm’s organizational efficiency. The first two effects can be regarded as labor-embodied while the third one is disembodied. Positive effects on productivity Worker participation in management presumably produces a more democratic environment as well as superior channels for informationprocessing and conflict resolution. Better conflict resolution reduces labor turnover and hence increases workers’ tenure with the firm.8 Longer average tenure then translates into higher productivity through its positive effect on workers’ firm-specific human capital. Worker participation, profit-sharing and ownership of assets are also hypothesized to provide better incentives and possibilities for workers to acquire human capital. The incentives are non-material, stemming from greater identification with the firm and its prosperity, as well as material, stemming from higher earnings during the longer expected tenure with the firm and the desire to share in as large profits as possible.9 Since many productive skills are acquired with the help of fellow workers, the willingness to assist others in on-the-job learning is regarded as an important productivity-enhancing feature [pageend51]46 KOSMAS of participatory, profit-sharing and worker ownership schemes (Levin, 1982). The effect on morale and quality of work is generated by a more positive perception of the workplace and a greater feeling of responsibility of workers as well as by their material motivation to enhance earnings which are linked directly to performance. Since the traditional adversarial relationship between labour and management is replaced by a more cooperative atmosphere of joint welfare maximization, the existing peer group pressure is towards better work rather than towards shirking or even sabotage.10 Superior communication channels resulting from a more participatory environment can help eliminate organizational inefficiencies that workers have no incentive to disclose (and in fact may promote) in a fixed-wage non-cooperative setting. This better use of workers’ organizational know-how is coupled with their greater willingness to implement decisions efficiently, accept technical change and advance innovative proposals in their own areas of expertise (Vanek, 1970). The team spirit brought about by the new institutional framework can also improve productive efficiency by reducing monitoring and supervision costs." Negative productivity effects In contrast to the positive arguments, numerous scholars and practitioners hypothesize that worker participation, ownership and profit-sharing affect productive efficiency negatively.12 It is observed that worker participation in management, by definition, entails less power and discretionary authority for managers. If managerial input is crucial for the firm’s productive efficiency and managers value power and discretion, greater employee participation will have a negative productivity effect arising from shirking by managers.13 Furthermore, the necessity to provide information to a relatively large group of inexperienced decision-makers (worker-members) and to undergo a relatively lengthy process to reach a decision is viewed as a factor that either slows down efficient decision-making or leads to ‘wrong’ decisions being taken. The hypothesis of a negative relationship between profit-sharing and productivity has been advanced primarily by organization theorists and property rights writers (see, e.g. Alchian and Demsetz, 1972, and Jensen and Meckling, 1979). Considering an individualistic rather than a collusive model of worker behavior, it is maintained that profit-sharing leads to shirking by workers. Group incentive [pageend52]THE WESTERN EXPERIENCE 47 schemes such as profit-sharing give each worker only a small fraction of any additional profit arising from his own effort; hence the incentive to enjoy the full benefit of shirking or on-the-job leisure (Meade, 1972). Monitoring of workers and managers is therefore needed, and for this monitoring to be efficient the bundle of property rights (including the right to keep the residual reward) must be vested in the central monitor. Since an individual worker receives only a small profit share, it is argued that monitoring will be suboptimal in a profit-sharing enterprise. Finally, the ownership of a firm’s assets by its workers is regarded as an example of an inefficient portfolio distribution by risk-averse individuals. If the firm’s policy reflects this ownership pattern, it will exhibit lower risktaking and on average will result in lower productivity than would be the case in a firm owned by fully diversified shareholders.14 Finally, the bulk of the theoretical literature focuses on the allocation of resources (allocative efficiency) in labor-managed firms (PCs). This literature has traditionally abstracted from most institutional features and examined in a simple mathematical form whether a stereotypical labor-managed firm which maximizes income per employed worker-member behaves differently than a stereotypical profit maximizing capitalist firm.15 The basic finding is that in the long-run, when firms can enter any given industry to compete away extra normal profits, the labormanaged and profit maximizing firms will behave identically. An analogous general equilibrium result is that an economy comprised of labor-managed firms will behave identically as an economy composed of profit maximizing firms. In terms of ’’long-run“ behavior, it is therefore possible to argue that labor-management is not inferior to capitalism. In terms of the short-run behavior, however, one finds a vast number of conflicting results. The basic theory, which assumes that the labor-managed firm maximizes income per worker, generates perverse behavioral results, the most striking among them being that the firm reduces the supply of its output when the price at which it can sell this output increases. This of course contrasts markedly with the profit maximizing firm which will eagerly produce and sell more at a higher price. The importance of this perverse finding is that, unless greater output will be supplied as a result of the free entry of firms in the long-run, an increase in demand by consumers (i.e. an increase in prices) will be met by a decrease in supply by firms, exacerbating the initial shortage, raising prices still further, [pageend53]48 KOSMAS leading to a further lowering of supply, etc. The problem is simply one of potential instability. Now, once the very strict income-per-worker maximizing model is modified even slightly (introducing for instance risk aversion, random allocation of layoffs, or compensation of laid off workermembers) the original perverse behavior with its backward bending output supply curve may no longer hold and a more plausible picture is one of a labor-managed firm whose output is relatively insensitive to price changes or one that responds positively just like its profit maximizing counterpart. The basic lesson that one gains from an in-depth examination of the theoretical literature is that there is a large number of competing hypotheses about both the productive and allocative behavior of participatory and labor-managed firm and that empirical testing is needed in order to resolve the issues. Empirical Evidence Empirical studies in this area are still very scarce and the quality of data is often not high enough to provide conclusive evidence. Nevertheless, the number of studies has increased rapidly in recent years and some tentative conclusions may now be derived. Moreover, one can also draw on case studies and casual observations in order to identify basic behavioral features. As far as the effect of parity codetermination on wages is concerned, the evidence from West Germany indicates that average hourly earnings were raised by about 6 percent in iron and steel but that the wage effect of introducing codetermination to coalmining, while positive, was statistically insignificant.16 No detectable effect could be associated with the introduction of the minority (one-third) representation of workers on Boards of Directors in the remaining industries. The effect of various forms of participation on productivity has been investigated in several econometric studies focussing on Germany, England, France, Italy, and Israel.17 The results indicate that the productivity effects of various forms of worker participation differ markedly from one institutional setting to another. However, in general they support the prediction that the overall effect of the various participatory schemes observed in Western producer cooperatives (PCs) is positive and in other types of firms positive or at least non-negative. The positive effect in PCs is found most uniformly with respect to profit sharing and, to a slightly lesser extent, indi[pageend54]THE WESTERN EXPERIENCE 49 victual capital (share) ownership by workers and participation in decision-making (measured by the proportion of workers who are coop members). Individual worker loans to the coop are not related to performance while collective capital ownership exhibits an insignificant or a negative productivity effect. The econometric findings with respect to PCs thus lend more support to the proponents than critics of various participatory schemes and they identify profitsharing, individual (as opposed to collective) ownership of capital and participation in management as key productivity enhancing areas. Similarly, less technical studies of the U.S. plywood cooperatives [e.g. Bellas (1982) and Berman (1976)] and of the Mondragon PCs in Spain [e.g. Thomas and Logan (1980) and Levin (1983)] suggest that these enterprises are more productive than their capitalist counterparts.18 These positive findings need to be qualified, however, because evidence is not so uniform in other contexts. An econometric study of West German codetermination found no significant effect on total factor productivity,19 while a study of West German industrial partnerships found the productivity effects of profitsharing and capital ownership to be insignificant but that of participation in management positive.211 The picture that emerges from the various studies is that participatory firms may confer important productivity benefits but that the magnitude of the effect varies and probably depends on organizational factors that have not so far been identified by the economic analysis. It is nevertheless important to note that virtually none of the economic studies finds the productivity effect of participation, profitsharing or (individual) worker ownership of assets (shares) to be negative. Conclusions An examination of the various developments with respect to worker participation indicates that (a) public as well as academic interest in this topic has been growing, (b) participatory firms are becoming increasingly frequent forms of economic organization, (c) the theoretical economic literature has expanded rapidly in this area but provided little guidance in policy work, and (d) empirical economic work is still limited but its results suggest that the productivity effect of participatory schemes are nonnegative and in many cases significantly positive. [pageend55]50 KOSMAS Further academic research should clearly focus on providing a better empirical understanding of why certain participatory schemes work better than others. In the policy arena, participatory firms promise to represent a possible alternative for promoting efficiency (competitiveness) together with a workplace democracy and worker satisfaction. NOTES 1.

[pageend60]WILL SYSTEMIC CHANGES HELP AGAIN? THE CRISIS OF THE YUGOSLAV ECONOMY IN THE EIGHTIES AND ITS ABILITY TO ADAPT TO GLOBAL STRUCTURAL CHANGE Joie Mencinger Summary The paper is divided into four parts. The main features of the economic systems before the ‘eighties are summarized in the first. An attempt is made to answer the question of what the reasons for the systemic changes were. The second part describes and comments on systemic changes in the ‘seventies and ‘eighties, and on debates which have been taking place during the turmoil of the ‘eighties. The normative setting of “contractual socialism” is sketched, the reasons for gaps between norms and reality are considered, and the stalemate of the debates and solutions in the eighties is illustrated. The third part presents economic performance within “systemic” periods and the most important economic movements of the ‘eighties, together with the effects systemic changes might have both on the performance and on structural changes. The most characteristic features of the Yugoslav economy in the ‘eighties, namely external imbalance, inflation, unemployment, and regional disparities, are analyzed somewhat more extensively. Some prospects of the Yugoslav economy for the second half of the ‘eighties and its ability to adapt to, if not benefit from, global structural change are summarized in the fourth. 55 [pageend61]56 KOSMAS 1. SYSTEMIC CHANGES, 1945-1986 In the theory of economic systems, the Yugoslav economy serves as the one example of what is called the self-managed, the participatory, the labor-managed or the socialist market economy. Benjamin Ward’s “Illyrian firm”, Evsey Domar’s “producers cooperative”, Jaroslav Vanek’s “labor-managed market economy”, and Branko Horvat’s “realistic model” have all been directly or indirectly inspired by the particularities of the Yugoslav institutional setting. This has, however, not been very stable. Thus, the Yugoslav postwar systemic development is often divided into distinct systemic periods. Four periods will be distinguished here: • the period of “administrative socialism” or the period of Soviet type economic system (1945-1952), • the period of “administrative market socialism” (1953-1962), sometimes referred to as the period of decentralization which gradually led to • the period of “market socialism” (1963-1973), and • the period of “contractual socialism” (from 1974 on), referred to as the period of income relations. The periodization is normative, with four postwar constitutions (in 1946, 1953, 1963, and 1974) forming the basis; the starting years of the periods are the years in which new constitutions were passed. Such periodization, based on constitutional rules for the functioning of the economy, is subject to criticism. First, it creates the notion of abrupt changes which did not occur. Second, some far reaching institutional changes preceded constitutional changes; some followed them in consecutive years. Third, the gap among the ideologies included in constitutions, the actual normative setting, and reality have always been wide. Fourth, some economic policy changes have had much greater impact on actual economic development than systemic changes. The 1965 economic reform which was dominated by the macroeconomic policy change (Bajt, 1984), (Burkett, 1983) has even been considered the turning point between the “more successful” and the “less successful” period of labor management (Horvat, 1971), (Sapir, 1980). The same is true in 1980, when the change in economic policy urged by indebtedness caused a similar turning point in all measurable performance indicators. The periodization is, however, closely related to the allocation of decisionmaking within the economy. [pageend62]WILL SYSTEMIC CHANGES HELP AGAIN? 57 In “administrative socialism” the answers to basic economic questions were to be given by the planner. In other words, valuation, organization of production, income distribution, and savings-and- investment decisions were to be centrally planned. After 1952, Yugoslavia started to move away, step by step, from the centralized economic planning by reducing administrative constraints and by giving enterprises a more independent role in decision-making. While the birth of the new system can be attributed to the Law on Management of Government Business Enterprises and Higher Economic Associations by Workers’ Collectives, enacted in 1950, its basic legal and political features were explicitly defined in the Constitution Act of 1953. It is this system which, according to the theory on economic systems, often serves as the one example of a socialist market economy or of a socialist self-managed economy. Up to the early sixties, self-management was rather limited even in a normative setting. In short, in the 1953—1962 period, two of the basic economic decisions, namely decisions on income distribution and savings-and-investment decisions, remained under strict government control, while the WHAT to produce was to be decided upon by consumers, and independent enterprises were free to decide HOW to organize production and HOW to combine productive factors. Although permanent systemic changes were taking place during the sixties, two reforms, in 1961 and in 1965, can be distinguished. Due to these reforms, the mechanism of economic control was reduced, the autonomy of economic units increased, and a phase referred to as “market socialism” was initiated. With the abolition of wage controls and with changes in the investment system, the remaining two basic economic decisions were, in the 1963-1973 period, at least formally transferred to independent enterprises. By the early seventies, important institutional changes were introduced. They started with the constitutional amendments in 1970, and were to be the blueprint for the so-called associated labor concept of the self-managed economy. Although they did not formally question the proclaimed basic elements of the socialist market system, the changes were so far-reaching that the market character of the Yugoslav economy has become questionable. Namely, to a considerable extent, the associated labor concept rejected two components of the market economy: the market as the basic allocative mechanism, and macroeconomic policy and indicative planning as means of indirect regulation of economic activities. It insisted that these were to be substituted to the greatest extent possible by mechanism of social contracts, self-management agreements, and overwhelming so[pageend63]58 KOSMAS cial planning. In short, who is to decide basic economic questions became blurred. The above normative periodization raises the question of what the reasons for systemic changes were, if the rather mystical “development of productive forces” is not accepted, the questions is reduced to a simpler one, namely whether the reasons behind (and the goals of) the systemic changes were inspired predominantly by economic or by political considerations. Although it is not easy to answer even such a simplified question, it seems that political factors prevailed in the abandonment of the Soviet-type, centrally planned system in the early fifties, and in the adoption of the associated labor concept in the early seventies, while the reforms in the early and mid-sixties were prompted predominantly by economic considerations. The motives for the changes in the early fifties have not yet been fully explained. According to "official belief”, the change can be explained by the considerations of Yugoslav political leaders, long before the break with the Soviet Union. This can hardly be proved by actual developments before or after the break. A favorable conjunction of events and circumstances (i.e., that the war of liberation had been in large part an independent effort and that the Soviet model had been voluntarily adopted), existed and made possible the rapid rejection of the Soviet model, but there is no evidence that workers self-management" had been in the air before it was officially introduced by the government”, which is the opinion shared also by some western scholars (Gurvitch. 1966). The organization of the economy, the overwhelming nationalization of practically every economic activity including typical noncapitalist forms of production, and the unprecedented increase in the pressure for forced collectivization in agriculture after the break with the Soviet Union indicate the opposite. Bad economic results, the difficulties encountered after the break, and the need to adapt to the new environment were in no doubt important. Nevertheless, ideological and political rather than economic issues were decisive in the search for new forms of socialism, organization and planning different from those in the USSR. The opinion that something had to be invented quickly appears to be close to the truth. This can be confirmed by the writings of Yugoslav political leaders at this time. To Boris Kidric, who was one of the architects of the economic system, both in the first and in the second period, state ownership was the highest form of the ownership of the means of production and planning was the fundamental law of socialist development [pageend64]WILL SYSTEMIC CHANGES HELP AGAIN? 59 (Kidric, 1949,1950). However, in less than one year state ownership was changed to only the first and the shortest step of the socialist revolution, and building of socialism was said to require the transformation of state socialism into a free association of direct producers (Kidric, 1950b). Very soon, similar statements were repeated by practically all Yugoslav social scientists. The ability of both, Yugoslav politicians and social scientists, to reread and to reinterpret Marx according to daily needs, was established for the first but not for the last time. The actual motives for the changes in the seventies, officially undertaken to reinforce the basic elements of the system of selfmanaged socialist economy, can be grouped into economic, social and political. Among the economic motives, the development after the 1965 reform was the most important . In other words, the enforcement of market principles combined with restrictive macro- economic policy measures after the 1965 economic reform produced predictable though unanticipated results. The growth of the economy was slowed considerably. The social and political consequences of rapidly increasing unemployment resulting from both, the long run development on the supply side and the short run slack in the demand for labor, could only be alleviated by the mass exodus of workers abroad. The cost-push inflationary pressures emerging form the increased freedom of enterprises in the distribution of income resulted in inflation. The balance of trade worsened and the Yugoslav share in world exports started to decline, though in the balance of payments these results were offset by the remittances of workers abroad and flourishing tourism. In short, the economic aims of the reform were not realized, and economic reform has increasingly been considered a failure and to signal an end to the “Yugoslav economic miracle” (Sapir. 1980). Rather poor economic performance was accompanied by the even less desirable developments in the social and political spheres. Social property defined as property of “each and all”, meaning the free access of each and all to the existing means of production, degenerated into group property (Bajt, 1980). The inequalities among individuals and among regions increased, causing social and political tensions among the republics. Furthermore, the concentration of economic power in the hands of managerial-technocratic elites (though predominantly the members of the party) not only endangered workers' control in the enterprises but threatened to deprive the party bureaucracy of political control. The last mentioned point appears to also be the most important for changes in both the economic and [pageend65]60 KOSMAS the political system. The institutional changes emerged as inevitable if the system and particularly the political power of the LCY (The League of Communists of Yugoslavia) and its actual control of social, political, and economic development were to be saved. The market proved socially and politically less neutral than assumed in either the Langean theory of decentralized socialism (developed by Oskar Lange, Polish Marxist economist, in the nineteen-fifties and -sixties) or in the theory of labor-managed socialism. 2. “CONTRACTUAL” SOCIALISM, 1974-1986 2.1 . The Normative Setting The new economic system was shaped by Edvard Kardelj, who dominated Yugoslav economic and political thinking for more than twenty years. Again, there was no difficulty in finding the roots and explanations in Marx’s teaching, and once again Yugoslav social scientists were rather unique in applauding its appearance. Occasional doubts as to its functioning and performance were pushed aside. The system was legalized by the Constitution of 1974, and by the Associated Labor Act in 1976. In the ensuing years parts of the system were gradually adapted. Every single part of the economic system was affected, and entirely new and rather awkward terminology was introduced. Only the most important institutions can be sketched here: the new organizational forms, such as the so-called income relations and pooling of labor and resources, the institutions of free exchange of labor, and the system of social planning. The Basic Organization of Associated Labor (BOAL) was introduced as the basic organizational unit. According to the Constitution and Associated Labor Act it is the form in which workers, directly and on terms of equality, realize their socio-economic and selfmanagement rights. The relationships among workers within BOAL, among BOALs within the Working Organization (WO, enterprise), and within the Composed Organization of Associated Labor (COAL), are formulated by the Self-Management Agreements (SMAs) another specific feature inaugurated by constitutional reform. The proclamation that the maximization of income is to be the basic objective function of BOALS, WO’s, and COALs “resolved” the old debate of what is the appropriate objective function for a worker—managed economy, begun by Ward’s “natural and rational” rule (Ward, 1958), and accepted by most foreign scholars in the field (Domar, 1966), [pageend66]WILL SYSTEMIC CHANGES HELP AGAIN? 61 (Vanek, 1970), (Sapir, 1980) but less so by the Yugoslavs (Horvat, 1972), (Dubravcic, 1970). The basic principles of the system should also manifest themselves in the specific functioning of the market confined to a commodity market. It has been assumed that social property and self-management promote cooperation rather than competition. This required an invention of a new instrument which was to replace contracts between the parties in a market economy. SMA has been considered to be an appropriate name for it. SMA’s are binding bi- or multilateral contractual agreements signed by economic agents for the realization of specific objectives derived from the maximization of income. They should serve as a mechanism for inter-enterprise and inter-BOAL communications, replacing mediation by planning agencies or price signals. The SMA’s, which can be considered macro- economic devices, have been combined with the system of Social Contracts (SC), another major institutional innovation. SCs are agreements among sociopolitical communities (governments at different levels) or between them and other agents in the economy, including chambers of commerce, trade unions, and Self-Managed Associations of Interest (SMAIs), and are used to state policy objectives in different areas such as planning, income distribution etc.. They are to substitute or to help to promote laws in regulating economic activity. SCs are thus typical macroeconomic devices. The institution of both vertical and horizontal “pooling of labor and resources” has been seen as one of the cornerstones of the system; first, as a replacement of short run demand-supply market relations; second, for channeling of investment resources to their most profitable uses, and third, as a way in which policy objectives could be achieved. The SMA’s for the channeling of investment resources should exceed the indicative role in the area of investment decision making. They have been designed to replace the functions of the capital market, i.e. to solve the problems of capital mobility and resource allocation. It has been hoped that they could cope with low mobility of capital and encourage the distribution of investible resources between surplus and deficit enterprises without mediation of banking institutions which have become ideologically suspicious. The concept of Free Exchange of Labor (FEL) is an innovation in the system of social finances which deals with the formation and the use of resources for the satisfaction of social and individual needs which cannot be met through the market mechanism. Two basic categories of social needs are distinguished; general needs and collective needs. The former, being in the interest of the entire [pageend67]62 KOSMAS community, are budget-funded with funds provided predominantly through taxes. The concept of FEL relates to collective needs and should curb the role of the state and replace it by direct relations between the producers of services. Funding is to be ensured predominantly through self-imposed contributions. The SMA’s are thus the organizational forms which link the interests of those who use the services and those who produce them. A disappointment with the market revived confidence in planning, which had previously in fact been abolished, although the institution of midterm plans and yearly resolutions had persisted with little relevance for actual developments. The revival of the confidence in planning, however, required its reconciliation with the proclaimed premises of the economic system. As the systems of directive planning or indicative planning could not be adapted to the concept of the new system, social planning was invented. It differs considerably from both directive and indicative planning. Its basic characteristics can be summarized as follows: Planning involves all relevant organizations, requires their active participation and carries legal obligations. It consists of macroeconomic planing of economic units (BOALs, WOs, COALs), and of macroeconomic planning of sociopolitical communities. There is an obligatory exchange of information by all economic units. The coordinated plans are codified into legally binding agreements—SMAs and SCs. All affected parties are to be consulted and their agreement secured before the codification. The basic plan is the midterm five-year plan with annual assessments and revisions. The planning process is continual and is carried over simultaneously by all planning agents. 2.2 The Norms And The Reality Although the divergence between actual practice and legal doctrine has been the rule rather than the exception in Yugoslavia, the breakdown of the system introduced by institutional reforms in the seventies can hardly be denied. Suffice it to consider the legislation which elaborated the institutions and functioning of the system. The laws regulating the behavior of economic units in the distribution of income, price formation, and foreign trade regulations, which were introduced after 1976, are only some of those which have been explicitly or implicitly abolished and replaced by new laws or administrative measures soon after their appearance. Some other laws, for example the law on planning or the law on “compulsory pooling [pageend68]WILL SYSTEMIC CHANGES HELP AGAIN? 63 of labor and resources” of commercial with manufacturing enterprises have remained irrelevant for the actual functioning of the economy. The explanations of the gap between the blueprints and the reality differ. Two theories can, nevertheless, be distinguished: the first explaining the collapse of the blueprints by the inappropriate behavior of economic units, and the second, blaming the blueprints. It does not seem to be too hard to decide for an answer if the following two principles are applied: first, that economic laws function independently of the system while the results of their functioning are determined by the system, second, that economic units behave rationally regardless of the system which itself, however, determines what is rational. Thus, if the unavoidable functioning of economic laws and rational behavior of economic units produce undesirable results, or if economic units do not behave in accordance with the premises of the system, the problem is most likely within the system. The system appears to have at least three important deficiencies: first, it is based on ideological constructions of reality and on correspondingly unrealistic performance expectations; second, the findings of economic theory are simply overlooked; third, the system is overloaded with needless institutions. This skepticism about the functioning of the system has been rejected by appealing to the peculiarities of the socialist self-managed economy. The problems which should be dealt with concretely have instead been “resolved” by ideological statements. For example, the wages-accumulation dilemma which could be discussed in the framework of the Furubotn-Pejovich wealth—maximization assumption (Furubotn, Pejovich, 1975) has been pushed aside by proclaiming the responsibility of associated labor to reproduce in an expanded way. The monopolistic economic structure and its consequences, exacerbated by the pooling of labor and resources, were overlooked. The institutions of “free exchange of labor” required additional administration and caused enormous costs to those who were losing time in “decision making”, and excused the government from the duty to develop a fiscal policy. The system of planning which is considered theoretically highly appealing as being a promising attempt to provide an ex ante general equilibrium solution ( Ardalan, 1980) is, due to giant information barriers, unfeasible, leaving aside the problems related to the usefulness of establishing general equilibria in future markets. In short, the blueprints of the system were either inoperative or produced undesirable results. Both required government interventions. A number of suspended or irrelevant “rules of the game” had [pageend69]64 KOSMAS to be replaced. This has been done by an enormous amount of administrative measures and incessant changes in legislation. Due to such developments, the proclaimed blueprints have been gradually replaced and the system has gradually acquired many characteristics of administrative systems. The rigidity, the slowness, the inconsistency of administrative measures, the distrust towards the decision making by economic units, and the application of noneconomic means to the implementation of economic goals are among them. Rigidity is the straightforward consequence of the fact that administrative measures cannot consider the variety of possible situations. Slowness and inconsistency are amplified by the need to obtain the compliance of regional governments and of cartelist economic groups, which implies compromise. Distrust towards the decision-making of economic units emerges from the characteristics of administrative measures. Economic units respond to administrative measures in a way which, in the existing system, is rational in a micro-sense. Their responses are. however, considered socially undesirable. Furthermore, the responses often appear to be irrational in a micro-sense as well, if they are judged by the expected behavior in a market economy. The “irrational” and socially undesirable responses of economic units demand new administrative measures which produce both incessant changes in the system and its instability. Because the required behavior contradicts the natural goals of economic units, it can only be imposed by political persuasion. This increases the role of politics and politicians in the economy. 2.3 The Debates In The Eighties While the criticism of the associated labor concept of the selfmanaged economy along the lines sketched above was vigorously refuted in the seventies as hostile to self-management and socialism, it soon became clear that the system blueprints were either inoperative or produced undesirable results. This became particularly apparent after 1979. when the inflow of foreign capital ceased. 1979 can therefore be considered the peak year of “contractual socialism”. However, contrary to the situation in 1950. when “administrative socialism” was quickly abolished, the disbanding of the “contractual” system has, at least on the ideological level, been rather slow. On the other hand, more and more government interventions have been required to replace a number of suspended or irrelevant “rules of the game”. The economic situation has developed into the most severe crisis of the Yugoslav economic and political system, and prompted a new [pageend70]WILL SYSTEMIC CHANGES HELP AGAIN? 65 reform. It started in 1982 with the “Long Run Stabilization Program” (savezni drustveni savet, 1984) which consists of seventeen documents (over 1000 pages) dealing with inflation, unemployment, foreign economic relations, infrastructure, agriculture, transport, energy, “small scale” industry, regional development, social policy, changes of the economic and legal system etc. It was produced by groups of economists led and supervised by politicians. While the Program is highly inconsistent in its approaches to different economic problems, one could say that it contains all schools of economic thought, from extreme monetarist to orthodox Keynesian, often nicely cloaked in Marxian terminology. Its main orientation is nevertheless clear: the reintroduction of the market and the reduction of a number of institutions introduced in the seventies. Enormous conceptual differences between the Long Run Stabilization Program, which tried to revive “market socialism” and the Associated Labor Act, which is the cornerstone of “contractual socialism”, have not deterred politicians and some social scientists from applauding both at the same time. The Program has remained the single proclaimed answer to the crisis in most of the speeches at the party and trade union congresses in 1986. This, however, does not mean that all politically relevant social groups in fact accept the premises of the Program or that its parts (which have not been enforced by the International Monetary Fund) have been readily introduced into the economic system. On the contrary, the future systemic development appears to be less clear at the beginning of 1987 than it was in the preceding years. The stalemate can be easily illustrated. Another document, the Critical Analysis of the Functioning of the Political System of Socialist Self-management, (savezni drustveni savet, 1985) which appeared at the end of 1985, has even been considered an alternative to the Program by most economists. The Analysis, although stressing the need for radical changes and formally appealing to the Program, reopened most economic questions dealt with in the Program. More importantly, its basic idea is that there is no need for any changes in the premises of the economic system. What should be changed, according to the Analysis, is the behavior. Thus, the breakdown of the system and the catastrophic economic results were, according to it, caused by inappropriate behavior of economic units and not by deficiencies of the blueprints. Actual changes in the economic system are nevertheless occurring permanently. Two quite different directions can be distinguished. Some systemic laws reintroduce the “rules of the game” which restore [pageend71]66 KOSMAS “market socialism”, while others strengthen the transition to “administrative socialism”. The price control law of 1984, the law on the banking system (1985), the proposal to abandon the law on compulsory “pooling of labor and resources” between trade organizations and the productive organizations, can all be considered examples of the first direction, while the new laws regulating foreign economic relations (1985), or the proposals for the regulation of income distribution, strengthen the transition to the administrative system. The 1984 price control law abolished the Self-Managed Associations for Prices and the criteria for price formation, and restored the principle of free price formation on the enterprise level without negotiations within the SMA’s and, quite realistically, without the need for government price controls. However, less than two years later, the new government proposed a new law, which reintroduces the criteria for price formation, and increases administrative controls. The 1985 law on the banking system reestablished banks as independent economic units. On the other hand, the foreign trade system of 1977 (the actual operation of which was enabled by the help of “gray” markets for foreign currency, cloaked by appropriate selfmanaged terminology) was replaced by the administrative system in 1986. The questionable right to foreign currency by those who “created” it and the theoretically unacceptable principle by which imports should equal exports on all levels, were replaced by a principle of socially (administratively) determined “import needs”. The new planning law, while simplifying the planning system to some extent, retained most characteristics of social planning and reintroduced some features of directive planning. Furthermore, the short-run plans for 1986 and 1987 (resolutions) reinforced direct control in those fields where such control existed previously (prices, imports), extended it to new fields (inventory formation), and questioned some of the cornerstones of the Program, such as the "real positive interest rate” and the real exchange rate. The variety of ideas concerning the way out of the crisis which has been generally recognized as overwhelming, as simultaneously economic, social, political, and moral, has been particularly wide in academic debates. A number of solutions have been suggested and most of the hitherto taboo topics have been reopened (Horvat, 1985; Jerovsek et al., 1985). These include, to name a few, recognition of labor and capital markets as indispensable segments of the market economy; changes in the principles of self-management (Goldstein, 1985); questioning of the concept of “social property” and its re[pageend72]WILL SYSTEMIC CHANGES HELP AGAIN? 67 placement by “collective property” (Bajt, 1986); and restoration of a mixed economy (Popovic, 1984). Although published, most of the ideas have been rejected, or effectively ignored. The Long Run Stabilization Program, which can be considered the reform proposal of the ‘eighties—if the changes of the ‘seventies are considered a counterreform—maintains some general characteristics of economic reforms in other socialist countries. It tries to increase economic efficiency by introducing or restoring the tools of capitalist market economics. The Program will, therefore, most likely share the fate of economic reforms in other socialist countries; the ideological obstacles and the fear of unacceptable weakening of the Party’s political monopoly will be the final and the most decisive arguments for determining the actual extent of the reforms and their duration. The ability to change the system and to reevaluate Marxist ideas might, again, push the trade-off between ideology and economic efficiency in favor of the later. The final direction of future systemic development is uncertain. It appears, however, that the outcome will be highly influenced by the present economic situation and its social and political implications. Administrative solutions will be favored for at least two reasons. First, the reintroduction of the market would increase social differences among individuals and regions to unacceptable dimensions. Second, increased efficiency of the economy can only be "achieved” by changing the framework which determines it, i.e. the economic and political system, and by giving up many “unquestionable” premises on social property, self-management, political monopoly of the Party, etc. 3. ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND RECENT DEVELOPMENT 3.1 Economic Systems and Their Performance The vast majority of efforts in analyzing performance of the socialist self-managed economy has been directed to macroeconomic issues. Macroeconomic performance has been judged predominantly by the deductive analysis comparing the worker-managed firm behavior to that of the capitalist firm under different assumptions about objective functions, production functions, institutional constraints on labor and capital supply, and environmental conditions. The macroeconomics of the labor managed economy have been much less analyzed though both, theoretical and empirical studies of mac[pageend73]68 KOSMAS roeconomic performance exist (Tyson, 1980), (Estrin. S. and Bartlett, W„ 1982), (Burkett, 1983), (Bajt, 1986), (Mencinger, 1986). The two most prominent scholars in the field of the labor-managed economy. Vanek and Horvat, have stressed the theoretical macro- economic advantages of the worker-managed economy. Vanek’s deductive conclusions about the performance of the self-managed economy are extremely favorable. “Comparatively—leaving aside the Soviet-type model as a basically inefficient one (except perhaps when it comes to income distribution)—there is every reason to believe that the participatory economy is, all other things considered, superior to the Western capitalist economy. In the sphere of how well it allocates resources in production, it has both advantages and disadvantages compared to the Western market alternative. It has a definite advantage in generating full employment, long-run price stability, and growth” (Vanek, 1971, p.38). Horvat arrived at similarly favorable macroeconomic implication. According to him (Horvat, 1972), high rates of growth are assured by a higher propensity to invest due to reduced risk and uncertainty, full employment by reluctance of workers to dismiss fellow workers, and control of inflation by the absence of the fundamental employee-employer conflict. In an empirical analysis for the 1972-1977 period the three testable macroeconomic characteristics proposed by Vanek and Horvat: (1) generation of full employment and short run stability, (2) long- run price stability, and (3) promotion of growth, were confronted with the Yugoslav reality (Mencinger, 1979). Only the first of the three macroeconomic implications—the proposition of short-run stability—was confirmed. The other two theoretical advantages—promotion of growth and long run price stability—were not confirmed. On the other hand, support for strong economic performance of the Yugoslav economy was provided by early empirical studies (Balassa, B. and Bertrand, J., 1970). Performance has often been described as impressive before 1965, and the declines after 1965 were attributed to the changes in external conditions, to the changes in the relative weights given to various economic objectives, to the increasing difficulties in attaining these objectives, and only partly to the system which weakened macroeconomic policy making (World Bank, 1979). It is beyond the scope of this paper to adequately analyze the performance of the Yugoslav economic system and to compare it to the performance of other systems, both capitalist and socialist. The knotty point of such an analysis is to disentangle systemic from other factors such as changes in external conditions, government [pageend74]WILL SYSTEMIC CHANGES HELP AGAIN? 69 regulations, interregional disparities, and macroeconomic policy measures which affect economic performance in different countries or in different periods. The results, which follow, should therefore be considered indicative. Performance indicators for the policy periods are summarized in Table 1 (i.e. indicators of growth, capital formation, standard of living, employment, price stability, efficiency of productive factors, employment balance, and external balance). A subperiod. 1980-1985, is added to the period 1974-1985. The growth rates in Table 1 appear satisfactory when compared to those of developed market economies. The comparison with similar countries, however, suggests that Yugoslav growth performance was not exceptional except for the agricultural production in the period 1953-1962, which was predominantly a result of the fact that the previous catastrophic policy of collectivisation had been abandoned. A much higher industrial performance in the second, compared to the first rate period, is evident as well, although this rapid growth is at least partly due to huge investments in industries with high capital/output ratios and long gestation periods, which started in the first period but added to growth in the second. The comparison of the growth figures from the two most recent periods with figures for the comparable group of countries (middle income oil importers) indicates that they are in the same general range. For both periods the average rates of GNP growth in Yugoslavia were slightly lower than for the group (7.0% for 1965-1973 and 5.6% for the 1973-1980 period); industrial production growth was slightly higher in Yugoslavia in the first period (8.6% compared to 8.2%) but lagged behind in the second (3.8 compared to 5.4%). Growth of agricultural production lagged in both periods—3.1% compared to 3.4% and 2.1% compared to 2.7% (World Bank, 1985). The figures on the share of investments in GNP, however, suggest that the cost of growth in Yugoslavia was much higher, and indirectly, that Yugoslavia, despite all institutional changes, retained the Soviet pattern of development. According to the figures of the World Development Report, the investment share in GNP in middle-income oil importing nations was 22.0% in 1965, 24.9% in 1973, and 26.6% in 1980. The same source reports the Yugoslav figures as 30.2% for the 1965-1972 period, 33.1% for the 1973-78 period, and 36.5% for the 1979-1983 period. The figures confirm the estimates (Bajt, 1984), that the growth of GNP per unit of investments in the 1960-1980 period was only 62% of the growth per unit of investments in comparable market economies of South Europe.

The shifts indicate that the changes in efficiency are related to systemic changes. In the period of “administrative socialism” economic growth was achieved by enormous input increases; both capital/output and labor/output ratios increased rapidly. When rigid planning was abolished and the sovereignty of planners was replaced by that of consumers and independent producers, the economy became more efficient. In the period 1953-1962, both the capital/output and the labor/output ratios decreased rapidly. In the third period, the capital/output ratio started to grow again, while the labor/output ratio slowly decreased. The changes in the distribution mechanism, which made the relatively abundant Yugoslav labor expensive (the majority of taxes and contributions were levied on wages) and scarce capital a free good (with real interest rates negative), appear to be important for such a development. The situation worsened considerably in the period of “contractual socialism”; the capital/output ratio started again to increase rapidly, while the labor/output ration stagnated and even began to increase after 1980. 3.2 The State of the Economy in the 'Eighties The unsolved and and probably unsolvable systemic dilemmas will no doubt be the most important determinants of the Yugoslav future—economic, social, and political. One should, however, not overlook the state of the economy (putting aside its interdependence with systemic changes) and its direct effects on future economic development. 3.2.1. Foreign Economic Relations The macroeconomic performance in the period of “contractual socialism” is characterized by the break in 1980, dividing the more and the less successful subperiods. The movements in the balance of payments, however, indicate that the success before 1980 was fictitious. The yearly inflows of foreign capital were, namely, greater than the increases in the gross domestic product. Thus, the Yugoslav economy would have stagnated for a decade if there had been no net foreign capital inflows. When the possibility of development based on foreign accumulation faded and when accumulated debts required enormous outflow of capital for debt servicing, this fictitious success dissolved as well. [pageend77]KOSMAS Graph 1 THE SHIFTS OF PRODUCTION MTNCTIONS 1948-1984 [pageend78]WILL SYSTEMIC CHANGES HELP AGAIN? 73 The interdependence between economic performance and external balance in the 1971-1984 period can be summarized by the relationship between GNP growth and export/import ratio. It is presented by an equation, with growth being the dependent and the export/import ratio the independent variable. rGNP = 18.47 - 0.23 E/IM R2 = 0.71 (7.3) (-5.6) DW = 1.63 The equation, which is statistically acceptable, suggests that an increase of 1 point in the export/import ratio reduced the growth rate by 0.23 points. The attempts of economic policy to restore external balance in 1972 and in 1975-1976 were followed by a deterioration at home and were quickly abandoned. Only when after 1979 indebtedness became excessive, did economic policy finally shift towards restoration of external balance. This is presented by the movements of balance of payments in Table 2. The “price” for achieving external equilibrium was high. It consisted of stagnation, unemployment, inflation, and increased interregional disparities. The growth of GNP decreased from 6.1% yearly in the period 1971-1979 to only 0.9% in the period 1980-1985. The unemployment rate reached 15.4% at the end of 1985. The average inflation rate increased from 20% in the 1971-1979 period to 40% in the 1980-1984 period, and to 90% in 1986, with the spiraling inflationary tendency. Real wages declined to two thirds of those in 1979, and interregional differences increased. 3.2.2. Inflation In the framework of Vanek’s general theory of the labor-managed economy (Vanek, 1970), long-run price stability should be more easily achieved in a socialist market economy than in its capitalist counterpart. Unfortunately, the facts have flatly contradicted the theory. The Yugoslav economy has always been subject to considerable inflationary pressures, and in the 'eighties, inflation acquired some characteristics of hyperinflation. These are the interfacing factors which can explain the inflationary movements in the ‘eighties: (1) systemic factors, (2) the shift in the allocation of macro-output, and (3) government interventions. (1) Three systemic factors will be briefly discussed; creation of aggregate excess demand; prevention of the entry of efficient economic units; and creation of a monopolistic economic structure.

KOSMAS [pageend80]WILL SYSTEMIC CHANGES HELP AGAIN? 75 Systemic factors can be blamed for inflationary pressure resulting from the nature of saving-investment decisions in the labor-managed economy. For if workers decided on income distribution, which they should in the framework of the norms, one could expect the largest possible share of enterprise income would be channeled to wages, in order to increase private consumption and private saving, and not to enterprise funds which would increase the social productive assets and the probability of future higher wages. The preferences for channeling savings into social fixed assets are, due to limited property rights, unlikely unless workers become legal collective owners of the assets. Those enterprises which accumulate enough to meet a high investment propensity, increased by the “soft budget constraint”, are therefore exceptions. Although the savings instrument gap could be filled with private savings through the banking system, the socialist environment (restrictions on the ownership of the means of production, relatively high social security, a destroyed price structure) increases the propensity to consume or to invest in nonproductive assets. Inflationary financing of investments in productive assets can therefore be considered as a normal replacement of direct forced savings which characterizes other socialist countries. This implies persistent overall macro-excess demand, which before the 'eighties was at least partly softened by the inflow of foreign capital. Agriculture provides the most characteristic example of the relationship between structural cost-push explanation of long-term inflation. The ideological prejudices against family farms, summarized in the maximum land tenure requirement, prevent the entry of efficient private economic units and favor large-scale socialist farms which also operate far from the minimum long-run average cost point. Productivity in the agricultural sector therefore lags behind technological possibilities, while the growth of agricultural incomes must follow general income growth in the economy, which is possible only if the prices of agricultural products increase faster than they would if efficient units were not prevented entry. The inflationary nature of the Yugoslav economy increased considerably in the period of “contractual socialism”, which created monopolies also in those fields in which natural monopolies had not existed before. Legally promoted price agreements caused formation of prices which enabled the least efficient producer to survive, the others being satisfied with smaller shares of the market, but at prices higher than those at which they would otherwise be willing and able to produce. In the context of Kornai’s shortage economy, one could [pageend81]76 KOSMAS claim that the institutions of “contractual socialism” considerably softened “soft budget constraints” and reduced price responsiveness. (2) World inflation in the early ‘eighties, and the need to establish external payments balance, forced domestic inflation in the ‘eighties even higher. Increased shortages of imported materials strengthened the monopolistic structure of the economy. The breakdown of the legal system, the need to establish “equilibrium” prices of capital (positive real interest rates) and of foreign exchange (“real” exchange rate of the dinar) was accompanied by an enormous surge in excess demand, caused by the reduction of the balance of payments deficit. The possibility of balancing aggregate demand and supply by external imbalance faded; domestic demand, which reached 110% of the domestic supply in the seventies, had to be reduced to 95%. This shift in the allocation of macro-output is the most important direct cause of the rise of inflation in the ‘eighties. (3) Although economic policy cannot be blamed for what happened in the early ‘eighties, it can be blamed for the use of inappropriate devices to curb inflation. Inflation control was reduced to direct price controls which were not even accompanied by wage controls, and to incessant switches from relatively liberal price controls to relatively strict ones. The resulting destruction of price structure caused partial imbalances and increased overall imbalance for a very simple reason; the uncontrolled wages and frozen prices increased aggregate excess demand. Frequent policy switches increased inflationary expectations and prompted the responses of the enterprises to expected future price freezes. 3.2.3. Unemployment The economic, social and political implications of the unemployment figures in Yugoslavia differ in many respects from the implications of comparative figures for a developed industrial country. The labor supply and demand characteristics make Yugoslav unemployment basically a long-term and regional problem. The labor supply is determined by the developing nature of the country, with relatively high birth rates, a high percentage of agricultural population. and a specific ownership structure with predominantly socialist nonagricultural and predominantly private agricultural sectors. Rapid industrialization, the spread of technological progress in agriculture, differences in real wages, and economic policy inspired by ideological prejudices, caused a quick one-way flow of labor from agriculture to the nonagricultural sector. Agriculture became the most [pageend82]WILL SYSTEMIC CHANGES HELP AGAIN? 77 important source of labor for the nonagricultural sector, a buffer against social and political effects of unemployment. On the other hand, demand for labor was determined by the long-term scarcity of capital, which implies a complementary rather than a substitutional relation between the labor and capital. This was amplified by the availability of underpriced capital, which favored capital-intensive project selection in a country where capital actually was the scarce and labor the abundant factor of production. Ideologically founded constraints have also affected demand for labor, as well as transferred private capital (especially from workers abroad) into consumption and nonproductive investments (cars, housing) instead of channeling it into productive investments. Four categories of unemployment should be distinguished if we wish to properly discuss the unemployment problems in Yugoslavia: registered', standard hidden', “internal” (those who are formally employed but do not add to the product); and potential (workers abroad) unemployment. The number of job seekers (those registered as unemployed) at the of 1985 reached 1, 080,000 and the unemployment rate stood at 15.55%. (Note that the unemployment rate—the number of registered job seekers vs. the number of employees—is unrealistically high because of the very narrow definition of employment, which does not take into account independent farmers and other active persons who do not comply with the official status of employed person). The category of hidden unemployment does not differ significantly from similar categories in other economies and can be estimated by demographic and employment movements. Both open and hidden unemployment are concentrated in the less developed regions. Domestic employment in the ‘seventies and ‘eighties is characterized by an autonomous growth independent of ups and downs in production growth. When after 1980 employment continued to increase but was not matched by increased production, “internal” unemployment, which characterizes socialist planned economies, started to rise quickly. In a study which uses the minimum labor per unit of output ratio as a measure of full utilization of those employed (Mencinger, 1983), it was estimated that at the end of 1982 approximately 20% of those employed in the socialist sector represented disguised overemployment. Thus a total of more than twelve hundred thousand workers should be added to 1,080 thousand registered job seekers, when estimating the utilization of labor resources. However, despite adverse economic [pageend83]78 KOSMAS effects, the growing scope of employment can be considered socially and politically desirable. Employment abroad can also be considered an “excess supply of labor” category, despite rather different social, political, and economic implications. The number of Yugoslav workers abroad is estimated at 675 thousand. The supply of labor is expected to slow down, mainly due to the age structures of the agricultural population. The demographers (Ma- cura, 1986, World Bank, 1983), nevertheless estimate that the net supply of labor will increase by 2.5% yearly, until 1990. A slower growth of output and accumulated “internal” unemployment will diminish the capacity of the economy to generate employment at a corresponding rate. The resulting gap can be filled by increasing “internal” unemployment, which has obvious but short-term social and political advantages, if compared to registered or hidden unemployment. Nevertheless, open unemployment could become the most important issue in the second half of the ‘eighties. The changed structure of the job seekers (skilled workers and young people concentrated in industrial centers, rather than unskilled workers dispersed in small villages) will affect its social and political dimensions. 3.2.4. Regional Disparities Regional disparities also appear to be one of the major category of obstacles to future economic development, and even more so, to changes in the economic and political systems. These (see Table 3) have actually increased, despite efforts to equalize the level of development throughout the country. The GNP per capita between Slovenia and Kosovo widened from 5:1 in 1955, to 7:1 in 1983. In addition, the intraregional differences are considerable within all regions. The increased regional disparities are not a result of the stagnation in the less developed regions (the growth of GNP was rather evenly spread and the growth of productive capital was higher in the less developed regions), although the development strategy, based on capital-intensive techniques, can be partly blamed. There are four main factors affecting interregional disparities, with very limited prospects of reducing them: demographic movement; differences in productivity between the modern nonagricultural and backward agricultural sectors; differences in productivity within sectors; and systemic factors. Differential population growth rates diluted the benefits of similar GNP growth rates and widened the ultimate gap between the less [pageend84]Table 3: t h e REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF YUGOSLAVIA Source:Stat1stfca1 Yearbooks, different years SFRJ BIH CG H M SL SR SRproper Kosovo Vojvodina participation rate (1984) .277 .227 .248 .327 .245 .432 .252 .276 . 120 .295 net participation rate (1984) .417 .365 .405 .527 .411 .690 .405 .427 .232 .460 unemployment rate (1984) . 153 .226 .232 .075 .262 .018 . 193 . 169 .491 . 154 GDP/capita (1983) 100 89 indexes 77 (Yugos 125 lavia * 65 100) 197 91 99 28 120 GDP/capita (1955) 100 83 77 122 88 175 86 91 43 94 GDP/employee (1983) 100 88 88 100 82 126 99 98 70 110 GDP/employee (1955) 100 87 87 102 100 129 89 85 108 95 GDP 5.7 5.3 growth 5.9 rates 5.3 1958 - 5.9 1983 8.0 6.0 5.9 5.7 8.2 population 0.9 1.2 1.1 0.5 1.4 0.8 1.0 0.8 2.4 0.5 GDP/capita 4.8 4. 1 4.8 4.8 4.5 5.2 5.0 5. 1 3.3 5.7 K/Q ratio (1983) 2.85 3.44 4.35 ratios 2.85 2.85 2.70 2.58 2.44 4.00 2.83 dK/dQ ratio 1971 - 1983 5.36 7.09 9.52 6.80 8.99 5.62 5.92 5.46 11.10 5.98 WILL SYSTEMIC CHANGES HELP AGAIN? [pageend85]80 KOSMAS and the more developed regions. While natural growth rates, birth rates, and fertility rates in the more developed regions, and also in most of the less developed regions, stabilized around 1970, the population of Kosovo continued to grow extremely rapidly. A fertility rate of 5.4 (in 1975) promises the population of Kosovo to more than double in one generation, meaning that even if the fertility rates were to decline sharply, the working age population would still continue to grow rapidly for decades. The disparity between the productivity of the modern nonagri- cultural, and traditional private agricultural sector, within the same region is enormous. Thus, the differences in participation rates, which indicate the relative size of the modern sector, point to the second main source of regional disparities. Differences in productivity within the modern socialist sector, as indicated by the differences in the average and marginal capital/output ratios, are the third consideration. The present low mobility of labor from the South to the North cannot be expected to increase soon (due to cultural differences and other factors such as housing). While this could be compensated by a transfer of capital and related technology from the North to the South, large voluntary transfers cannot be expected, partly due to low absorptive capacities in the South, and partly due to the legal status of social property, which does not protect the investors from losing both the capital invested and the control over established enterprises. Any sizable reduction of regional disparities will therefore be slow and expensive. A gradual reduction of disparities might be accompanied by an extended period of rising unemployment (Katz, 1985) and increased political tensions, aggravated by increased nationalism. Massive transfers of resources will, on the other hand, continue to be necessary, if socially and politically acceptable disparities are to be retained. This appears to be feasible only through administrative diverting of resources from the North to the South. 4. PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE AND THE ABILITY TO SHARE IN GLOBAL STRUCTURAL CHANGE The prospects of the Yugoslav economy for the second half of the eighties do not appear encouraging. The external payments balance was enforced due to overindebtedness, and achieved at the cost of internal imbalance. The possibilities of economic recovery and development will therefore be rather limited. The transformation of [pageend86]WILL SYSTEMIC CHANGES HELP AGAIN? 81 the economy, which obtained a large part of its disposable product (up to 10%) from abroad, into an economy where foreign demand increases the productivity enough to offset the loss of this part and to generate the outflow of capital required by debt servicing, can only be accomplished in the long run. The simple fact that it took half a decade to stabilize the current balance of payments indicates the difficulties of such changes. They will be hindered by the existing economic structure which renders export expansion more difficult, and by the existing economic system and its apparent inability to take advantage of favorable external conditions, such as, for example, prevailed in 1986. The adaptation to the external payments balance has the most seriously affected the share of investment in GNP, which means not only slower growth of productive capabilities and employment, but also a slower introduction of technological changes. This has, up to now, not even succeeded in compensating for the decreases in labor inputs nor in coping with the increased cost of the social and political superstructure. Securing minimal growth rates and preventing further deterioration of its economic position within Europe (relative to both Western and Eastern countries) appears to be the most Yugoslavia can hope to attain without a massive inflow of foreign capital, in the second half of the ‘eighties. The degree of ability of the Yugoslav economy to adapt to, if not to participate in, the global structural change remains another important issue. The state of the economy, the level of economic development, and the regional differences will no doubt be important obstacles. Can these obstacles be at least partly balanced by greater flexibility of the economic system, when compared to other socialist countries, which appear even less able to adapt to global change? Yugoslav attempts to carry out reforms, while retaining the principles of a socialist economy, deviate from reforms in other socialist countries in some respects. The swings were bigger and the extent of reforms was not limited by the external considerations, as in other Eastern European countries. While the changes in efficiency characteristics suggest that systemic reforms have affected economic performance, it is less clear what their impact on the economic structure have been. This could be established by comparing the pattern of structural change in Yugoslavia to the pattern of structural change in other countries, both market-oriented and centrally planned. Such a task, however, would exceed the scope of this paper. To get an indication of the effects the reforms likely might have had on [pageend87]82 KOSMAS (1) manufacturing and mining, (2) construction and transportation, (3) trade, catering, banking, and insurance (4) other services Source: Yearbook of Labor Statistics, ILO Geneva, 1981 Table 4: NONAGRICULTURAL EMPLOYMENT STRUCTURE country (1) (2) (3) (4) (l) + (2) (3) + (4) Austria 35.0 17.0 23.7 24.3 52.0 48.0 Belgium 27.9 15.6 26.4 30.1 43.5 56.5 Dannemark 24.0 16.7 22.3 37.2 40.7 59.3 Finland 31.0 16.3 22.8 30.0 47.3 52.7 France 29.3 16.4 25.6 28.2 45.7 54.3 Irei and 29.2 18.4 24.4 28.0 47.6 52.4 Italy 32.4 18.2 24.7 24.8 50.6 49.4 Nether land 23.7 17.9 27.4 31.0 41.6 58.4 Norway 24.0 18.1 25.0 32.9 42.1 57.9 Portugal 37.2 18.4 19.0 25.1 55.6 44.4 Spain 33.7 18.5 28.6 19.2 52.2 47.8 Switzerland 35.7 13.3 29.8 21.2 49.0 51.0 Sweden 26.3 14.2 21.1 38.4 40.5 59.5 Great Britain 32.1 13.5 24.6 29.8 45.6 54.4 Germany BDR 39.6 14.3 21.6 24.7 53.9 46.1 average 30.7 16.5 24.5 28.3 47.2 51.8 Yugoslavia 42.6 19.8 17.7 19.9 62.4 37.6 Bulgaria 44.8 20.8 11.0 23.4 65.6 34.4 Czechoslovakia 44.1 19.4 12.7 23.7 63.5 36.5 Hungary 43.2 20.4 12.2 23.9 63.6 36.4 Germany DDR 47.1 16.4 11.5 25.0 63.5 36.5 Poland 43.2 21.8 12.2 22.8 65.0 35.0 Romania 50.4 21.1 8.8 19.8 71.5 28.5 average 45.5 20.0 11.4 23.1 65.5 34.5 structural change, a one-period comparison is used, and to avoid the problems of relative prices involved in the comparison of production structures, employment structures are used. They are presented in Table 4. The main determinant of employment structure is no doubt the letel of economic development. Thus, the regression (based on crosssection data for 21 countries of Table 4. Yugoslavia excluded), to determine the explanatory role of economic svstem. was fitted, with [pageend88]WILL SYSTEMIC CHANGES HELP AGAIN? 83 the share of employment in manufacturing, mining, construction and transportation (sectors 1 and 2 in Table 4) in total nonagricultural employment being the dependent, and the per capita of GNP (data from Pryor, 1985, p. 68) and a dummy variable for economic system, being the independent variables. sL = 58.79 - 0.1816 * GNP/cap + 14.90 * D R2 = 0.86 (16.9) (-3.46) (7.47) SE = 3.61 As one could expect, in the post-industrial era, the shares of sector 1 and 2 are inversely related to the per capita GNP, and there is a significant difference between the systems. According to the equation, the share of employment in sectors 1 and 2 is, at the same level of development, higher by 15 units in the socialist countries. The estimated figure for Yugoslavia would be 69.0, if Yugoslavia followed the socialist planned type of development, and 54.2, if it followed the capitalist market type of development. The actual figure of 62.4 differs significantly from both, which could be considered an indication that economic reforms have had some impact on structural development. The question as to whether economic reforms could enable Yugoslavia to participate in, and to benefit from, global structural change, nevertheless remains unanswered. While reforms often indicate that the institutions of the given society are flexible, and therefore the country is able to adapt to structural change, this might not be true. For despite many reforms in the economic sphere, the political sphere, dominated by the monopoly of the communist party and the principle of democratic centralism, remained unchanged. Moreover, institutional reforms which created “contractual socialism” were adopted to preserve rather than to change the institutions, and to reinforce rather than to weaken the links between the economic and the political system, while true adaptation to global structural change would require above all thorough political reforms. Any economic reforms unaccompanied by political reforms could only increase the inconsistency between the market system and the political system, which could make the present stalemate permanent, or would even more likely lead back to an administrative economic system. This kind of obstacle to participation in global structural change can best be illustrated by a rather recent development. That is, Yugoslavia has not joined Eureka, European space program,for two reasons: political reconsideration was the internal, and a lack of enthusiasm about Yugoslav participation on the part of participant [pageend89]WILL SYSTEMIC CHANGES HELP AGAIN? 85 , 1983. “Otvorená nezaposlenost i zaposleni bez posla”, in Privredna Kretanja, 128, 27-40. , 1986. “The Yugoslav Economic Systems and Their Efficiency”, in Economic Analysis, Vol. 19, 31-43.

[pageend90]THE ADAPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF MARKET SOCIALISM: LESSONS FROM YUGOSLAVIA Arnold Katz The restructuring of the international economy in recent years has put the adaptability of most economic systems to tests from which few have emerged with flying colors. The singularly poor performance of the Yugoslav economy, which Dr. Mencinger’s excellent survey recounts, raises especially searching questions about Yugoslavia’s system of self-management. Evidently, Yugoslav aspirations of finding a distinctly better way than either East or West, through market socialism, appear to have been frustrated, at least for the moment. Was the Yugoslav dream overly ambitious, hopelessly naive, a victim of circumstances, or what? Fortunately, space constraints excuse me from attempting anything remotely resembling a complete answer to such a question. Nevertheless, I plan to use this opportunity afforded me to comment on Dr. Mencinger’s analysis of the prospects for the Yugoslav economy to attempt a broad outline of what I personally feel the Yugoslav experience tells us, the onlookers, about the feasibility and adaptability of systems of market socialism. The main point I hope to make is that a major lesson of the Yugoslav experience has been a demonstration of the close relationships between, to use a phrase coined by Charles Lindblom, politics and markets. The economic viability of market socialism has been 87 [pageend91]LESSONS FROM YUGOSLAVIA 89 tial in the development of the Hungarian approach,1 lays down centrally-imposed rules for plant managers which require them, in effect, to mimic the outcomes achieved by a more laissez-faire system. Vanek and Horvat, whose work has been more influential for the Yugoslav approach, look to the competitive worker control of enterprise decision-making for similar safeguards. A striking characteristic of these debates has been the neglect, on both sides, of the political preconditions for a system of market socialism to succeed. Critics and defenders alike assume that economic viability is a separable issue capable of analysis independently of the political institutions through which economic policy is made and implemented.2 Dr. Mencinger’s numerous examples of the political impediments to more effective economic policies in Yugoslavia give me an outstanding point of departure, for raising doubts about the relevance of a methodology of this kind for evaluating the Yugoslav experience. The Yugoslav Experience As the history which Dr. Mencinger surveys reveals, the course taken by Yugoslav self-management has twisted and turned through many systemic changes, but each and every phase has seen, at best, a half-hearted effort to implement policies promoting free market exchanges of goods and services. This was probably unavoidable during the 1953-62 learning era, of so-called administrative market socialism, when some 67 percent of the value of industrial output was regulated by price controls (Lydall, p.257). Still, extensive price regulation persisted into the subsequent 1963-73 years, when the Yugoslav practice of market socialism came perhaps the nearest to the textbook models and yet, according to one estimate, close to 45 percent of the value of industrial output remained subject to state control (Schrenk et al, p. 120). The period of “contractual socialism” from 1974 on has entailed a return to an almost universal system of what a leading Yugoslav economist has called “political” pricesetting by “closed local communities” under government supervision (Vojnic, quoted by Lydall, p.258). An extensive system of exchange controls, itself a consequence of the distortions produced by the other price regulations, has been further superimposed upon domestic prices. It is also the case that interest rates have been kept at artificially low levels, through all the systemic changes, with the disastrous economic consequences which Dr. Mencinger relates. [pageend92]90 KOSMAS I completely concur with his view that much of the considerable gap between economic expectations and performance can be traced back, in one way or another, to these ill-advised deviations from the basic philosophy of market socialism. Given this, one may be tempted to infer that there is really very little to be learned about market socialism from Yugoslavia’s experiences, because of its seemingly insincere commitment to the use of markets. Yet why has self-management evolved in this way? So far as 1 am aware, there has never been a very extensive analysis of this important question. Much of what we can hope to learn about the feasibility of market socialism from the Yugoslav experience may depend on how it is answered. I shall attempt to catalog some of the major hypotheses in the hope that bringing them together into one place may help to illustrate that they are highly interrelated, though perhaps not obviously so at first glance. Ideological Inertia As is well-known, Yugoslav self-management developed quite spontaneously, more as a pragmatic symbol of the break with the Soviet Union in 1948 rather than, at least at first, a full-fledged systemic reform (Rusinow, ch. 2). Its intellectual architects were Marxists, busily engaged, up to the time of the break, in recasting the Yugoslavia economy into a Soviet mold (Singleton, 1982), and were probably themselves very insecure about the wisdom of abandoning important economic decisions to be made by free markets. Thus the commitment to economic liberalization was, from the start, a shaky one at best. Difficulties in the early 60’s, which as Dr. Mencinger points out were mainly attributable to errors in macroeconomic policies, became equated with what looked, at the time, to be an ill-advised courtship with free markets. Free markets also came to be widely blamed for growing inequalities, inconsistent with socialist standards of equity and distributive justice.3 In this way, the half-heartedness of the commitment to genuine market socialism bred an impatience for quick results which helped to prepare the way for the economically reactionary constitutional reforms of the 70’s.4 In the final analysis, however, the importance one attaches to ideological factors must depend on the extent to which they actually shape institutional practices. With this criterion in mind, many important obstacles tó market socialism, such as the persistence of efforts to maintain artificially low interest rates, indeed seem to have [pageend93]LESSONS FROM YUGOSLAVIA 91 their roots in Marxist ideologies diametrically opposed to free market philosophies? Yet there are other major institutional impediments, such as the weaknesses of the federal government in formulating and implementing economic policies, which cannot be readily explained in these terms. Yugoslav Federalism Examples of these weaknesses abound, but the impotence of federal monetary and fiscal policies illustrates a particularly important case in which efforts to counter inflation, promote economic growth, and lay a generally healthier environment for market exchanges have failed for institutional reasons largely unrelated to ideological resistances to free markets. As an example of the constraints on fiscal policies, Lydall points out (p.264) that: Since 1971, the federal government has been deprived of any significant independent source of budget revenue other than customs duties, which cannot be arbitrarily raised so long as Yugoslavia remains a member of GATT. The major sources of federal revenue are a 50 percent share in revenue from sales taxes, and contributions from the republics and provinces. Since sales taxes are imposed at all levels of government— the federation, the republics and provinces, and the communes— changes in rates of sales tax cannot be made without general consent, at least between the federation and republics and provinces. The same applies to the contributions of the republics and provinces, which are laboriously negotiated each year. On the expenditure side of the federal budget about two-thirds goes towards defence and veterans’ benefits, and much of the remainder is committed to subsidies for the less developed regions. Hence very little federal expenditure can be appropriately reduced as part of a deflationary policy. Unless the present constitutional arrangements are greatly modified, giving the federal government independent authority, subject to parliament, to impose new taxes (for example on incomes, which are at present completely reserved for the republics, provinces, and communes) or to raise sales taxes, there will be little scope for fiscal policy in Yugoslavia. The Central Bank, on the other hand, has instruments, such as the authority to set reserve requirements, to pursue more effective monetary policies, but they are either seldom used (OECD 1984, p.20- 1) or else have been typically neutralized by various loopholes, like [pageend94]92 KOSMAS the access of debtors to interenterprise loans arranged through the intervention of local political leaders (Mencinger 1987, Knight 1984). Federal jurisdiction for prices, moreover, is currently limited to a handful of commodities such as petroleum, ferrous, coal, transport, and tobacco products. Prices of all of the rest, except local services, rents, and retail prices of basic foods whose regulation is up to the local communes, are either partially or fully the responsibility of the republics or provinces (Lydall p.258-9). Thus, even the most direct forms of state interference with the operation of markets have come to be highly decentralized. Not all the limitations on federal authority in Yugoslavia are, moreover, instrumental. Numerous times, the central government has had the statutory authority to override regional actions, yet federal laws and directives have simply not been enforced. In these cases, even the will to impose national agreements on dissenting parties has been lacking.6 The constitutional changes of the early 70’s granting the republics veto power over most federal initiatives were more a recognition of the de facto state of affairs than a political reform.7 Burg, in fact, argues (chap. 4) that the other changes of the 70’s, which so curtailed free markets, were fundamentally intended to create a system of checks and balances to counter perceived threats from the power of the republics, which had been steadily increasing since the beginnings of the experiments with market socialism. That the reforms did not work out as intended is less relevant for our purposes here than what this view suggests may have been the contribution of the conflicts between republican and federal interests to so many of the market interferences emanating from the reforms and decried by Dr. Mencinger. Yugoslav Federalism and Interethnic Relations Why have the republics been so successful in resisting federal encroachments on their powers? Partly, of course, this reflects a characteristic Yugoslav distrust of strong central government, emanating from centuries of foreign exploitation and experiences with the interwar Serbian monarchy. Yet the distinctive interethnic relations of the Yugoslav population are probably a more overriding factor. While a common South • Slavic ancestry of the majority of the population helps to shape a national consciousness, at the same time, many specific differences in historical and cultural traditions precipitate and/or exacerbate conflicts. The regional boundaries of the [pageend95]LESSONS FROM YUGOSLAVIA 93 various republics and provinces tend to be demarcated, in large part, along these ethnic dividing lines.8 Ethnic differences are therefore also highly correlated with the sharp regional economic inequalities pointed out by Dr. Mencinger. Given this history of interethnic strife, the circumscriptions on federal power may be viewed as a means of conflict resolution, not all of whose consequences have been, by any means, unfavorable. However this may be, they have also made it possible for the individual republics and provinces effectively to stalemate and block agreements on reforms to deregulate and liberalize the economy when these conflict with their regional self-interests. Mancur Olson theorizes that the blocking power of what he refers to as distributional coalitions has proven to be a serious threat to the vitality of all market economies. Such coalitions, he argues, tend to favor suboptimal economic policies because, although they result in a smaller economic pie overall, they also provide the coalition with a larger share, more than compensating its members for the concomitant losses in overall economic efficiency. Distributional coalitions have been successful in promoting their parochial interests more often than not, according to Olson, because they are smaller and more effective in coming to agreements than larger groups. Olson’s theory offers a logical and plausible framework for analyzing how a high degree of political decentralization comes to create obstacles to free markets, in spite of their manifest benefits to the economy as a whole. The framework seems to fit the Yugoslav experience quite well. Although, as Ramet shows, there has been fluidity and some shifting of regional alignments, the individual republics and provinces have usually, as Olson’s theory predicts, put narrower self-interest ahead of the national welfare, especially when their vested interests are threatened. In the words of one Yugoslav political analyst whom Burg (p.76) quotes: “it is entirely natural and, what’s more, necessary that the [republics] have before [their] eyes primarily the interests of [their own] republics, and only in second place the interests of the whole; that is, the entire social community’’ (emphasis added). Yugoslav style federalism increases the chances that national interests are locked into “second place”. Though Yugoslav federalism exhibits many of the traits predicted by Olson, his model does fail to explain the comparatively short time it has taken for the distributional coalitions in Yugoslavia to achieve their enormous power. In the other national experiences which he reviews, Olson finds (p.38-41) that the political mechanisms through which the blocking actions of the distributional coalitions [pageend96]94 KOSMAS became effective took considerably longer to develop. I would imagine that the distinctive ethnic basis of the regional coalitions in Yugoslavia must be important for explaining this difference. The long tradition of interethnic conflicts greatly facilitates the formation of distributional coalitions and then strengthens their cohesiveness.9 In addition, cultural and language barriers greatly discourage the free passage of capital and labor,10 encouraging and then strengthening the barriers due to protective policies. Thus, while the political processes through which obstructions to markets developed in Yugoslavia may not be especially unique, the nationalities problems lend them a distinctive flavoring. The obstructions developed more rapidly and more effectively because of them. The Single Party System Olson himself appeals to the comparative strength of encompassing vs. special-interest organizations to explain many national variations in the vitality of market economies. He points out, for example. that where labor unions, as in Germany, Japan, Norway, and Sweden, have broader-based memberships and a more national-oriented outlook, they have “not only an incentive to consider the effect of [their] policies on the efficiency of the society, but also an incentive to bargain with other substantial interest groups in the interest of a more productive society” (p.48). In Yugoslavia, however, apart from the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, as the central Party is called, there are few encompassing organizations with significant enough influence effectively to advocate a national point of view.11 The LCY—especially under Tito’s leadership—has sometimes taken stern measures to ensure more cooperation between the republics, but even Tito had his share of difficulties reconciling their differences. On balance, the LCY has more often acted as the ultimate peacemaker in regional and ethnic conflicts. Thanks to this, the end result has usually been more of a papering over than a resolution of differences, to the detriment of the influence of what might otherwise be the nation’s most effective encompassing organization.12 Much of the significantly greater success of distributional coalitions in Yugoslavia appears therefore to be due as well to the highly pluralistic ways of the LCY. which derive from the nationality differences. A radical centralization of the Party’s authority would not. of course, solve the underlying nationalities problem. Besides, there is no guarantee that a radical strengthening of federal authority would result in an increase in economic liberalization.13 The economy [pageend97]LESSONS FROM YUGOSLAVIA 95 is already overdirected and overmanaged with governmental regulations. Rather, the dilemma is. as a Yugoslav political scientist14 describes it: “the state is there when it is not needed, but it is not there when necessary”. Constraints on Transitional Adjustments A final set of obstacles to implementing market socialism relates to the dynamics of economic reform. Unfortunately, the more prolonged and more comprehensive the interferences with normal markets. the more difficult it becomes to unravel the resulting mess. Janos Kornai (1980) describes the problem well in a discussion of attempts to improve investment decisions in a highly regulated market environment: It is simply impossible to find out who is responsible for the wrong decision. Since decision-making was preceded by a multi-stage iterative process—both in the assembly of information and in the preparation of decision-making—every participating organization and person is responsible. They are responsible—and yet they are not. They can say that they did not want the investment in this particular form, but that they were forced to compromise with the other participants. Ultimately. therefore, personal responsibility for decision-making is lost. The increasing inability to pinpoint responsibility generates strong pressures to insulate firms and workers from the risks of failure. In Yugoslavia this manifests itself in a virtual breakdown of financial discipline with extraordinary measures taken to keep loss-making enterprises from having to shut down (Knight 1984). The protection of the firm extends, of course, to its workers, so that the net effect is an implicit guarantee of lifetime employment, once a worker has a job.15 It is extremely difficult to break out of this vicious circle by piecemeal reforms. Partial deregulation of prices is inadvisable because it only adds further asymmetries between input and output prices. A fully comprehensive deregulation of market? is certain, on the other hand, to entail a profound structural adjustment as labor and capital is reallocated to its more efficient uses. Many of the resistances of distributional coalitions to reforms have no doubt been motivated by interests in avoiding costs of this kind. [pageend98]96 KOSMAS In the upshot, it becomes increasingly difficult to eliminate the accumulated effects of past errors. Even if the goals of economic liberalization can be agreed upon, the hurdles of implementing the agreed upon changes must still be overcome. This may help to explain the paradoxical contrast, which Dr. Mencinger reports, between the seemingly widespread acceptance of the "Long Run Stabilization Program" and the failures to carry out its recommendations. Lessons from the Yugoslav Experience The foregoing indicates the complex tangle of factors sapping the vitality of market socialism in Yugoslavia. The performance statistics which Dr. Mencinger has summarized do seem, however, to indicate that the economy responded favorably to such liberalization of market constraints as did occur. Economic growth attained record levels, unduplicated before or since, with the initial relaxation of controls in the formative (1953-62) period of “administrative market socialism”. It continued respectably with the further liberalization in the 1963-73 period and then plummeted afterwards, with the broad retreat from market socialism after 1973. Although the economy was also exposed to serious external disturbances from 1973 on, Dr. Mencinger’s analysis of input-output ratios (graph 1), showing that both capital and labor were used more productively at the height of the economic liberalization than at any other time since World War II, indicates that the adaptability of the economy to these disturbances was significantly reduced by the impediments to freer market exchange. All in all, therefore, whenever the scope given to markets was increased, the performance of the Yugoslav economy seems to have benefitted thereby. While this is not the same as saying that market socialism has proven itself to be at least as economically efficient as other systems, it does return us to the main question of why, in spite of these promising beginnings, there was a retreat in the 70’s. From the hypotheses reviewed, I conclude that ideological divisions, although not without importance, have been less crucial than other factors. Most of the other explanations cited are interrelated, I believe, by the difficulties of achieving consensus on otherwise sound economic policies which impose costs on subgroups of the population whose vested interests are threatened by reform. The inability to reach agreements on how these costs were to be distributed blocked further liberalization and thereby reduced the adaptability of the Yugoslav [pageend99]LESSONS FROM YUGOSLAVIA 97 economy to external disturbances and structural change at the very moment when such adaptability was perhaps needed the most. Though the phenomenon described is by no means unique to Yugoslavia, the nationalities differences seem to have inspired a fairly unique set of political institutions which have greatly aggravated the difficulties of obtaining collective agreement on free market policies. If this view is tenable, then Yugoslavia’s failures in implementing market socialism are not fundamentally systemic. What the Yugoslav experience rather shows is that the viability of markets, whether under capitalism or market socialism, is inseparable from the character of the political institutions in which they are expected to operate. This deserves to be stressed if only because of the increasing specialization of social scientists and its implicit encouragement to separating political from economic considerations in policy analyses. Past theoretical controversies over the feasibility of market socialism, in having focussed on more purely economic issues, have dealt with matters of largely secondary importance and contributed very little to practical diagnoses of the ills of self-management. The feasibility of market socialism in Yugoslavia, I would say, turns out to have had comparatively little to do with the controversies over the nature of the ownership of productive assets with which the literature on the feasibility of market socialism has been mostly preoccupied up to now. Policy Implications This is not a terribly constructive conclusion for anyone who is specifically concerned about the Yugoslavia’s future. If the assessments here are correct, however, the hopes for those who continue to live with self-management will depend on their success in jointly restoring markets and finding ways of modifying the Yugoslav federal system without bringing ethnic conflicts to a boiling point. If there is a crisis in Yugoslavia today, it is because of this necessity of finding new blueprints which will integrate political with economic remedies for the ailments described here. This is hardly the place to discuss the detailed form of such blueprints, even assuming I was in any way qualified to offer advice. Yet, in closing, I would like to add a few very brief remarks on what I believe the analysis of this paper, if it is anywhere near the mark, may imply are some minimal steps which ought to be taken. [pageend100]98 KOSMAS Olson, whose model of the political economy of market failure we have drawn on at several points to interpret the Yugoslav experience, contends there are no reasonable substitutes for a complete liberalization of markets, domestic and foreign, for overcoming the blocking actions of narrow interest groups, (pp. 140 ff.) This advice, however, begs the question of the political feasibility of economic reforms. It would seem to me that if significant progress is to be made, then loosening the constraints on correcting past mistakes must be given a top priority. This in turn will require a fundamental rethinking of the way in which the risks and losses associated with liberalization are to be shared, with those who make mistakes made somehow to assume greater responsibility for the consequences of inefficiencies or poor judgement. Opposition will come not only from those who may expect justly to be disciplined but also from others who may perceive being penalized for mistakes due to circumstances entirely beyond their control. There clearly is an inescapable tradeoff with hard choices to be made between the benefits of disciplining poor judgments and the losses of protection this may entail for the innocent. One way of approaching the trade-off without enervating the reforms may be to reduce the size of the population at risk by assigning more direct responsibility for losses to plant managers. This is appealing, I think, because managers are certain to be key actors in freer markets, and if appropriately compensated for the added risks they are to assume, would find it difficult to oppose a genuine liberalization which gives them a freer hand. Under selfmanagement, moreover, it would be entirely appropriate to increase the accountability of managers for enterprise performance, say by making the tenure of plant managers more truly subject to the review of their workers and less subject to political influence, as now.16 The Olson model suggests a further step which I think may prove important. This is the implication from his analysis about the potentially beneficial role of encompassing organizations, a lack of which, we have seen, places undue burdens on the LCY, dissipating Party energies and delaying vital decisions. This indicates a need, I believe, for more political competition between encompassing factions. Victories in competitions of this sort might well provide elected leaders with a visible and broad enough mandate more successfully to oppose the blocking actions of regional coalitions. Since, however, the LCY’s flirtations with direct local elections in the past seem often to have advanced the parochial over the more [pageend101]LESSONS FROM YUGOSLAVIA 99 statesmen-like leaders,17 it may well prove necessary to start with an increased democratization of the Party at the federal rather than local levels, at least in the first instance.18 Prospects The prospects for a successful resolution of the current crisis are extremely difficult to judge. On the more optimistic side, the popular acceptance of self-management seems still very high,19 and there is virtually unanimous agreement on the necessity for far-reaching changes. On the more pessimistic side, one cannot fail to be impressed with the strong similarities between the issues which Yugoslavia must now resolve and those which it ultimately required the Civil War to settle in the U.S. Will the resolve to avoid ethnic bloodbaths prove strong enough in Yugoslavia to forge a new, and more successful, environment for market socialism? Only time, and the Yugoslav people, can tell. FOOTNOTES 1. But see Kornai (1986) for a dissenting view. 2. The following passage introducing the topic of market socialism in a recent textbook (Gregory and Stuart, p. 133) typifies this perspective: “In this book ... we are primarily interested in economic—as opposed to political—concepts of socialism. We are not interested in the political molds into which national leaders may wish to place thir own differing economic systems. We are interested in establishing the basic characteristics of socialism as an economic system (emphasis in original). . . 3. As Comisso points out (p. 123): “continued economic instability provided a golden opportunity for the increasingly influential political factions favoring a greater role for the state in the economy to undercut the competitive support for the competitive market still present in the firms. Moreover, by linking the inequalities issue to the demand to restore “control” over “surplus value” to the “direct producers” (as opposed to banks on the one hand and managerial personnel on the other), they were able to place the defenders of enterprise autonomy in both a politically and ideologically untenable position. In effect, executives had to choose either the “working class” and reduced enterprise autonomy or “technocracy” and the “anarchy” of the market. Not surprisingly, most opted for the former.” 4. It is worth noting that the results of many of these reforms were difficult to foresee at the time. The divisionalization of large enterprises into smaller more autonomous Basic Organizations of Associated Labor is a good example. Though many now contend that this did grave damage to the [pageend102]100 KOSMAS economy by shattering firms into uncoordinated fragments, Sacks points out that the concept of the change was economically sound and, in principle, should have increased market competitiveness. It is therefore hard to say whether, in a more suitable political environment, divisionalization might not have strengthened market socialism. Below, we comment further on how the basic intent of the reforms was quite different from how they turned out in practice. 5. Zagorka Golubovic’s position that: “ . . . the hybrid character of the Yugoslav system stems not from the lack of any previous experience or a trial and error method characterizing each experiment, but from a compromise approach to its ideological heritage” (p. 11; emphasis in original). Seems a bit extreme and goes farther than we in stressing the difficulties related to the philosophical upbringing of the founding fathers of selfmanagement. On this point, recall Dr. Mencinger’s caution to be careful in interpreting ideological rhetoric, which is often used as a cover for narrower self-interests. Comisso provides an interesting further example of a debate in the 70’s related to the reform of the banking system which, although carried on in mainly ideological terms, is more authentically described as a conflict between opposing vested interests: “illiquidity crises [in the 1960’s] ... led to demands that banks and trading companies be put under republic control, where locally based industrial firms would have easier access to them. . . . When banks and trading companies objected that the various decentralization schemes would obstruct capital mobility and lead to a politicization of investment decisions, their opponents accused them of ‘technocratic-managerial’ deviations. . . .” (p. 122) 6. According to Stanovcic, e.g.: “The main deficiency of Yugoslav federalism is not the distribution of power between the Federation and the constituent republics and provinces. Article 281 of the Yugoslav Federal Constitution . . . can be taken as an example of strong government ... the big shortcoming of Yugoslav federalism is the fact that the federal government has not control nor the possibility to influence the execution of federal laws which were enacted with the approval of all federal units" (emphasis added). Conversely, when the will is there, the federal government has shown a remarkable ability to exercise its authority. The dramatic turnaround in the Yugoslav balance of payments between 1980 and 1981, under federal import controls, is an example. (OECD, 1982) 7. Burg notes, for example, that the jurisdiction of the Federal Chamber of Nationalities was expanded under the constitutional amendments of 1967 and 1968 in hopes of resolving the conflicts between local and republican interest groups which had been plaguing the leadership of the Communist Party. But, “while the increased activity of the Chamber of Nationalities suggested to some foreign observers at that time that Yugoslavia was moving in the direction of parliamentarism, the luxury of hindsight allows us to suggest that it would have been more accurate to suggest that the Yugoslav [pageend103]LESSONS FROM YUGOSLAVIA 101 state was moving toward immobilisme. The 1967 and 1968 amendments rendered the parliament—through the Chamber of Nationalities—susceptible to the same stalemating forces that were affecting the party and the government" (p. 76. emphasis in original). 8. In all federal units except Bosnia and Vojvodina, the principal nationality group makes up at least two-thirds of the population, and in four of these, the ratio is at least three-quarters. The principal cities of Bosnia and Vojvodina are, moreover, significantly more ethnically homogeneous than the rural areas. (Ramet, p. 21) 9. According to Ramet (p. 24): “ethnicity, not ideology or class, appears to provide the ultimate source of political identity in intergroup conflict”. 10. Schrenk et al notes (p. 250) that the rates of external and intrarepublican migration have been respectively 4 and 5 times greater than the rate of interrepublican migration. 11. Potential others might include the Socialist Alliance, the Trade Unions, the military, and the Association of Veterans. From time to time, these groups, particularly the Trade Unions, have represented broader-based interests quite effectively, but such occasions have been rare. 12. Burg (p. 347) describes the Party dilemma as follows: “The political decision-making process that has evolved in Yugoslavia ... is complex . . . and generally . . . slow. It requires highly competent leadership at the center: capable of mediating among, and manipulating the conflicting interests of the regions; and at the same time formulating and pursuing common policy. And it requires equally competent leadership in each of the regions; capable of controlling or repressing tendencies outside of the boundaries of permissible activity, aggregating the diverse legitimate interests in their respective regions, representing these interests in negotiations at the center, and enforcing on them compromises that result from those negotiations. Each of the regional leaderships, therefore, must be responsive to two different constituencies; the regional constituency in which its power is rooted, and the constituency of “all-Yugoslav” interests, defined through interregional negotiation in the central organs of the party. ... By its very nature, the Yugoslav decision-making process is highly conflictual. Rather than repressing regional economic and nationality conflicts. the communist leadership has given them institutional expression. They have not done so to preserve them, but out of the realization that they could not both reform the party and repress all manifestations of internationality conflict. It was, and still is, hoped that in time the divisions of region and nationality will give way among the masses to the integrative force of common class interests. In the interim, however, the entire structure and process of decision-making emphasizes the coincidence between national and other differences, and thereby reinforces political divisions within the party itself.” 13. Some of the staunchest advocates in the LCY of tighter federal controls have been the staunchest opponents of economic liberalization as well. (Ramet, ch. 6) [pageend104]102 KOSMAS 14. S. lnic, quoted by Golubovic, p. 24. 15. There are virtually no job layoffs in Yugoslavia. Unemployment is high because of a scarcity of openings for new entrants, itself due in part to a reluctance on the part of firms to add to their long-term commitments to workers already hired. (Katz. 1985) 16. Slavko Goldstein outlines a practical proposal along these lines which deserves to be taken more seriously than it seemingly has thus far. 17. Rusinow (pp. 222-224) e.g. 18. There seems to be wide agreement that democratization of some form is needed, according to Golubovic who notes, “All debates on the crisis of Yugoslav society stress that the 'democratic alternative for getting out of the crisis’ is the only solution (p. 42) . . . The political elite in Yugoslavia is faced with two contradictory strivings: it wants to preserve the prestige Yugoslavia earned when it embarked on an independent road and opted for the democratic concept of socialism, but it also wants to conserve the monopoly on determining the thrust and pace of social development. . . . In today’s conditions, the two cannot really go together. . . . Consequently, the political elite dare not publicly or widely oppose the propagation of democratization. . . . Even in their own ranks, the champions of a status quo policy are feeling the pressure of currents advocating the democratization of political and social institutions as the only rational way out.” (p. 46) 19. Veljko Rus reports Tos’ public opinion poll showing that “even now when the gap between normative expectations and actual organizational behavior seems to be as great as four decades ago, high commitment to the goals of self-management persists in the majority of the population.” In addition, Rus points out that his studies with sociologists in other countries show an even higher commitment of Yugoslav workers to their self-managed enterprises than comparable surveys find among Japanese workers to their firms (p. 9).

[pageend107]MUSIC THEORISTS OF THE BOHEMIAN REFORMATION: JAN BLAHOSLAV AND JAN JOSQUIN Thomas Sovík Few Western scholars have pursued the topic of music in Renaissance Bohemia-Moravia, and the musical interaction between the theorists of Bohemia-Moravia and Wittenberg (a focal point of music as well as of religious activity during the period) has largely been ignored. Much of the information available in English is based on inadequate presentations by Czech researchers working in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Research by the Moravian Music Foundation and the Moravian College has centered primarily on the history and music of the Czech Protestant movement after its revival as the Moravian Church in 1722 at Herrnhut. Prior to 1985. no music treatise written in sixteenth-century Czech had been translated into English or into any other language.1 The Jednota bratrská, an austere Protestant sect that flourished in Bohemia-Moravia between 1457 and 1620, published 11 monophonic hymnals, a complete Bible, a Czech grammar, and a Czech speller. Jan Blahoslav and Jan Josquin, members of the Jednota, wrote the first music treatises in the Czech language; Blahoslav’s Musica (1558) and Josquin’s Muzika (1561) are the only music texts known to have been written by Czech Protestants during the Renaissance.2 Because Jan Blahoslav (1523-71) was a bishop, diplomatic representative. and publisher, a significant amount of information about 105 [pageend108]106 KOSMAS him exists. We know that he traveled extensively and studied in Wittenberg, Königsberg, and Basel. He personally knew Martin Luther and Philip Melanchton, and may have been acquainted with the music theorists Martin Agricola, Adrianus Petit Coclico, Heinrich Faber, Hermann Finck, and Georg Rhau. Blahoslav was a prolific writer, and at least 58 of his works, dating from 1550-71, are extant. Of particular interest to the music community is Blahoslav’s Musica of 1558. Although no copy of the first edition has survived, at least two copies of the 1569 reprint still exist in the Knihovna národního muzea (National Museum Library) in Prague. The 1569 revision contains two major supplements: “Some instructions necessary for those who wish to sing well” and “Teachings necessary for those who wish to compose songs.” The second music treatise printed in the Czech language, the Muzika of Jan Josquin, appeared in 1561. One copy survives, also in the Knihovna národního muzea, but it lacks the final two sections dealing with multivoiced singing and text setting. ’ While it is possible that “Jan Josquin” is the author’s true name, most of the evidence favors the assertion that this is a pseudonym used by the Jednota priest Václav Solin (1527-66). Little is known about Sohn; he is primarily remembered for having collaborated with Blahoslav in the printing of the Jednota hymnal Písně chval božských (1561 and 1564 editions). What follows as Part I of this study is a biography of Jan Blahoslav. Part II includes a summation of the major arguments regarding the identity of “Jan Josquin,” biographical information about the Jednota priest Václav Solin, and evidence to support my assertion that it was indeed Václav Solin who authored the Muzika of 1561. Part III contains a general discussion of the musico-theo- retical concepts presented in the treatises of Blahoslav and Josquin and an identification of the probable sources of ideas and illustrations. THE BIOGRAPHY OF JAN BLAHOSLAV Jan Blahoslav was one of the most prolific and interesting individuals of the Czech Renaissance. A bishop of the Jednota bratrská during its golden age, Blahoslav’s secondary interests and assigned duties within that religious organization caused him to function as an archivist, editor, diplomat, musician, educator, publisher, grammarian, and translator. Although all of his works possess an inseparable attachment to religion, it is a characteristic of his writing [pageend109]MUSIC THEORISTS OF THE BOHEMIAN REFORMATION 107 style that annotations about commonplace events, practices, and prejudices are habitually interjected into his essays. Thus, by his talkativeness, Blahoslav assured the survival of a wealth of diverse historical and technical information about the Czech Renaissance that would otherwise be lost. Vavřinec Orlík, who succeeded Blahoslav as scribe of the Jednota following Blahoslav’s death in 1571, provided two biographical accounts of his predecessor in the Jednota^ Nekrologium. These accounts are the primary sources for Blahoslav’s biography. The first of these is the autobiography of Blahoslav, which was transcribed by Orlik from notes prepared by Blahoslav before his death: I, Jan Blahoslav, was born in the year of our Lord 1523 on the first Friday of Lent, at the 16th hour. In the year of our Lord 1540, on the Feast of St. Gall, Brother Wolff took me from Přerov to Prostějov so that I would be a stableboy [čeledín] for Brother Martin Michalec, whose stableboy I remained until his death. In the meantime, in the year 1543, I was sent by him to study in Goldberg, and I was there one year. Then, in the year 1544, I was sent to Wittenberg with some other young men, and we arrived there on the Saturday before the Feast of St. John the Baptist, and I was also one year in Wittenberg. In the year of our Lord 1547 my master, Brother Martin Michalec, died, and the Elders of the Jednota gave me as a housekeeper [hospodář] to Brother Matouš Strejc, with whom I remained one year. In the year 1548, after the Feast of the Apostles, the Jednota sent me to Brother Jan Černý of [Mladá] Boleslav. In the year 1549 I was sent by Brother Jan Černý to study in Prussia, in Königsberg. But we did not stay in Prussia very long because of an outbreak of a plague, and all of us returned to Brother Mach [Siónský] in Dabrovno after the Feast of St. James. In that same year. 1549, Rokyta and I were again sent abroad, to Basel. But I became ill there and, from the spring of the year 1550, was ill many weeks. After Easter I returned home. In the year 1553 I accepted the office of student priest [jáhen] during the time of Lent, in Hromnice, and on the second Sunday after Pentecost I was ordained a priest in Přerov. In 1557 1 was accepted into the Inner Council and, on the same day. I was elected a bishop. In the year 1558 I moved to Ivančice and its environs, arriving there from Boleslav around the first Sunday after Pentecost. Who knows when and in what year the Lord God will want to take me? When that time comes. He will designate the time and the manner.4 [pageend110]108 KOSMAS Likewise, Orlík inscribed Blahoslav’s obituary into the Nekrologium: In this year [ 15]71, on Saturday the 24th of November at the 23rd hour, in a field in [Moravský] Krumlov, died Brother Jan Blahoslav. He was one of the leading four [bishops], the scribe of the Jednota, a father and shepherd of God's people in the Jednota, a great and excellent man. very religious, industrious from his youth, and to all people he was very nice, and his fame spread widely among our nation and to others. This was a great and precious jewel of the Jednota and too soon, according to our opinion, the Lord God has taken him from us. But only the Lord knows why He took him.5 A more comprehensive biography of Jan Blahoslav can be pieced together with the aid of four sources: Jan Blahoslav a Jan Josquin (1896) by Otakar Hostinský; Jan Blahoslav (1966) by Josef Janáček; Sborník Blahoslavüv (1923), a collection of articles edited by Václav Novotny and Rudolf Urbánek; Jan Blahoslav Přerovský (1971), a collection of articles edited by František Hýbl and Gustav Vožda.6 Blahoslav’s Early Years Jan Blahoslav was born in Přerov at 4:00 p.m. on 20 February 1523. His father’s name was “Blažek,” an abbreviation of the name "Blahoslav” (happiness and glory). Although the aristocratic ancestry of the Blažek family has been “conclusively” both proven and denied by respected Czech scholars, the only firm evidence of the family’s station was discovered by Leopold Calábek in 1916. This information was related by František Chudoba in an article of 1923: [Calábek] found, in the “foundations-register” of the city of Přerov from the second half of the sixteenth century, a note dating from 1565 according to which Blahoslav, “in a letter under the seal of the city of Ivančice,” "passed to his sister, the wife of Bernard.” Zuzanne. his share of the property inherited from his parents and his brother, Martin Abdon [died 1561]. His share was bound by a debt on the house that his mother, Kateřina Blažková, had sold for 550 kops on the Monday commemorating Master Jan Hus in 1561 to her son-in- law Bernard who, however, readily paid only 100 kops. As much as the house stood "on the hill,” that is, in the upper square of Přerov, close to the old castle, it obviously belonged among the respected bourgeois houses. As much as we do not know, however, how long this was the property of the Blažek family, we cannot know with assurance that Blahoslav was born herein.’ [pageend111]MUSIC THEORISTS OF THE BOHEMIAN REFORMATION 109 Blahoslav’s mother, Katerina, was the daughter of a furrier named “Bezpero” (without feathers); the family name of Bezpero is still quite frequently mentioned in the town records of Přerov and nearby Lipník as recently as the first part of the seventeenth century. Because Blahoslav was taken to Prostějov for apprenticeship on 16 October 1540, we can assume that his father had died before this time. Martin Abdon, Blahoslav’s only known brother, was born on 1 February 1529. Martin was ordained a priest in the Jednota and appointed as a clerical manager in Prague, where he lived until his death on 8 March 1561. Blahoslav’s mother died the following year. Virtually no information is recorded about Blahoslav’s only known sister, Zuzanne.8 Blahoslav’s only other known relative, an uncle Tobiáš in the Bezpero family, died in Lipník in September 1565.9 Přerov, Blahoslav’s birthplace, had been the center of one of eight Moravian districts as early as the eleventh century. A conservative town that had remained faithful to the Catholic ruling class at the outbreak of the Hussite rebellion, Přerov was overrun by Bohemian Hussites who crossed the border of Moravia in 1423. Because of its strategic position, the town became a frequent battleground; in 1438 both the castle and the surrounding municipality were burned by Catholic forces. Přerov, subsequently used as collateral and an item for barter, passed through a succession of different “owners.” As a direct consequence of these overlords allowing religious freedom (and, in some cases, providing a sympathetic protection of Protestantism) so long as they were not bothered by religious disputes between their subjects, Přerov became the first and most important center of the Jednota in Moravia during the latter part of the fifteenth century. Records show that by the end of the century the Jednota in Přerov had founded a hospital, that by 1518 a Jednota school had been established under the direction of Dr. Vitt, and that on 9 March 1525 a “larger” church (sbor) was consecrated to accommodate the increased numbers unable to be contained by the earlier church constructed in 1498.10 When reconstructing the Nekrologium after its damage by fire (1546), Blahoslav did not mention Vitt, who died in 1531, as one of his former teachers at the school in Přerov; the school remained closed from Vitt’s death until the arrival, in April 1533, of the new headmaster, Jan Wolff. Thus, it appears that Blahoslav did not attend the school in Přerov prior to age 10. It is from Blahoslav’s obituary of Vitt in the Nekrologium, however, that we first learn that Blahoslav was a believer in witchcraft: [pageend112]110 KOSMAS In the year of our Lord 1531 died Vitt, the doctor of Přerov, on the Saturday before the Feast of St. Matthew. He was a clean man, large, fat, with curly hair. For many years he was the administrator of the assembly [kantor : sborn] in Přerov. He was a student priest of the Jednota, then he married, took up the medical profession, and prospered greatly. Then witches took over the city of Přerov and cost many their lives, and. among these, even the good doctor was poisoned. Neither privilege nor yeomanship granted by the Polish king could help him. His clan, the sons and the daughters, all died. None of his clan remained alive." In his Grammatika česká (1571), Blahoslav made a second reference to the practice of witchcraft in his native town: . . . my beloved natal place, today for a number of reasons almost hated by me, mainly because of its criminal magic and even witchcraft that. I pray, the Lord may soon exterminate.12 In the Nekrologium, Blahoslav also commemorated his former teacher at the Přerov school. Brother Jan Wolff. This obituary reveals something of Blahoslav’s education between the ages of 10 and 17: And so in the year of our Lord 1548 died Brother Jan Wolff, in Přerov, on the Friday before the Feast of SS. Simon and Jude, after the 15th hour. He was very dear to the Lord and to almost all who knew him, as he was very kind. He was buried in Šířava [a small village adjacent to Přerov] by the Elder, Brother Daniel. There is much to tell about this man. I was with him in my childhood. Whenever I remember the actions of this man I always wonder about him, because I have never known anyone like him; even now in the Jednota there is no one similar to him in these things: courtesy, pleasantness, careful speech, piety, exemplariness, seriousness, kindness toward people that attracts them, and so on. And although simple, he, nevertheless, was a pleasant preacher, a scribe, [a man skilled in] German, and a good manager who used to be a housekeeper for the Elder, Brother Lukáš. He composed a larger number of songs, many of which are in the new hymnal. I have never met, among the Jednota managers, any man who had fewer passions or vices than he. So great was this man's carefulness that he truly knew how to control himself. He was a man, but a rare sort of man. He knew very little Latin, but nevertheless was well learned and accomplished. He also knew physics. He was ordained a priest in 1526 and was a member of the Inner Council.13 [pageend113]MUSIC THEORISTS OF THE BOHEMIAN REFORMATION 111 On 16 October 1540 Brother Jan Wolff took the 17-year-old Blahoslav to Bishop Martin Michalec in Prostějov (28 kilometers west of Přerov). It was under Michalec’s supervision that Blahoslav, as a stableboy, may have received his elementary instruction in the Latin language. By the middle of the sixteenth century the Jednota had developed a strong tradition of sending students abroad for study. In 1543 Blahoslav and Matouš Tatik were placed in charge of several younger students and sent to the school of Valentine Friedland Trotzendorf in Silesian Goldberg (Zlotoryja). The objective of Trotzendorf’s gymnasium was to prepare students for the study of theology at the university level by emphasizing the reading of Latin (the only language used in the instruction at the school) and Greek, spelling, and rhetoric. Trotzendorf’s pedagogical regimen consisted of drill and severe discipline, with some accounts reporting serious physical punishment for students falling behind in their studies. Blahoslav remained in Goldberg for one year, and in 1544 went with four other Jednota students to study in Wittenberg. He arrived at the home of Kašpar Peucer in May 1544, registering at the university under the name “Joannes Blasius Przeroviensis” (Jan Blažek Přerovský). A fellow Czech, Peucer was a professor at the university who later became the son-in-law of Philip Melanchton. While in Wittenberg, Blahoslav attended the lectures of both Melanchton and Martin Luther, later declaring in his Grammatika česká that he was surprised that Luther and the Jednota bishop Jan Augusta held such similar views on religious issues.14 Blahoslav returned to Prostějov from Wittenberg in 1545; we do not, however, know anything of Blahoslav’s activities between this time and 1547. Following the death of Martin Michalec in Prostějov in January 1547, Matouš Strejc assumed spiritual responsibility for the Jednota in central Moravia. Shortly thereafter, Blahoslav was appointed as a housekeeper for the clergy in Prostějov. In 1548 Blahoslav was assigned as an aid to Bishop Jan Černý in Mladá Boleslav. Boleslav, near Prague, had been the headquarters of the Jednota in Bohemia since the beginning of the century and remained so until their protector, Arnošt Krajíř, died in March 1555. Blahoslav’s first stay with Bishop Černý did not last long. Already before Easter 1549 Blahoslav was once again sent to study abroad, this time at the newly established university at Königsberg.15 A serious dispute broke out almost immediately, however, between the Czech students in Königsberg and the professor of theology, Andreas [pageend114]112 KOSMAS Osiander. The situation was further aggravated by an outbreak of cholera that swept through Prussia in 1549, and the Czech students left the city in July of that same year. After leaving Königsberg. Blahoslav and another Jednota student, Jan Rokyta from Litomyšl, were boarded at the home of Mach Siónský. Siónský, living in Dabrovno (Gilgenburg), was the Jednota bishop in jurisdiction over the Poles and Prussians. During this interim. Blahoslav met Dr. Pavel Sperat from Jihlava, the Jednota bishop in Poznan. After a brief stay in Dabrovno, Blahoslav and Rokyta continued their journey back to Moravia. On 28 August 1549 a Jednota synod was convened in Prostějov to discuss a possible reconciliation with the Lutherans; the nonviolent Jednota had broken off formal relations with the Lutherans in 1525 after a savage repression, by Lutheran princes, of the peasant revolt. The question of sending scholars abroad to study, in view of the unhappy situation at Königsberg, was also discussed at this synod. It was decided that a group, including Blahoslav’s younger brother Martin Abdon, was to return to Königsberg but that Blahoslav and Rokyta should go to Basel. Leaving Prostějov in October and traveling through Bohemia and southern Germany, Blahoslav reached Basel sometime around 1 December 1549. Letters of recommendation given to him by Dr. Sperat enabled Blahoslav to be accepted into the homes of many learned scientists in Basel and, in particular, to that of the Silesian Řehoř (Žigmund) Hrubý from Jelenia Góra (Hirschberg). Řehoř was associated with the printing shop of Johann Frobin; this shop had, in 1516, published Erasmus’s Greek translation of the New Testament. Řehoř introduced Blahoslav to the art of editing and printing. This was a milestone in Blahoslav’s education, because he would later become the Jednota's chief editor and would himself establish a printing shop in Ivančice. Blahoslav was able to enjoy the favor of his sponsors in Basel only during the winter of 1549-50. He fell seriously ill sometime after the first of the year and was no longer able to participate in studies at the university. He partially recovered after Easter, recuperating under the care of Dr. Kraton, personal physician of Maximilian II. Dr. Kraton, feeling that Blahoslav would now be able to survive the rigors of a long journey, advised him to return to Přerov. Accompanied by Rokyta, Blahoslav made the trip from Basel to Regensburg by carriage, and from Regensburg to Vienna by boat on the Danube. Blahoslav and Rokyta parted in Vienna, Blahoslav continuing to Moravia unaccompanied, Rokyta returning to Basel. [pageend115]MUSIC THEORISTS OF THE BOHEMIAN REFORMATION 113 Blahoslav as Author and Editor During his recovery in Přerov, Blahoslav authored his first work at age 27.16 This work. Spis o zraku (1550), exemplifies Blahoslav’s understanding of human nature. Here, Blahoslav admits that he is well aware of the temptation of the opposite sex and notes that God Himself likes to look at pretty girls, but cautions that Christians are expected to show discipline and to curb their desires. This handbook became the workbook for moral education among the Jednota. It is from this work. Spis o zraku (Writing about Sight), that we also learn that Blahoslav was among the first in Moravia to wear eyeglasses. As Blahoslav’s health improved, he began to teach at the Jednota school in Prostějov where he himself had once studied under Michalec.17 In this same period he met Beneš Optát, a Catholic priest turned to Utraquism, who had translated the New Testament of Erasmus into Czech. Blahoslav doubtlessly learned from Optát about the pitfalls that he himself would encounter in his own translation (1564) of the New Testament.13 Optát had also coauthored (with Petr Gzel and Václav Philomathes19) the Etymológia (1533), the Czech grammar Blahoslav would use in preparing his own Grammatika česká (1571). After a fire in Litomyšl severely damaged the historical archives of the Jednota in 1546 or 1547, Jan Černý began the difficult task of restoring and moving the remnants of the archives to Mladá Boleslav. In 1552 Blahoslav was recalled to Boleslav to assist with the memoirs, which in 1589 culminated in 14 volumes collectively entitled the Akty Jednoty bratrské.-0 On 2 February 1553 Blahoslav, at age 30, was elevated to the position of “jáhen” (student priest) in Hromnice and, on 30 June of that same year, he was ordained a priest at the synod in Přerov. Disregarding the recent mandates of Ferdinand I, who was attempting a re-Catholicization of Bohemia, in autumn 1553 the Jednota opened a “new” church in Mladá Boleslav under the protection of the local lord, Arnošt Krajíř. Following his ordination in this same year. Blahoslav returned to Boleslav. In early March 1555 Blahoslav was sent on the first of his four diplomatic missions to Vienna.21 These were attempts to gain an audience with Archduke Maximilian who, although a Habsburg, did look upon the Protestant movement with some favor. It was hoped that, through their petitions, the Jednota would achieve religious freedom and would secure the release of one of their leading bishops, [pageend116]114 KOSMAS Jan Augusta, from Křivoklát prison. These trips, however, proved to be unsuccessful. Arnošt Krajíř, protector of the Jednota in Mladá Boleslav, died on 18 March 1555. Arnošťs sons were summoned to Prague and, although accompanied by Blahoslav acting as adviser, “converted” to Catholicism upon threat of fines and punishment.22 This action forced the Jednota to close its headquarters in Mladá Boleslav. Blahoslav returned to Moravia and, in the latter half of November in that same year, traveled again to Vienna. In May 1556 Blahoslav was sent to Magdeburg with a personal letter from Jan Černý to Matthais Flacius Illyricus, theologian and Protestant church historian. Illyricus was evidently preaching against the Jednota who had recently taken up residence in that city, but neither Černý nor Blahoslav was able to convince him to stop. Blahoslav returned home from Magdeburg in June via Wittenberg, Leipzig, and Regensburg, accompanied a large part of the way by Philip Melanchton. In May and September 1557 Blahoslav was sent on his third and fourth diplomatic missions to the court of Archduke Maximilian in Vienna. In recognition for his service to the Jednota, Blahoslav was elevated to the position of bishop at the synod in Slížany in 1557. In the summer of 1558 the Elders met in Mladá Boleslav to divide the work and the region of authority among the four Jednota bishops. Blahoslav was given the responsibility, as scribe of the Jednota, for keeping and updating the archives and for acting as its chancellor; he was assigned the bishopric of southern Moravia. In late summer of 1558 Blahoslav moved his personal belongings and the Jednota archives to Ivančice. Ivančice was a small farming community in southern Moravia. From the end of the fifteenth century onward, the Utraquists, Anabaptists, and Jednota had lived side by side without serious confrontation. Concern about their individual existences was shared in equal measure by all three Protestant groups, and it benefited all inhabitants not to create any problem that would inevitably bring Catholic forces into their town. Because the spiritual community of the Jednota was strengthened by the arrival of a bishop, the previously existing stable relationships among the three Protestant groups became unbalanced. In addition, there was concern that the activities of the new bishop might endanger a town currently living in harmony. Even the Anabaptists, who had arrived from Alexovice in 1527 and who had maintained [pageend117]MUSIC THEORISTS OF THE BOHEMIAN REFORMATION 115 an isolated existence, called for a public debate between their clergy and the new Jednota bishop in order to define their doctrinal differences. Blahoslav agreed to debate with the Anabaptists from Ivančice and Znojmo, even going so far as to arrange for Jan Jelický, an expert on both the Czech and German languages, to act as interpreter. Ultimately, Blahoslav was unable to personally attend the debate with the Anabaptists because of his responsibilities as editor of a new Jednota hymnal being printed in Šamotuly (central Poland). Instead, Blahoslav sent his future coeditor of both the Šamotulský kancionál (1561) and the Ivančický kancionál (1564), Václav Solin, as his representative. The Elders of the Jednota had met in Prostějov in 1549 to consider the problem of doctrinally inaccurate singing and, in particular, the resultant problem of dealing with heresies that were being introduced into their services through the assimilation of foreign hymns. The Elders felt that not even the fraternal clerics were able to distinguish good songs from bad and that many clerics, however well intentioned, were permitting the singing of heretical texts. There was also some concern with ideological contamination from within, because many clerics were composing songs without proper regard for either the teachings of the Jednota or the principles of good vocal composition. Consequently, the Elders felt compelled to place strict limits upon the membership by a ruling of the synod: The composition of new songs without a commission, examination, and judgment by the Elders is strictly forbidden. All those already in use should be assembled and presented for a future judgment by a committee of the Elders. And no one else is entitled to compose new songs who does not have an official commission and judgment of these by the Elders. A great disorder, and even a danger for the Jednota, has appeared by these trivial [lehký] songs.23 During the synod of 1555 the Elders decided that the hymnal currently in use should be newly arranged and printed. This edition had been printed in 1541; all copies had been sold out for some time, and those held by many congregations were heavily worn. Jan Černý, head of the Jednota in Mladá Boleslav and director of all Jednota preachers in Bohemia, was appointed to chair the committee that would select the hymns for the new hymnal; the youngest member of the committee was Černý’s assistant in Boleslav, Jan Blahoslav; the third member of the committee was Bishop Adam Sturm. This board was to retain, alter, or exclude compositions [pageend118]116 KOSMAS contained in the current hymnal, and to select for inclusion other works, especially from those composed by Bishop Jan Augusta. Once the committee’s work was sanctioned by the Elders, the new hymnal was to be printed and distributed to the membership. Because all publications of the Jednota had been banned by the Mandate of St. James (1508), the hymnal could not be printed in either Bohemia or Moravia without great danger. Even in Prostějov, the Jednota headquarters in Moravia, the Utraquist majority did not look favorably upon the Jednota. Poland, although predominantly a Catholic country, was much more tolerant of Protestant activities, and it was here that the opportunity for publication of the hymnal arose through Alexander Aujezdecký. Aujezdecký was a Jednota immigrant from Plzeň who had recently established a printing shop for Lukáš, Count of Górky, in the castle at Šamotuly. Černý, Blahoslav, and Sturm had already worked on the new hymnal for four years; toward the end of 1559 the Elders decided that it was to be printed in its present state of revision. It appears that Blahoslav continued to edit and correct the selected material even in Šamotuly,24 thereby delaying the printing of the hymnal. In 1560 the Elders sent Václav Solin to Šamotuly to speed the publication. Charged with this responsibility, Solin was probably not able to give full consideration to all corrections deemed necessary by Blahoslav, and it is suspected that friction developed between Blahoslav and Solin over the sharing of responsibility.25 The actual printing of the Šamotulský kancionál began on 25 January 1560 and was completed on 7 June the following year. The hymnal contains 735 songs, including approximately 450 that are accompanied by music. The remaining hymns are given only in text, with indications that they should be sung to particular well-known melodies. This approach made the hymnal accessible to members who did not read music. Blahoslav was not satisfied with the printed edition of the 1561 hymnal. Although this edition was finer than those that preceded it, he still viewed the Šamotulský kancionál as an imperfect work and one that fell, according to his glossed copy, far short of his linguistic and musical objectives.26 Criticism of the Šamotulský kancionál by opposing religious groups had been expected; the internal conflict, however, was much more damaging. Blahoslav’s efforts to correct, systematize, and modernize the Czech language and music of a larger number of contributors was met with stiff conservative resistance and, after publication, harsh criticism. An indication of the severity of this conflict was [pageend119]MUSIC THEORISTS OF THE BOHEMIAN REFORMATION 117 the swift approval by the Elders for the publication of a second edition. Such was granted despite the realization that the appearance of a second edition after only three years would be pointed to by external opponents as an admission of the alleged shortcomings in the 1561 edition. Many of the modernizations that Blahoslav made in this earlier edition were, in fact, changed back to their original form in 15 64.27 In his Apologia pro editione Cantionalis nova (1564) to Martin Žatecký, Blahoslav remarks that he was powerless to correct these defects and he expresses a desire to prepare a third edition: And if the Lord God would allow me, before I die 1 would like to see this hymnbook in better feathers, and I would accept this as a special expression of mercy and a great gift.28 This internal conflict had its place within the larger and long- lasting disagreement between two outstanding bishops of the Jednota, Jan Augusta and Jan Blahoslav. Augusta, 23 years older than Blahoslav, was elected a bishop in the Jednota when Blahoslav was only nine years old; Blahoslav rose to prominence during Augusta’s 16 years of imprisonment (1548-64). Augusta was an autodidact (before the German and Swiss reformations, the Czech “heretics” could not find non-Catholic universities abroad, and the Jednota viewed the mainstream Czech Utraquists at the Charles University as being as “impure” as the Catholics): Blahoslav was an intellectual who had been sent abroad for higher education in theology and the humanities. One important aspect of this disagreement appears to be Augusta’s early and consistent desire to lead the Jednota out of isolation and illegality toward a rapprochement with the mainstream of European reformation. It should be noted, however, that Augusta’s behavior in this respect was often inconsistent, especially in his early intolerance and even provocative treatment of the Czech Utraquists. In contrast, the majority of Jednota Elders, and apparently Blahoslav after he was elected a bishop in 1557, did not share these views with Augusta. Augusta opposed Blahoslav throughout his life and at nearly every opportunity. He expressed deep dissatisfaction with the correction of his contributions to the Šamotulský kancionál, attacking Blahoslav as its chief editor. Although he is the most-represented composer in the hymnal, with 139 songs (nearly one-fifth of the total number), Augusta went so far as to censure Blahoslav for not giving his work sufficient consideration!29 [pageend120]118 KOSMAS A companion work to the Šamotulský kancionál is Blahoslav’s Rejstřík (1561). In this register. Blahoslav identifies 527 composers whose hymns are found in the hymnal; no such information is found in the hymnal itself. In the Rejstřík. Blahoslav provides information about the history of the hymnal, characterizations of many of the composers, and many unique pieces of information about the Jednota. (In the Grammatika česká, Blahoslav provides a list of the 79 hymns that he considers “excellent”; again, nearly one-fifth are by Augusta.30) From the Rejstřík, we also know that Blahoslav was a practicing composer; he credits himself with 69 compositions. It is apparent from Hostinsky’s study, however, that Blahoslav wrote the music for no more than eight or nine of these compositions;31 the Jednota understood the expression “píseň skládat” (to compose a song) to mean the attachment of words to a preexisting melody. Blahoslav as Educator and Publisher Upon returning to Ivančice from Šamotuly, Blahoslav took charge of the Jednota school that had been founded at the end of the fifteenth century (see Plate I). With the exception of religious training, the school was barely approaching the level of education provided by the municipal academy. Blahoslav immediately introduced the study of languages, rhetoric, and music into the curriculum. In addition, he reinstated the earlier tradition of manual labor as part of the students’ training, with particular tasks to be completed at a specific hour of the day. Šimon Turnovský, who later became a Jednota bishop himself, provided a contemporary description of Blahoslav’s school. In a letter dated 1570, Turnovský stressed the rigid academic schedule, similar to the regimen at Trotzendorf’s gymnasium that Blahoslav had attended in 1543-44. According to Turnovský, Blahoslav’s school of 40 male students was divided into “departments” of high and low: After prayer, they each go to their own work, the boys to school, and the adolescents and young adults to their studies to be trained in languages, and to lectures in divinity.32 In the lower school, students were taught the spelling and grammar of the Czech language; in the higher school, students learned German, Latin, and possibly even Greek and Hebrew. Mornings were devoted to academic studies while afternoons were devoted to manual labor: [pageend121]MUSIC THEORISTS OF THE BOHEMIAN REFORMATION 119 PLATE I Seminary and Parish School of the Jednota bratrská in Ivančice (16th century) The school was directly across the street from the Jednota rectory. The building is currently (1987) used as a warehouse by a toy and magazine distributor. After lunch many, in particular the younger ones, have to work at something good with their hands until afternoon prayer. There, in my presence in Ivančice, several worked in the printing shop, others were binding books, still others, the stronger ones, were splitting wood. Some. 1 recall, were even weaving linen.'3 Jan Lasičky, another contemporary observer, likewise provided an account of the work environment in Jednota schools: In the household environment of the Jednota, some, especially the young, bind books (especially at Ivančice), others weave cloth, others sew clothes from furs and skins prepared elsewhere, others make bowls on a wheel, others catch fish, others work in the fields or in the gardens or orchards or vineyards, others split wood—one. tw'o. or three hours before lunch and afterward.34 In addition to reorganizing the school at Ivančice. Blahoslav established the first printing shop in southern Moravia. Before the end [pageend122]MUSIC THEORISTS OF THE BOHEMIAN REFORMATION 121 preacher should avoid, and what things a preacher might accomplish with his sermons. Three companion texts, the Ctnosti kazatelské (Virtues of Preachers), the Naučení mladým kazatelům (Teachings foi Young Preachers), and the Pořádek kázání ročního (Yearly Chronology of Sermons), are no longer extant and cannot be dated with assurance. These four texts were the primary curriculum materials used at the Ivančice seminary to train future preachers. Blahoslav’s fifth work of this last grouping, the Grammatika česká, was completed in 1571 after undergoing 23 years of revision. While visiting the neighboring town of Moravský Krumlov, Jan Blahoslav died at 11:00 p.m. on Saturday, 24 November 1571, at the age of 48. ARGUMENTS REGARDING THE IDENTITY OF JAN JOSQUIN The second music treatise printed in the Czech language, the Muzika of Jan Josquin, appeared in November 1561. Having followed its predecessor by only three years, the Muzika is nearly identical in scope and purpose to the Musica of Jan Blahoslav. While it is possible that “Jan Josquin” is the author’s real name, this is widely believed to be a pseudonym. The author’s true identity has been discussed by several Czech historians, with determinations ranging from Václav Solin, an associate of Blahoslav, to Josquin Desprez himself. Because the authorship of the Muzika has not yet been satisfactorily resolved, this study offers commentaries on the opinions held by the major Czech historians who have addressed this issue. The Hypothesis of Pavel Frantisek Gabulka The earliest-known scholar to have addressed the question of Jan Josquin’s identity was the first historian of the Knihovna národního muzea, Pavel František Gabulka. In 1817 Gabulka pasted a handwritten note into the library’s only known extant copy of Josquin’s Muzika in which he theorized that the author of this treatise may have been either Josquin Desprez, Giosquino del Prato, or Josquin Boston.37 Following a brief anecdote about Desprez and his relationship with Louis XII, Gabulka discussed the two lesser-known “Josquins”: Another Josquin, Giosquino del Prato, Jodocus Pratensis, was an internationally known musical composer in the Netherlands between the years 1440-96. [pageend123]122 KOSMAS Again, another Josquin, Josquin Boston, also flourished in the Netherlands in the year 1556. Perhaps one of these was our Czech composer, as in past centuries Czechs were drawn to the Netherlands, as was Komenské [Comen- ius].38 It is well documented in musicological studies of the Renaissance that numerous musicians took advantage of the widespread popularity of Josquin Desprez in promoting their own credibility. Over 40 "Josquins” are known to have been active in the century following Desprez’s death, including at least five in the Czech kingdom: Josquin Dačický, Josquin za Francouze, Jusquin von Holz, Jan Josquin, and Tobiáš Josquin.39 Although the name “Josquin” is not of Czech origin, the use of that pseudonym in 1561 by a Czech author of relatively insignificant stature comes as no surprise. It is surprising, however, that Gabulka failed to realize that Giosquino del Prato and Jodocus Pratensis are merely other identifications of Josquin Desprez, and that he seriously considered Desprez as a possible author of the Muzika. Both the title page and the dedication of the Muzika indicate that the work dates from 1561, by which time Desprez had already been dead for forty years. In addition, a contemporary account by Adrianus Petit Coclico, who claimed (in his Compendium musices, 1552) to have been a student of Desprez, denies that Desprez ever wrote a theoretical treatise.40 Gabulka also referred to Josquin Boston or Baston (fl. 1542-63), a Netherlandic composer active during the mid-sixteenth century. While very little information about Baston survives, it is known that he visited the courts at Austria, Denmark, Poland, Saxony, and Sweden.41 Jan Baston cannot, therefore, be summarily eliminated from a list of possible authors of the Muzika. The Hypothesis of Josef Jireček Josef Jireček reported that the Muzika of Jan Josquin was not written by a Czech at all, but by a displaced Frenchman who had entered Bohemia in 1534: Jan Josquin was descended from a line of Reformation Frenchmen who, before the persecution of King Francis I beginning in 1534, turned from his country to foreign lands. Josquin, having found among the Jednota a kindly refuge, lived, as it seems, by teaching singing and music. Among his students were counted the brothers Konrád. [pageend124]MUSIC THEORISTS OF THE BOHEMIAN REFORMATION 123 Karel, and Adam Krajíř, sons of Sir Arnošt (died 1555), to whom he dedicated his Muzika.*2 Jireček, however, offers no evidence to support his claim that Jan Josquin was a Frenchman (Josquin za Francouze). Moreover, Josquin himself, in the Muzika, refers to his relationship with the brothers Krajíř as one of native (vlastní) brothers.43 It is interesting to note that Jireček registered the following titlepage information for the Muzika, suggesting that this work antedates the Musica of Blahoslav by seven years: Muzika, which is the instruction appropriate for singing. For the gratification of all who desire to learn singing. From me, J.J. Published in the Czech language at Olomouc in 1551, and in Prostějov in 1561.44 Where Jireček obtained the information of a “first” printing is not known. The actual title page of the 1561 edition of the Muzika, which Jireček was supposedly quoting, reads as follows: Muzika, which is the instruction appropriate for singing. For the gratification of all who desire to learn singing. From me, Jan Josquin. Newly written and published in the Czech language, in the year 1561.45 That there was, indeed, no edition of the Muzika in 1551 can be substantiated by evidence found in the treatises of Blahoslav and Josquin: 1. The author of the Ad lectorem of Blahoslav’s Musica (1558), known only as “S.T.T.,” states that this work is the first of its kind in the Czech language: This book (as it is first in number, so it is in excellence) first teaches the Bohemians to sing in a refined manner.46 2. Blahoslav himself, in the Musica, indicates that this is the first music theory manual to be written in the Czech language: ... 1 hope that the understanding reader will not be astounded nor blame me for having written, as never before, these instructions. ... I have written this in Czech for the Czechs.47 3. Josquin dated the dedication of his Muzika as 9 November 1561, and this dedication contains no reference to any earlier edition of the Muzika.** [pageend125]124 KOSMAS 4. In his discussion of ligatures (music notation) in the Muzika, Josquin refers his reader to an earlier theoretical treatise in the Czech language: If you wish to understand more of this, you will find that [it is] rather extensively [covered] in the first Czech Musical Perhaps Jireček confused the works of Blahoslav and Josquin in regard to an earlier edition of the Muzika for, although published in 1558, the first edition of Blahoslav’s Musica did originate in the town of Olomouc. In any case, it seems safe to assume that Jireček did not actually review Josquin’s Muzika prior to writing the entry “Jan Josquin” in his Rukovet. The Hypothesis of Otakar Hostinský The first substantial academic investigation into the identity of Jan Josquin was the late nineteenth-century effort by Otakar Hostinský. In his Jan Blahoslav a Jan Josquin, Hostinský not only transcribed the theoretical treatises of both Blahoslav and Josquin from sixteenth-century to nineteenth-century Czech, but also attempted to lay to rest the question of the identity of “Jan Josquin.”50 Hostinský observed that the most conspicuous suggestion of the author’s identity is a handwritten remark in the lower right-hand corner of the title page of the Muzika. Although part of the inscription has been obliterated, some words are still readable: B. V. Solín sepsal tu m ... v ten čas když se . . . na hněval.5' (B. V. Solín wrote this m ... at that time when he(?) was angry with (?) Hostinský resolved the first part of the inscription as follows: B. V. Solín sepsal tu muziku . . . (B. V. Solín wrote this Muzika . . . ) What remains of the name of the person with whom Solin(?) was angry, however, is only the final syllable “na.” This permits the “decoding” to take several directions and still remain orthographically correct: . . . když se na Jana hněval. . . . když se na mne Jana. [pageend126]MUSIC THEORISTS OF THE BOHEMIAN REFORMATION 125 . . . když se na Přerovina. . . . když se na Josquina. (. . . when he was angry with Jan [Blahoslav?]. . . . when he was angry with me, Jan. . . . when he was angry with the Přerovite. . . . when he was angry with Josquin.) Thus, it is impossible to tell if Solin wrote the remark himself. Perhaps a third party was writing about a conflict between Solin and Jan, or perhaps Jan wrote the remark himself. The “na” may not even complete the name of a person at all. In this case, the “na” could refer to one of the common ways in which Blahoslav identified himself, by referring to his native town of Přerov. In fact, the “na” may not complete either the word “Jan” or “Přerovite,” but could complete the name of any person or town that ends with the spelling of those two letters in this particular grammatical construction. Perhaps Hostinský’s resolution of “sepsal tu m . . is incorrect and Solin wrote “this” (referring to the glosses of this treatise rather than the treatise itself) when he was angry at the author. Jan Josquin. Another possible decoding, although an unlikely one in view of the limited amount of paper missing from the title page, is that Solin wrote “this” (referring to either the glosses or the Muzika itself) when some third party was angry with . . na.” To corroborate his assertion that Jan Josquin was the Jednota priest. (Brother) Václav Solin. Hostinský pointed to what he believed is that author’s allusion, in the Muzika, to his true identity. The Muzika contains a four-voice arrangement of “Kdož pod obranau NejvySSiho,”52 based on a tenor melody of Bishop Martin Michalec that is found in the Šamotulský kancionál. Printed beneath the discant of this arrangement are the initials “I.I.V.S.” Hostinský believed that these initials stand for “Johannes Josquinus. Venceslaus Solin.” Hostinský did not, however, address the possibility of a misidentification, in the Rejstřík, of the composer of this tenor melody. Perhaps Solin himself was the composer and was “correcting” the error here in the Muzika; perhaps Solin was merely indicating that it was he himself who was responsible for this four-voice arrangement. Very little is known about the life of Václav Solin, and it is only because of his association with Jan Blahoslav and because of the Jednota's meticulous record keeping that Solin’s name receives even a minor footnote in Czech history. [pageend127]126 KOSMAS In 1560, at age 33, Václav Solin was sent to Šamotuly by the Elders to assist Blahoslav with the printing of the Šamotulský kancionál. The specific purpose of Solin’s assignment remains unclear, but Hostinský theorized that Solin was to take over the position of editor at the printing house. In 1555 the Elders had entrusted Blahoslav with the selection and “correction” of hymns for a new hymnbook. By 1560, however, it had become apparent to them that Blahoslav’s obsession with linguistic and musical revision, and his personal conflict with Bishop Jan Augusta over the number of Augusta’s hymns that were to be judged “acceptable,” might prevent the hymnal from ever being printed. The Elders apparently thought that Solin could expedite matters. Solin’s diary reports that he was in Šamotuly on 25 January 1560, a time when the printing of the hymnal was just underway. The hymnal was released on 7 June of the following year, but no mention of the event is contained in the diary. The diary further indicates that Solin was present in Ivančice on 2 December 1562, when a revision of the hymnal went to print, and that he was likewise in Ivančice on 17 February 1564, when the printing was completed.53 The one omission from Solin’s diary is obvious, and it may be that Solin was indeed not present for the completion of the Šamotulský kancionál. Hostinský believed that friction had developed between Blahoslav and Solin over the sharing of responsibility, with Blahoslav doubtlessly expecting his opinions as the “music specialist” to be respected. The supposed animosity between Blahoslav and Solin over the printing of the hymnal could have been intensified by Solin’s preparation and impending publication of a second Czech-language theory manual. If Solin did indeed leave Šamotuly prior to June 1561, the reason for his departure is not known. Several conjectures are plausible. Perhaps the Elders never intended for Solin to remain in Šamotuly; perhaps Blahoslav arranged to have his antagonist recalled; perhaps Solin left voluntarily to attend to the printing of his own theory manual in Prostějov. We know that Prostějov was the headquarters of the Jednota in Moravia, that the Jednota in Prostějov operated a printing shop, and that the Muzika of Jan Josquin carries a date of 9 November 1561. If Václav Solin was “Jan Josquin,” it seems understandable that he would have wanted to be in Prostějov prior to November 1561 to supervise the printing of his treatise. The edict of the Jednota Elders in 1549 forbade the printing of material without official church sanction. If Solin was unable to [pageend128]MUSIC THEORISTS OF THE BOHEMIAN REFORMATION 127 secure permission from Blahoslav to print his Muzika in Šamotuly following completion of the Samotulský kancionál, he may have been compelled to travel to Prostějov to obtain this permission from a Jednota bishop in another district. The single surviving copy of Josquin’s Muzika is heavily glossed with marginal notes. Some of these marginal notes have been left unintelligible by the cropping of pages for insertion into booklet form, and many more have been rendered unreadable by the passage of time and neglect. In his Jan Blahoslav a Jan Josquin, Hostinský stated that he could be sure of a reasonable transcription of only 35 of these glosses, which are reproduced in his study. The glosses provided Hostinský with yet another phase of investigation in his attempt to prove that Václav Solín and Jan Josquin were one and the same person. Hostinský asked Josef Müller, historian of the Jednota archives in Ochranov, to compare the glosses found in Josquin’s Muzika with the significant works and notes of Jan Blahoslav. In a letter dated 30 March 1892, Müller replied that certain words positively do bear the characteristics of Blahoslav’s handwriting, but that he could not be sure that all of the glosses were by Blahoslav. The complicating factors are that the handwriting varies between bold and delicate, and that the ink varies between light and dark. Hostinský noted, however, that there is consistency among the glosses in terms of style, (vile) temperament, and the annotator’s knowledge of the subject and that, from these, a number of things can be known about the author of the glosses: that he was a Czech, that he was an expert in the Czech language, that he was an experienced editor, that he was fond of using proverbs, and that he was a contemporary of Jan Josquin. These determinations led Hostinský to undertake his own handwriting analysis of the glosses in the Muzika, comparing these with Blahoslav’s material in the Ochranov Archives. This analysis included Blahoslav’s glosses of the Šamotulský kancionál, a source that was not included in Miiller’s analysis. Hostinský dismissed the handwriting dissimilarities as arising from the use of different writing instruments and from the likelihood that the critique was done at different sittings. Hostinský concluded that all of the glosses in the Muzika of Jan Josquin were made by Blahoslav. Hostinský cited three verifications to support his claim that Solín used the pseudonym “Jan Josquin”: [pageend129]128 KOSMAS 1. The partially destroyed inscription on the title page of the Muzika, which indicates that Václav Solin had some association with this work. 2. The initials “I.I.V.S.,” which accompany one of the musical examples in the Muzika and which could be deciphered as “Johannes Josquinus. Venceslaus Solin.” 3. The alleged conflict between Blahoslav and Solin, which might have led Blahoslav to gloss so heavily the treatise of his musical rival. Regarding this latter verification. Hostinský devoted a large portion of his discussion to establishing the poor relations between Blahoslav and Solin. While no concrete evidence exists to verify this supposed conflict. Solin’s obituary in the Nekrologium does seem to suggest that he experienced some difficulty in personal relationships: In this year [1566] died Brother Václav Solin, administrator of the assembly in Třebíč, here in Třebíč after Pentecost, on the fifth day of June, around the 16th hour. Still a young man, he will be buried tomorrow. He was ordained to the priesthood in Slížany in the year 1557. He was greater alone than with others. And we have blossomed through him. but it was an impermanent flowering.54 The comment “was greater alone than with others” is highly atypical of remarks registered in the Nekrologium. This personal characteristic of Solin and the alleged conflict between Solin and Blahoslav, however, prove neither that Solin used the pseudonym “Jan Josquin” nor that Blahoslav might not have glossed a treatise by any other author. Likewise, the initialing of the musical example in the Muzika answers no question and raises many others yet to be addressed. It is only the partially destroyed title-page inscription, with the many variations for its “decoding,” that in any way supports Hostinský’s determination of the author of the Muzika as Václav Solin. Nevertheless, the depth of Hostinský’s research concerning the identity of Jan Josquin remains unsurpassed in any study to the present time. The Hypothesis of Ladislav Dolans ký Following Hostinský’s assertion that the author of Jan Josquin’s Muzika was the Jednota priest Václav Solin, several articles were written to challenge Hostinský’s conclusion. The first of these, “Johannes Josquinus Václav Solin,” was published by Ladislav Dolanský in 1901.55 [pageend130]MUSIC THEORISTS OF THE BOHEMIAN REFORMATION 129 On the basis of his analysis of Solin’s handwriting in the Calen- darium historicum conscriptuni a Paulo Eberoib and the glosses of the Muzika, Dolanský concluded that the glosses were not made by Solin. Moreover, Dolanský declared that he could only be sure that Blahoslav wrote the inscription on the title page. Dolanský observed that Blahoslav always capitalized the word “musica” in his theoretical primer. Therefore, Dolanský disagreed with Hostinský’s resolution of the title-page inscription as “B. V. Solín sepsal tu muziku . . Dolanský speculated that what appears to be the character “m” beginning a new word might not be that character. Instead, it might be the letter “n,” “u,” or “w,” or even part of the previous word, for example, “tú.” Dolanský did not believe that Václav Solin could have had such poor command of the Czech language as is found in Josquin’s Muzika. As proof of this Dolanský cites a dexterous use of the language in the two brief entries of Solin in the Akty Jednoty bratrské', Dolanský did not, however, address the fact that these entries are not in Solin's own hand and that these may have been corrected by the scribe. As further proof of Solin’s academic competence, Dolanský pointed to Solin’s stature within the Jednota: 1. In 1559 Blahoslav sent Solin and Jan Jelický to represent the Jednota in the debate with the Anabaptists from Ivančice and Znojmo. 2. Solin was appointed by the Elders of the Jednota to the editorial boards of both the Šamotulský kancionál (1561) and the Ivančický kancionál (1564). 3. In 1565 Solin traveled to Vienna to represent the Jednota at the funeral of Ferdinand I, acting in the capacity of “spiritual adviser to the Jednota aristocracy.” 4. Following completion of the Ivančický kancionál, Solin assumed the position of spiritual and administrative representative of the Jednota in Třebíč. Dolanský could find no conclusive evidence of the supposed conflict between Blahoslav and Solin. He noted that Blahoslav did not criticize Solin in the Rejstřík, the index of composers whose songs are in the Šamotulský kancionál, and that Solin did not criticize Blahoslav in his papers originating from the time of the alleged conflict. Moreover, Dolanský could find no indication that Josquin’s Muzika was written out of anger or in response to an [pageend131]130 KOSMAS earlier Czech music manual, nor any instance where Blahoslav criticized Josquin’s Muzika in his later writings. Dolanský noted that the dedication of Josquin’s Muzika contains the partially destroyed signature of “Jan ... nk ...” or “Jan . . . nka . . .” alongside the printed name of “Johannes Josquinus.” This, according to Dolanský, is proof that the author was not Václav Solín. Even if, as Hostinský surmised, Solín had taken the name "Josquin” out of admiration for Josquin Desprez, there still would have been no reason for Solín to select another Christian name. Finally, Dolanský focused attention on Josquin’s stated place of residence: Josquin declares directly [in the dedication of the Muzika] that he was a subject of the Krajíř family from the district of Mladá Boleslav. Solín was not. Hostinský slights this disagreement and tries to explain it by the fact that the Moravian branch of the Krajíř family, related to the one in Mladá Boleslav, was also related to the Pernštein family, on whose estate Solín was born in 1527. The author of the glosses [further] points out that Josquin was loyal even to the relatives of his overlords, but this relationship between the two families was a rather distant one and should hardly have led the author of the marginal notes to such an assertion.57 Thus, because he did not believe that Solín, related to the Moravian branch of the Krajíř family, would have dedicated his Muzika to his Bohemian relatives, Dolanský could not believe that Solín and the author of the Muzika were one and the same. There are a number of concerns, however, regarding the depth of Dolanský’s research in his attempt to discredit Hostinský’s findings. Dolanský, for example, based his familiarity with Solin’s handwriting on only a single, one-line annotation in the Calendarium historicum conscriptum: 1564 ten den sem se do Třebíče přistěhoval. Václav Solín. (1564. On this day I moved to Třebíč. Václav Solín.) This meager amount seems insufficient for Dolanský to have used it as the sole basis for a confutation of Hostinský’s extensive handwriting comparison. With regard to the implications of Blahoslav’s failure to capitalize the letter “m” in his title-page inscription of the Muzika, Dolanský failed to address a number of items: [pageend132]MUSIC THEORISTS OF THE BOHEMIAN REFORMATION 131 1. There are many inconsistencies in the capitalization of words in the printed text of both Blahoslav’s Musica and Josquin’s Muzika, and the capitalization of nouns in the handwritten language of the period was even less systematic. 2. This inscription may have been added some years after the publication of Blahoslav’s Musica. Furthermore, the fact that a single word was or was not capitalized during an era when the rules of the Czech language were undergoing great change does not seem to have the importance that Dolanský assigns. This would, at most, represent only a very minor change in the writing style of Blahoslav. 3. It is possible that Blahoslav did not capitalize the word “muzika” in this inscription because he wished to chide the author of the text in one more way. On the issue of Solin’s education, Dolanský presupposed that an exemplary education would have been a requisite for a man of Solin’s position in the Jednota community. Detailed records in the Akty Jednoty bratrské describe numerous educational travels both sanctioned and financially supported by the Jednota; Solin’s name, however, is not mentioned in connection with any of these scholastic sojourns. Further, Solin’s obituary in the Nekrologium is quite modest in comparison to obituaries of leading members of the Jednota and indicates, by his assignment to the town of Třebíč, that, in fact, Solin held a position of relatively minor importance. We can assume, therefore, that Solin had probably received only the basic education that was available in a Jednota parish school. With regard to the fact that Blahoslav does not “criticize” the musical examples of Solin in the Rejstřík of the Šamotulský kancionál, Dolanský totally ignored the insult. Although Solin is represented in the hymnal, all recognition of his life and work is omitted from Blahoslav’s Rejstřík. Furthermore, Solin, coeditor of the two Jednota hymnals, is represented by only four hymns in the Šamotulský kancionál, and possibly by one additional hymn (listed under the name “Janovi z Žerotína Václav B.") in the Ivančický kancionál. Blahoslav, who was authorized to select the hymns for inclusion, is himself represented by 69 hymns in each hymnal. The fact that Blahoslav’s name is not mentioned in Solin’s diary during the time of the alleged conflict could have a number of explanations: [pageend133]132 KOSMAS 1. Because of the Jednota's doctrine of forgiveness, as well as the tact that Blahoslav held the position of bishop and Solin one ot subordinate authority, it would be surprising to find Solin admitting any such conflict in writing. 2. Any evidence of the alleged conflict between Blahoslav and Solin may have been removed when Solin’s diary was recopied into the Akty Jednoty bratrské. 3. It may have been that Solin intentionally ignored Blahoslav, omitting recognition in places where it would have been natural to make such acknowledgment. Dolanský stated that he was unable to find any indication that Josquin’s Muzika was written with vindictiveness toward Bishop Jan Blahoslav or Blahoslav’s Musica. It seems extremely doubtful that a Jednota priest would have been able to publish even a subtle criticism of a Jednota bishop, especially in a Jednota printing shop located at the Moravian headquarters of the Jednota, in a town where that bishop had lived for many years, and during a time when all publications of the sect were strictly censored by church officials. Dolanský did not point out that it is nearly halfway through the Muzika before the author acknowledges the existence of an earlier Czech Musica, doing so without ever mentioning the author of that earlier primer by name. Considering the hierarchical relationship of Blahoslav and Solin, this is probably as far as Solin could have gone in any attack directed toward the bishop. With regard to the marginal signature that follows the dedication of the Muzika, the only basis for Dolanský’s theory that this represents the true name of the author is that the Christian name used in the marginal note is identical to the Christian pseudonym of Jan Josquin. Finally, Dolanský observed that the author of the Muzika lived near Mladá Boleslav, and that this fact eliminates Václav Solin from a list of possible authors because he was related to the Moravian branch of the Krajíř family. It seems that Dolanský was unaware that Solin spent many years in Mladá Boleslav, the headquarters of the Jednota in Bohemia. It is possible, therefore, that Solin might have attached himself to his relatives already living there, and might have considered himself a resident of that city. The Hypothesis of Vladimir Gregor In his “Jan Josquin a Jusquin von Holz” of 1953, Vladimir Gregor stated his belief that the author of Josquin’s Muzika was a vicar in [pageend134]MUSIC THEORISTS OF THE BOHEMIAN REFORMATION 133 Šumperk, Jusquin von Holz.58 In this assertion, Gregor followed the opinion presented in the Geschichte der Stadt Mährisch-Schönberg (1924) by the Šumperk archivist, Franz Harrer, who himself followed an earlier (and later discounted) hypothesis of Josef Jireček. Gregor, however, did not take into account the religion (Lutheran) and nationality (German) of Šumperk during Jusquin’s lifetime; he portrayed Jusquin as a Czech writer of the Jednota while, in fact, later studies indicate that Jusquin was a German Lutheran from Hamburg.59 The most obvious problem with Gregor’s information is that he placed the Muzika of Josquin before the Musica of Blahoslav in spite of six facts that contradict this arrangement: 1. The title page of Blahoslav’s Musica is dated 1558. 2. The author of the Ad lectorum of Blahoslav’s Musica states that this is the first music treatise to be printed in the Czech language. 3. Blahoslav himself states, in the Musica, that his is the first primer to appear in the Czech language. 4. The title page of Josquin’s Muzika is dated 1561. 5. Josquin himself dated the dedication of the Muzika as 9 November 1561. 6. Josquin acknowledges, in the Muzika, that he is aware of an earlier Czech Musica. My only explanation for this erroneous arrangement is that Gregor must not have had the original treatises at hand, basing his article, in this respect, on the erroneous information registered by Jireček in the Rukovet. The Hypothesis of Frantisek Bartos In his Bratrsky spisovatel Jan Josquin” of 1956, František Bartoš stated his belief that the author of Josquin’s Muzika was Jan Cervenka, son of the Jednota bishop Matěj Červenka.60 Virtually all that is known about Jan Červenka is that he was a painter and an alchemist from Hranice, a town located only 25 kilometers from Blahoslav’s birthplace. Bartoš based his hypothesis on the similarity of the first name “Jan” and the ending of the surname . . nk . ,” which is found as a marginal note following the dedication of the Muzika. While Bartoš evidently did a great deal of research to prove that Jan [pageend135]134 KOSMAS Červenka could have been a subject of the Krajíř family (a necessity, to match the self-description of the author), he could provide no substantive argument to show that Jan Červenka had any relation to the Krajíř family, that Jan Červenka was related to Bishop Matěj Červenka, that Jan Červenka was a musician, or that Jan Červenka ever used the pseudonym “Jan Josquin.” The Hypothesis of Ivan Vávra In his “Dnešní stav josquinské otázky” of 1958, Ivan Vávra asserted that the author of Josquin’s Muzika was Jan Facilis.61 He based this conclusion on three findings: 1. Evidence of a Jednota priest, Jan Facilis, who was active in Mladá Boleslav and Prostějov during this period.62 2. The existence of a four-voice vocal composition by Facilis, using the verses of Ovid, which proves that Facilis was a musician. 3. An entry of matriculation cited in O. Hartwig’s Album aca- demiae Vitebergensis 1561-1602 for a “Iohannes losquinus Bo- leslauien [Jan Josquin from Mladá Boleslav]” dating from 30 April 1563. Regarding that entry, Vávra noted the following: This inscription escaped the attention of all researchers looking for Czech scholars abroad. It would have saved O. Hostinský from his Solin hypothesis, V. Gregor from his adventure into German historiography, and F. M. Bartoš from his identification of the painter Jan Červenka.63 How these findings of Vávra identify “Jan Josquin” as Jan Facilis is difficult to understand: 1. Both Jan Blahoslav and Václav Solin, as well as numerous other members of the Jednota, are known to have worked in Mladá Boleslav and Prostějov. This comes as no surprise, because Mladá Boleslav was the Jednota headquarters in Bohemia, and Prostějov the Jednota headquarters in Moravia. 2. Facilis’s single composition provides absolutely no evidence to support the claim that Facilis wrote a theoretical text using the pseudonym “Jan Josquin.” 3. While an “Iohannes losquinus” from Mladá Boleslav may have indeed studied at Wittenberg, and this might have been the author of the Muzika, this fact shows no interrelationship [pageend136]MUSIC THEORISTS OF THE BOHEMIAN REFORMATION 135 between Iohannes losquinus and Jan Facilis. Vávra did point out that the initialing (I.I.V.S.) of the musical example in the Muzika could be “decoded” as “Iohannes losquinus Vitebergae Studiosis” but failed to observe that the Muzika was printed in 1561 while Iohannes losquinus did not matriculate at Wittenberg until 1563. The validity of Vávra’s study is suspect in several other areas. Vávra stated, for example, that Hostinský: . . . very correctly identified the conflict between Jan Blahoslav and his printing assistant Václav Solin who, at the beginning of 1564, suddenly left the printing shop at Ivančice without waiting for the completion of his work—the hymnal and the New Testament.64 Vávra misquoted Hostinský’s work; apparently he misunderstood the sequence of events surrounding the publication of the Jednota hymnals of 1561 and 1564. Hostinský pointed out that it was in 1561 (not 1564), before completion of the Šamotulský kancionál, that Solin unexpectedly left the printing shop at Šamotuly (not Ivančice); Solin's diary indicates that he was indeed present in Ivančice on 17 February 1564 when the printing of the Ivančicky kancionál was completed, as Hostinský so stated.65 In regard to Josquin’s relation to the Krajíř family, Vávra stated the following: The author of Josquin’s Muzika was, in fact, a subject of the Krajíř, originally coming from Mladá Boleslav and, safely, living there before 1555 because he knew the old Arnošt Krajíř z Krajku [died 1555], whose achievements as a singer he remembers in the dedicatory preface.66 This statement is false. Arnošt Krajíř is neither mentioned nor alluded to in the Muzika of Josquin and the work is, in fact, dedicated to the sons of Arnošt Krajíř, Adam, Karel, and Konrád. The exemplary musician who Josquin remembers in his preface is not the father, Arnošt, but rather, Pán Otec (God the Father).67 Further. Vávra observed that the Muzika of Josquin is more in character with the “harmonic” tendencies of the Czech Utraquists and German Lutherans than with the monomelodic music of the Jednota bratrská, and suggested that the author of the Muzika might not have been a member of the Jednota. It is true that Josquin’s [pageend137]136 KOSMAS treatise, as well as Blahoslav’s Musica. contains a number of polyphonic examples and that Josquin’s treatise originally contained a chapter (now lost) on polyphony. Vávra, however, overlooked five facts that negate this theory that the author might not have been associated with the Jednota: 1. The Muzika was published in Prostčjov. the Moravian headquarters of the Jednota. 2. The author of the Muzika alludes to only one other music treatise, that of the Jednota bishop Jan Blahoslav. 3. The author makes an obvious reference to the Šamotulský kancionál, published just five months prior to the Muzika, when explaining the purpose of this treatise: It is for those who have a love and a thirst [for music], desiring to know about it and yet not knowing the Latin language, so that they may have an easier access to the learning (particularly when in the newly published hymnbook many unfamiliar melodies are found, and these would be impossible to decipher easily for the one who does not know music, and it would be tiresome to look for a master of each song).68 4. Many of the musical examples in the Muzika are extracted from the Jednota hymnal of 1561, an illegal publication and a source that probably would not have been used unless the author was himself a member of the sect. 5. The Šamotulský kancionál was published on 7 June 1561; the Muzika of Josquin was published on 9 November of that same year. The time seems insufficient for an author to have prepared this treatise, extensively quoting examples from the hymnal, unless that author (Václav Solín, coeditor of the hymnal?) had prior knowledge of which hymns would appear in the hymnal. Finally, Vávra concludes that the Muzika of Josquin and the Musica of Blahoslav were intended for different audiences and were in no way in competition with each other. This judgment, based on an apparent unfamiliarity with the treatises, is incorrect. The treatises of Josquin and Blahoslav are, in fact, nearly identical in scope and purpose.69 Conclusion The concern regarding existing research related to the authorship of the Muzika of 1561 is twofold: the failure of particular historians [pageend138]MUSIC THEORISTS OF THE BOHEMIAN REFORMATION 137 to substantiate a hypothesis with evidence and their failure to concentrate on more than a few details of a complex mystery. Gabulka’s proposal that the author was Josquin Desprez when Desprez had been dead for 40 years, Jireček’s registering of a 1551 edition of the Muzika that never existed, Dolanský’s negation of Hostinský’s extensive handwriting analysis by a study based on only a ten-word example of Solin’s handwriting, Gregor’s erroneous dating of Blahoslav’s and Josquin’s treatises despite the fact that both works are clearly dated, Bartoš’s inability to draw any conclusion, and Vávra’s volume of incorrect conclusions that demonstrate an almost complete lack of familiarity with the treatises of Blahoslav and Josquin, are all examples of the inadequacy of past research on this topic. Unfortunately, it is upon this level of research that we are dependent for much of our information; many of the materials necessary for a detailed study of “Jan Josquin” are either unavailable to Western scholars or are no longer extant. Hostinský’s extensive discussion in Jan Blahoslav a Jan Josquin is by far the most scholarly and most comprehensive of those reviewed for this study. Despite several oversights. Hostinský presented a detailed argument that the author of the Muzika was the Jednota priest Václav Solin. Several other possibilities that cannot be discounted at this time have been proposed by other Czech historians. However, in view of the evidence uncovered thus far and the inferences that can be drawn from that evidence (such as the fact that only Solin could have so rapidly prepared a music treatise quoting hymns from the Šamotulský kancionál), it appears most probable that the author of the Muzika of 1561 was indeed Václav Solin. MUSIC THEORY ACCORDING TO JAN BLAHOSLAV AND JAN JOSQUIN It is not surprising that the Elders of the Jednota bratrská sent many of its novitiates to study in Wittenberg. In the mid-sixteenth century one could make the 450-kilometer journey from Prague to Wittenberg in 12 days on the Elbe River. In Wittenberg the students could attend the lectures of Martin Luther and Philip Melanchton and exchange ideas with Protestants whose beliefs were very close to those of the Jednota. In addition to pursuing their religious studies while abroad, it is probable that many of the Jednota students sought out musical instruction as well. The Jednota sent Jan Blahoslav to Wittenberg in 1544. A number of music theorists are known to have been active in Wittenberg [pageend139]138 KOSMAS during the year 1544-45, and Blahoslav likely came in contact with them during his stay.70 The musician and publisher Georg Rhau, who had established a printing shop in the city in 1525, served as town councillor from 1541 until his death in 1548; Heinrich Faber, who later wrote three theoretical texts (1548-50), matriculated at the university in 1541 and received a Master of Arts degree in 1545; Hermann Finck, who later wrote a treatise (1556) from which Blahoslav took much of the information for his Musica, matriculated at the university in 1545; Adrianus Petit Coclico, who later claimed to have studied with Josquin Desprez,71 is likewise mentioned in the matriculation register of the university in 1545. Coclico taught privately in Wittenberg, and later tried unsuccessfully to win a position on the faculty. Like Finck, Coclico later wrote a treatise (1552) from which Blahoslav would take information for his Musica. There is no documentation as to whether Blahoslav actually met Rhau, Faber, Finck, or Coclico, but the opportunity seems to have existed in each case. 1 believe that there is evidence to indicate that Václav Solin also studied in Wittenberg. If, however, the “Iohannes losquinus Boles- lauien” who registered at the university in 1563 was indeed the “Jan Josquin” (Václav Solin) who authored the Muzika, the treatise would have predated the author’s university training by two years. If Blahoslav had not met the theorist Adrianus Petit Coclico at Wittenberg in 1544-45, the two may have met when the Jednota sent Blahoslav to study at the newly established university at Königsberg in 1549. Coclico matriculated at the university in September 1547, remaining in the city until 1550 when his housekeeper bore him an illegitimate son.72 Further, Blahoslav’s visit to Magdeburg in May-June of 1556 provided him with the opportunity of meeting the theorist Martin Agricola. While it is not certain that these two men met before Agricola died on 10 June of that year, Blahoslav was probably working on a draft of the Musica by 1556 and would likely have sought out this famous choirmaster of the Magdeburg Lateinschule. In the Musica, Blahoslav recommends the treatises of two theorists: 1 refer the cantor who wishes to sing with a learned voice and who knows Latin to the disciple of the famous musician Josquin [Desprez], Adrianus Petit [Coclico]. and to another like the first. Hermann Finck. The cantor will surely find these to be of great benefit.73 [pageend140]MUSIC THEORISTS OF THE BOHEMIAN REFORMATION 139 Much of Blahoslav’s information and many tables and examples are taken from the Compendium musices (1552) of Coclico and the Practica musica (1556) of Finck. To a lesser extent, Blahoslav drew material from the Musica (1548) of Nikolaus Listenius and the Musicorum libri quatuor (1512) of Václav Philomathes. Coclico, Finck, and Listenius were all connected with Wittenberg at some point; very little is known about Philomathes from Jindřichův Hradec.74 Although Josquin, in his Muzika, does not mention an indebtedness to any theorist, it appears that he borrowed heavily from the treatise of Listenius. Josquin does make a reference to the “first Czech Musica"-, my earlier study is a detailed examination and comparison of the treatises of Blahoslav and Josquin.75 During the sixteenth century, music was typically divided into three disciplines: musica theorica, musica practica, and musica poe- tica. Because most music texts were destined for use in preparatory schools rather than at the university, it is not surprising that these texts contain more practical advice than speculative theory or discussions of advanced procedures. Musica theorica, the definitions and classifications of music, was given less attention during the sixteenth century than during the previous era; musica poetica, the study of polyphonic composition, was discussed by relatively few sixteenth-century theorists.76 It was musica practica, then, that formed the bulk of discussion in the typical music manual of the sixteenth century. Because the Musica of Blahoslav and the Muzika of Josquin were published within a three-year period and were related through their association with the Jednota bratrská, one should not be surprised that they are similar in scope and level of presentation. Because all publications of the Jednota were banned after 1508, we know with relative certainty that Blahoslav and Josquin were writing only for members.of their sect. The worship music of the Jednota did not progress beyond vocal monophony, and the composition of new songs had been severely curtailed by the Elders in 1549. There was little need for manuals that discussed musica theorica or musica poetica, a limited discussion of musica practica being all that was necessary to train singers of the Jednota choirs. The applicable fundamentals of unison singing are amply discussed and illustrated by Blahoslav and Josquin; the theoretical explanations, mathematical ratios, and complex proportions are left aside. Many of the items discussed by Blahoslav are discussed by Josquin, and the two authors often construct their arguments and examples after the same model; Blahoslav and Josquin occasionally [pageend141]140 KOSMAS omit identical pieces of information about a topic. In the case of terminology, both writers use identical unprecedented Czech translations of Latin terms. The most striking curiosity of Blahoslav’s Musica and Josquin’s Muzika is the inclusion of polyphonic examples. Despite the expectation that these texts would contain purely monophonic examples of the type used by the Jednota in their worship service, Blahoslav’s Musica contains five polyphonic examples while 16 are found in the Muzika of Josquin. Neither Blahoslav nor Josquin, however, offers any solid instruction in polyphonic composition. Surely Blahoslav and Josquin were aware of the polyphonic traditions of the Catholic and Utraquist churches that virtually surrounded the Jednota, and perhaps the inclusion of polyphonic examples in these treatises was merely meant to make the student aware of this other practice. It is true that some topics are discussed only by Blahoslav while other topics are discussed only by Josquin. It does not appear, however, that Josquin’s Muzika of 1561 was written as a supplement or amplification to Blahoslav’s Musica of 1558. Rather, it appears that these were rival texts competing for the same readership. Each text is complete within itself, and the omissions and enlargements appear to be based on what seemed important to the particular author. Through a study of Blahoslav’s Musica and Josquin’s Muzika it is possible to understand the musica practica of the Jednota bratrská prior to the Battle of White Mountain.77 No new musical system is proposed in these treatises, and the ideas are, for the most part, conventional. Yet, as the first two music treatises printed in the Czech language, these works are important because they prove a musical interaction between the theorists of Bohemia-Moravia and those of Wittenberg and because they shed light on the relatively unexplored music and music theory of Bohemia-Moravia during the sixteenth century.

Only five of Blahoslav’s works are known with certainty to have been published during his lifetime: Spis o zraku (1550), Musica (1558 & 1569 editions). Písně chval božských (Šamotulský kancionál 1561 & Ivančický kancionál 1564). Nový Zákon (1564 & 1568), and Evangelia (1571). It was widely believed that Blahoslav wrote the Slabikář český, the first spelling primer of the Czech language, while teaching at the Jednota school in 'Prostějov in 1551. This work was long thought to have been unpublished and no longer extant. See a reproduction of the title page, dated 1547 (no other information available) in Jan Blahoslav Přerovský, ed. by Hýbl & Vožda. p. 112. [pageend143]142 KOSMAS 17. Like Blahoslav, Jan Amos Komenský (Comenius, 1592-1670) was born in Přerov and attended the Jednota school in Prostějov. 18. In a letter to Zachariáš, dated in Přerov 15 July 1551, Blahoslav stated that Optáťs translation of the New Testament into Czech was based on Erasmus’s Latin translation (which was printed alongside the Greek). For a reproduction of this letter see Blahoslav, Grammatika česká, pp. VII-X. We do not know, however, to what extent Blahoslav depended on Optáťs translation for his translation of the New Testament (from Greek), to what extent Blahoslav depended on Erasmus’s Greek translation, or if Blahoslav knew that Erasmus was dissatisfied with his own Greek translation, considering it to be “precipitated rather than edited.” See Roland Bainton, Erasmus of Christendom (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1969), p. 133. Taken from Erasmi Epistolae III, p. 117. 19. See note 74. 20. The first six volumes of the Akty were edited by Jan Černý; Blahoslav edited the 7th, most of the 8th, and part of the 9th. The Akty continued to be expanded until the death of Vavřinec Orlík in 1589. The work appears to have been discontinued at this time due to the increased religious tolerance under Maximilian II and Rudolf II. This made the gathering and copying of documents less important, and documents came to be directly deposited into the. Jednota library at Ivančice. 21. Some Czech historians erroneously indicate that Blahoslav made the first two of his four trips to Vienna in 1556. These travels are described by Blahoslav as having occurred in 1555. See Chudoba. “Jak přibývalo vědomostí,” Sborník Blahoslavily, pp. 19-20. 22. The Muzika of Jan Josquin, dated 9 November 1561, is dedicated to the sons of Arnošt Krajíř. 23.

Some Czech historians deny that Blahoslav left his parish of Ivančice to work in Šamotuly. It seems unlikely, however, that Blahoslav would have entrusted a subordinate with delivery of the manuscript of the Šamotulský kancionál. Further, we know that Blahoslav was unable to personally attend the debate with the Anabaptists from Ivančice and Znojmo. 25.

At least two works, the Nový Zákon (1564) and the Musica (2nd ed., 1569), bear the Latin arcanum “in Insula Hortensi" (at the island among the gardens) as the place of publication. This was the assumed name, among the Jednota, for the town of Ivančice. In 1578 the printing equipment was moved from Ivančice to the estate of Jan Žerotín Kralický: in 1620 Kralice was overrun by Catholic forces. The printing equipment was moved to Náměšť nad Oslavou and, eight years later, to Lissa (Leszno) in Poland. The equipment was destroyed in 1665 in the great fire of Lissa. 36. The second edition may have been printed elsewhere. The Kralická Bible was published in six volumes (beginning 1579). The New Testament was translated by Blahoslav (1564); the Jednota employed six Hebrew scholars to assist with the translation of the Old Testament. For practicality, the Kralická Bible was later printed in a small, one-volume paper edition with a plain calf binding. 37.

Philomathes matriculated at the University of Vienna in 1510, and two years later published his Musicorum libri quatuor in that city. The work went through six editions, two published by Rhau, who wrote an introduction to the treatise in 1534. Martin Agricola published a revision of the work, Scholia in musicam ptanam K Philomathes de Nova Domo, ex variis musicorum scriptus, through Rhau in 1538. Jan Trojan’s doctoral dissertation on Philomathes. done at Brno University, is currently unavailable to Western scholars.

English translations of Philomathes’s Musicorum and Agricola’s Scholia are forthcoming (Sovik). 75. See Sovik, Music Theorists, pp. 64-116. 76. Although texts devoted to polyphonic composition existed prior to the sixteenth century, Nikolaus Listenius appears to be the first to use the expression "musica poetica" in this sense. 77. Although the pacifist Jednota bratrská did not participate in the Battle of Bílá Hora (White Mountain) (8 November 1620), the membership suffered the same consequences as other Protestant factions. Forced into exile, the surviving disciples strove to retain their religious identity while living among a foreign population. In 1722, largely through the efforts of Count Nikolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf, the church was formally revived at Ochranov (Herrnhut) in Saxony. The sect exists today as the Moravian Church. [pageend147]SLAVIC INFLUENCES IN THE WORK OF JOHANNES BRAHMS In Commemoration of Brahms' Ninetieth Anniversary of Death Ernst Kern and Karel B. Absolon Franz Schubert and Johannes Brahms were the two outstanding composers of songs of the Romantic period and the whole 19th century in the German speaking area. Schubert who composed over six hundred Lieder (songs) used texts prevalently derived from German poets. Johannes Brahms, on the other hand, to a large extent chose also non-German texts, especially Slavic ones, a fact that up to this day has been little recognized. What is then the importance of this Slavic poetry and of the influence of Slavic culture in general for and upon the composition of Lieder and the complete oeuvre of the composer Brahms? Johannes Brahms, born 1833 in Hamburg, died 1897, by his ancestry as well as by his temperament was a typical Northern German. When he was thirty-years old, he went to Vienna and decided, after a short time, to make his permanent home there. He stayed in the metropolis on the Danube to the end of his life. Vienna in the 19th century was populated by a checkered mixture of nationalities, among whom not only the Hungarians as “Second Principal Nation” played a dominant role, but where also Czechs, Serbians and many others made their presence felt. 147 [pageend148]148 KOSMAS It would be wrong, however, to assume that everyone living in Vienna was exposed to all these influences in the same way. If so, the young Schubert would not have remained untouched by them. Apparently, born of German-speaking parents in Vienna, Schubert hardly had any contact with other ethnic influences. Maybe he didn’t even know of them—in modern lingo one might speak of “subcultures” that have an impact only on those who live within their sphere. Somebody like Brahms, though, who came to Vienna from the outside, saw with the sharper eye of a stranger all these foreign elements, their charm, their color, more clearly than the native. And it may have been just this complete contrast of the Slavic temperament in its way of expression, in its passion, that attracted and fascinated the primarily cool Northerner. This possibly is the main reason why one cannot see any Slavic influences in Schubert’s work, while these are very apparent in Brahms. A second reason could be the circumstance that systematic collecting of folk poetry and songs in various regions of the Austro- Hungarian monarchy started in the 1820s, but German translations suitable for the composition of the Lieder became available only after Schubert’s death. Thus, for his adaptations of German folk songs Brahms often used Anton Wilhelm Florentin von Zuccalmag- lio’s Deutsche Volkslieder mit ihren Originalweisen (German Folksongs with Their Original Tunes), published in two volumes in 1838-1840, or Johann Gottfried Herder’s Stimmen der Völker (Voices of the Nations, 1778-79) brought to his attention in 1854 by Julius Allgeyer. The translations of Slavic poetry and folk songs also appeared about that time, such as Josef Wenzig’s Slavische Volkslieder (Halle, 1830) and Siegfried Kapper’s Die Gesänge der Serben (Leipzig, 1852). Brahms was familiar with these volumes. Even before he settled in Vienna, in 1864, he set to music the first song of Wenzig’s collection (Von ewiger Liebe, op.43, 1), according to an authentic report by Mrs. Nelly Chrobák (Kalbeck II, 128). Kalbeck comments on the considerable difficulties and inadequacies resulting from the German adaptation. Once set to music by Brahms, the subsequent translations of the German text into other languages, such as English, were even more problematic. Brahms got to know Kapper’s adaptations only in 1877 (Kalbeck III, 328). Anyway, Brahms was well informed about both poets, as we see from his letter to the publisher Simrock, in December 1877, concerning Antonin Dvořák: “Among other works he sent duets for two soprano voices and piano .... The title and unfortunately the text as well are in Czech. A very good German translation should be arranged! Possibly, Wenzig (recently deceased) [pageend149]SLAVIC INFLUENCES OF JOHANNES BRAHMS 149 already translated some of them. Otherwise, perhaps Dr. Siegfried Kapper in Prague could agree to do it .... ” It may be opportune to say here more about Josef Wenzig, the translator-poet of many texts used by Brahms. Prague-born Wenzig (1807-1876) was an educator, poet in both the Czech and German languages, a dramatist, translator, and a Czech patriot. During his studies at Charles University in Prague, his literary activity began with the translation of Jan Kolár’s national poetry into German. F.L. Čelakovský, K. Vinařický and J.K. Chmelenský, three Czech poets and translators of world poetry, were his colleagues and mentors. In the turbulent year 1848, his associates and fellow members of the National Committee were the educators and writers Bernard Bolzano, Václav Kliment Klicpera and Josef Jungmann. Wenzig’s patriotic fervor was the underlying motivation for his efforts to acquaint the German speaking peoples with Czech literature. As a counsellor to the Ministry of Education in Vienna, with the help of his brother-in-law Exner, a high governmental official, he was instrumental in founding a new type of high school (Realschule), emphasizing technical subjects rather than the classics. He became its first director. With P.J. Šafařík he compiled the “terminology” for Czech high schools, a dictionary of Czech scientific terms. When Goethe quoted Wenzig in his periodical of criticism, Über Kunst und Altertum (Art and Antiquity), published in six volumes between 1816 and 1832, he enhanced the Bohemian writer’s status. Thus Wenzig’s publications came to be read in German speaking Europe. By 1860 some of Wenzig’s plays were produced on the stage. At that time Bedrich Smetana was on the ascent in Prague and used Wenzig’s librettos for his two important operas, Dalibor (1867) and Libuše (1881). Siegfried Kapper (born in Prague, 1821; died in Pisa, Italy, 1879) was a practicing physician. He was a peripatetic personality. France, Switzerland, Russia, Croatia, Serbia and Bulgaria were on his itinerary, until he finally settled in Bohemia to practice medicine. Of interest to us is his Slavic poetry translated into German, particularly his collection of the songs from Serbia. * * * Brahms composed thirteen Slavic Lieder for one voice, listed here in chronological order: 1.

It is well documented that Brahms not only understood and felt the folkloric character of these Lieder but also studied the instrumentation typical of such folk music. His knowledge went so deep that in op.95,1, he respected even the Serbian national meter, the 7/ 4 time, by continuously alternating the 3/4 and 4/4 measures. In op.69,9, the Serbian national instrument which uses just one string woven from horse hair, is heard besides the shepherd’s flute. Similar examples can be easily documented. Brahms became genuinely sensitive to Slavic music and through his empathy reached a degree of understanding surprising in a man of such a different ethnic origin. Brahms used Slavic folk texts not only in his Lieder for one voice, but also in some of his choral works, such as: 1. Fragen (Nach dem Slawischen), op.44,4 2. Das Mädchen (Nach dem Serbischen), op.93a,2 3. Der Falke (Nach dem Serbischen) op.93a,5 4. Verlorene Jugend (Nach dem Böhmischen) op. 104,4 In case of Brahms’ several settings of Das Mädchen (op.93a, 2, respective op.95,1), the solo voice version seems to be the first one. Theodor Billroth (1829-1894) wrote about it to the composer on August 6, 1884: “I already heard once before that lovely Serbian song; it must have fallen out of one of your earlier song collections [i.e., from op.85]; and since it does not fit anyway into a volume of other, very serious Lieder, you will just have to compose more songs in this genre, so characteristic of your work, to make up a complete volume.” It might be of interest that the surgeon Billroth got to see and hear most of Brahms’ compositions even before their publication. He had a kind of a jus primae noctis on all of Brahms’ works, [pageend151]SLAVIC INFLUENCES OF JOHANNES BRAHMS 151 according to a somewhat envious exclamation of Eduard Hanslick’s. Brahms and Billroth, both born in Northern Germany, became very close, intimate friends in Vienna. Billroth, the most important surgeon of his time, settled in Vienna in 1867 and never left again. We may assume that the two friends had similar reasons for staying there for the rest of their lives. This song Das Mädchen (The Maiden) has a special importance among the Brahms’ Lieder settings. As in all other composition genres, he experimented in his Lieder through all his life and tried again and again to create something new. Looking at it from this point of view, we may ask whether it isn’t significant that a striking break in style, noticeable in Brahms’ song output between op.94 and op.95, should be marked by such a Slavic Lied. Siegfried Kross describes this state of affairs as follows: “Op.94,5 (Kein Haus, keine Heimat) is a no-more-song, a non-Lied, a point of no return, that has no possible continuation. . . . The voice has no real melody anymore, the piano accompaniment is reduced to single, isolated, harsh clashes. . . . The artistry of this Lied in fact lies in leaving- out [anything non-essential], achieving total expression through a total absence of all moments of expression. . . .” He then continues: “In view of the consistency with which Brahms pursued such goals, it certainly is not by chance that he opens his next composition (i.e., Das Mädchen, op.95,1) with a Lied derived from completely different tectonic principles of configuration. . . . The whole piece is held together, in a very special way, by a constructive principle running through. The Lied as total variation!” Siegfried Kross’ point of view is further supported by the fact that Brahms worked at the time on his Fourth Symphony. As we know only today, with this symphony Brahms was the first one to define the boundaries of the twelve-tone technique. Arnold Schoenberg (born in Vienna 1874, died in Los Angeles 1951) always called and regarded Brahms his direct predecessor. We quote again Siegfried Kross: “The principle of the passacaglia (in the last movement of the Fourth Symphony) of a ‘Variation on No Theme,’ exactly corresponds on a grander scale with the one Brahms experimentally tried en miniature in the Lied op.95,1. . . .” For a layman, there are examples of Slavic influences on Brahms music better known than the above mentioned Lieder and choral works that today are seldom performed. Perhaps they can be sensed even in the Hungarian Dances that particularly contributed to Brahms’ popularity. However, in his Lieder composition such influences play a central role that should not be underestimated. [pageend152]152 KOSMAS The interest in the Slavic temperament and folk character that he had developed during his decades in Vienna must also be at the origin of the great understanding and close friendship that Brahms felt at the end of his life towards his much younger competitor, Antonin Dvořák, who was so strongly rooted in his own Slavic background. One may remember that it was Brahms who in 1877 recommended Dvořáks early compositions (Moravian Duets, Slavonic Dances) to be published by the Simrock Publishing Company. Earlier, as a member of the committee established in 1863 by the Austrian Ministry of Education to award subsidy grants to poor and talented artists, Brahms recommended Dvořák for such an award, even though he knew him only through the compositions submitted to the com- .mittee. Later, Brahms used one of his occasional trips to Prague to seek out Dvořák. He found the awardee in an extremely modest flat, consisting of one room and a kitchen, and learned that Dvořák had been a viola player in a Czech theater and currently was a poorly paid organist at St. Adalbert’s Church, and that he would have been starving had he not been awarded the state subsidy. Since then Brahms did his best on many levels to make Dvořák known and have his works, which he called his “best friends,” performed. When Simrock complained that Dvořák was an unreliable proofreader, Brahms himself, without hesitating, made the initial corrections of all Dvofák’s works in print, so that the latter only had to revise the almost perfect final galley proofs of his compositions. Oskar Nedbal, Czech composer (1874-1930), to whom we owe this communication, writes: “It was a pure example of greatness and modesty. In the whole history of music nothing similar can be found: A great, renowned composer, out of pure love of the created works, spares his younger colleague from the tiresome task of correcting the printing mistakes!” During the years when Dvořák was engaged in the United States, Brahms took over all the proofreading of the new compositions created on the other side of the Atlantic (Kalbeck III, 156). When Dvořák returned from the United States in 1895, Brahms made the proposition that the Dvořák family move from Prague to Vienna and offered the necessary financial support as he had done on other occasions in the past (Kalbeck IV, 427). However, in consideration for his children who spoke only Czech, Dvořák declined the generous offer and remained in Prague for the rest of his life. [pageend153]SLAVIC INFLUENCES OF JOHANNES BRAHMS 153 The long lasting and close artistic and personal relationship between the two composers is an important part of the circumscribed topic of this article, written to commemorate the ninetieth anniversary of Brahms’ death. Specifically, it points to the circumstances in which Johannes Brahms, the cool and introverted Northern German, was transformed into a mature cosmopolitan artist in the atmosphere of that multinational melting pot which then was Vienna. It would hardly be possible today, at the age of tightly closed and often impermeable frontiers between the countries and nations of Central and Eastern Europe.

[pageend154]JAN EVANGELISTA PURKYNĚ International Scientist and National Leader 1787—1869 Otakar J. Pollak During the last two decades of the 18th century life in Bohemia and Moravia underwent major changes. The religious persecution which had prevailed since the battle of White Mountain in 1620 declined. Its goal of re-Catholization of the Czechs had been achieved. By 1781, serfdom has been abolished and a measure of liberty promised to the peasants by the Emperor. In spite of these developments, however, political and cultural bondage had worsened for the Czechs. The Austrian government was bent on colonizing the Czech lands. The idea that an uneducated people can be more easily governed than an educated one led to systematic Germanization. As long as school attendance was not obligatory, many a Czech child stayed home rather than to be sent to a German school. And with the introduction of compulsory education, the Czech language was banned first from the classroom (1774-1779), then from the courtroom (1786). In 1791, Czech was declared a provincial language; Latin, the tongue of Rome; and German, the tongue of the monarchy. The Czech intelligentsia had German schooling and lived in the German cultural world. Thus, it had become estranged from the common people. Czech cultural life barely flickered. Protestations against oppression and Germanization were sporadic and timid. Yet, within the developing European cultural revolutionary movements, 155 [pageend155]156 KOSMAS Czech voices were heard. In August of 1819, at a conference called at Karlsbad—Karlovy Vary—by Metternich, the German and Austrian governments adopted “Resolutions to check the free expression of hostile opinions at all institutions of learning.” These said: “. . . Special representatives of the ruler shall strictly enforce existing laws and disciplinary regulations; observe the spirit shown by instructors in their public lectures and regular courses. . . . The confederate governments pledge to remove teachers who abuse their legitimate influence over youthful minds. ... or who propagate harmful doctrines hostile to public order or subversive of existing institutions. . . . These laws, directed against secret ad unauthorized societies, . . . apply especially to the General Student Union— Allegemeine Burschenschaft,—since its very conception implies the utterly impermissible plan of permanent fellowship and constant communication between universities. No student, once expelled, shall be admitted to any other university ...” Participation in national minority political activities became the prime reason for the expulsion of teachers and students. Repression was harsh. Academic life in Prague was under the cloud of these decrees. Yet a circle of patriots was already in existence and growing. In 1818, Jungmann, the brothers Presl and Berchthold, and then Čelakovský, Chmelenský, Marek, Palacký, Smetana, Sušil, Šafařík, and Šír embraced Purkyně, a newcomer to Prague. His enthusiasm and dedication added impetus to the young national movement. In 1820, Purkyně published his classic essay “On the importance of the mother tongue.” A year later, Jungmann, the Presls, and Purkyně established the first Czech scientific journal, “Krok” (Step), a cornerstone in the renaissance of Czech scientific life. Jan Evangelista Purkyně was born on December 17, 1787, in Libochovice in Bohemia. His father was supervisor of Count Die- trichstein’s estates at Libochovice, a small town not yet as germanized as larger communities. Thus, the eleven-year-old Jan had to study German to be admitted to the second grade of the Piarist gymnasium at Mikulov in Moravia. He already could read Latin. After he had learned German, he also learned Greek, Italian, French, and later, most Slavic languages. He entered the Piarist Order in 1804. But he left it three years later to study philosophy (1808-1811) and medicine (1812-1817) at the University of Prague. Although he had spent a decade in a German environment in Moravia (1798-1807), he read Czech poetry and prose. From 1808 through 1817, at the University, Purkyně attended lectures in German and in Latin. For three years (1811-1813) he tutored in the home of the German Baron von [pageend156]JAN EVANGELISTA PURKYNĚ 157 Hildprant at Blatná. After graduation from Medical School on December 8, 1818, he became Assistant Prosector at the German university. He held this post until the spring of 1823. Born a Czech— though living among Germans—he remained a Czech. Purkyně presented his doctoral thesis “On subjective vision” in 1818, and it was published a year later. It had a strong impact on the scientific world. However, his many attempts to obtain a teaching post failed, possibly because ha had joined a Masonic lodge. At last, with the influential recommendation of professor Rudolphi of Berlin, who later became his father-in-law, Purkyně was named professor at Breslau in Prussia, on April 10, 1823. Here, in the face of strong opposition, Purkyně founded the first physiologic institute in the world, introduced experimentation into the lecture hall, and wrote most of his 200 original essays in physiology, anatomy, histology, embryology, physics, chemistry, pharmacology and experimental toxicology. To this date, many cells and fibers, phenomena and apparatuses bear Purkyné’s name. In spite of his teaching schedule, extensive research and his duties during five terms as Dean of the University, Purkyně found time for numerous activities which earned him such epithets as “Slav consul” or “Slav cultural attaché.” (Perhaps’s such intense activities compensated for his personal tragedies: In 1832 he lost both daughters and his father-in-law, in 1833, he lost his mother, and then, in 1835, his wife.) As early as 1821, Purkyně had written that “every nation should rule itself”, further, that “all Slavic nations should have connections with Russia, the largest of them.” Though now a Prussian citizen, Purkyně created a Slavic Society in Breslau in 1836, surrounded himself with Slavic friends, spurred a Polish national movement, translated German plays and essays into Czech, and Czech literature into German. Purkyně searched for material from Comenius’ times: He found the manuscript of Comenius’ “Didactica magna” and donated it to the National Museum in Prague. In 1842, he recommended the Czech poet Čelakovský for the chair of Slavic literature at Breslau. In 1849, Prime Minister Bach transformed Austria into a police state with all the trappings—censorship, informers, harassment, and arrests of intellectuals. His Minister of Education, Count Leo Thun, although a German feudal conservative, was a Bohemophile. He was interested in upgrading the University of Prague. He recalled Čelakovský and he also wanted Purkyně back in Prague. Both men were eager to leave the Prussian environment, but Purkyně faced obstacles. In 1848, he attended the First Slavic Congress in Prague. That same [pageend157]158 KOSMAS year the University—at its 500 year celebration —conferred on Purkyně an honorary doctorate of philosophy. However, the Medical Faculty did not want him—the Czech—in their midst and fought his appointment. It was not until October 20, 1949, that the chair of physiology at Prague became his. Purkynč’s return to Prague, on April 9, 1850, at age 63 and after an absence of 27 years, contributed substantially to the cultural renewal of Czech life. All his efforts were guided by his idea that the blending of scientific and national work was imperative for building a morally and culturally strong nation—a nation justified in aspiring to political freedom. “Like Moses, who after many years of wandering, finally was able to reach his promised land, I was able to see again our beloved fatherland, to live and work with it and for it.” With these words, spoken in Czech—“our precious tongue”—did Purkyně begin his address at the dedication of the Physiologic Institute at Prague on October 6, 1851. He continued in German. But he had issued the first in a long series of “provocations” which resulted in constant police surveillance. Only his scientific fame and Count Thun’s friendship kept Purkyně out of jail. On Saturdays, he lectured in Czech; one of these lectures—on anthropology—was attended by 240 persons, of whom only 14 were regular students. Beginning in 1853, he gave his regular courses in physiology in German, then repeated them in Czech. In 1860, 13 patriots—Purkyně among them—dispatched a letter to the Emperor, protesting expulsions of Czechs from schools, seeking Czech representation in the Viennese Parliament, pleading for equal rights of Czech with German, and asking permission to publish a Czech political newspaper. Surprisingly, the last request was granted: thus, the first Czech daily, the “Národní Listy” (National Papers), was born, with Purkyně as one of its editors. In 1861, Purkyně as a member of the Czech Diet, protested the persecution of Czech newsmen. Purkynč’s patriotic activities covered a wide range: He was an instigator, promoter, officer, or benefactor of such varied endeavors as the first Czech women’s organization, the first Czech Technical School (whose magazine he edited), orphanages for boys, a workmens’ cooperative “Včela” (The Bee), the choral societies “Hlahol” (Fanfare) and “Svatobor” (Sacred Pines), the national gymnastic union “Sokol” (Falcon), the National Theatre, and “Matice lidu” (People’s Mother), which published inexpensive books. He advanced Czech scientific terminology and Czech shorthand. At the “Umělecká Be- [pageend158]JAN EVANGELISTA PURKYNĚ 159 seda” (Art Circle) he proposed a Scientific Section and at the National Museum he created a Natural Science Section with its own journal, “Živa” (Life), to which he contributed 30 essays between 1829 and 1862. In “Živa”, in 1861, Purkyně revealed his plans for a National Academy of Sciences. “The Roman Church, by enslaving society, handcuffed science and scientific institutions . . . The State assumed control over the universities. Science must break these bonds. . . . ” And later he added:“Perhaps with national life and with the evolution of self-government in our lands this Academy will some day arise ...” Purkyně tried for several years to establish a Czech medical journal “Domácí lékař” (Family Physician), as a supplement to “Živa.” Disappointed by the apathy of the germanized physicians, few of whom had command of their mother tongue, he voiced the hope that future generations would have more understanding and courage. Physicians who worked in governmental posts, including universities, were forbidden to engage in minority nationalist activities. Yet, here was Purkyně presiding from his professional chair over the Czech cultural awakening. Prior to March of 1848, the month of European uprisings, Czech students had demanded lectures in Czech—without success. In 1861, they refused to subscribe to the German-language “Mediziner Blatt” (Medical Student’s Paper) and requested a Czech journal. On October 1st of that year, five physicians—Eiselt, Frič, Grégr, Novotný, and Staněk—formed a Czech medical circle in Prague. Soon, its membership rose to 15. On the 28th of that month, petitions for a Czech medical journal were sent to the Royal Presidium, to the ViceRegency, and to the Police in Prague. There were 14 signatures. Purkyně. knowing that the signature of a Free Mason would seal the fate of the petition, did not sign. The request was granted on December 29th—by a letter written in Czech! The “Časopis lékařův českých” (Journal of Czech Physicians) is being published weekly to this day. A parallel petition, for permission to form a Czech medical society did not fare so well. However, when the press began to discuss the reasons for the refusal of the request, the Vice-Regency inquired at the Ministry in Vienna as to why the demand was not being granted. The working of the delayed answer permits us to credit Purkyně with the favorable outcome. It read—again in Czech: “On June 25, 1862, by the highest decision, the Emperor and King, his Apostolic [pageend159]160 KOSMAS Majesty Franz Josef, most graciously grants consent for a society of Czech physicians to be established by Jan Purkyně and other physicians. At the first meeting of the "Spolek českých lékařů” (Society of Czech Physicians), Purkyně was elected President for life. Within nine months the membership grew from 138 to 300. The biggest struggle—which did not end until fourteen years after Purkyné’s death—was for Czech professorships at Prague University. On July 14, 1862, Purkyně wrote: "His Majesty has granted the nationalities in his empire equal rights. The Czech language has already been introduced in the Law School, the Theological Faculty, and the Technical Institute. We are demanding our rights in the Philosophical and the Medical Faculties. Of the 300 medical students, 120 are Czechs. They demand lectures in Czech without which it will be difficult for them to complete their studies. The argument that the Czech language has not progressed sufficiently has no foundation. We now have a Czech terminology in physics, medicine, and in general natural sciences. This is adequate proof of the comphren- siveness of our language. I admit that we do not yet have Czech medical textbooks, but that can be remedied. ... we do not lack qualified teachers. A complete Czech University, besides the German University, would not be a detriment to science or to its programs. I therefore submit our modest and rightful demand to the judgement of the Collegium.” The proposal was rejected by a vote of 29 to 19. Stubbornly, Purkyně began to lecture exclusively in Czech. At his urging, the Society presented a new petition—with 264 signatures— on July 25, 1863. The answer from Vienna came on February 18, 1864: "The High Imperial Ministry is not, at present, in a position to grant your request for the establishment of Czech chairs in clinical and legal medicine.” Then, on October 7th, the Presidium of the Prague Vice-Regency addressed Purkyně: “The Imperial Ministry, by its edict No. 8727 of September 26, 1864 has consented to your petition that the lectures in Czech, on legal medicine, be given by professor Poppel, with a stipend of 300 gulden and 150 gulden for transportation.” This was a two-pronged insult: Poppel was not qualified to teach the subject, especially not in Czech, and the alloted moneys were inadequate. During this period, another Czech medical career had been in the ascendant. Karel (Carl) Rokitansky, born in Hradec Králové in Bohemia sixteen years after Purkyně, began his medical studies in Prague, but completed them in Vienna, where he continued to live. Thoroughly germanized and loyal to the Crown, his career blossomed. He became a full professor of anatomical pathology in 1844. He [pageend160]JAN EVANGELISTA PURKYNĚ 161 served as Dean, and in 1859 as Rector of the University of Vienna. He was President of the Medical Society in 1850 and President of the National Academy of Sciences in 1869. He became “Geheimrat” (Government Councillor) in 1852, “Hofrat” (Aulic Councillor) in 1862, and “Unterrichtsrat” (Councillor and Advisor to the Ministry of Education) in 1863, under the centralistic regime of Schmerling. His contributions in the field of pathology, which earned him many honorary degrees and decorations, are still recognized and quoted today. It would appear that Rokitansky, from his exalted post in the Ministry, with the responsibility for Medical School affairs in Austria, in 1863, could have favorably influenced the fate of the petitions from Prague. He didn’t. If letters were exchanged between him and Purkyně. they have not been found. But two essays by Rokitansky from 1863 are available, as are Purkynč’s reviews of these essays, published in the “Časopis lékařův českých” in 1863 and 1864. Rokitansky’s articles were an outgrowth of the repressive Karlsbad decrees of 1819. His first essay deals with medical schools, the second, with the need for uniformity of all Austrian universities. Rokitansky does not specifically mention the struggle for Czech professorships, but his negative reaction to the Czech demands is clear. He discusses the university, its position in the State, the structure of academic posts, discipline within the schools, the limits of freedom, the type of instruction, and the relation between the Professional Collegium and the College of Physicians. Rokitansky, a devoted loyalist, stood for centralization. Purkyně, speaking for all seven national minorities of Austria, advocated federalization. He wrote: “Once fully settled in the individual nationalities, there will be ample time to consider conformity of the universities.” Rokitansky’s idea was a university, which would produce efficient and obedient public servants—bureaucrats, not create independent thinkers—scientists. Purkyně believed in the exact opposite. Moreover, he argued that King and Emperor Charles IV had in 1348 established the Prague University for the Czechs. It is puzzling that Purkyně did not quote Pope Clemens IV’s bull of January 26, 1346, in which he had charged Charles IV to establish in his hereditary kingdom of Bohemia a central university for the Holy Roman Empire. The bull specifies the scope of the university, referring to "doctors, magisters and scholars”, and to the “privileges, liberties and immunities” granted to lecturers and students. It warns in great detail all those who would try to subvert the spirit of the bull. In his charter of April 7, 1348, Charles IV states: “libertates [pageend161]162 KOSMAS concessas sua bulla aurea confirmavit.” He extends these “privileges, liberties, and immunities” by making them applicable to doctors, magisters and students while traveling. In his supplementary diploma of January 24, 1349, the King reaffirms the spirit of the bull and the charter, thereby granting privileges to the servants of doctors, magisters and scholars, and sternly and gravely forbidding any obstruction of the rules. Rokitansky’s role in the fight for Czech rights has become the subject of debate by historians. Some think that the smallest gesture on his part in favor of Czech demands could have altered the course of events. This may be an oversimplification. It is true that Rokitansky believed sincerely in centralization and in the government in which he held a high post. He had, however, some powerful enemies, some of whom he shared with Purkynč. The influential editor of the official “Wiener medizinische Wochenschrift” (Viennese Medical Weekly) Wittelshofer wrote various editorials attacking Rokitansky and Purkynč—though for different reasons. Rokitansky never denied his Czech origin. He visited Bohemia during summer vacations, spoke Czech with Czech visitors in his ministerial office, and bade them good-bye with a kiss and an embrace. Privately, he may have been sympathetic to the Czech cause. When Purkyně was elected to the Viennese Academy, Rokitansky, then its President, welcomed him in Czech—in spite of their recent dispute. Years later when professor Eiselt of Prague visited Rokitansky and Jireček, the Minister of Education in Hohenwart’s liberal cabinet, in order to thank them for their role in the creation of the Czech Medical School, he learned that Rokitansky, who at first opposed it, eagerly agreed to it once it was favored by the Minister. The rejected petition of 1862 and the one of 1863, which had received token approval, were not the last. New and pressing resolutions. demanding equal rights at Prague University, were addressed to the Ministry in 1865 and again in 1867. Now, for the first time, the Ministry sought the opinion of the University Senate and the Medical Society. By secret ballot, on June 8, 1867, the Senate rejected the request. Addressing the Prague Medical Faculty later that month, Purkynč said: "The objections that the introduction of Czech would disturb the ideals of the University, that Czech is not a world language, that there is no space for duplication of collections are to be rejected as sophisms and as an attempt to erase the Czech nation. Science is cosmopolitan, the property of all mankind. All nations have an equal right to it. From time immemorial our nation has admirably cultivated the field of the sciences, and for that reason it [pageend162]JAN EVANGELISTA PURKYNĚ 163 cannot be denied its rights at the University. ...” By the time of the next petition, October 8, 1868, the aging and ailing Purkynč’s signature was barely legible. Among the 44 courses listed in the Medical Schoofs catalogue for 1868-1869, three were in Czech— those by Eiselt, Purkyně, and Quadrant. By that time, the failing Purkynč’s lectures had to be given by his assistant, Novotný. Ever since his return to Prague, in 1850, Purkyně devoted more time to national affairs and less to research and teaching. From 1862 on, there were mounting complaints to the Ministry about his activities. In late 1864 Rokitansky decided that Purkyně should retire. He called on Jan Bohumil Eiselt, one of Purkynč’s trusted friends, to break the news. On January 30, 1865, Purkyně admitted in a latter to Rokitansky that the time had come for him to retire, but he wanted a say in the matter of his successor. He favored Tomsa over Czernak, Gregr, Fritach, and Novotný, who were considered for the post. “Il has been my most sincere wish to be succeeded by someone who would not be solely interested in science, but also in our country, and I say openly, in our people; that is a necessity of life, of our whole future.” Unable to resolve the impasse, Purkyně remained in his post. On February 8, 1867 Rokitansky suggested a compromise—the establishment of a second chair in physiology, Purkyně agreed. The second chair went to Maximilian H. Vintsch- gan, who had lost his post at Padua after the defeat of Austria by Prussia and Italy. To fully appreciate the long and arduous struggles for a Czech Medical Society, a Czech medical journal, for equalization of language at Prague University, and for Czech professorships, one must understand that these struggles took place during the darkest, most reactionary period in Austrian history. After the fall of Bach’s regime in 1859, hope for some measure of freedom for the national minorities briefly revived. Bach’s successor, Rechberg- Goluschowski, was a federalist. His “October Diploma” (October 20, 1860) “regulated conditions in the empire, by which the present absolutistic government would be changed into a constitutional form on the historic basis of individual kingdoms and territories.” But only four months later, the succeeding neo-centralist regime under Schmerling wrote the notorious “February Patent,” which frustrated the hopes and aspirations of the minorities. The final blow came in 1867, when by the “Ausgleich” (Compromise), the “Empire and Kingdom of Austria and Hungary” was created, and the Emperor made a formal commitment never to award an autonomous status to the Kingdom of Bohemia or any other Austrian province. Purkyně did not give up [pageend163]164 KOSMAS his fight. At age 80, he wrote in his longest political essay “Austria polyglotta”: “One could hardly find a nation which has proven its individuality as clearly as has the Czech nationfrom its entry into the Bohemian basin until present time.” Purkynč’s two most fervent dreams—of a Czech National Academy of Science and a Czech Medical School—did not materialize until after his death. However, no one has any doubts that the many institutions Purkyně created or helped to create enhanced the development of Czech medicine, Czech science in general, and Czech cultural life. Purkyně died on July 28,1869, at age 82. He left two eternal legacies: one to the world as a renowned international scientist, and another to his fatherland—as a venerated national leader.

Pollak A tribute to Jan Evangelista Purkyně, a worldwide renowned scientist and Czech patriot, at a Congress of Pathologists held in Prague, is most appropriate. December 17th, 1987, marked 200 years since his birth. Every pathologist is familiar with Purkyně cells in the cerebellum and with Purkyně fibers in the heart. Not many know about his additional contributions to histology and many other sciences. Few outside his homeland know about his varied cultural, social and political efforts on behalf of his nation. Within the framework of this essay, we can point only to a few fragments of his rich life and his many works, especially those relating to pathology, and most particularly to morphology. First, we have to explain the two ways of spelling his name. In Bohemia, he used the correct spelling—“Purkyně.” He is much better known by the German spelling “Purkynje,” which he used in most publications. It must be remembered that he spent many years in a German environment and also that during his lifetime the Czech lands were part of the Austrian Empire, of which German was the official language. Purkyně was raised in Libochovice, a tiny town some 50 km north-east of Prague, where his father was an official at Count Dietrichsteins estate. After grade school he was admitted to a Piarist high school, a “gymnasium,” in Mikulov, Moravia. Upon graduation, 169 [pageend169]170 KOSMAS he spent three years teaching in the Piarist Order. He became proficient in Czech, German, Latin, Greek, Italian, French and in most of the Slavic languages. He left the Order and went to Prague to study philosophy and later medicine at the university. He earned his medical degree in 1818. His doctoral thesis “On subjective vision” soon became known throughout the scientific world. It even attracted the attention of the German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Purkynč’s first post was that of an Assistant to the Institute of Anatomy at the university in Prague. There, he worked as prosector for over four years. He tried persistently for a professorship—in anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, pathology—applying to several Austrian universities. All his attempts failed, apparently because he had become a freemason. At last, by chance, on the recommendation of professor Rudolphi of Berlin, he was named professor of “physiology and pathology” at the Prussian university of Breslau—now, the Polish city of Wroclaw. He taught pathology within the framework of physiology. The 17 years Purkyně spent in Breslau were his most productive ones. Here, he founded the world’s first Physiological Institute, in 1839. from his post, he published most of his original essays—some 200—in physiology, anatomy, histology, embryology, physics, chemistry, pharmacology and experimental toxicology. In 1823, at his habilitation, Purkyně reported on his further observations in ophthalmology and on his studies of the architecture of the skin. By discovering the ducts of sweat glands, he corrected the old belief that sweat is filtered through the skin. He described 9 basic patterns of grooves and ridges on the fingertips, thus laying the foundation of a new science, dactyloscopy. Purkynč’s first histological study concerned the prenatal evolution of the hen’s egg, in 1825. Using a simple magnifying lens, he noticed that the egg yolk contained a structure which he called “vesicula germinalis,” declaring it to be a primary, basic part of the ovum. In fact, he had discovered the nucleus of the egg cell. The year 1832 marked Purkynč’s main contribution in the field of histology. Utilizing the latest microscope, a sophisticated achromatic device invented by the Viennese optician Plossl, which allowed for a 1000-fold magnification, Purkyně devoted much of his time to microscopy. He became the founder of modern histology. His name became an eponym to the giant cells in the cerebellum and to specific cardiac fibers. While studying the brain, the cerebellum and the spinal cord, Purkyně observed several types of large cells throughout the central [pageend170]REMEMBERING J. E. PURKYNĚ 171 nervous system, calling them ganglion cells. (It is fascinating to compare Purkynč’s skilled, detailed drawing of these cells with photomicrographs of slides prepared by modern histological techniques.) Purkyně also discovered the axial cylinders of nerves, thus correcting the prevailing concept that they are hollow tubes. In 1839, Purkyně published a paper in a regional Polish journal on the nerve supply of various organs. He described how the heart of a sheep contained fibers beneath the ventricular endocardium, visible to the unaided eye. He concluded correctly that this system of fibers was of muscular origin. He failed to demonstrate the existence of such fibers in the human heart, although he searched for them till his dying day. Lacking evidence of a physiologic function for these fibers, he ascribed to them a mechanical function, that of strengthening the ventricular lining. It took until 1906 for the Japanese pathologist Tawara to include Purkyně fibers in the conductive system of the heart. It is not surprising that Purkyně thought, at first, that these fibers could have cartilaginous origin. In another publication, dating back to 1835, Purkyně and his associate, Valentin, revealed that the ciliary movement is an universal phenomenon. They were the first to observe it in higher animal species. At the Congress of German Natural Scientists, held in Prague in September 1837, exactly 150 years ago, Purkyně lectured on the structure of gastric glands and on digestion. His ideas provided the background for Schwann’s cellular theory. Purkyně demonstrated that the organs of plants and the organs of animals have an analogous structure, that both are composed of basic units, with nuclei and protoplasm. He coined the term “protoplasm.” Curiously, he called the units “cells” in the flora, but used the term “granules” for the fauna. Many of Purkynč’s original ideas and discoveries were presented in doctoral theses written by his pupils. Most of them deal with the microscopic structure of various organs and tissues—the skin, bones, teeth, cartilage, blood vessels, heart, uterus, and nervous system. These were important contributions to histology. Until 1839 Purkyně worked with his staff in his home; thereafter, he worked at the Physiological Institute, the first in the world. One part of it was the Histological Institute which the renown histologist Heidenheim referred to as the “cradle of histology,” in 1888. Somehow, as if “on the fringes” of these manifold topics, Purkyně managed to develop many histological techniques which earned him [pageend171]172 KOSMAS the appellation of “founder of histology.” The roster of his original contributions to histological methodology seems incredible: • He was the first to use various fixatives for tissues besides formaldehyde and the first to evaluate the usefulness of mercury bichloride, acetic acid and alcohol. • He introduced the practice of examining serial sections. The first modern microtome was constructed in his laboratory. • He used new dyes for staining tissue sections, such as indigo and mixtures of iodine and chromium. • He originated intravital staining. • He pioneered the examination of hard tissues, first by using a file to prepare think polished slides of bone, and later, by viewing sections of bone that had first been decalcified in acids. • He was the first to subject microscopic preparations to artificial fermentative digestion. • He introduced photomicrography and slide projection. • He was the first to use Canadian balsam and cover slips in the preparation of tissue sections for microscopy. Let us quote a few of Purkynč’s ideas on microscopy. He contributed these in 1844 to a text, the “Handbuch der Physiologie” by Rudolph Wagner. “Microscopists who have light brown or greenish eyes have an advantage over those with a black, gray or blue iris since the latter tire more easily. Moderate near-sightedness is also advantageous.” About microscopy, in general, he says that “seeing does not suffice; it is necessary to learn how to look, how to observe, how to construct a subjective opinion, not one based on a single sense, on seeing, but rather on all available senses, on one’s total intellectual capacity, on the complete human being with all his or her qualities, good and bad.” “Furthermore, it is essential for the microscopist to be free of all sophisticated bias.” And he adds: “Scientific research requires tranquility. There may come that unhappy day on which one’s sight becomes impaired. At such time, it is best to stop working, especially if one is disturbed by unrelated events.” (End of quotes.) We all are only too familiar with such situations and thus can readily concur with Purkynč’s opinions. In 1850, after an absence of 27 years, Purkyně returned to Prague as professor of physiology. His second period in Prague is chiefly characterized by his activities as a Czech national leader. He founded a Physiological Institute. At its dedication, Purkyně started his address in Czech. He founded and edited the first Czech Natural [pageend172]REMEMBERING J. E. PURKYNĚ 173 Science Journal. The year 1862 saw—after a protracted and emotional struggle with the authorities—the creation of the Czech Medical Society. Purkyně, one of its founders, became its first president, a post he held until his death. He also founded the first Czech Medical Journal, which has been published weekly ever since and is still being published today. Purkyně was active in numerous cultural, educational and social organizations and institutions—the gymnastic union, a workmen’s cooperative, a women’s organization, a boys’ orphanage, an artists’ circle, choral societies, the first Czech Technical School, the National Theatre, a Natural Science Section at the National Museum. He was elected to the Czech Senate. One of his ambitions was to establish a Czech scientific terminology, supplementing or replacing the German and Latin text in use at the time. His final goals were to create a Czech National Academy of Science and a Czech Medical School. These dreams came to fruition only years after Purkynč’s death. One of the most interesting chapters is Purkyné’s relation with another famous scientist of Czech origin. Karel (Carl, or Charles) Rokitansky was born in Hradec Králové’, some seventy miles east of Prague. He was 17 years younger than Purkyně. In the years 1821 to 1823, Rokitansky was one of the medical students Purkyně instructed in anatomy in Prague. A year after Purkyně left for Breslau, Rokitansky moved to Vienna where he completed his medical studies. There he achieved unusual success as professor of pathology, as dean of the medical school, as rector of the university and lastly, as ministerial councilor. In this capacity and as the Emperor’s loyal servant, he introduced in 1863 a reform of medical education in Austria, advocating its centralization. Purkyně criticized the plan in two articles published in the Czech Medical Journal, advocating the creation of national, federal universities, as a move leading to a solution of national language problems within the Austrian monarchy. In support of his views, Purkyně, at age 80, wrote a long political essay, “Austria Polyglotta.” Public disagreement did not diminish Rokitansky’s admiration of Purkyně. At Purkynč’s induction into the Viennese Academy, Rokitansky, its president, welcomed the candidate in Czech. He also persuaded the Emperor to bestow on Purkyně the Order of Leopold, the highest decoration awarded to a scientist, making him a nobleman. Purkyně had returned to Prague at the age of 63, in good health, able to continue teaching and to pursue many other challenging activities . The death of his younger son, Karel, a well known Czech [pageend173]174 KOSMAS painter, in spring of 1868, came as a severe blow. From then on, Purkynč’s health began to fail, and he had to spend much time at home, away from the university. In mid-June of the following year Purkyně experienced episodes of fever, with symptoms of bloody urine and increasing urgency; he developed decubiti, and finally, uremic convulsions and loss of consciousness. He died on the 28th ot July, 1869, at 81 and a half years of age. The common folk called him a "national patriarch,” the Viennese and the Prague police referred to him as “an incorrigible old man.” The necropsy, restricted to the torso, was performed by the leading professor of pathology at Prague university, a Czech patriot, Václav (Wenceslaus) Trietz. Among the latter’s legacies are the ligamentum Suspensorium duodeni Treitzi, Treitz’ retroperitoneal hernia and Treitz’ uremic colitis. The autopsy findings on Purkyně were prostatic enlargement, urinary bladder hypertrophy with diverticula and with two almond-size calculi, distention of the ureters and renal pelves, and left-sided serofibrinous pleurisy. The funeral cortege originated from Purkynč’s home, which at one time, had housed the Prague Physiological Institute. The procession turned into a powerful national demonstration. Interment took place at the Vyšehrad cemetery, the resting place of the most illustrious sons of the nation. The tombstone inscription reads: “For as long as and wherever God preserves life, be faithful to your homeland, to your faith, and to your friends.” Concluding our tribute to Purkyně, we can state that the Czech nation values the legacy of its heroic son and that Purkyně remains forever a model scientist and patriot. [pageend174]BOOK REVIEWS Erich Kulka: Escape from Auschwitz, South Hadley Publishers, 1986, pp. 151 Hundreds of prisoners tried to escape from the Auschwitz- Oswiecim death camp. Some were tempted by attractive offers from corrupt SS members. Practically all were caught, tortured and killed. This story is a historical account of the only known escape in which the Jews survived, while the SS accomplice perished. Erich Kulka, the author, differs from the vast number of academic historians of the Holocaust because “he was there and survived.” His works therefore have a rare authoritative ring of personal testimony. In writing Winds of War and War and Remembrance, the best selling novels of the Hitler period, Herman Wouk consulted Kulka for accuracy. This book tells the incredible story of how Siegfried Lederer—a Czechoslovak Jew—escaped from the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp in company of a disgruntled SS officer. Kulka, who was a fellow inmate of Lederer in Auschwitz, learned about the escape only ten years later, during a chance meeting in Prague. Lederer’s story “seemed too fantastic.” During the next two years Kulka therefore visited places connected with the escape and interviewed people who had provided refuge and help to Lederer and his SS accomplice. Survivors from both the Theresienstadt ghetto and Birkenau certified most parts of Lederer’s story. Kulka consequently decided to write this historical novel about how a Jew desperately 175 [pageend175]176 KOSMAS tried “to warn the world ... (in order to) save the lives of the doomed.” In 1966 Kulka’s Czech version of An Escape from the Death Camp was published in Prague (Útěk z tábora smrti). Two years later, the day the Russians invaded Czechoslovakia, Kulka escaped from Prague and eventually settled in Israel. There he was able to prepare the updated English version of this courageous and tragic escape, unique in the history of the Holocaust. The notorious Dr. Josef Mengele did his medical experiments in Auschwitz. Kulka described what Mengele did “under auspices of the Frankfurt on Main headquartered Research Institute for Hereditary Biology and Racial Care.” Here is how the testing of the deadly Zyklon gas, used in the death chambers was done: “Through the airtight peephole in the door ( . . . Mengele) attentively followed his victims’ final struggle for life. The commander . . . Johann Schwarzhuber, stood next to him (Mengele) with a stopwatch in his hand. As soon as Mengele lifted his head from the peephole. Schwarzhuber clicked the watch and declared, ‘Twelve minutes, eight seconds!’ “Mengele turned the pages of his notebook; on the page marked ‘Sonderbehandlung, 8 March 1944,’ he marked the time given by Schwarzhuber. Then he said casually, as if he were timing a swimming contest, ‘It took two minutes more than it should. The pharmacist Capesius used a tin with less Zyklon than he should have. The children . . . resist longer than the adults.’ Schwarzhuber then turned to a group of prisoners standing behind the cordon of the armed guards and ordered, ‘Sonderkommando to work! Switch on ventilators!’ "In Auschwitz-Birkenau’s 4 extermination complexes were equipped with 45 furnaces and 8 gas chambers . . . (For) the secret Gas War . . . the Nazis had a name of their own. In their secret papers, they called them (these procedures) Sonderbehandlung (special treatment). "A secret organization of prisoners had been sending information abroad about the meaning of this term. Nevertheless, people in New- York. London, and Paris could not imagine what was really happening when they read. ‘Thousands of people are being destroyed in the extermination camps in the East.’ For two years, the secret couriers had carried this information to and fro. There was not a single sign of any reaction (among the Allied nations). Nothing was done, no measures were taken against these crimes.” After his escape from Auschwitz, Lederer informed the Red Cross in Switzerland as well as the remaining inmates of the Theresienstadt (Terezin) concentration camp. The world at large did not believe the [pageend176]BOOK REVIEWS 177 story which was confirmed only when the Allies reached the death camps in May 1945. By then it was too late to do anything about it. Upon the liberation of Czechoslovakia, Lederer was honored and decorated for his bravery. He married and returned to his prewar job in a leading textile firm in Prague. In the wake of the anti- Semitic 1951-53 Slánský trials, Lederer was demoted to salesman. Frustrated and exhausted by the vain fight for his and his friends’ rehabilitation, Lederer withdrew from all public activities. With his wife and son he survived in Spořilov, a suburb of Prague. Lederer died on April 5, 1972 at age 68, exactly 28 years after his dramatic escape from Auschwitz. “Not a single notice appeared in the Czech media.” On February 7, 1979, Wolfgang Gerhard (ex-Dr. Mengele) drowned in Brazil; he was quietly buried in Sao Paulo. When, on June 6, 1985 the grave was opened, and forensic experts verified that it indeed were the remains of Dr. Mengele. Mass media reported that news world-wide. In the foreword to the book, Herman Wouk praises Kulka for “not essaying the darkly poetic pictures of an Eli Wiesel, or the lighthearted suspense of a thriller writer. His aim remains historical accuracy and reality.” Because the records and the people connected with this escape adventure perished or vanished. Kulka had to use creative imagination to bridge the information gaps. He did it without departing from his central lifelong purpose: to bear true witness.“ I am the only survivor of my family, which perished in Auschwitz in late 1944. Lederer’s gruesome story sounds unbelievable to my children who consider these events a matter of an unrepeatable past. I have to continuously remind them that this type of cruelty was not the monopoly of the Nazis. Holocausts continue to happen: Vietnam. Kampuchea. Argentina ... If we want to make sure that these nightmares “never again” occur, we have to listen to the witnesses of the Holocaust history. This is why Kulka’s Escape from Auschwitz deserves to be widely read, especially by our children and grandchildren. Frank Meissner Bethesda, Maryland U.S. Legislators with Czechoslovak Roots, From Colonial Times to Present with Genealogical Lineages. Compiled by Miloslav Rechcigl. Jr. Washington D.C.: The SVU Press, 1987, vii + 65 pp. [pageend177]178 KOSMAS Miloslav Rechcigl, Jr. is affiliated with the Agency for International Development. As an American born in Czechoslovakia, he devotes most of his free time to the cause of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences in America (SVU) and to the documentation of Czechoslovak ethnic history in America. He had previously edited the proceedings of one of the SVU congresses, entitled Czechoslovak Contributions to World Culture (1964) and compiled Educators with Czechoslovak Roots (1980). The present volume deals with United States senators and members of the House of Representatives who served since the Declaration of Independence and were either born in Czechoslovakia or of Czech or Slovak descent (most of them belong to the former category). Their total number is 45, of whom 15 were senators; some individuals served both as senators and representatives. Only one was a woman. In addition, there are 16 listings of legislators whose wives were of Czechoslovak descent. A dozen of these legislators were members of the Congress in 1987. It has to be noted that the term “Czechoslovak” is used throughout the book in the geographical sense, i.e., referring also to times before the actual creation of the Czechoslovak state in 1918. The sources for this genealogical monograph are the Biographical Directory of the American Congress, 1774-1971 and the Congressional Directories, supplemented by the Dictionary of American Biography, all highly respectable sources. Among the people listed are also diplomats. Secretaries of State, judges, governors and generals. Several were alumni of Yale, Princeton, Harvard or the University of Chicago. They represented Federalists, Whigs, Democrats, and Republicans. They came from all the corners of the United States, including the Confederacy. For an historian of the United States, there are a number of surprises, namely finding the names of some well known Revolutionary patriots or their kin on this list. The best known of these is John Jay, who is included as the spouse of a wife of Czech origin. Sarah Livingston Jay, according to this genealogical survey, was the descendant of the Viscount Felyps of Bohemia. Sarah Jay accompanied her husband on his frustrating mission to Spain during the American Revolution and suffered with him the humiliations, as he was left to cool his heels without Spanish recognition of the United States, and the mockery of some Spanish dons who claimed that all John Jay could keep repeating was: “Spain, recognize the United States; Spain, extend us a loan!” It was Sarah Jay who commiserated with her husband later on, when after the conclusion of the Jay [pageend178]BOOK REVIEWS 179 Treaty the wrath of the populace found one expression in scribbling on a fence: “Damn John Jay!” Damn every one that won’t damn John Jay!! damn every one that won’t put lights in his windows and sit up all night damning John Jay!!! Such and similar stories are, of course, not part of this genealogy, but they come to mind almost instinctively upon the noting of his name. Another fascinating entry is that of Edmund J. Randolph of Virginia, one of 21 direct descendants of Augustine Herman, who must have been one of the most prolific progenitors of later-day Czechs in America. Herman was an early settler, who came to the New World in 1633, owned a home in the then New Amsterdam (later New York), and was engaged in the tobacco trade. But his claim to fame, aside from siring the many ancestors of 21 legislators, was the settlement of a border dispute between the Dutch in New York and the English in Maryland and the resulting first map of Maryland and Virginia (now in the British Museum), for which Herman received a 20,000 acre land grant; parts of this is the still existing Bohemia Manor in Maryland. So we now know that the Randolphs of Virginia were descendants, at least in part, of the Czech Herman, who arrived in America just 13 years after the Mayflower and twice as many years after the Sarah Constant, Godspeed and Discovery. This particular Randolph (1753-1813) was a delegate to the second Continental Congress and to the Constitutional Convention, and in between governor of his state. It was his relative John Randolph of Roanoke who, as a good Jeffersonian, after the ratification of the Jay Treaty raised his glass to a toast: “Damn George Washington!” There must be dozens of other fascinating connections between the men listed in this book and the heroes of American history. Rechcigl laid the groundwork for several possible monographs for those whose predilection is ethnic history. He did painstaking research, and the result is an honest piece of source material for historians who would choose to utilize his groundbreaking labors. The more the pity that careless proofreading resulted in frequent typographical errors (e.g. the constant misspelling of Great Britain). But such mechanical blemishes can be overlooked in view of the significance of this original contribution to the roster of historical ethnic monographs which are of growing interest to the specialists subscribing to the pluralistic interpretation of American history. Vera Láska Regis College Weston, Massachusetts [pageend179]180 KOSMAS Czechoslovakia. Compiled by David Short. Denver Clio Press, Colorado, 1986. xxv + 409pp. (The World Bibliographical Series Vol. 68). More than twenty years have elapsed since the issuance of the last two bibliographies relating to Czechoslovakia, i.e., Rudolf Sturm’s Czechoslovakia: A Bibliographic Guide (Washington, D.C.: Library of Congress, 1967) and the reviewer’s “Czechoslovakia and its Arts and Sciences: A Selected Bibliography in the Western European Languages,” published as a part (pp. 555-634) of The Czechoslovak Contribution to World Culture (The Hague: Mouton, 1964.) There has been an urgent need to fill this gap. The publication under review substantially meets this objective. The compiler, David Short, a philologist associated with the University of London’s School of Slavonic and East European Studies, took advantage of his several visits to Czechoslovakia to explore their libraries and get acquainted with that country’s literary production. As a result of his first-hand knowledge, the compiler was able to incorporate in his bibliography a good number of the published Czechoslovak materials which otherwise might have been missed. It is a selective annotated bibliography, comprised of one thousand entries, mostly books, although more important articles and book chapters are also included. The listed publications are written mostly in English; however, here and there, some French and German, as well as Czech and Slovak, titles also appear. It is a handy, attractive, pocket-size volume with extensive index of titles, names and subjects. The bibliography is definitely dated, since it covers predominately publications of the last twenty years. The earlier issued publications are exceptionally referred to if no comparable more current books or articles exist. The compilation is organized by subject into some forty sections, including such headings as the country and its people, geography, travellers’ accounts, tourism and travel guides, flora and fauna, prehistory and archeology, history, nationalities and minorities, extraterritorial population, folklore, folk art and customs, religion and theology, society, population,health and welfare, education, statistics, politics, opposition and dissent, foreign relations and contacts, law and constitution, government, economy, banking and finance etc. With a few exceptions, on the whole, the selection was done with care, objectivity and sensitivity. The best selections are in the humanities and social science areas, reflecting the compiler’s back[pageend180]BOOK REVIEWS 181 ground and interest. The science and other applied topics are somewhat weaker, and would have benefitted if the compiler consulted with particular experts in the respective fields. The extraterritorial population section is not as representative and not entirely up-to-date, lacking such important publications as Guido Kisch’s In Search of Freedom: A History of American Jews from Czechoslovakia, 1740-1945 (E. Goldston, 1949), Joseph Chada’s The Czechs in the United States (The SVU Press, 1981), Vera Láska’s The Czechs in America 1633-1977). A Chronology and Fact Book (Oceana Publications, 1978), Clinton Machann’s and James W. Mendl’s Krásná Amerika. A Study of the Texas Czechs 1851-1939 (Eakin, Press, 1983), František Bielik’s Slováci vo svete (Matica slovenská, 1980), Michael Cigler’s The Czechs in Australia (AE Press, 1983) and Josef Polišenský’s Začiatky českej a slovenskej emigrácie do USA (Slovenská akadémia vied, 1970). The sections on bibliographies and on encyclopedias, and directories are also somewhat wanting. These sections would have clearly benefitted from the inclusion of the older literature. I cannot imagine that any serious student of Czechoslovak culture could get by without such standard and classical sources as Ottüv slovník naučný (J. Otto, 1930-199; 28 vols.), Slovenský náučný slovník (Litevna, 1932; 3 vols.), or Československá vlastiveda (Sfinx, 1929-1936; 10 vols.). With respect to bibliographies, the compiler should have consulted the SVU Congress publication, prepared by the present writer, Czechoslovakia Past and Present (Mouton, 1968) which contains an exhaustive listing of bibliographies in different languages (Vol. 2, pp. 1639-1801). Moreover, a comment on the selection and characterization of some of the sources is in order. Having used, on and off, many of these sources I have found some of them not entirely reliable, incomplete and out of date, including Wynar’s Slavic Ethnic Libraries, Museums and Archives in the United States (Kent State University, 1980), Miller’s A Comprehensive Bibliography for the Study of Ethnic Minorities (New York University Press, 1976) and Brye’s European Immigration and Ethnicity in the United States and Canada: A Historical Bibliography (ABC-Clio, 1983). Also the characterization of the Slovak Bibliography Abroad, which is otherwise meritorious, as “providing a near complete bibliography ... by or about the Slovaks ...” is an overstatement, to be sure. The SVU publications have generally received good coverage. It is noteworthy that the two SVU Congress Proceedings, The Czechoslovak Contribution to World Culture (Mouton, 1964) and Czechoslovakia Past and Present (Mouton, 1968, 2 vols.) and the selected [pageend181]182 KOSMAS individual papers in these volumes, are referred to in forty separate entries, amounting to l/25th of the total coverage. In this connection, I must take exception, however, to David Short’s stereotypic characterization of the Czechs, when he states “there is something of a tradition, attached to this kind of publication, ascribed by some to the need to counteract the national inferiority complex, the 'malý český človek' syndrome, made much of by some Czechs.” This unmistakably derogatory and sarcastic expression must have its origins in feudal times, reflecting a humble (peasant) background of the population and the then held attitudes by and towards the ruling foreign aristocracy. Later on, the term acquired somewhat broader meaning and was used when poking fun of some individual’s parochial or provincial thinking. In any case, to characterize Czechs in this way is unacceptable and unfit for use in scholarly publications. Furthermore, the argument that the referenced books were the result of the presumed “inferiority complex” is equally fallacious unless an intended bias or the “delusion of grandeur” by the authors can be demonstrated. Otherwise one could similarly dismiss any publication concerned with the cultural contributions of any nation, including Winston Churchill’s writings. Or elsewhere, when describing Kosmas, David Short claims that its content “tends to represent the interests of the mid-century generation of exiles and the political aspect is accordingly less virulent than in some of the more recent emigre journals”; or Proměny, which according to him“ carries a variety of political commentaries and articles of wide cultural interest. It does not aspire to being overscholarly . . . ”; or his reference to the SVU as the “émigré or expatriate academy”; all these comments miss the point completely, and show the compiler’s unfamiliarity with the SVU publications, as well as the SVU purposes and its by-laws. I do not wish to end on a negative note. Whatever critical comments have been made, these were made in a constructive vein, in the eventuality that the compiler intends to up-date his bibliography or issue a sequel to it at a later date. Generally speaking, it is a relatively good bibliography of recent publications relating to Czechoslovakia, which, for most purposes, will serve the general reader well. For more serious scholarship I recommend, however, that it be used in conjunction with the earlier bibliographies, referenced above, together with Paul Horecký’s East Central Europe.
