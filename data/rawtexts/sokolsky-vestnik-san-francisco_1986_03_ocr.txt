SOKOLSKY VĚSTNÍK Bulletin of Gymnastic Association Sokol San Francisco 847 North San Mateo Drive San Mateo, CA 94401 Sokol Hall: 415-347-2033 Ročník - Volume XX JULY - AUGUST, 1986 Číslo - Issue 2 "THEY" You've heard of "they" haven't you? BUT, you've probably never met a "they". You know "THEY" - the people who complain about one thing or another. "They" are the unknown. "They" send their message through someone else, while "they" remain nameless. "They"are the invisibles who come to every meeting."They" are the folks who should make an appearance and present themselves and their ideas and/or complaints. Personally, I find it difficult to cope with all the "theys" in the world. It's impossible to communicate with someone who is never there. "THEYS" - come forward and express yourselves. We are open to constructive criticism and new ideas! The Editor See related article [pageend1]SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO JULY - AUGUST, 1986 SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO June 10, 1986 The meeting was catted to order by Sister Helen Murphy with the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag. A moment of silence in memory of Br. Cesak and former member Sister Saiz was observed. Roll call of officers indicated that alt were present except Vice President Br. Jeremcuk. Minutes of the May meeting were read and approved as read. Membership Chairman, Sister Bele nominated Jaroslava Prossr and Jaroslav Vrana for membership in our Unit. Their memberships were approved by the Unit and Sister Murphy performed the swearing in ceremonies. There was no correspondence. Treasurer Sister Vrana reported that books are all up-to-date, and submitted copies of the report for members to study. Committee Reports: Educational Chairman, Sister Meier reported that ASO had forwarded some puzzles and information about the National anthems. She made copies and distributed to members. She also reported that copies were distributed to the gym classes. Sister Meier also reported that the Vestnik had gone out, and that there would be another Summer issue. Membership Chairman, Sister Bele reported that membership dues were coming in very slowly. Building Committee, Br. Kolar reported that the sewer had been repaired. New lights were installed downstairs, and other minor repairs accomplished. He submitted a bill for $44 for bar expense at the last dance. Sister Walker gave a short report on the Zupa meeting. Told about the Family Camp at Dinkey Creek, and said the gymnastic exhibition was a success. The next Zupa meeting would be in November, probably at Fresno. Though they discussed having the Annual Zupa meeting after the Unit annual meetings, they did not recommend a change. Sister Murphy explained that Sister Bursik would like to form a dance group to practice at Sokol Hall rent free. A motion was made by Bess Walker that such a group be allowed to use the hall with the understanding that they were to represent our Sokol Unit, and would perform at our programs if requested to do so. Sister Vrana seconded the motion. Motion carried. Sister Murphy would like to hold a special meeting of Sokol members to discuss several items regarding our Unit and its future. Since it could be a long meeting, lasting three or four hours, it was suggested that we start early and break for lunch. Saturday, August 2 at 10 am was set aside for this purpose. All members are urged to attend. There is no General Meeting in July. The Turners insurance coverage is due on Wednesday, June 12, and Sister Murphy will contact them about renewal which will include a clause that "holds Sokol harmless" —rr [pageend2]SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO JULY - AUGUST, 1986 PAGE -3- Sokol San Francisco Minutes Page -2- June 10, 1986 Sister Vrana read the income and expenses for the month of May, 1986.

Sister Blanche Duffey reported that three of our gymnasts were participating in the Slet in Zurich. She also reported that we discussed sending Sister Sylvia Pros sr to the Sokol Kurz, but that no official motion had been made.

At the last Sokol meeting, there were some remarks from "theys" that there are no Czech articles in the Vestnik. Last month we had two Czech articles. When that was pointed out "they" felt the articles were not interesting. NOW THAT HURTS!!1 Being a child of a "mixed marriage" - one Czech - one not - I do not speak or write Czech. Br. Turek submits Czech articles from time to time, and other contributions are welcome. If submitting a Czech article, please submit a, translation in English. Czech articles should be typed and ready for print.(I don't type Czech either) [pageend3]SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO JULY - AUGUST, 1986 PAGE -4- ------------------------ IN MEMORIAM--------------------------- t z Trpký osud postihnul pomČrná mladého dvaasedesátiletáho bratra Vladimíra Cesaka, presidenta Sokola San Franciska, který zemřel náhle 1.Června 1986.

Probiji se jako mladý jak se dá, aby se uživil,, az posleze stava se kuchařem, tak jsme ho poznali i my. Po letech podařila se mu emigrace do U. S. A. , po příjezdu zapojil se do Sokola, ale aktivní se nepodílel. AŽ po letech , kdy odchází mlada presidentka Sokola, přichází bratr Cesak a je zvolen presidentem. Jeden a pul období jeho cinosti, kdy smrt ukončila jeho život je nutno přiznat, že celou dobu vládlo za nČj pít žen (cleni výboru) ktere po strance administrativní i výchovné řídily Sokol dobře, toho si zemřely bratr Cesak byl vědom. Schůze, která řídil , byli Často bouřlivé - ” nenavidčl ty, kteří bez funkci nemohly žit. Častokrát stahovaly se na nčj nízká pomluvy, která nezakládaly se na pravdě! Kdo je bez vinny, hod první kamenem ! íest budiž jeho památce ! VLADIMIR CESAK Vladimír Cesak, 62, a Peninsula maitre ď and waiter who last worked at the Brentwood Lodge in South San Francisco, died June 1. The native of Czechoslavakia had lived in Belmont for 25 years. He died in Kaiser Hospital in South San Francisco. Along with his professional duties, he was president of the Sokol Club in San Mateo. Funeral arrangements were handled by Duggan’s Carlmont Chapel in Belmont. [pageend4]SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO JULY - AUGUST, 1986 PAGE -5- The Two-Step Program to Better Sit-Ups If your feet fly into the air when you try to sit up without anchoring your feet, you have to retrain your muscles, says physical therapist Marilyn Miller. Feet-anchored sit-ups use your hip muscles; you should be using your abdominal muscles instead. The curl-back exercise below is one way to begin retraining your abdominals. 2. Then stretch your arms up above your head and forward. Suck in your abdominals, breathe out, Learning the Curl-Back 1. Sit on the floor with your knees bent and your back rounded, with your arms stretched out in front of you. As you pull your navel (or lower abdomen) back and up toward your spine, bend your head forward, and (you guessed it) contemplate your navel. and smoothly curl yourself up into a sitting position. Keep your back rounded and your head down and focused on your navel. If you can’t do this at first without your feet flying up, try placing your feet over the anchor bar to give yourself a little support. This variation will exercise your hamstring and gluteal (buttocks) muscles, but your abdominals will still do the work of sitting up instead of the iliopsoas (hip muscles), says Miller. If you’re into slantboard sit-ups with your feet anchored, securing your feet over the anchor bar is a good way to continue performing them, says Miller. Once you can do the curl-up without your feet coming off the floor, you can perform both exercises in one continuous sequence. Remember to breathe out as you curl back, then take a breath, and breath out again as you curl up. As it becomes easier to sit up, you can place your hands across your chest to make the exercise more difficult. 2. Slowly curl back toward the floor, keeping your trunk curled and looking at your navel. (The trick here is to keep your attention on your abdominal muscles.) Breathe out as you curl back, since this helps you to further contract your abdominals. When you reach the floor, stretch your arms out behind you, unbend your head, and take a deep breath. The object of this exercise is to curl back as slowly as possible while your heels remain in contact with the floor. Once you can do the curl-back evenly in a smooth and continuous motion that lasts at least five seconds, you’re ready to try a curl-up. We are reprinting from ASO Vestnik Gymnast section information regarding the correct way to do sit-ups. Most of us have been exercising this particular movement incorrectly. Be warned now! Correct your ways! Do you read these articles in the monthly National ASO Vestnik? You will find both interesting and informative information in them. The Curl-Up 1. Do the reverse of the curl-back. Lie flat on the floor with your knees bent and your arms stretched out on the floor above your head. [pageend5]SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO JULY - AUGUST, 1986 PAGE -6- : Miss l ib Lighting the Way For Immigrants Vital Statistics In ihe New York Narrows early in the century, transatlantic steamers anchored at quarantine while inspectors and immigration officials boarded to survey the latest arrivals of human cargo. The great bulk of immigrating passengers—those in third and fourth class steerage—were put on barges there or at receiving piers upstream, and ferried to Ellis Island, the U.S. immigration station. No name is more closely linked with massive American immigration than Ellis Island’s. For three decades—1892-1924—the greatest tide of incoming humanity in the nation’s history swept through this narrow portal in Upper New York Bay. From its opening in 1892 to its closing in 1954, more than 17 million newcomers arrived at Ellis Island. Today almost half of all living American can trace their heritage to one or more family members who first stepped onto American soil at Ellis Island. While Miss Liberty beckoned nearby, the 33 structures on this island became theater for an enormous and repetitious drama. The masses of crowded Europe—manual laborers, domestics, uprooted peasants, blacksmiths, displaced artisans, and families—trooped off the barges, up the quay and into the main building. They were received into the ground floor baggage room w'here they deposited their worldly belongings before climbing the flights of stairs to the Great Hall for medical and legal examinations. 1 he medical exam began as the immigrant climbed the stairs into the Great Hall. Doctors were waiting at the top of the steps, watching the immigrants as they climbed. Was the immigrant breathing heavily? Was he limping? Did he have any type of a physical deformity that would hinder him from finding a job here in the United States, or a result of which he would become a public charge? When the immigrant reached the top of the stairs, he would walk in a circle in front of the doctor. The doctor would examine the immigrants hair and face. The inspector was also looking for any type of contagious disease, whether it be curable or incurable. If the inspector suspected that the immigrant had a medical problem, he would take the immigrant out of line and mark his clothing with a piece of chalk—an “L” for lameness, an “H” for suspected heart disease, and an “E” for eye problems. The immigrant then entered the Great Hall and would remain until he could be taken upstairs for a full examination. Prior to 1911, the Great Hall was divided by metal passageways. In 1911, the staircase that ran from the baggage room into the center of the Great Hall was removed and staircases were put in on either side of the room. At that time, wooden benches were arranged in rows across the room. After the immigrant completed his medical inspection, he would sit on the benches, working his way across the room to the legal inspectors. Legal inspectors had in front of them the ships’ manifest sheets—lists of all the passengers that had arrived on the steamships that day. Each immigrant wore a manifest tag on his clothing with two numbers on it. It indicated to the inspector the page and the line on the page of the manifest sheet where the immigrant’s name appeared. Beside the immigrant’s name the sheet contained answers to questions he had presumably been asked in Europe before he was sold his steamship passage. The steamship companies were responsible for the immigrants and were supposed conduct medical and legal examinations before they sold the immigrant a Continued on next page Height from base to torch: 151 ft. 1 in.

The inspector at Ellis Island would merely re-ask the questions. There were approximately 30 questions asked in about two minutes. They were asked in English, but the immigrant would have an interpreter as needed. The questions went something like this: “What is your name?” “Where were you born?” Weight of copper used m Statue: 100 tons Weight of steel used in Statue: 125 tons Total weight of Statue: 225 tons Copper sheeting covering Statue (thickness varies because of hammer forming): 1/8 to 3/32 in. thick.

Then, he would receive an “SI” on his clothing in chalk. He would be detained until he could appear before the Board of Special Inquiry—the legal examiners on Ellis Island. For 80 percent of the immigrants, the average stay on Ellis Island was only three to five hours. Twenty percent were detained for either a medical or a legal reason, and between 1892 and 1924 only two percent, approximately 250,000 people among the many millions processed, were excluded from admission to the United States. If one was detained for a medical reason, he would be given a full physical examination. If one had a curable medical problem, he would be cared for in the hospital. 100th birthday [pageend7]SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO JULY - AUGUST, 1986 PAGE -8- CALENDAR DATES TO REMEMBER — St. Wenselaus - Sept. 27th Independence Commemoration Oct. 20th Annual Sokol Meeting - Dec. 7th New Year's Eve - Dec. 31st ; AZ DAR!
