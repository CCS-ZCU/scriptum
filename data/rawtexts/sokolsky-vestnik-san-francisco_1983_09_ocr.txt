As we are familiar with events before and after the independence, let us recall the beginning of our nation handed to us through legends...... According to the story after the settlement of Slavs in our country, first Duke, after our forefather Cech, was Krok, who did not have sons, but three daughters: Kazi, Teta, and Libuše. At. his death, the youngest, Libuše, known as the wisest and also clairvoyant was chosen to be ruler. One day she was called upon to settle a dispute between two noblemen. When her decision was against one of the noblemen, he complained that it was not fitting to have a woman as judge and ruler. The insulted Libuše called together the representatives of the people and asked them to choose a man to rule over them. The representatives depending on her wisdom, suggested she select a husband who would then rule. Libuše consented, and pointing to distant hills on the horizon said: "Behind those hills is a river called Bilina and on its shore a village by the name of Stadice. Nearby you will, find a man who is plowing a field. His name is Přemysl. Follow my horse, who will lead you to him. Každý rok n8 října v-Zpomínáme založení Československé republiky v roce 1918. Jsme obeznámeni s dobou před a po založeni, vzpomeňme dnes počátku našeho národa, jež nám byly zachovány pouze v pověst ech. Podle nich, po usazení se Slovaníi v nsší vlasti, prvým po praotci Čechovi vévodou byl Krok, který nem§l syny, pouze tři dcery: Kazi, Tetu a Libuši. Po smrti Kroka vládla nejmladší dcera Libuše, známá svou jasnovidností a moudrostí. Jednoho dne Libuše rozhodovala při mezi dváma muži. Ten který prohrál prohlásil že neni patřičné mít za soudce a vládkyni ženu. Uražená Libuše svolala zástupce lidu a vyzvala je aby si vyvolili za vládce muže. Tito ale nesouhlasili, nýbrž, spoléhajíce na Libušinu moudrost, navrhli jí aby si našla manžela, který pak dále bude vládnout. Libuše svolila a ukazujíc na vzdálené kopce na obzoru,pravila; Za t«mi zopci je řeka Bílina, na jejím břehu stojí vesnice Stadice. Blízko ni najdete muže orajícího pole, jeho jméno je Přemysl. Následujte mAho koné, Který vás k nému dovede.

Vyřidte mu vzkaz ode mne a mého lidu a svolí-li, přivodí e sob* knížete a urns manžela. Poslové učinili vše dle Libušina přání, nalezli přemysla, který se s nimi vrátil, oženil se s Libuší a tim počala v naší vlasti vláda Přemyslovců, která trvala do roku 1306. CZECHOSLOVAKIA The.

Those of us who attended enjoyed the beautiful day in the sun. Peter Jiremcuk served free hot dogs to the children and adults alike - Thank You, Peter, for your generous donation. The ”parky”were so good — urn!!!! It is really a shame that the members of Sokol as well as our Czech friends fail to support the picnic. It was so much fun to be with friends and share the "goodies”, to play volleyball, and to hike around the Point. Some are working so hard to keep Sokol San Francisco going — but we need more support from the members as well as the cooperation of all the Bay Area Czechs. Won’t you please help keep Sokol alive? We need more Sokol members and more children for our gym classe for without them Sokol will fold in the future - for they the children are the future of Sokol.

A few thoughts come to my mind, and I wish to share, them with you. In two or three months our Sokol Units will conduct their annual meetings, and elect officers for the coming year 1984. Holding any office in Sokol is an honor, and should be respected as such. A member accepts an office in good faith, and expects, and rightly so -- cooperation of the membership. However, often too much is expected of an officer — especially the president -- and without that cooperation, the office proves to be a burden to him or her. We should be glad to have members willing to take an office, and not discourage them by criticizing and not caring to be involved. Why not appoint committees to do special tasks at various events -- that means -- if a member promises to help in certain capacity, keep that promise and do it! Regretfully, it often does not turn out that way, the officer ends up doing the work -- and this repeats over and over. What is the result? He or she is disillusioned and will not accept the office another year. REMEMBER: Our involvement and cooperation in Sokol work is NOT done for any specific officer or individual. We are doing it for the success of the event, we are doing it for the advancement and betterment of our Sokol Unit, and for our personal satisfaction that we are helping to keep up our Sokol traditions. Therefore -- when you elect your 1984 officers, be grateful to them that they are willing to serve, and offer them your helping hand! Good Luck! The word Unit -- Jednota -- means Unity of ALL members. Let us remember: UNITED WE STAND -- DIVIDED WE FALL! NAZDAR! Sis. Louise Nekuda Pacific District - A.S.O.

Another important organizational change was the adoption of full membership rights and privileges for women. They were able to point to their brilliant role during the war in maintaining activity in the units as well as their participation in the revolutionary struggle. In legalizing the equal rights for men and women even before it was provided for in the republic’s constitution once again served to prove the Sokol's true democracy. The greatest encouragement in the Sokol's educational efforts was the establishment of the Tyrs center, built by using the profits from the Seventh Slet and by direct contribution from the members. It was in this building that the Sokols concentrated all the divisions and offices of the Czechoslovak Sokol Community, but its main purpose was the training and education of the Sokol gymnastic instructors. A permanent Sokol instructors school was able to supply the units and districts with professionally trained instructors. Furthermore, upon leaving the school, these newly trained instructors took wi ;h them the understanding of the idealistic basis of the Sokol training and thus they were able to help elevate the Sokol development towards its leading position in the field of gymnastic training throughout the world. The basic gymnastic program was further broadened by the addition of various sports, camping and cross country tramping. The Tyrs building further made possible expanded activity in the field of publishing books and periodicals. Thanks to the democratic and strictly non-partisan way of thinking and acting the Sokol was able to enjoy the same respect and confidence it had enjoyed before the war. Being freed of all partisan view and influence helped to expand the political role of the Sokol as a large disciplined whole, motivated exclusively by its interest in the welfare of the nation and the state. In 1926 when the contagion of fascism began to spread in our country, the Eighth Sokol Slet came in the nick of time to support the democratic strength of the nation. Gajda's attempts for a fascist revolution shortly after the Slet brought forth the declaration of the Czechoslovak Sokol Community proclaiming the incompatibility of fascism with membership in the Sokbl. This proclamation made it imperative for all Sokol components to fight against fascism by educating its members and expelling all who refused to be convinced. Several times by public appeals the Czechoslovak Sokol Community succeeded in its efforts to pacify extremely violent struggles between the political parties. In so doing it tried to vault over the disagreement by constantly stressing the common interests and common understanding. The relation of the Sokol to the army was very h^rty and friendly, for after all the army was virtually bora of the Sokol .The Prague 28th infantry regiment was renamed Tyrs-Fugner regiment, and the ČOS presented a banner to the TGM First Air Force unit. A similarly hearty relationship existed between the Sokol and the first two presidents, both Sokol members. Continued next 00 62. [pageend5]October, 1983 San Francisco Sokol Vestnik Strana-Page 6 HISTORY - Continued from last month. At a time when all the other succession governments were tossing about in economic poverty and internal confusion, in the Czechoslovak Republic, just one year and eight months old, the Sokols staged a Slet which attracted the attention and admiration of the outside world. However, its greatest significance was the affect it had right at home. The Slet stirred the nation’s conscience, it Jarred it from its depression and woke in it decision and efficient will. It showed clearly that only courage and hard work could lead the nation from the post war difficulties and save it from the dangers of communism. The most important role in the internal structure of the Sokol after the first World War was the expansion of Sokol activity to Slovakia and Ruthenia. The original name of the organ!zation was changed to Czechoslovak Sokol Community. In the days of Austria-Hungary the Sokol was not allowed to exist there and several attempts at establishing an organ!- zation were foiled at the very inception. The truly wideawake Slovaks used to join the Sokol during their student years in other parts of the historical lands of Bohemia, Moravia, and in Budapest, would it great risk secretly travel to the Slets‘in Prague. The American Slovaks had begun the organizing of Sokol uni ts since 1892. It is understandable therefore that after the revolution Sokol, began to spread rapidly throughout Slovakia. The units were being established simultaneously with the advance of the Guards of Freedom, replacing the Hungarian garrisons. The first unit was created one week after the Prague revolt, November 4, 1918 in the Uherska Skalice. February 9, 1919 saw the establishing of the Masaryk Sokol District intended to cover all Slovakia. However by October of the same year it was necessary to break it up into six separate Districts which were joined later by the Ruthénian Sokol District. The importance of the Sokol in Slovakia in addition to its physical and moral upbringing was most of all its contribution to the creation of Czechoslovak unity. From the very beginning the Sokol in Slovakia and in the historic 1 and.? was solidly one body and soul. There were no organizational divisions, no differences, no special pi'ivil^ges. Constant contact in the instructors schools, meetings, Slets and visits supported mutual understanding and served to strengthen the units. I don’t think we had another organization so thoroughly Czechoslovak. The Sokol was one of the strongest supports of Czechoslovak uni.ty. In the internal affairs within the Sokol the decline of momle„called for the strengthening and deepening of the educational efforts. There also emerged the need for protecting the Sokol from penetration by undesirable elements brought in by the post war avalanche of new members. That is why the Sokol called for a waiting period before acceptance, as well as training and pledges by new members. Once again special emphasis was focused on regular training in the gymnasia and went as far as demanding obligatory training for younger mem- Continued next page — [pageend6]October, 1983 San Francisco Sokol Vestnik Strana-Page 7 F or 300 years the Czechs were under the rule of the Austro- Hungarian Empire. Within the Empire, the Germanic population claimed a leading position and enjoyed many privileges not allowed non-German nationalities. With the disolution of the Empire at the end of World War One and the creation of the Czechoslovakian Republic, it was natural that some of the Germanic people living within the territory of the new Republic refused to acknowledge the authority of the Prague government and agitated for union with Germany. One particularly serious situation developed in Cheb (Eger) near the German border where the local government proclaimed independence from the central Czech government and organized its own military force called the Volkswehr. These actions, in themselves, were not of immediate danger to the new Republic. However, at the end of the war, the airfield at Cheb had been used by the Austro-Hungarian Air Force as a collection point, and the warehouses and hangar of Cheb airfield were full of military equipment. This material was of extreme value to the new Republic which desperately needed a creditable military force to protect and preserve its newly won independence. When a postal official who daily made the round trip between Cheb and Prague reported that military airplanes were being flown out of Cheb to Germany, the Czech government decided to act immediately. Dr. Schemer, one of the men given the task of organizing the new Czechoslovakian Army, issued the following orders to Czech Colonel Rosicky: “Gather together some soldiers and pilots and go to Cheb tonight. Occupy the airfield and fly out as many planes as possible before tomorrow.” The date was 9 November 1918, two days before the armistice was signed on the Western Front. Colonel Rosicky was able to assemble fifty men and two officers armed with a few rifles and four machine guns. Eleven pilots, under the command of Lt. Adamec, were found to accompany the expedition. All the pilots had served in the Austro-Hungarian Air Force and most had trained at Cheb airfield during the war. Therefore, they knew the airfield and its environs very well. In fact, Airman Antos was able to give Colonel Rosicky detailed aerial photographs of Cheb airfield. Colonel Rosicky ordered the car corps to prepare ten lorries for use A little-known aeronautical incident at the end of World War One is recounted By Jaroslav Klupak and James V. Sanders by the expedition. However, only five were available in Prague, so he had to contact Plzen (Pilsen), which was on the route between Prague and Cheb, to request additional lorries. When the expedition arrived at Plzen, the garrison commander, General Vojtechovsky, had been able to locate only four lorries. The expedition left Plzen for Cheb at 10 o’clock in the evening on 9 November. Colonel Rosicky’s plan was to sieze the airfield and protect it from attack by the Volkswehr while the Czech airmen prepared the aircraft for evacuation. Because he had so few infantrymen, it was imperative that the four machine guns be placed in the most appropriate locations. In making this decision, Rosicky was greatly aided by Airman Antos’ photographs. The column advanced without incident until it entered the small town of Stribro. Here they were stopped by Volkswehr sentries who wanted to know where they were headed. Colonel Rosicky told the sentries that they were carrying weapons to Cheb and boldly asked the way. The bluff worked and they were allowed to continue. Beyond Stribro, however, the expedition ran into continued bad luck. Every few kilometers one of the lorries would stall and the entire column had to wait for it to get started again. These problems were probably caused by the very poor quality of the available petrol. Hampered by continuous delay, the column advanced into unfriendly territory throughout the night. As they approached Cheb, Colonel Rosicky became increasingly worried that their mission may no longer have beén a secret and that the Volkswehr might be waiting for them at the airfield. At 10 o’clock in the morning of the 10th as the expedition neared NEXT PAGE THE CZECH EXPEDITION TO CHEB [pageend7]Continued from page 7 CHEB the airfield in dense fog the Colonel ordered everyone to be watchful. The airfield had just made its appearance out of the fog on the left side of the road, when the column was stopped by a hay wagon which stood across its path. Behind the wagon stood the men of the Volkswehr with their rifles at the ready. For a moment there was complete silence. Then, having ensured that the machine gun in the lead lorry was ready for action, Colonel Rosicky calmly walked over to the hay wagon and asked a German noncommissioned officer, “Are you in charge here?” “Yes, I am,” replied the officer. “Then have your men lay down their rifles and get this wagon off the road.”, Rosicky ordered. To the surprise of all, particularly Colonel Rosicky, the German officer clicked his heels together and answered, “Jawohl, Herr Hauptmann.” Rosicky returned to the lorries and ordered his men to get out and quickly disarm the Volkswehr. No one who was there will ever forget the quickness with which the Czechs carried out this order or the speed at which the disarmed Germans fled into the fog. Immediately, Lt. Adamec and his pilots ran to the hangar to start getting the aircraft ready for takeoff. In a few minutes, two pilots returned to report that when they reached the hangar, an aircraft was being prepared for takeoff. The German airmen, seeing the approaching Czech troops, ran away. One of them was caught and made a prisoner. > The Czechs were busy collecting the flyable aircraft when Colonel Rosicky received a report that. one of his sentries had detained a car containing two Germans who had asked to speak with the commander of the Czech troops. Before going to meet with the Germans, Rosicky inspected the Czech defenses and issued orders to shoot only if under direct attack. Then he went to the road to meet with the Germans. In the car were Dr. 'Bernardin, the chairman of the District Committee, and Colonel von Brunn, commander of the Volkswehr. The meeting was very cool. Colonel von Brunn asked Colonel Rosicky why the Czechs were occupying an airfield that was situated outside the territory of the Czechoslovak state. Rosicky replied that the airfield was the property of the Czechoslovak state and that nobody should care what Czech soldiers were doing there. Furthermore, he told Brunn that if he really wanted to know, they were carrying out military tasks assigned to them by a legitimate representative of the Czechoslovakian government. Colonel von Brunn refused to aco pt this explanation. Then Dr. B< nardin asked Col. Rosicky to com< with them to the office of the District Committee and gave his word that no harm would come to him. Rosicky hesitated for a moment, but decided to go in order to find out about the mood in Cheb. He called for his personal car and took with him a big, strong Czech soldier for protection. The rooms of the District Committee were on the town square. As Rosicky had expected, there were many German officials at the meeting. They asked him to write a description of the occupation of the airfield which he was to sign. Rosicky refused, explaining that they were mistaken if they thought that Cheb was an independent district and that the Allies had already made the decision that Cheb would be part of the Czechoslovak Republic. Until now the proceedings had been polite. Suddenly, the meeting was interrupted by the noisy arrival of two members of the Volkswehr, a lieutenant and a corporal. They were very excited and the lieutenant began his speech. Explaining that he came as a delegate of the Council of Soldiers, he demanded an immediate attack on the Czechs at the airfield. He said that all German men, even the lame and invalid, wanted to take part in this attack. As the lieutenant glared at Colonel Rosicky with hatred, he told the members of the District Committee that they were negotiating with the leader of bandits. At this, Col. Rosicky stood up and stated that he would no longer listen to insults, and asked both Dr. Bernardin and Col. von Brunn to keep their word and let him leave in safety. The lieutenant threatened that since all the town was in rebellion, if the District Committee did not authorize the attack, the Council of Soldiers had no authority to act. Colonel von Brunn then ordered the lieutenant to do nothing without his orders and be concluded next month told him to wait outside. Without the noisy lieutenant the negotiation continued peacefully until an attendant entered the room and whispered something to Dr. Bernardin that made him turn pale. Dr. Bernardin took Col. Rosicky aside and said, “I have just been informed that an airplane which took off from the airfield has crashed in the town. One of the crew is dead and the other seriously wounded. These men are certainly airmen from the Czech troops because both men had Czech tricolors on their caps.” It was dreadful news, but Col. Rosicky had to continue with the negotiation because he wanted to prevent useless bloodshed. Finally he told the District Committee that if the airfield was attacked he would send to Plzen for heavy artillery which would shell the town. The German gentlemen admitted that this was compelling logic and the negotiations were successfully completed. Having said his goodbyes, Rosicky i hurried away to visit with the injured airman. Leaving the Council House he ran into an ugly scene. The square was crowded with citizens who shouted at him and threatened him with their fists and canes. He was called every bad name in the book, some of the repeatable ones being “robber,” “dog,” and “rogue.” The gentlemen of the District Council were as surprised as Rosicky and they ordered the citizens to disperse. More shouts, outcries, and threats were the citizen’s answer. The situation was so bad that Rosicky asked the members of the District Council to appoint someone to accompany him to the hospital. Colonel von Brunn ordered the lieutenant who had interrupted the meeting to accompany Col. Rosicky. The lieutenant sat down in the Czech car without pleasure, and with the big Czech soldier sitting in the rear seat the car made its way through the crowd with great difficulty. Once out of the town square, the car was able to increase its speed. When Col. Rosicky arrived at the hospital, a doctor led him to a bed on which was the dead man. “I cannot help this one,” the doctor said. “It is Airman Antos,” Rosicky said, “one of my most excellent pilots.” On returning to the airfield, Rosicky learned that Antos, disobeying a temporary ban on flying, ’ had chosen the Brandenburg two-seater from which the two German airmen had fled when the Czechs arrived. Taking off with his observer, he had [pageend8]October, 1983 San Francisco Sokol Vestnik Strana-Page 9 Minutes - September 12 1983 Sokol Meeting Resume The meeting was called to order at 7:30 by President, Sister Duffey. Roll call of officers showed tuat Sister Murphy was absent because of illness. Minutes were read and approved. Bpilding Committee: Br. Macalik reported for nr. Rozehnal, saying that they had received an estimate on scraping and re-doing the ceiling in the hall of $1100. Sister Duffey reported that she had called Br. Kolar regarding the replacement of the fan. There should be further information at next month's meeting. Vestnik: Sister Meier submitted a letter for approval to be sent to all advertisers in the Vestnik asking for revision of their ads and payment of the amount due for the year 1984. Sister Bele made the motion and Sister Forsythe seconded, that the letter be approved. Motion carried. Other Business: Peter Gaffney came to speak to us about getting information from sources in Czechoslovakia regarding composer Černohorsky, and eventually present a program featuring his music. Jarmila Vrana volunteered to help in composing a letter to be sent requesting information. He also announced a Smetana music festival to be presented in San Diego State University in March and April, 1984, and suggested we try to organize a group to attend. Perhaps a bus charter. More information will be published in the Vestnik. Sister Duffey reported that orientation of the gym classes would be this Friday, Sept. 16. Joan Louzensky, a former class member at Sokol, is willing to instruct the teen class. She asked for approval to pay her $5 an hour. Sister Sikl made the motion that we pay an instructor for gym class $5. per hour. Sister Bele seconded the motion. The motion carried. Sister Duffey reported on the orchestra situation. Mr. Hahoda agreed to act as director of the orchestra - paying him an additional $20 for taking that responsibility. At that time, Sokol representatives will discuss with them their availability at our dances in the future. Also contacted, were the "Music Masters" who play Czech music and their charge is $50 per person which would come out less than our present cost. The Combo Band according to union scale receive $250 for three hours for three people. The usual procedure, by musicians, is playing time 45 minutes and then 15 minutes off. Things seem to be lined up for the September Dance. Sisters Chambers and Duffey will cook. There being nothing to add for the good of Sokol, the meeting adjourned at 8:45 pm. **************************************** Mluvíme česky n kvrcitó-f roBopHT no-pyccKH. MIKE STANINEC, D.D.S.
