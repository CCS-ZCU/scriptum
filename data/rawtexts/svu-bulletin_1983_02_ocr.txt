He started to study modern languages at Charles University in 1937 but left the country after the Nazi occupation in Í939. He settled in the United States and studied at Harvard.University (A.B. 1942, M.A. 1943), earning his Ph.D. in 1950 from Columbia University. He has taught Russian language and literature at Duke University (1948-58) and Slavic languages and literatures at the University of Michigan (1958-66), first as associate and then as full professor. Since 1966 he has been a Professor of Slavic Languages and Comparative Literature at Brown University in Providence, achieving the status of Professor Emeritus in 1982. He also continues to fill the position of Director of the Center for Research in Semiotics which he has held since 1977 at the same university. Visiting appointments and lecturing engagements at numerous American and European universities have been an important part of his career. He is a member of a number of professional societies in his specialties, has received various major grants for his national and international consulting and organizational activities, and has been extensively involved in editorial work. He has been editor of Brown University Slavic Reprints since 1967; co-editor since 1979 of Semiotic Scene, the Journal of the Semiotic Society of America which elected him Vice-President in 1976 and President in 1977; and co-editor of the Journal of American Semiotics, besides editing special issues of other learned journals, proceedings of linguistic conferences and symposia, and books. Dr. Winner’s bibliography since 1947 is too extensive to include here, and he has more than twenty “forthcoming” contributions for 1983 and “beyond,” in several languages. Among his books in English are: Kazakh Literature and Oral Art (1958), Chekhov and His Prose (1966), Aesthetic Semiotics, East and West: A History of Semiotic Theory in the Creative Arts (forthcoming), The Peasant and the City: Interpenetrating Structures, Irene Portis Winner, ed. (also forthcoming, with two other major works). His articles primarily concern Chekhov, Tolstoy, various aspects of the history of Russian literature, the Prague Linguistic Circle, structural poetics, current Czechoslovak literature, several entries for the Encyclopedia of World Literature (1981), Kafka and other topics connected with his research in semiotics. ★ ★ ★ JAROSLAV NEMEC - EDITOR OF ZPRÁVY (SVU NEWS) Jaroslav Nemec was born on March 23, 1910 in Orechov, Moravia. He finished his law studies with the degree of Doctor of Juridical and Political Sciences in 1937 at the Masaryk University in Brno. Between 1939 and 1945 he was an officer of the Czechoslovak Army Abroad in France, England, Russia and eventually in Prague, with ranks of Military Justice and General Field Prosecutor. He then became the Head of the Repatriation and Reemigration Section of the Ministry of Interior in Prague until the Communist take-over in 1948. He managed to escape to Germany in 1950 and arrived in the United States in 1952. 3 [pageend3]To build a new career, he earned a Master of Science in Library Science at the Catholic University in Washington, D.C. in 1956, and worked as a Legal Research librarian with the American Medical Association until 1959. His last position was Reference Librarian (Medical Jurisprudence) at the National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, from which he retired in 1976. Dr. Nemec is one of the founders of the Society. In fact the idea of organizing Czechoslovak scientists and artists abroad in a society independent from the Czechoslovak National Council of America originated with him and some of his closest friends. He was Secretary General of SVU in 1958-59 and 1960-62, was elected President for the period 1968-70 and became Honorary Member in 1972. Between June 1975 and April 1977 he edited the Czech SVU News together with the editorial board. We briefly quote from one of his numerous reminders of what the purpose of SVU is. Referring to the “publish or perish” principle he said: “SVU was born out of the necessity to fill in the gaps in the knowledge of Czechoslovak culture by the world. The Board has been aware since our beginnings that this situation could be best remedied by the printed word... It concerned primarily publishing in English or other world languages. It did not mean that we loved and honored our mother tongue less, but that those whom we wished to inform about Czechoslovak culture did know neither Czech nor Slovak” (“A Publishing Imperative,” Zprávy 11/7, September 1969). Dr. Nemec himself has written works both in Czech and in English. Among his most important English publications are: Medical Research Institutions Named After Medical Men (1969), International Bibliography of Medicolegal Serials, 1736-1967 (1967), International Bibliography of the History of Legal Medicine (1974), Highlights in Medicolegal Relations (1976). He also wrote many shorter articles, e.g.: “Physicians Who Have ' Served in the American Congress, 1774-1956” (1956), “Bibliographic Sources of Russian Medicine” (1960), “Witchcraft and Medicine, 1484-1973” (1974) and many more. However, his dream since his student years, Dr. Nemec confesses, was to become a historian of his birth place. He chose the title Orechov near Uherske Hradiště, A History for this dream and published Volume 1 (1131-1649), 241 pages, in 1972. Volume II (1649-1885) and Volume III (Topography and Folklore) are in manuscript. Volume IV (Sources) exists in a limited mimeographed edition. Dr. Nemec considers this his most important work written in Czech... to honor his roots and the mother tongue. ★ ★ ★ GEORGE JIRI GLOS Dr. Jiri Glos, Chairman of the SVU Conciliation and Arbitration Committee, Chairman of the SVU By-Laws Committee and member of the SVU Membership Committee, was born in 1924. He obtained the Doctor of Law degree from Charles University in Prague in 1948. He became a member of the Prague Bar and practiced law in Czechoslovakia in the years 1948 and 1949. After he arrived in Australia in 1950, he was awarded the Commonwealth Scholarship and obtained the LL.B, degree from the University of Melbourne in 1956. He practiced law in Australia until his departure for the United States in 1958. Dr. Glos presently is a Barrister and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Victoria and of the High Court of Australia and a Barrister-at-Law. In the United States he was a Sterling Fellow at the Yale Law School and earned the LL.M, degree in 1959 and the J.S.D. degree in 1960 from Yale University. 4 [pageend4]Between 1960 and 1963, Dr. Glos taught at the Faculty of Law of the University of Singapore. In 1963 and 1964 he practiced law in New York, and in the period 1964-1980 he .was Professor of Law at the St. Mary’s University School of Law in San Antonio, Texas. In 1978-79 he was a Visiting Professor of Law at the Memphis State University Law School and in 1980, Dr. Glos joined the European Law Division of the Library of Congress where he has been working as Assistant Chief of the Division and a legal adviser to the U.S. Congress. Since 1981 he has been an Adjunct Professor of Law at the Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C. Dr. Glos specializes in the Common Law of England and teaches primarily the subjects of Property, Torts, Conflict of Laws and International and Comparative Law. He is the author of two books (International Rivers, 1961, and Comparative Law, 1979) and he has published extensively in legal periodicals in the United States, Britain and the Commonwealth and Europe. His wife, Blanka, is a librarian and past Secretary General of the Society. See Bulletin III, 2, May 1982 for more details about her. ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ Our Losses JOSEPH A. WINN, M.D., 1901-1983 Dr. Joseph A. Winn, Psychiatrist, was chief of the Veteran Administration neuropsychiatric clinics in Manhattan and Brooklyn from 1947 to 1970. He died on February 9, 1983 at the age of 82. His obituary was published in the New York Times (February 11, 1983). He had also been a consulting psychiatrist at the South Beach Psychiatric Center of the New York State Department of Mental Health from 1971 until he retired in 1978. He was an instructor in neurology at the New York University College of Medicine from 1942 to 1952 and an associate clinical professor of neurology at New York Medical College from 1957 to 1973. Dr. Winn, SVU member, was born in Poděbrady, Czechoslovakia, and received his medical degree from Charles University in Prague. He came to the United States in 1938. He also wrote poetry, short stories and other literary works under the pen-name of Alcantara. Contributions in his honor should be made to Amnesty International, 304 W. 58th St., NYC 10019. ★ ★ ★ MILADA SOUCKOVA, 1899-1983 From Harvard University comes the news that Milada Souckova, eminent Czech novelist, poet, literary critic and historian who played a significant role in the Czech literary avant-garde, died on February 1, 1983 in Cambridge. For more then twenty-five years, Ms. Souckova served as the Czech and Slovak bibliographer of the Harvard College Library, where shp was largely responsible for building Harvard’s Czech and Slovak collections, unsurpassed outside Europe. 5 [pageend5]Ms. Souckova’s publications include twelve volumes of poetry and fiction, numerous scholarly articles, and several major works of literary history. Notable among her English publications are Baroque in Bohemia (see a review below); A Literature in Crisis: Czech Literature, 1938-1950; A Literary Satellite: Czechoslovak-Russian Literary Relations; and The Czech Romantics (1958). Her most recent book of poetry, Sešity Josephiny Rykrove, was published in Toronto in 1981. Ms. Souckova, SVU member, taught at several major universities, including Harvard, the University of Chicago, and the University of California at Berkeley. She joined Harvard Library staff in 1954, and from the time of her retirement in 1964 until her death she continued to work in the College Library Slavic Department as a consultant and bibliographer in the field of Czech and Slovak acquisitions. The Slavic Department, Harvard College Library (Cambridge, Mass. 02138) has received its first gift in memory of Dr. Milada Souckova and hopes eventually to be able to establish an endowed book fund. Checks should be made payable to: Harvard College Library, and annotated; “For the purchase of books in memory of Milada Souckova.” ★ ★ ★ JIRI KASPAREK, 1909-1983 On the afternoon of February 20, 1983, Dr. Jiri Kasparek passed away. .The course of his life was unusual and often difficult. Born in Brno, he became a Doctor of Law at the Masaryk University in 1932. In Fall 1939, as a secretary of the Society for State Sciences in Prague he was arrested by the Nazis as one of several hundred representative intellectuals whom the occupants held as hostages to insure submission of the Czech nation to their rule. Dr. Kasparek passed through several Nazi prisons and concentration camps during the war years. Soon after the end of the war he was finally able to marry his fiancee Zdena. He joined the Czechoslovak diplomatic service and was appointed an envoy to its embassy in Moscow. He was soon faced with a changed political situation when the Communist coup occurred in Czechoslovakia in February 1948. He resigned his position and under difficult circumstances escaped to the West with his wife. They went through many phases in their new life in Canada and the United States until they finally settled in Pennsylvania, where Dr. Kasparek acted as Assistant Director of the State Planning Board in the Governor’s Office in Harrisburg. Dr. Kasparek was one of the first members of the Society. The Los Angeles Chapter was very pleased to welcome him when he and Mrs. Kasparek decided to retire to Laguna Hills in early 1981. Dr. Kasparek was a highly educated man and a shrewd student of national and international events and trends. His modesty and charm made him many friends everywhere he went. They grieve at his premature passing, after a short exhausting fight with an incurable disease. LAK ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★A 6 [pageend6]KOSMAS.

MUSIC RAFAEL KUBELIK Recently, visiting Rafael Kubelik conducted the United States premiere of the original version of Janacek’s opera From the House of the Dead, in a concert performance by the New York Philharmonic. The principal soloists were Richard Cassilly, Donald Grobe, Norman Mittelmann and John Cheek. An English translation of the libretto by Yveta Synek Gr.aff and Robert T. Jones which was used was made available to the audience. Though there was nothing amiss musically, some critics felt that “this work cries, above all, for inventive theatrical translation” to achieve its full impact as a little known novelty in this country. In Europe Kubelik presented his expert reconstruction of this opera in Munich, at the Lucerne Festival and in Vienna. ■ One can in retrospect regret that Maestro Kubelik did not have more time to develop and implement his artistic program when he assumed the position of music director of the Metropolitan Opera (1972-74): it is possible he would have staged Janacek and other Czech operas. However, this “simple Czech musician,” as he likes to describe himself, is a man of strong principles and uncompromising artistic convictions. After his resignation from the Met, he has been frequently coming to the United States from his home at Lucerne, Switzerland, as a guest conductor. Rafael Kubelik, son of the celebrated violinist Jan Kubelik (1880-1940), was born at Bychory on June 29, 1914. He studied violin, composition and conducting at the Prague Conservatory of Music from 1928 to 1933, debuting as conductor with the Czech Philharmonic at the age of twenty. His career in Czechoslovakia led to the National Theater in Brno (1939-41) and to the post of musical director of the Czech Philharmonic in Prague (1942-48). After his escape to the West in 1948 he has never returned to Czechoslovakia, on principle. Neither did his first wife, Lala Bertlova, well- known concert violinist, who died in Switzerland in 1961. In 1967 Kubelik became a Swiss citizen. Kubelik’s appointments in exile included these positions: principal conductor of the Chicago Symphonic Orchestra (1950-53); director of the Covent Garden Opera in London (1955-58); chief conductor of the orchestra of the Bavarian Radio since 1961; the above mentioned period as director of the Met; a return to the Munich position; guest conductor with many American, European and other Western orchestras, as well as his extensive recording sessions. Besides a standard repertory, Kubelik has insisted on performing Romantic and contemporary music cf lesser popular 8 [pageend8]appeal and has introduced many Czech works. His recognition as a world- known conductor has rested on his solid and sensitive musicianship, even when his programming choices at times displeased his audiences. He has received important prizes for his recordings and has been awarded honors by various countries and musical societies, but his main aim has remained, as he puts it, “fighting for music and the freedom of expression.” He was one of the first Vice-Presidents of SVU and accepted an honorary membership in 1966. Instead of detailing Mr. Kubelik’s concert career, we will take a closer look at his discography which partially reflects his repertory and his conducting engagements. He has recorded whole symphonic cycles such as all nine symphonies of Beethoven, each one with a different leading orchestra; nine Dvorak symphonies with the Berlin Philharmonic; complete Dvorak overtures, as well as symphonic poems, Slavonic dances and Stabat Mater, with th? Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra; Dvorak Legends and Serenade, with the English Chamber Orchestra; three complete recordings of Smetana’s My Fatherland with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Vienna Philharmonic, as well as his symphonic poems with the Bavarian Radio Orchestra; Janacek’s Sinfonietta, Taras Bulba and the Glagolitic Mass with the latter; Mahler’s Symphonies No. 1, 4, 5 and 8, again with his Munich ensemble and with his Australian born second wife Elsie Morison in the vocal solo parts; and with Fischer-Dieskau Mahler’s Songs of a Wayfarer^Handel’s Royal Firework Music and com- plete Water Music; all four symphonies by Robert Schumann, both with the Bavarians and the Berlin Philharmonic, besides the Concerto in A for Piano, Konzertstueck and the Manfred Overture; Weber’s Concerto No. 1 and Mozart’s Concerto in A, both for clarinet; Grieg’s famous Piano Concerto; Borodin’s Symphony No. 2 and Polovtsian Dances with the Vienna* Philharmonic; Bartok’s Concerto for Orchestra^ Siegfried Idyll and preludes from several other Wagner operas with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. A very significant part of Kubelik’s discography are complete operas: Weber’s Der Freischuetz and Oberon; Hindemith’s Mathis der Maler; Nicolai’s The Merry Wives of Windsor; Wagner’s Lohengrin; first ever recording of Pfitzner’s Palestrina; and Verdi’s highly praised Rigoletto. Complete incidental music to Midsummer Night’s Dream by Mendelssohn also belongs to the dramatic genre. With Fischer-Dieskau he recorded Wagner arias and with Brno-born Ernst Hoeflinger Janacek’s Diary of One Who Vanished, in this case accompanying the singer on piano, as he used to accompany his violinist father on his concert tours during the thirties. This impressive recording output is currently listed. Some older records were reissued, as for example those from Kubelik’s Chicago era. Thus Bloch’s Concerto Grosso, Schoenberg’s Five Pieces, Mussorgsky’s Pictures at an Exhibition and Hindemith’s Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Weber have again become available. The recordings, of course represent but a fraction of the compositions he has conducted in concerts. Besides conducting and recording, Rafael Kubelik is a composer even though he never promotes his own compositions. A proper catalog of his works has not been published. Consequently data on publications and first performances in existing musical dictionaries are unreliable and sketchy. He has composed a number of chamber music works, songs, violin concertos, a cello concerto, a symphony, cantatas and operas. Some of his compositions 9 [pageend9]from the 193O’s and 1940’s were reportedly lost and only a few were performed. In Czechoslovakia a requiem for his father Pro memoria patríš was premiered by the Czech Philharmonic in 1942 and his opera Veronika debuted in Brno in 1947. Among the compositions from his exile years his oratorio Libera nos was first performed in West Germany in 1965. His opera Cornelia Faroli, composed in Czech in 1966 for the Olympic cultural program, had its world premiere on August 15, 1972 in Augsburg and was broadcast in Albany, N.Y. a year later. Dalibor C. Faltis wrote the libretto for Cornelia Faroli, as he had done for Veronika and another Kubelik’s opera Chodska svatba. The only work the composer Kubelik conducted and recorded for the Deutsche Grammophon (139443 Stereo), with the English Chamber Orchestra, are his Quattro Forme per Archi, also written in 1965 and premiered on August 28, 1966. A relatively recent interview with Rafael Kubelik was published in the English issue of the magazine Zapad/The West (see below). ★ ★ ★ THE BARTERED BRIDE IN JERUSALEM From The Jerusalem Post (International Edition, March 20-26, 1983) we are happy to hear that Smetana’s “national” opera The Bartered Bride was performed in Jerusalem. The reviewer Yohanan Boehm wrote among other comments: The leading spirits of the Jerusalem Opera Society — Madelyn Coppock-Roden and her husband Jacob Roden - launched an operatic pilot-project two years ago, without help from foreign experts or from local sources.. .In close cooperation with the Jerusalem Municipality’s Youth, Sports and Social Activities Department, opera was brought to schools, and a start was made in educating new and young audiences in understanding and love of this medium. ‘ Smetana’s The Bartered Bride was chosen for its folklore element, its simple plot and lively action. However, the main reason for the choice was the opportunity the production gives for participation by children. Dancing, playing animals and clowns, acting, preparation of decorations and costumes, and all the other complex facets of opera, provided unlimited possibilities for the children. Four elementary schools were selected to take part...All in all, some 1,200 children between the ages of 9 and 12 were involved. Finally, this month all this painstaking work bore fruit. After a fortnight’s rehearsals with over 200 young “actors,” four performances were staged at the International Cultural Centre for Youth, in the German Colony, which placed its facilities at the disposal of the project. So that as many children as possible should take part, different groups took turns at each performance. It was a tremendous success... The standards were highly professional. The assembled talent proved there are enough competent singers in Israel to justify the attempt to build up a small opera company. The performance - ably conducted by Eli Jaffe, and with an excellent piano accompaniment by a new Russian immigrant, Natasha Kessov -was a remarkable event in the history of opera in Israel. As a similar project of “opera for schoolchildren” The Bartered Bride has been periodically repeated in Los Angeles, with emphasis on the circus scene rather than the lyrical “adult” love plot. We can only speculate whether its impact on Israeli or California children will be the same as on Czechoslovak youngsters, who used to be exposed to this opera as their first operatic experience. The fact that adult Czechoslovaks usually know the opera by heart almost in its entirety is beyond point in this connection, but it proves the “national opera” status of The Bartered Bride. This opera was performed even in Terezin (Theresienstadt) “model Ghetto” during the Holocaust. ★ ★ ★ 10 [pageend10]SMETANA FESTIVAL SVU member Jaroslav Mraček, Professor of Music at San Diego State University, is in the process of organizing an important event for next year: The Smetana Centennial: An International Conference and Festival of Czechoslovak Music. The program of musical performances and academic lectures is slated for the week of March 29-April 8, 1984. Due to the importance of this plan, we hope that the whole Society and all other Czechoslovak organizations, as well as friends of Czechoslovak music will support the SDSU Festival. The year 1984 also marks 130 years of Janacek’s birth, 110 years of Suk’s birth, Max Brod’s centennial, and eighty years of Dvorak’s death. Details will be forthcoming. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA RELIGIOUS NEWS TWO EXILE BISHOPS ORDAINED On January 6 of this year Pope John Paul II ordained two new bishops in Rome to take care of the spiritual needs of the Czechs and Slovaks abroad. It is a new administrative act, for usually Catholics in exile belong to their local dioceses, even though about forty missions with Czech or Slovak priests exist in the West. However, the establishment of specific bishoprics means a higher degree of recognition and support from the Vatican for two to three hundred thousand Czechoslovak faithful who have left their country of origin. Monsig. JaroslaV Skarvada was given the title Bishop of Litomyšl, a medieval Czech diocese non-functional since the XVth century, while Monsig. ‘ Dominik Hrušovsky became the titular bishop of Tubia, Mauretania, together with his mission to Slovak Catholics. Both dignitaries had left Czechoslovakia shortly after World War II, studied at the Lateran University in Rome and taught theology besides their other positions. They will be based in Rome and make pastoral visits to their countrymen all over the Western world. Dr. Skarvada is SVU member of long standing. ★ ★ ★ CZECH NATIONAL CHAPEL OF OUR LADY OF HOSTÝN IN WASHINGTON, D.C. During the days of June 24-26, 1983 a solemn dedication will take place at the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in the nation’s capital. The Chapel of Our Lady of Hostýn and St. John Neumann, built over several years with the sponsorship and monetary support of many Czech- Americans and other donors, will be consecrated. The canonization of St. John Neumann in 1977 provided an additional impetus for the creation of the chapel. Group trips to the consecration ceremonies and a testimonial dinner - which will be attended by President Reagan - are planned in various cities. A special booklet about the event is available from: The Trustees for the Czech Chapel in Honor of St. John Neumann Chestnut Hill College 9601 Germantown Ave. Chestnut Hill, PA 19118 ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★A II [pageend11]SLAVIC STUDIES CONFERENCE “UKRAINE AND CZECHOSLOVAKIA” A two day international conference “Ukraine and Czechoslovakia” was held at the Ukrainian Free University in Munich, Germany, on July 30-31, 1982. This interdisciplinary conference which attracted scholars from Canada, Europe and the Urtited States was organized and chaired by Dr. Nicholas Bohatiuk, professor of economics, Le Moyne College, Syracuse, N.Y. He has also edited a book of abstracts of the conference papers in Ukrainian, Czech, German and English. The conference audience of about 150 represented a broad spectrum of specialists in East European affairs. The conference was opened by Dr. Bohatiuk in Ukrainian, Czech, German and English, and the welcoming address was delivered by Professor Wolodymyr Janiv, rector of the host institution, the Ukrainian Free University (UFU). The conference papers were presented in four sessions. The first session “Language and Literature,” with Prof. Igor Kaczurowskyj (UFU) as chairman, included the following papers: “Czech Influence on the Ukrainian Language” (Prof. Olexa Horbatsch, University of Frankfurt and UFU), “Correspondence of I. Franko, V. Hnatiuk and O. Kobylianska with Czech Scholars” (Dr. Blanka Jeřábek, Institute for Social and Pedagogical Professions and UFU), “The Prague School in Ukrainian Literature” (Prof. Dmytro Shtohryn, University of Illinois, Urbana). In the second session, “Economics and Society” chaired by Prof. Zenowij Sokoluk (UFU), the papers read were: “Technological Exchange between Ukraine and Czechoslovakia” (Prof. S. Billon, University of Delaware), “Ukraine and Czechoslovakia in the CMEA Integration Plans” (Prof. Nicholas Bohatiuk, Le Moyne College and UFU), “Some Aspects of -Czech Settlements in Volhynia” (Mag. jur. Wolodymyr Didowycz, UFU). The third session “History and Philosophy” (Prof. Hryhorij Waskowycz, UFU - chairman) consisted of three papers: “On the Basic Orientation, Affinities and Differences of Ideas in Ukrainian and Czech Philosophical Thought” (Dr. Milan Danhel, formerly of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences), “Comenius and Skovoroda - Slavic Educators of their Times” (Prof. Theodore Mackiw, University of Akron), “Masaryk’s Concept of East Central Europe and its Significance Today” (Prof. Roman Szporluk, University of Michigan). The last session dealing with “Ukrainians in Czechoslovakia” (Prof. Peter Potichnyj, McMaster University and UFU - chairman) contained the following papers: “The Intelligentsia of Carpatho-Ukraine and the Czechoslovak Government” (Prof. Alexander Baran, University of Manitoba), “Relations between Ukrainians and Czechs during the first Decades of the Existence of the UFU” (Prof. Josef Kratochvil, University of Stuttgart and UFU), “Publishing Activity of Ukrainian Immigrants in Bohemia and Moravia from 1900 to 1945” (Dr. Wolodymyr Maruniak, UFU). A social period followed this very unique and successful international conference.

Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1980; Michigan Slavic Publications, No. 17. Pp. 216, numerous illustrations. In the Postscript, the late Roman Jakobson stated that ýi the history of Czech culture “the Baroque pattern vitally surpasses the contiguous Renaissance and Classical trend” and “the Baroque remodeling of Gothic churches convincingly belongs to the Czech landscape.” According to Jakobson, “the imagery of the Czech Baroque poets revives in the work of their Romantic heirs and reveals a contagious affinity with modern Czech poetry...” He praised Milada Souckova for her “initiative and role of interpreting the Czech literary Baroque to the international readership.” Baroque in Bohemia is a compact and very attractive book covering both major areas of culture, literature, poetry and monumental arts - and its more marginal aspects. Souckova dedicated special chapters to such minor arts as “Painting on Glass,” “Painting with the Needle” and “Rococo Gingerbread.” The chapter entitled “Guided Tours” refers to the voyages of several Czech aristocratic diplomats to various foreign countries and then focuses on the tour of Krištof Harant z Polzic to the Holy Land and to Egypt. “A la Turca” expounds on the often neglected period when the “Turkish danger” threatened the Eastern parts of Austria-Hungary, illustrated by many echoes found in Slovak folksongs and in the personal history of the Protestant priest Stefan Pilarik (1615-1693), author of Sors Pilarikiana and temporary captive of the “Tatars.” In another chapter Comenius appears as a representative of Baroque literary style. “The Art of Allegory” is discussed in another chapter dealing with the emblems, icons and Baroque house signs in Prague, as well as congratulatory poems and - theater pieces. “Baroque Flower Arrangements” — both botanical gardens and stylized castle gardens - get deserved attention. “A Beautiful Day in the Baroque Period” deals with the hunt and a hunter, Count Franz Anton Sporck (1662-1732), as well as with a hermit portrayed in the legend of St. Hubert. “Rybrcoul or Bohemia Docta” introduces Baroque fairy tales. And “Bohemia Pia” treats the cults of many saints, especially St. John Nepomucene. The illustrations and literary quotations, translated into English, complement the scholarly text in a very striking manner. Twelve pages of footnotes provide an excellent source for further study. The only fault to be found is the absence of an index. ★ ★ ★ Bradley, John: Lidice, Sacrificial Village New York: Ballantine Books, Inc., 1972; 160 p., many photos Sometimes associations do not click immediately -- and paperback books tend to hide themselves in bookcases. Writing about John Bradley’s editorship of the first volume of Kosmas and reproducing the Society’s declaration commemorating the destruction of Lidice and other Nazi crimes of 1942 as reprisals for Heydrich’s assassination did not immediately evoke the association it should have. Bradley’s book on Lidice is No. 2 of Ballantine’s Illustrated History of the Violent Century, published by a mostly British editorial team. John Bradley, who spent World War II in his native Czechoslovakia, partialy in 13 [pageend13]Gestapo custody, made a thorough research of the Lidice tragedy and was able to collect much photographic materials from British, Czechoslovak and German sources. His text explains step by step the Fall of Czechoslovakia, organization of the Czechoslovak Government in Exile and the Czechoslovak military forces in England, the planning of the assault on Heydrich, and the Nazi revenge that followed it. The author reconstructs many details of the chain of events that led to the selection of Lidice and its population for complete annihilation, intended by the occupants as a deterrent against any armed resistance in the Protectorate Bohemia and Moravia. However, in 1942 Lidice became a symbol all over the world, besides Guernica. It is beneficial, though painful, to reread Bradley’s book in these months commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of Hitler’s seizure of power, the fortieth anniversary of the brutal suppression of the Warsaw ghetto revolt, and other atrocities of this Violent Century. John F. N. Bradley was born in Brno, Moravia. He graduated from Cambridge University (England) in 1955 and later earned a doctorate from L’Universite de Paris. He taught International Politics at Manchester University, becoming Senior Lecturer in charge of East European studies. He authored many articles and books, among them La Legion Tchecoslova- que en Russie 1914-1920 (Paris, 1964), The Allied Intervention in Russia 1917-1920 (London, 1965), The Russian Civil War 1917-1920 (Manchester, 1967) and, recently, World War III. ★ ★ ★ THE LAST HONOUR, Volume I Memorial for Czechoslovak Refugees 1948-81 Pejskař, Jožka: Poslední pocta (Zurich: Konfrontation, 1982, pp. 323, $40.00) In February 1948 the Communists took over Czechoslovakia; in August 1968 the Soviet armies occupied the country. These two events forced perhaps as many as 60,000 Czech and Slovak dissident patriots into exile. Most of them hoped that some day they would be able to “return home” upon the reestablishment of a democratic regime. As years of banishment came and went, many exiles died while waiting. This book honors them by telling who they were, what their accomplishments “at home” were, and what they did in the diaspora while waiting. I was completely unprepared for this book. One day the mailman just left a big package at my door. Not being able to contain my curiosity, I cautiously opened the package. In it, J. Pejskař, iň his own longhand, informed that the volume was being sent “on approval;” he assured me that “if not satisfied” the book could be returned within two weeks without obligation, “the sender paying the postage.” The billing was for $40, a stiff price even in our runaway inflationary economy. Because the book has no index, I started to page through the volume to see what was in it. Gradually, curiosity got the better of me. I started to read the message on the dust cover, then the Preface by Sir Cecil Parrott, then the cover letters, then I looked at what was being said about Dr. Ladislav Feierabend, Cardinal Beran, Petr Zenkl; then I read about my late colleagues from my days in the Royal Air Force (RAF) in England. I was instantly and hopelessly hooked on the book. Let me share my thoughts about this extraordinary läbor of love. The author assembled curricula vitae for about 270 deceased individuals in this first volume. The book contains far more than a bare enumerations of vitae. In many cases, samples of writings by the exiles or about them are included; these serve as footnotes to crucial historical events which these individuals actively helped to shape. The text is either in Czech or in Slovak. 14 [pageend14]The Preface in English, by Sir Cecil Parrot, who was British Ambassador in Prague during 1968, is a jewel of human warmth, vision, understanding and hope. Sir Cecil, besides his service in Czechoslovakia was also stationed in Moscow and Belgrade. Furthermore he translated into English the classic story of the Good Soldier Svejk by Jaroslav Hasek and recently also Hasek’s The Red Commisar. Because of his love for the country and its culture, Sir Cecil regrets the “incalculable loss to Czechoslovakia and its people caused by these successive waves of emigration.” He speculates on “what it would have meant to Czechoslovakia and Europe between (World War I and II) if Thomas G. Masaryk had died in exile instead of returning home to be acclaimed by the people and elected (first) president (Liberator) of the new republic.” Having raised that question, Sir Cecil masterfully sums up the anguish of exile as expressed by Earl of Kent, when ordered to leave England by King Lear, the ruler he so faithfully tried to serve: “Freedom lives hence and banishment is here.” No one but Shakespeare could have better expressed the theme of Pejskar’s book. The author is already working on the second volume. That provides him the opportunity for a reminder that if one has not found the name of somebody in the first volume, chances are it will appear in the second volume. He then asxs for comments, suggestions, names, data that ought to be included. Because the book has no index, it forces the reader to carefully examine the volume page-by-page to find out what treasures it contains. Doing that I started tabulating individuals by sex, profession, place of death. This rudimentary attempt at tabulation and analysis provides some clues about ways to make the second volume even more useful and complete than the first one. By profession the departed patriots fall roughly into the following categories. Profession Number % of Total 1. Military.............................. ..... 121 45.0% 2. Diplomats.......................... ........ 52 19.3 3. Technology........................ ........ 27 10.0 4. Politicians.......................... ........ 25 9.3 5. Literature............................ ........ 19 7.1 6. Prominent Refugees.......... ........ 13 4.8 7. Scientists............................ ..... 12 4.5 Total 269 100.0% With almost two-thirds of the individuals in military and diplomatic services, it seems that other professions have been under-represented so far. This bias might be eliminated by the second volume, which is to contain individuals in arts, education, communications, business and sports. Likewise only 10 women are listed, including Ms. Alice Masaryk, daughter of the first President of Czechoslovakia, T.G. Masaryk. That indicates a “male bias.” About 10 Jews are included; the late John Adler of the World Bank and Ernest Sturc of the International Monetary Fund are conspicuous by their absence. Will they be in the second volume? 15 [pageend15]The place of death provides an indication of the degree of dispersal of the exiles, as well as clues about the “geographic sampling bias.” Source: Table 1 Region Number % of Total 1. Western Europe .............. .......... 144 51.1% 2. North America................ . .......... 107 37.9 3. South America............................ 15 5.3 4. Other................................ .......... 16 5.7 Total.................................. .......... 282 100.0% Offhand one would expect the bulk of exiles to be concentrated in Western Europe, but only 42, or about 15%, appear to fall into that category. The explanation is relatively easy: the United Kingdom, with 102 exiles represents more than one third of the total. This is apparently because Mr. Pejskař had access to military records of veterans of Czechoslovak Armed Services who died in England. Soldiers and diplomats provide a suitable beginning to the first volume simply because they were civil servants, or the most conspicuous “professional patriots” with skills that do not easily adapt to civilian life abroad, if one compares them to the relatively ready job opportunities for scientists, entrepreneurs, educators or skilled workers. And so it is that soldiers and diplomats retained a “purer exile status,” considering their stay abroad to be a temporary sojourn. For them it would have consequently been somewhat inconsistent to sink roots by taking out citizenship in host countries, to build homes, to systematically assimilate. As years and decades go by, realistic evaluation of their situation inevitably started to creep in. More and more escapees began to undergo the metamorphosis from exiles to immigrants. I am one of them. Does that mean that, upon my death - having twice escaped the Holocaust and once Communist Clutches -- I will not qualify for the Last Honor Roll? The above tabulations and speculation about definitions illustrate the type of macro-research for which this volume and the future volumes of Pejskar’s pioneering work lend themselves. Likewise, analysis of individual case histories is a rich data source for many future Masters and Doctoral dissertations dealing with Czechoslovakia, political exiles, ethnic ethiology, economics, sociology, and other fields of inquiry about the fate of exile communities. The attractive physical appearance of the book is also a result of Pejskar’s dedicated labor of love. In short, I am looking forward to the second volume. That in itself should be adequate tribute to what has been done in the first volume. The book was reviewed in many Czech periodicals, Voice of America and Radio Free Europe. For an English review, see SVU Bulletin, Los Angeles Chapter, Vol. XIV, , No. 2-3, April-September, 1982. It even attracted attention of the German press, as in the article “Trotz einiger Luecken ein ingesamt herausragendes Werk des tschechischen Exils” by Toni Herget (Sudetendeutsche Zeitung, Muenchen, 5.November 1982). The German reviewer makes’reference to the J. G. Herder-Institut in Marburg where some archival collections are located and concludes that there has been no similar work produced by other exile groups, including the expelled Sudeten Germans.

Edited by Ladislav Matějka and Benjamin Stolz. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1982; Michigan Slavic Material, No. 20; 379 p., illustrations; $8.50. This attractive large paperback publication represents contemporary and historical literary and artistic trends in Central and Eastern Europe. The editor, Ladislav Matějka (see Bulletin I, 1, January 1980) and several contributors are SVU members. Among the others we find both Slavic and English names, some internationally renowned. The first essays, “Looking for a Center: On the Poetry of Central Europe” by Czeslav Milosz, “Letter from Budapest” by George Konrad, “Defining ‘Central Europe:’ Power, Politics, and Culture” by Roman Szporluk (U. of Michigan) and Jan F. Triska’s (Stanford U.) “East Europe? West Europe? Both? Neither?” explore in general terms the conditions of collisions, interdependencies and temporary syntheses of the Eastern and Western cultures in the areas of Central Europe. 17 [pageend17]Specifically Czechoslovak topics are treated in A. Finkielkraut’s “Milan Kundera Interview;” “American Motifs in the Work of Bohumil Hrabal” by Josef Skvorecky (U. of Toronto); “Slovak Surrealism as a Parable of Modern Uprootedness” by Peter Petro (U. of British Columbia); “Jiri Orten’s Elegies” by George Gibian (Cornell U.); “Rilke’s Early Contacts with Czech’and Jewish Prague” by Daria A. Rothe (U. of Michigan); Jana Cerna’s “Kafka’s Milena as Remembered by Her Daughter Jana;” “Spellbound by Prague,” by Jindřich Chalupecky and “The Liberated Theatre of Voskovec and Werich” by Jarka M. Burian (New York U.). “The Swell Season Comes to an End: Sad Autumn Blues” is a sample of Josef Skvorecky’s narrative style. Connections with other neighboring countries are highlighted in “Bela Bartók and Slovakia” by Michal Želiar, “Bela Bartók as a Collector of Folk Music” by Albert B. Lord (Harvard U.), and “Haba’s Microtonal Theory in Yugoslavia” by Jelena Milojkovic-Djuric. To Poland are dedicated the articles “Ivan the Terrible as the Gentry’s Candidate for the Polish Throne: A Study in Political Mentality” by Wiktor Weintraub (Harvard U.); “The Independent Publishing Movement in Poland: Its Past and Future Perspectives” by Stanislaw Baranczak (Harvard U.); “Conversation with Tadeusz Konwicki” by A. J. Liehm (U. of Pennsylvania); “Czeslaw Milosz and the Landscape of Exile” by Harold B. Segel (Columbia U.), and “Andrzej Wajda: Film Language and the Artist’s Truth” by Herbert Eagle (U. of Michigan). Ingo Seidler (U. of Michigan) asks “Who is Elias Canetti?”; H. Gordon Skilling (U. of Toronto) discusses “Samizdat: A Return to the PreGutenberg Era?” and Emery George (U. of Michigan) offers a selection of English translations of “Contemporary Poetry in Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia.” The longest study of the collection is “Krleza’s Glembay Cycle in its European Context” by Ivo Vidan (Zagreb U.). The yearbook makes for interesting reading, some scholarly in orientation and some purely literary in its very promising debut as 1982 Cross Currents. We hope the editors will be able to make it into a real “yearbook.” The motto by Szymborska (p. 89) seems to characterize the whole volume: “The joy of writing - The power of preserving - The revenge of a mortal hand” -- a modern paraphrase of the saying the word is mightier than the sword? Order from: Michigan Slavic Publications Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures 3040 Modern Languages Building The University of Michigan Ann Arbor, MI 48109 Zapad/The West In October 1979 a group of Czechoslovak literati living in Canada along with the publishing company Collegium Bohemicum started a bi-monthly magazine with varied contents, ranging from political comments to humor. A special English issue of Zapad/The West appeared in March 1982 with the assistance of the Secretary of State for Multiculturalism. In its sixty- four pages appear sections on Canada, The World, Czechoslovakia, Ideology, Law, Business, Sports, Arts, Music and Prose. All translations of 18 [pageend18]the original Czech texts were made by Paul Wilson. Several SVU members are on the Editorial Board and have contributed to this issue. The text and accompanying photos provide an informative cross section of topics selected from the magazine’s first volumes. The English issue is available for $3.50. The yearly subscription for the regular issues of Zapad is $14.00 in Canada and the United States. Order from: Zapad, Box 322 Waterloo, Ont. Canada N2J 4A4, ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ PHYSICAL FITNESS SOKOL A special full session on sports and physical fitness was the novelty of the Eleventh World Congress of the Society last October, even though occasional papers on topics of this kind have been included in past congress programs. Love of “real football,” i.e. soccer, as well as ice-hockey, gymnastics, water sports, calisthenics, hiking and so on has always been strong among the Czechs and Slovaks. Such names as Olga Fikotova- Connoly, Martina Navratil, several figure-skating aces (among them Aja Vrzan and the Jelineks of the Ice Capades) or Vera Komárek of the Annapurna I expedition have often appeared on the pages of major English newspapers. The Latin precept of “mens sana in corpore sano” (a sound mind in a sound body) is often quoted by the common Czechoslovak man in reference to the holistic goals of a satisfactory life style. The roots of this ingrained attitude are found in the 19th century’s Sokol movement, though some elements of it can be traced to the pedagogical principles of Com- enius. A good exposition of the history of the Sokol organization was published in the second volume of Czechoslovakia Past and Present, ed. Miloslav Rechcigl, Jr. (The Hague: Mouton, 1968). The article “The Sokol Movement - A Tribute to the National Revival and Culture of the Czechoslovak Nation” by Milada Lejkova-Koeppl, director of the Physical Education Department of the Immaculate Seminary in Washington, D.C., and the Educational Director of the Washington Chapter of American Sokol, explains the philosophy of Dr. Miroslav Tyrs (d. 1884), the founder of the Sokol program. Tyrs launched it in 1862; the program included the idea of Sokol Festivals every sixth year as a revival of ancient Olympic competitions. Thus the Sokol idea preceded Pierre de Coubertin’s Olympic Games (1896). The name Sokol means “falcon;” it was taken over from the Yugoslavs who traditionally used the term as a synonym for “a hero.” The first American Sokol unit was founded on February 14, 1865 in St. Louis, and other cities soon followed. The Pacific Sokol District started its activities in 1909. Currently Sokol units exist in England, France, Sweden, Switzerland, West Germany, Austria, Belgium, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, Morocco and Australia, as well as in the United States and Canada. Even though the Sokol movement was dissolved in the country of its origin and in other East European countries, it continues in exile. The “exile” Fifth Sokol Festival took place last July in Vienna. 19 [pageend19]The “Sokol Physical Culture” is officially described as: “A scientifically designed system of calisthenics, gymnastics with and without apparatus, games and spouts. With more than one hundred years of experience and achievement, its program benefits both men and women and carries the individual in a progressive program from 3 years to 75.” However, Sokol also has striven to develop the moral and spiritual qualities of its members. Consequently, Sokols home and abroad supported Czechoslovak liberation efforts during both world wars. As a democratic organization, they promoted equality among “brothers and sisters” of the membership and opposed any totalitarian regimes. For that reason, members of communist parties were not acepted ever since 1918. Among well-known Sokol leaders living in the United States is a remarkable woman, Marie Provazník, a living example of the benefits derived from the Sokol regimen. She was involved in organizing the women’s branch of the International Gymnastics Federation and became the national director of Sokol women in Czechoslovakia. She played a leading role in the 9th Sokol Festival of 1932, the 10th Festival in 1938 shortly before Munich, and the 11th Festival of 1948, which took place after the communist takeover but before the official dissolution of the organization. She then defected after the 1948 Summer Olympic Games in London. In the United States she taught gymnastics at the Montclair State College, New Jersey, continued working with Sokol women and edited Czechoslovak Sokol Abroad. She nominally retired from her activities in 1967. She was one of the initial SVU members. At the age of almost 93 she . is a friend of many and a paragon of Tyrs’ and Masaryk’s ideals. ★ ★ ★ . Olympic Games To enjoy Olympic Games, one does not have to be an athlete. One does not even need a recliner and a TV. So it appears to SVU member Gabriel Laub who published a book of “timeless sport stories” under the title Olypisches Laub (Bergisch Gladbach: Bastei-Luebbe, 1980; 125 p.) In view of the approaching 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, we hope the organizers take heed of his stimulating suggestions. Or rather, there might be some nimble minds, according to the Los Angeles Times, thinking along the same lines as Mr. Laub did when he decided that reports about future Olympic Games should be written beforehand. He might enjoy the idea of a 10-year-old Angeleno who made a picture of a monumental traffic jam as the most outstanding Olympic event - children’s drawings will adorn the athletes’ rooms. Laub of course described the “Tourists’ Race in- the Eternal City” in which the American teams won all first places for managing to see the twenty-six most important Roman monuments, have a meal and arrive in their hotel in less than two hours, but he did not explain how the winners trained. Another Californian suggestion of an American- dominated sport is the World Tobacco Spitting Championships. Not even Laub thought of this, though his “Find Cheap Potatoes,” a successful ladies event, sounds pretty creative. His other sport satires also include peculiar historical and political allusion that must be read in full. Gabriel Laub was born in Poland, studied in Prague, left Czechoslovakia in 1968, lives in Hamburg - and writes in Czech or German. He has contributed to German newspapers (Die Zeit, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung) and worked with the West German Radio. He was the President of the Exile PEN-Club for eight years and has received awards for his literary work. 20 [pageend20]He has published books of aphorisms and satires on a multitude of subjects. He often makes puns on his own name, as in the titles Ur-Laub zum Denken (1972, satires) or Erlaubte Freiheiten (1975, aphorisms). His Enthuellung des nackten Kaisers (1970) starts with A (Aufrichtigkeit = sincerity), in an ironic paraphrase of Andersen’s fairy tale about Emperor’s new clothes, and ends with Z (Zensur = censorship, Zitat = quotation). Alle Macht den Spionen (1978) and Dabeisein ist nicht alles (1980) are books of satirical advice on love, child rearing, women, TV, literature, politics, books, and other topics. So far it seems his humor has not reached English speaking readers, though his Olympic stories are timely now. We could even consider a good belly laugh a part of any physical fitness program. ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★A News Received Physician’s Farewell Dr. Karel Steinbach, an 88-year-old general practitioner and gynecologist, has retired from his job at Brooklyn’s Fort Hamilton induction station, where he processed every woman who applied to the armed forces from the city and Nassau, Suffolk and Putnam Counties since 1965. Before that, Dr. Steinbach was an Army civilian physician on Governors Island after emigrating from Czechoslovakia in 1949. Why retire now? he was asked. “Because of driving the Brooklyn Queens highway,’’ he said yesterday from his home in Jackson Heights, Queens. Failing vision, coupled with dark winter mornings, had made it dangerous, he explained. He avoided forced retirement at age 65 by working for a daily fee of $100. He is proud of several army citations for his low rate of “mistakes” (approving an applicant with a hidden medical condition). By his count, he has examined 60,000 applicants; Army officials could confirm only 56,000. He will continue his private practice, tending to such Czechoslovak artists as Rudolf Firkusny, the pianist; Rafael Kubelik, the conductor, and Jarmila Novotna, a retired opera singer. What will Fort Hamilton do without him? “We’re replacing him with a 76-year-old,” said Lieut. Col. Edward Gross, the station commander. The New York Times, Friday, January 14, 1983. Dr. Steinbach was born in Trebsko near Pribram on June 8, 1894. He graduated as M.D. from Charles University in 1920. However, medicine was not his only interest. He became a friend of many outstanding Czechoslovak public and artistic personalities. He remembers, and often lectures on the years of the First Republic when he was in personal contact with President Masaryk, Jan Masaryk, the writers Karel and Josef Capek and others who created the now vanished democratic spirit of pre-Munich Czechoslovakia. ★ ★ ★ The International Palladium Medal Award Dinner The Societe de Chimie Industrielle awarded the International Palladium Medal to Thomas G. Gibian, President and Chief Executive Officer, Henkel Corporation, at a dinner in his honor on Wednesday, May 11, 1983 in New York City. 21 [pageend21]This prestigious international award was presented to Mr. Gibian in recognition of his many contributions in the United States and abroad in the furtherance of understanding and cooperation within the chemical professions and the chemical industries. Mr. Gibian’s work has enhanced the aims and objectives of the American Section and its French parent organizaton. This award is presented biennially to an individual for outstanding contributions to the world chemical industry. Thomas G. Gibian, SVU member, was born in Prague. He received his B.S. (Chemistry) from the University of North Carolina in 1942 and earned his Ph.D. from Carnegie-Mellon University in 1948. ★ ★ ★ Wilber Czech Festival In the last issue we had information about the 1982 Wilber Czech Festival. We received the notice that the 22nd Annual Czech Festival will take place this year on Saturday and Sunday, August 6 and 7. The theme is “Czech Beauty and Romance.” An art show, Czechoslovak travelogue, parades, a historical pageant, various contests, ethnic folk dances and other attractions are on the program. Dr. Larry Mitchell is President of the event. Mr. Joe T. Vosoba, Attorney at Law, who sent the data in his function as one of the organizers invites SVU members and friends of Czechoslovak culture to attend. For more information write to Irma Ourecky, Box 652, Wilber, NE 68465; phone (402) 821-2485. We do not know yet who will be the recipient of the King Charles Award in 1983, but have the following data about the 1981 awardee (World- Herald, July 19, 1981): Czechs Honor Lincoln Doctor Wilber, Neb. - The Nebraska Czechs of Wilber have selected Lincoln neurosurgeon Dr. Louis J. Gogela as this year’s recipient of the annual King Charles Award... Gogela, a native of Omaha whose parents came to the United States from Czechoslovakia, received his bachelor’s, master’s and doctor of medicine degrees from the University of Nebraska. He served a fellowship at the Mayo Clinic where he received a master’s degree in neurosurgery from the University of Minesota, and has been a clinical instructor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center... The 1982 awardee, newspaperman Vladimir Kucera of Lincoln was introduced in the last Bulletin. ★ ★ ★ Judaica The Smithsonian Institute will present a Judaica Collection from Czechoslovakia, starting September 1983. A $25,000 grant from the United Jewish Endowment Fund (UJEF) will make possible, in part, “Project Judaica: The Precious Legacy,” an international loan exhibition of old world Judaica from the Czechoslovak State Collection. Project Judaica represents the culmination of a 15-year effort to bring to the United States a collection of Jewish ceremonial and folk art from Czechoslovakia originally gathered by the Nazis for their planned “Museum to an Extinct Race.” The Czechoslovak government has maintained the collection since the end of the Nazi rule. The planned exhibition marks the first time the government allowed part of the collection to leave the country. 22 [pageend22]Washington will be the first city to host the 333-object collection.

We are sure you will be pleased to learn that, at long last, Volume III of The Jews of Czechoslovakia has gone to press. This is the final, the longest and perhaps the most important volume in our trilogy. The editors of the Jewish Publication Society of America have been most enthusiastic about the project and tell us ihat the book will probably be on sale by this fall. We will inform you of the exact publication date. Following the publication of this book, the Society for the History of Czechoslovak Jews, Inc. intends to launch a program of scholarly and literary activities, researching and publishing additional material relating to Czechoslovak Jewry, past and present. We plan to do this in a form of a paperback yearbook that will be available not only to our membership but also to libraries, educational institutions and individual subscribers throughout the English-speaking world. We believe that in this manner the Society for the History of Czechoslovak Jews, Inc. can make a unique contribution to world Jewish historical studies.

We quote only the highlights. “When her mother died, Pablo Casals wrote a charming letter in French, reminding her that ‘music is a wonderful consolation.. .but not modern music!” She used to accompany James Joyce when he sang Schubert lieder for his family in their ‘very bourgeois’ house in Paris where everyone spoke only Italian. She danced ballet in the same company as Joyce’s daughter Lucia... She knew Marinetti, still an artistic force in the ‘20’s, and Russolo and Balia and others painters who took off from the Cubist style to portray motion and simultaneity on their canvases. Paris was full of ferment in those days, and everybody knew everybody. Podhajsky agreed to give dancing lessons to the painter Kokoschka and brought her gramophone to his flat, but he was sick. She came the next day and the next, but he was always sick, always with something different. Finally he told her that his genius was just too demanding to take on ballet. He did, however, write her regularly, and eventually she arranged for him to paint Thomas Masaryk, the first president of Czechoslovakia. The portrait hangs in Pittsburgh now. Zdenka Podhajsky has been living in Vienna as an Austrian citizen for the past 18 years. A tireless traveler, she is an unofficial agent for composers like Bohuslav Martinu and Leos Janacek and other artists. She is also translating the memoirs of her father, the late Gen. Alois Podhajsky, one of the top Austrian generals of World War I... Podhajsky is accustomed to famous musicians. Her mother, a singer and later an actress, had a salon in Vienna. The daughter still has a fan autographed by Brahms, Mahler, Honegger and Mascagni. She returned to Czechoslovakia after Paris, leaving the country legally in 1965 for Vienna a few years after her parents died. She has never married. Col. Alois Podhajsky who commanded the famous Lippizaner Spanish riding school in Vienna, rescued by General Patton in World War II is - ‘A cousin, a distant cousin,’ she says carelessly.” SVU Bulletin 75-70 199th Street Flushing, NY 11366 Return Postage Guaranteed Second Class Postage Paid at Washington, D.C. with additional entry at Flushing, NY 24 [pageend24]
