Vatican sources have said they are satisfied with the appointment as a first step toward restoring the church hierarchy in Slovakia.

Cyril and Methodius have applied themselves Io different goalsand objec- trvesset by (he 1994 Genera! Chapter. Now they are ki tn® process of evaluating these goals and forming new ones in lerms of Community and Church renewal. Among these goals which had priority in renewal efforts were those which pertained la their identity as Women in the Church. The Chapter Declaration on Theological Onantáliwu^teraled a statement which fountf^baSsin ihe example of their pawi£-Ss Cyril and Methodius. In part it staled: "We perceive our loyally end devotion to Ihe Church as unique strengths of our Congregation. Therefore, it is incumbent upon us to cherish and develop art ecOesiai understanding commensurate with the Church's own sell-understanding " To further (heir understanding ol Church and to develop contemporary Church-mmcfedness. the Sisters devoted a year apiece to studying selected Church documents. A Theolog ical Updating Committee was formed in Ihe community to help implement me goalsollheChapter. They initiated summer Institutes of Theology and Spirituality which locused on specific topics such as ecclesiology. the Eucharist. Poverty, and Ministry. They also presented a one-day seminar each summer on current social justice issues grounded in Church encyclicals or bishops' pastorals. The Church documenls chosen lor rniense communal Study were: Lumen Gentium fDogmaüc $cnsMutfon on the Church/ Geudiu/n et Spes (Pastoral Constitution Oh the Church in the Modem Worid): Stavorum Apoštoli (In Com- memoretitm oi the Eleventh Centenary ol the Evangafäng Work of Saints Cyril and Methodius), and Redamptorts Maier (Mother 0/ the Redeemer). 0'1- ferent members ol the Theology Updating Cammillee. all of whom have degrees in either theology or religious studies, studied the documents and lormulated guiding queätons which were geared both at understanding the documents key features and al making applications Io community mission and Inung, They published these m leallet form for community use. including appropriate para-lrturgical services.

From preliminary questionnaire responses it seems that the communal study and practical sharings have helped the Sisters as a group to better grasp ihe Church's contemporary sell- understanding in terms of diiiereni models, such as.

We are particularly concerned with ihe unprecedented attack on ils own loyal citizens Ihat the Communist regime launched on March the 25lh, the day Ihat has come to be known as "Bratislava's Good Friday" since it was a protest over the curtailment ol religious rights as well as civil rights. 1) We would like the Canadian government to lake a strong position against Iha! violation ol human * rights in the homeland of our ancestors. The government has done so. courageously, in tite case of other countries with totalitanan and oppressive regimes and . we should wish that it would do the same in this case. I All the more so in that in this case, many of ihose op I pressed are the brothers and sisters, ihe lathers and L mothers, the cousins and friends, of those whom we Hr represent here. Some of us are third-and fourth-gen- I eration Canadians whose ancestors came here many I years ago to escape ihe oppression of the old imperial I orders, some of us have arrived only recently to I escape Ihe oppression ol the new Imperialists. Thal I oppression was never made more dear than on I Bratislava's Good Friday, and the lie that there are tun I ovi I and religious rights in communist Czecho-Stovakia I was never rare exposed as lhal day I We feel it would be appropriate for the Canadian I government to express its disapproval of this behavior, I and its interest because of Ihe effects on Canadians of Slovak descent We do not feel this would confute interference in ihe internal affairs of another nation, but would be an entirely fitting ad ol moral integrity. There will be no change for the better m any nation if we in the free countries stand by passively and allow such things to pass without comment. 2) The Canadians we represent would wish that our government would exert pressure on the govern- mentsof the Slovak Socialist Republic and the federal government of the C-SSR to honor Internationa) agreements ihey have themselves signed We feel that in particular, the free exchange of literature and cultural materia) is being hampered at every turn Thisis particularly Irueot religious literatura and religious materials. The government there, in its typically collectivist thinking, does not treat the phenomenon ol religious belici as a matter of individual rights and personal conscience. but as something to be institutionalized and therefore regulated and controlled. This is contrary to ihe thinking ol any decent and free person, religious or not. Control of personal thought and the pnvate actions of private persons in their own homes is not. in any just society, wiihin the purview of the state.

Chat his does NOT in any way represent the true culture of Slovakia. Still, Canada is a Iree country and we raise ab- soluiely no objection to this situation. In the free market ot ideas, the truth will always have the most value We would like the Canadian government to insist Ihat literature concerning religion and the social and political culture of Slovaks, as seen from the perspective of those of us living in a Western democratic society, be given exactly the same freedom ol entry into ihe Slovak Socialist Republic as hs literature is given here No less, no more. 3) in ihis connection, we would ask the Canadian government to insist that the Communist regime of Czecho-Slovakia live up to its obligations under international postal agreements. And that Canada Post streamline its own ivestigalivs procedures and be more persistent in seeing that mail addressed to individuals in the Slovak Socialist Republic actually is delivered in a timely manner. And that posial regulations not be abused in such a way to contradict the spirit ol the Helsinki accords We have had frequent complaints from Canadian Slovak individuals and publishers ot periodicals, journals, and religious material that mail-addressed lo private persons in Slovakia is subject 10 mysterious disappearances Or it amves many months too late Or dearty tampered with.

Needless to say. in a regime as oppressive as that in the C SSR. many individuals are reluctant to pul in writing that they subscribe to. and expect to get. such and such a journal from the West.

KRAJSA, KSGG CATHOLICS IN SLOVAKIA THEY SUFFERED THE BLOWS OF THEIR ADVERSARIES THE LETTER OF 68 PRIESTS OF THE KOSICE DIOCESE SENT TO THE PRIME MINISTER OF SLOVAKIA, PETER COLOTKA. ON 15TB APRIL 1986. Mr. Pclcr Colotka Prime Minister of the Slovak Socialist Republic. Bratislava Dear Sir. The news about the brutal police dispersion of a peaceful gathering of demonstrating Christians assembled at the Hviezdoslav Square in Bratislava on 25th March. 1988, hurt us deeply. These Christian laymen at the Hviezdoslav Square were brought together by a cause, which is of concern to us. the priests, loo All sincere Catholics in our country desire io have as their bishops men of such qualities as to be acceptable to the Holy See. It is our conviction that the Holy Father Is the most competent judge to decide what qualities are required of men in such responsible positions. Together with those who were violently dispersed on 25th March, we too rise our voices and demand full religious freedom and full respect for human and civil rights for all our cifizens. The Second Vatican Council declared: "11 civil government exceeds its powers and oppresses its citizens, the citizens are bound to comply with the rules only as far as it serves the common good. However, they should be permitted Lo defend their and their fellow- citizens' rights against the abuses of the government." (Gaudium et Spes. 74) In the light of the above declaration the faithful have every right to peaceful demonstrations. On 25th March they assembled in prayer, they did not attack or offend anybody. They pleaded for those legitimate rights which had been denied to them for the past 40 years. Those rights are guaranteed by the Constitution. The 29th paragraph of the 19S0 Constitution states; "In accordance with the Interests of the working class, the freedom of expression. especially the freedom cf press and Speech, are guaranteed in all areas of public life. The citizens enjoy these freedoms as the means of their personal development and creative effort, and as the means of active participation In the governing of the state and in Its economic and cultural growth. The Constitution guarantees also the freedom of assembly, the freedom of street marches and demonstrations. These freedoms are guaranteed in such a way that the working people and their organizations have at their disposal publishing houses, printeries. public buildings, halls, open spaces, as well as broadcasting, television and other communication media facilities." Therefore, we protest most resolutely against the violent and brutal measures taken by the police against a peaceful demonstration at the Hviezdoslav Square in Bratislava on 25th March. 1988. The demonstrators — In agreement with the UN Charter and the Declaration of Human Rights — requested the appointment of worthy bishops to all vacant dioceses In Czecho slovakia, greater religious freedom and full respect for human rights of all people in our land. We unanimously declare that this brutal action of the police was an abuse cf power against the people and a gross violation of the 28ih paragraph of our Constitution. We would like lo believe, Mr. Prime Minister. that it is within your power to take Ihe necessary action and to prevent any further acts of violence by the police against the faithful citizens exercising their constitutional rights. Please, try to do your utmost to remove from our souls the uneasy feeling that we are the victims of unJustice. Only the awareness, that we. the faflhful citizens, enjoy full religious freedom, will make us and all the people into keener and more enthusiastic participants in the making oi a real democratic society Sincerely yours: The priests of the Kosice diocese (68 signatures) Copies io: Franustk Cardinal Tomasek Bishop Jan Chrysostom Korec All episcopal offices in Czechoslovakia THE LETTER OF BISHOP KOREC TO THE PRIESTS OF THE KOSICE DIOCESE My dear brethren in Christ, With gratitude I received your letter in defense of dur faithful citizens who assembled on 2bth March — on the least of the Annunciation of the Lord — in frotilof the Slovak National Theatre In Bratislava. There, in their prayers and hymns they expressed their devotion io the Church and pul forward some demands essentia] for her existence. As IL would be most distressing If a priest was to condemn this action, so it is pleasing to see the priests standing by their faithful and defending them by wise, true ind man-becoming words In doing so. Ihe priests are prompted by such Chrlstianvirtues as justice and courage and are fulfilling the role ofChrist theGood Shepherd who—unlike the hireling — does not desert his sheep. The priestly duties include prayers, mass, spreading of the Gospel message, forgiveness and willingness to suffer persecution for justice's sake. Our Lord is the supreme model of these virtues. But li would be somewhat one-sided to sec the Gospel and the life of the Church as nothing else but a humble and passive suffering or a stlent prayer. The faithful have full rights to truth andjustice in the spirit of the Gospel. (Gaudium el Spes. 75. 76) When Jesus was inteu egated by Annas, and one of the soldiers struck his face, the patient Saviour objected: "Why did you strike me?” (John. 18. 23) Our faithful citizens gathered in Bratislava in the spirit of faith and conducted themselves with great dignity Silently they suffered the blows of their adversaries. We admire their dedication to (hr church and we condemn the unjust violence perpetrated against them. If you. our priests, continue to grow in faith and prayer, in fidelity to the Apostolic Church, in truth and Justice. If you live in the unity of love and peace, you would be able Co lead your flock to a deeper and more fervent Ufe of faith. Then the Church in Slovakia — and also in Bohemia and Moravia — can look forward to its future without any fear. The Lord Himself Wil] be her protector. In Him as our Father — through the Son and In the Holy Spirit — we have certain hope that after several decades of waiting, the priests and the faithful of all Slovak dioceses — including the diocese of Kosice — will receive I heir worthy bishops who will be true successors of the Apostle® In this Marian year we ore encouraged to hope in the intercession of the Sorrowful Mother, our good and powerful Patroness. Yours in Risen Christ; Jan Chrysostom Koreo Bratislava. 22nd April 1988 IN PRAISE OF ELLIOTT ABRAMS Michael Novak Among the men and women in American public life to be most admired by their fellow citizens are those who bear with bravery and distinction the heat of the hottest battles and the longest days, and in the State Department this includes. above all. Elliott Abrams, the Assistant Secretary ofState for Inter-American Affairs, it is good to thank them while, they still are active. The front Une of Soviet expansionism has for a decade now been Latin America, via Cuba and Nicaragua. On these matters, the American people are deeply divided- Partisan passions run high. Crises in Central America have been daily front-page news since at least the Panama Canal Treaty of 1978. under Jimmy Carter. Not even a "do-nothing“ leader of U-S. policy could today escape controversy. Elliott Abrams has been a "can do” leader. He is brave. He is tough. He is smart. He persists. Obviously. Elliott Abrams is under daily fire, as will be his successor In the next administration. To serve in the government of the United States these days is to be brutally attacked often. One’s whole Efe's work is smeared, one'scharacter. one's family name- The experience is horrifying. Few con tin tie under It with such Indomitable cheer as Elliott Abrams. His colleagues, career officers 0Í many years' experience, openly admire three secrets about Elliott Abrams — and some of them even know a fourth and most Important secret. The first secret is Abrams' character under adversity. "The pressure during ihe Iran- Contra hearings would have crushed most.” a veteran at State says. “EllioLt's ability to withstand pressure is exceptional." Another says: "Elliott is amazing. Whether he has just suffered a policy setback or a harsh, personal attack. he's back in the office the next mor ning at 7 a.m.. bright and enthusiastic,” The second secret Is that Abrams speaks good Spanish, knows Latin America in detail, and admires the democratic vitality of Latin Americans- He absolutely never patronizes them. He tells the truth man-to- man, no pretense- He is direct and honest. Both elected leaders and opposition leaders telephone him directly, often at his home He knows their problems in detail. In Brazil recently, a major paper published a longand detailed interview with Mr. Abrams. evoking broad acclaim for Abrams' precision of detail and largcmindcdne$$. And for his humor, too: The reporter asked in which Latin American city Abrams would like to live? Without blinking. Abrams replied. "Miami.” Some Latin Americans don't like Abrams' quickness and directness. Abrams doesn't ask tobe liked. His task Is tocldrify U.S. interests and intentions. FROM OUR JEDNOTA HISTORY By Anthony X.

Have you ever known a person who always has something to say whether it makes sense or not? Whenevei a conversation is going on. this person always bulls in and gives you his version or account of a story. Whenever there is a discussion which involves a listener and a speaker, this person Is always doing Ihe speaking, it seems that he is always trying to Impress someone. If you think about it. there would have been many times that this same person would have, come across to others as wise If he bad just kept quiet. The Holy Scriptures saw this trait ihousands of years ago when the writer of Proverbs stated that "When words are many. $in is not absent, but he who holds his tongue is vise." (Proverbs 10:191 and ' Even a fool is thought wise if he keeps silent, and discerning if he holds his tongue." (Proverbs 17-28). I like those two verses and the deep meanings that they present to us even today. Reflect over these verses the next time you're confronted with a decision as to whether it is best to voice your (expert?) opinion or to keep your mouth shut. Ask yomsclf the hard soul- searching question "Which alternative would better serve my listcner(s)?" The Slovak-American community often found iuelfln a difficult position during World War II- There was Benes's government in exile which wanted to reestablish the old prewar-Czecho- Slovakia and there were individuals and groups who accused ihe Slovak-Americans of supporting the Slovak State of Father Tiso officially at war with the United States. As Philip Hrobak. editor of JEDNOTA, wrote In 1942. "Slovaks are being blamed for everything except Pear) Harber and therubber shortage. They are called separatists and worse things.” Ail of this was untrue Thera was never any question of Slovak-American loyalty to the United States and the war effort yet the attacks continued. Hrc- bak referred to this as the "smear campaign'' waged by the enemies of Slovak Independence. The main concern of the First Catholic Slovak Union and other Slovak societies was over the future of Slovakia in postwar Europe. Hrobak and others wanted a free Slovakia, a state where the rights of the Slovak nation would be respected and guaranteed. Thus they refused tp support the Benes government In exile which advocated the re creation of the First Czechoslovak Republic. This concern over postwar Slovakia was the cause of controversy- In August. 1942 a special meeting of the Slovak societies and Slovak editors was called in Harrisburg. Pa., by the Office of War Information (O.W.L) to better coordinate the war effort At this meeting, attended by Hrobak. a resolution was drawn up condemning all discussion of postwar governments In Europe until final victory' had been achieved. The resolution men- toned Nazism and fascism, but not communism. Hrobak objected to this. When he asked why communism could not be included, he was told that you could not mention communism, "because you would get into trouble." He was told "not to confuse aid to Russia with aid in communism. Another meeting of the Slovak societies was held the following month In Pittsburgh. The meeting was presided over by Michael Vargovieh. President of the First Catholic Slovak Union. Allan Cranston. Chief of the Foreign Language Division of the Office of War information, was present, Cranston asked the representatives of the various Slovak societies to stop arguing among themselves over Czechoslovakia and to devote themselves to winning the war- A resolution pledging allegiance to the United States passed unanimously. A second resolution, however, was the cause of much debate, it read. " ... in the Czechoslovakia of old. the Slovaks rather than being accepted as equals by their brother Czechs, were too often treated as a subject people in derogation of their rights and privileges as equal partnera in the Republic." The two Slovak communists present. President of the Neu! Yorksky Denník. and Rev. Mr- J Pelikan. President of the Slovak National Alliance, demanded that the resolution be changed or deleted. Cranton warned Chat if the resolution was adopted he would leave the meeting řince it was out of his Jurisdiction, and he added that anyone who endorsed It would have io register as a foreign agent. The majority present, however. voted for the resolution and Cranston left Ihe room Later Cranston was asked to rttum and the resolution was changed to read. "Whereasin the word of the President of the Untied Slates we believe that any nationality. no matter how small, has the Inherent right to its own nationhood . . . " This seemed to satisfy most of those present. This Is only one example of the problems faced by the First Catholic Slovak Union, the Slovak League of America, and other Slovak societies during the war. It was clear to all that Benes's government In exile and Its allies were in a position of power during those years. Their propaganda was one of several enemies the Slovak-Amerlcans had to deal with in the 1940s. period- "Elliott Abrams." says Armando Valladares., Cuban poet and author of Against All Hope, "is one of the most knowledgeable experts in the problems of the Latin American countries. He has the necessary aggressiveness to represent the United States Ln that position like no other. I am proud of the friendship of a man like him." Abrams' third secret, says a career officer aL Slate who initially was skeptical, "has not been discovered by the press: Elliott is an ideologue about democracy. He is for democracy in Paraguay and Chile. He has defended democratic Peru and Guatemala from serious coup attempts. Abrams is for democracy in Nicaragua. El Salvador, and Cuba. Elliott Abrams' passion is democracy." "In Latin America there are ' five people who hate Elliott Abrams most." another veter. an at State says. "Castro and Ortega are on the list. But right up at the Lop arc Noriega. Pinochet. and Stroessner' There you have them: the five remaining dictators in thia hemisphere. Under Ronald Reagan. there have been no military coups in Latin America, and the rising tide of democracy in the world may be President Reagan's most enduring legacy — from South Korea and the Philippines, to nearly a dozen nations In Latin America and the Caribbean. As assistant secretary of International Organizations, then of Human Rights, and finally of Inter-American Affairs. Elliott Abrams has done a good deal of the legwork for this "democratic revolution." Hfs successor will have a tough act to fallow. Yet nothing in Abrams' ler- ritory comes easily; setbacks are many. Governor Dukakis now challenges the alleged "deal" to drop drug indictments in exchange for General Noriega's surrender of power. Abrams replies: "That's silly. Today those Indictments cannot be enforced, and General Noriega Is ruling Panama. If we can use those Indictments to force Noriega to surrender power and get out of Panama, that's a very good outcome that □pens the door to democracy in Panama. What democrat opposes that?" Should Americans oust Noriega by using the 10.000 American troops already In Panama, with reinforcements? Many Americans would not support that. Mr. Abrams is left to find another path. Abrams has made mistakes, but he prides himself on admitting them quickly, apologizing for them, and working harder to make up for them. He fears no Intellectual fight. Rigorous hontsLy is his best asset, and if he doesn't hit a point on the head al first he'll always come back to it and clarify. Light doesn’t frighten him. Then there is the Assistant Secretary's fourth secret. Recent newspaper accounts in Baltimore and Miami mention it: it's the heart of the matter: Secretary of Stale George Shultz and President Ronald Reagan like Elliott Abrams a lot. Who wouldn't? A clear analyst. of complex realities, who stays calm and cheerful as rhetorical bombs explode around him, who doesn't ask to be loved or thanked, but who keeps plodding toward his goal: the establishment of practical, working democrats among all Latin American peoples who urgently desire them. These are the goals of the President and of the nation. The citizens of the United Slates owe Elliott Abrams a lot for enduring long days and the torrid heat of criticism, inorder to make the fate or democracy happier at the end of his service then when he began. Even against lesser odds, let his future successors do better — if they can. He's set the mark.

"These kids are scared, confused bored with lack of recreational activihcs. They are anxious about the future and not sure what's going to happen to them . . . and there Is virtually nothing being said about" their plight, said Father Leonard Depasquale. a priest of the Con- solata Society of the Foreign Missions who is refugee chaplain for the Diocese of Brownsville. Texas. The border patrol has been apprehending Juveniles In the Port Isabel area for years, but last fall federal authorities began locking up 10 to 12 Juveniles a week, the priest said in an Interview In mld^May. Until then, he said. Lhe bor- I der patrol had released the juveniles — 'unaccompanied minors" — to local church agencies which offered shelter and helped locale relatives. Now the youths are Incarcerated at the Port Isabel detention center for up to 16 days before being transferred to Immigration and Naturalization Service detention centers in Laredo or Houston. Father De- Pasquale said. A move by INS to contract with private organizations to open a Juvenile holding center in June in the nearby town of Los Fresncs had the priest especially troubled, ’ At any one time, al least 250 undocumented juveniles are held in INS facilities nationwide. said Duke Austin. [NS spokesman. "We certainly don't want to detain children." Austin said in an interview. “This is an anguishing situation for us." he said. In many cases, according to Austin, the unaccompanied minors are offspring of "par- f ents who split. left behind their children and came north, but now refuse to come forward to claim their children." "The laws aren't written (that) if you're under a certain age and come in illegally you've got a right to remain here." he said. Children whose parents are still In their homeland may opt for immediate voluntary departure or choose to remain In detention and pursue legal means to stay in the United -States. Austin said. Nancy Schulz, coordinator of children's services for the , U.S. Catholic Conference's division of Migration and Refugee Services, said in an Interview that on a nationwide basis INS is "much more humane" to detained juveniles than the agency was years ago. recalling incidents including "body cavity searches of minors." Nevertheless, ahe said, hy locking them up. "we are handling Lhe children as If they - were perpetrators when we should be looking at them as ' victims." They are victims. Ms. Schulz said, of "a system lhal has forced them to come here, of parents who sent them out or told them to follow them (to the United Stales)." INS attempted in vain to contract with church organizations to run with new Juvenile facility in Les Fresnos. said Father DePasquale. Catholic agencies probably do a much better Job than INS of housing the Juveniles, said Ms. Schulz. "But what you’re doing (by signing such a contract) is holding the Juveniles for INS. You become bait for the parents who may be here illegally." she said. Austin said it is INS policy to only release detained Juveniles to immediate family members or court appointed guardians. But last year In California. as a result of an out-of-court agreement with the regional INS director. INS released 24 teenage boys who had been detained for Illegal entry Into the United States to the personal custody of Archbishop Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles. And Bishop Rene H. Graclda of Corpus Christi. Texas, said in an interview lhal his diocese and INS have a good working relationship with regard to release of Juveniles. "The border patrol will bring minors on their own lo La Frontera la shelter run by the diocese in Larcda). Any undocumented who shows up at our door we will shelter without calling INS. INS respects that and they will not enter our building." he said He attributed INS cooperation to his opposition to the sanctuary movement, an organized network of church workers who publicly deft U.S. law by giving shelter to Salvadorans ancj Guatemalans. But the bishop said La Frontera also shelters bartered women end undocumented adults and can only offer shelter to a percentage of juveniles detained by INS In Laredo. The rest are locked up at the "Joovy" — short for Juvenile detention center — on the edge of town. Austin said cooperative agreements with churches are the exception rather than the rule. "It would be naive of us to believe every church groupjs honest .. . How liable do you think the federal government would be if something happened to one of the children (In church custody]? Very Hable. I would think," he said. According to Bishop Gracl- da. the detained Juveniles are part of a "continuous (low of teenagers from south of the border." "They come most often on foot or hitching rides. They usually have nothing but the clothes on their backs. They like to cross (the border) at Laredo because there 1s a lot of train activity out of Laredo. They come to catch a train north to a big city — to Chicago. Detroit. New York or Dallas." Bishop Gracida said The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act had no effect on the number of youths crossing the border, said Rox- anna B- Guerra, executive director of Catholic Social Services in Laredo. It's business as usual. The hunger doesn't stop, the unemployment doesn't end Just because a law is passed." she said- Among those currently staying al La Frontera, said Mrs. Guerra, are three young men who lost limbs attempting to climb aboard moving trains on their journeys north. "Sometimes 1 wonder when It's going to end," she said.

Father Joseph Margas* genius must not be forgotten and deserves to be repeated, in 1905 this Slovak immigrant priest, pastor of Sacred Heart Slovak Church. Wilkes-Barre. Pa., patented a method of wireless communication using the rotary spark gap. He startled the scientific world with a demonstration of his revolutionary system of wireless telegraphy leading the way to radio broadcasting as we know It today. The historic demonstration took place between specially erected transmission towers In Wilkes-Barre and Scranton. Pa. Guglielmo Marconi of Italy, credited with inventing wireless telegraphy, came to Wilkes-Barre to consult with Fr Murgas and used many of his ideas to perfect his own system. Fr. Murgas' Invention out-performed the famous Marconi system, then used by ships at sea and for over-water communication, but it was not effective over land. Fr. Murgas sold his patent to a firm in Philadelphia and used the money to build America'a first radio towers. This was the role that a Slovak immigrant played in the development of the radio. “This is in response to Helen Lasko's letter In the May 4th issue of JEDNOTA that appeared in 'Jednota Tolk/ It has been proven, the best way to get changes In programs is from the inside. My suggestion to Helen Is to become a member of the Slovak Day Committee that sponsors the event at Kenny- wood Park. It may be of interest to her that the majority of the members arc women. "To begin with, almost all cf the subcommittees are predominantly women with the exception of the games handled by a husband/wife team, the kitchen sales by two men and the Mass under the Jurisdiction of a priest. "One of the chief complaints heard is. let's cut down (time wise) on some of the acknowledgements given for people-work done. ”Jf Helen has attended the Slovak Picnic activities, she would have noticed the part our women played in making the past 64 Annual Picnics the successes they were. For example, the many days of preparation of the foods served in the Slovak Kitchen; the women’s activities In the craft work and displays: their work with the children in the Game Area: the selling of ads and tickets for the day'irpark activities: handling t£e performers in the Hance groups; and finally the clean-up work that is always necessary afterwards. "In passing, may I add. the Madam President. Secretary, and Treasurer are women. And. if Helen considers the above as excluding women. 1 can only wonder what she may have in mind with the statement. T. for one. will not continue to support functions which exclude women.' Hopefully, the younger generation will notice this and become active in the many areas where we Slovaks are promoting our Slovak heritage. "So now. let's forget all this, come on out and join us halfdozen guys and forty women members who will make the 6oth Annual Slovak Day Picnic successful and those following Into the twenty-first century." — WilUam R.

Da the Slovak Americans need. a Chair of Slovak Stadies? — Considering the limited and distorted knowledge of Slovak history, culture and the national aspirations of ihr Slovak nation in the world, especially In the United States. Canada. England and some other countries which will one day decide again the future of Slovakia, there Is hardly any other nation which would need a chair of Studiesac some western university with such urgency as wc Slovaks do. Until the Second World War. there was no book in a Western language which presented objectively Slovak culturg. the history and national aspirations of the Slovak people except for a few chapters tn Scotus Viator's book Racial Problems in Hungary (1908) and in C.A. Macartney's book Hungary and her Successors (1937). The Slovaks did not exist in Hungarian or Czech propaganda as a distinct nation with its own language, history and culture, and If they were mentioned, they were presented as a poor, backward people who needed to be ruled — before 1918 by the Hungarians and then by the Czechs During and after the Second World War anll-SIcvak propaganda was especially violent and to this day there are many misconceptions about Slovakia and the Slovaks even in scholarly works. A chair of Slovak Studies would help to correei this linage and acquaint the world and Slovak generations bom or educated abroad with Slovakia In a scholarly way. This would be done systematically and as long as the university, at which such a chair is established will exist. There is hardly a belter way lo help the Slovak Americans and Slovakia today. The Slovak Foundation. Inc., comprised of five Slovak fraternal societies, including the First Catholic Slovak Union, is doing Just that at the University of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh, Pa. To promote the Slovak language, culture, history, and the knowledge of national aspirations is well on its way.

GOSPEL Mark 14.7 2-16, 22-26/165 On the first day of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the paschal lamb, the disciples said to Jesus. "Where do you wish US to go to prepare the Passover supper for you?" He scnl two of his disciples with these instructions: "Go Into the city and you will come upon a man carrying a waler jar. Follow him. Whatever house he enters, say to the owner, 'The Teacher asks. Where is my guestroom where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?' Then be will show you an upstairs room, spacious, furnished, and all in order. That is the place you are to gel ready for us " The disciples went off. When they reached the city they found It Just as he told them, and they prepared the Passover supper. During the meal he took bread, blessed and broke It. and gave it to them. "Take this." he said, "this Is my body." He likewise took a cup. gave thanks and passed It to them, and they oil drank from it. He said to them; "This Ismy blood, the blood orthcconvenani to be poured out on behalf of many. I solemnly assure you.

WEDNESDAY, JUNE 1, 1988 LIGHT ONE CANDLE Jt is better ío light one candle than to curse the darkness. (Christopher Motto) By Father John Catoir Director of The Christophers An Addiction Cure That Works Twenty-four years ago Ln Sienna. Italy, a priest named Don Pierion Gelmtni started a movement to rehabilitate drug addicts More than 25&f9Oftjjeople have passed through the program and they boast^p/a^KJwÄire rate. After a month in a special detoxification center, tfie addict lives tn a comm unity [never more than 35 members to a house). Then begins a three-year-perlůd of spartan living. The movement buys old houses and rebuilds and reconditions them. Each community is self supporting- Residents become bakers, gardeners and laborers. Their diet is simple, mostly vegetables and pasta: only once or twice a week do they have a cup of coffee, some meat and one glass of wine. Arter the first three months the family of the resident is allowed to visit every other Sunday; after six months residentscan spend a weekend with their family. For entertainment there is sports, books, music, and a little TV. This program has been so successful that the Catholic Church in Italy has encouraged it. and many dioceses have provided money and housing facilities. A similar program is being started in France. The high success rate is based on an iron-clad discipline and recourse to prayer. Here are the rules signed by each addict who enters the program; 1. I promise to respect every rule of the community as soon as 1 am admitted. 2. No drugs, no pharmaceutical products, no personal money-1 accept the contra! that will operate as soon as 3- Very little tobacco; not more than 10 cigarettes a day. 4. No violence, no aggressive attitudes. If I do not respect others 1 shall be excluded from the community. 5. The use or transistor radios and TV Is left to the discretion of the leaders. I shall never have recourse to them during working hours or when 1 am alone. 6. No form of isolation, alone or with others, shall be tolerated; life in community is founded on sharing. 7. Sexual encounters are forbidden. 8. The schedule established by the community must be respected- 9. No smoking in the rooms where silence Is the rule. 10. During the first month there will be dally meetings of Lhe group; later, they will take place three times a week. It's a tough discipline but It works. Prayer is very mucha part of the healing process but It Is never forced. The waiting list Is long because the addicts know their very lives and even their irrnpor- taJ souls are at stake. Perhaps such a program Is worth looking Into for American youngsters. Fora free copy of thcChriawpher News Notts.

There are many Slovaks and Jednoia members In this area who are very interested in Ihe growth Df cur Society both tn members/np and assets. As usual, we will near those voices in our Society which again will complain mat Board of Directors meetings should be held in Cleveland. Ohio, or (ha! traveling to the West Coast is toe expensive. To these observations might i.asPresfdem olour Society, state trial it hae been me policy of our Society to treat all of our membership with equal representation, and it would be grossly unfair to our total membership if our Board of Directors were Io meet only in the City of Cleveland, or Youngstown, or Pittsburgh. All members of our Society are to be treated equally, and we must, if we are a fraternal organization, meet periodically in different cities in which we have Society membership to make these ara« more aware ot out presence, our interest in their specific areas, and their scecfc problems. To those who maintain Ihat traveling to a distant city incurs increased cost lo the Society, might I point out that travel to the San Diego area today is just as expensive as a trip from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Chicago. Illinois, or from Cleveland, Ohio, to Middletown, Pennsylvania Soto those in our membership who tee! that the Board of Directors' travels to cities outside ot Cleveland is an inordinate expense, tel me allay those fears by stating that any increased costs are far outweighed by the public relations benefits Obtained by visiting different areas periodically, areas that have not been visited by members ol our Society for many, many years in welcoming me Board of Directors to the San Diego area, permit me to indicate that Ihe Jednoia membership in California has done an outstanding job in representing Slovak interests in me United States and [pageend8]■ JEDNOTA, WEDNESDAY. JUNE 1. 1988 Paře 9 MINUTES OF ANNUAL MEETING OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE FIRST CATHOLIC SLOVAK UNION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND CANADA Canada, and many prominent Slovak leaders, who are also Jednota members, reside in foe State of California. Mr Ray Piutko. whose column on geneotogy appears in our JEDNOTA newspaper, originally comes from the California area, but now resides in Colorado. Mrs. El Nora Rusnak, who resides here m San Diego, has been very active in putting on the yduth programs eminalmg from Iha State oi California and which have appeared at the Youth Festivals of Ihe Slovak World Congress Mrs Rusnak has been highly instrumental in forming and training the Slovak Heritage Dancers of San Diego, which.is the only recognized Slovak Folk Dance Group in Ihe State of California Our Socrety has two branches in the State of California. We have 114 members m these two branches. During this week we will have an opportunity lo meet with the officers ol these branched Ol Our First Catholic Slovak Union, and discuss with them (heir needs for expanding our membership in this area The Membership and Marketing Department will also have ihe epportunhy ol presenting a seminar io those groups which would tike to participate In i his educational program while we are visiting ihe San Diego area I sincerely hope and pray that our visit to San Diego will be an ex- Iremely productive meeting for this Board ot Directors. As we discuss the annual financial statement ot our Society lor 1987. our progress in Ihe im- plomoniarion cl our corporation concept, and cur outreach to our younger membeiship through collage programs Such as the language and literature program at (he University of Pittsburgh, let us also exert oui best efforts to solidify our relationships with cur California membership and all potential new California membership from among the Slovak population residing here. There is great promise jor increased membership in our wesiern stetes. of , Let us. as a Board ol Directors, pul into effect those programs which will increase ih y membership by stimulating greater interest in product sales by our recommenders, by programs which educate our recommenders to the quantity and quality a/ dur products, and to fhe programs of our Society which prompte Paternalism, and the interests of the Slovaks as a people and as a nation Let us pray, that during Ibis week, we will be the beneficiaries of the wisdom which we pray foe Holy Spin! will endow upon all ot us who participate ai this Board ol Directors Meeting. We pray also that the Stovák community in San Diego and all of our local officers in this state will continue their efforts in behali of the Firsl Catholic Slovak Union, and in behalf of our Slovak Community nationwide.

FR CHARLES E HAWKINS. OS.B. Exhibit #5 Report of the President 1987! What a year! A stock market Crash rivaling |rfe stock ma’kei collapse ol 1929, A balance of trade showing the highest deficit trade balance in American history. The value of the American dollar at all-time tows. The price of gold dropping. Oil prices dropping and oil becoming a glut on the world market. The forecasi ol an economic recession or downturn racing throughout ihe equity markets But yet. lor Ihe First Catholic Slovak Union, 1987 was a very good yeat The First Catholic Slovak Union suffered no financial setbacks during the stock market collapse ol October 19. 1987, lor one váry simple reason — the First Calhoiic Slovak Union did no! invest m slocks during 1987 In fact, the First Catholic Slovak Union nas not invested in slocks over tae past twenty-five years. The First Catholic Slovak Unon has had very conservative management, whoseinveslment philosophy has beento protect Society interests despite Ihe Eures of high investment returns in the stock market, and whose philosophy has been to invest in the relative safety ol Ihe bond markets tor security and long range linanoal appreciation. The Society's investment philosophy has also been directed to land appreciation and land development programs, which have also added io the financial growth and stability of our Society dunng 1987 Our annual statement tor 1987 indicates lhal our Society's premium income for the 1907 fiscal year was $6.032.372. and of this amount $659.049 went imo surplus, making pur total surplus al the end of 1987 to be $8,739.884 Over £2,761.100 went into reserves which served to increase our total assets in 1987 to $57.599.173 Our outside, independent, certified public accountants, our aciuary. and our internal auditors will qttre ihrs Board ol Directors a tun report on Ihe financial activities of pur Society over this past year and each ol these reports will be published tor ihe information of our membership. But figures alone do not teil the entire story. The entire story can be evaluated only after all the other futuristic programs of the Society are taken into consideration. and in my annuel report to the Board ql Directors, as President I will touch on all areas which aftected our financial and fraternal performance during 1987. and |ust as importantly, areas which will affect positively our annual reports next year and during all the upcoming years in the lulure, Before going toa departmentiby-departmenl evaluation of our Society's performance during 1987, let me for a moment digress to explain to this Board of Directors, and through this Board to our membership, the extreme seriousness of the problems which nave hindered our Society's progress and income during this past year These problems were the creation ol district officers of Our Society n the Cleveland, Ohio, area These problems were unnecessary and unjustified Society harassmenl There were problems which created unnecessary, unjustified legal and administrative expense for our Society exceeding £45.000 during 19S7 atone. There were problems which nave cost our Society loss cl prestige and embaiassment to its Board of Directors and Supreme Officers. These are' problems which musi be discussed and resolved finally by action of this Board of Directors al this Annual Meeting On July 11,1987. the officers ol the Rev. Stephen Furdek District of Cleveland. Ohio without giving any notice io the Executive Secretary or Supreme President as mandated by the Society's Bylaws, filed a tetter of complaint with the Insurance Department Pi the Stale of Ohio, alleging violations ol the Bylaws of the First Catholic Slovak Union by Ihe Supreme President Ol our Society In their allegations, the Rev Stephen Furdek District complained to the insurance Department d the State of Ohio (hat the Supreme President had exceeded his powers, failed lo comply with certain provisions of Chapter 3921 of the Ohio Revised Coda, had dissipated Society assets, and was conducting business FRAUDULENTLY or in a manner hazardous lo the members cl ihe First Catholic Slovak Union The complaints to iha insurance Department ol the State ol Oho were filed in behalf of iha Rev Stephan Furdek District by its President. Stephen J Kandra, and its Secretary John S. Gohas Fůr Ihe record, il Should be noted that Andrew Putka. Esq . represented Ihe Rev. Stephen Furdek District al meebngs with the Insurance Department of the State of Ohio Scaled in Columbus. Ohio In a second complaint. IN VIOLATION OF OUR SOCIETY BYLAWS, the Rev. Stephen Furdek District alleged to the Supreme Court of the Fira! Calhoiic Slovak Union, that violations of our Society Bylaws were made by (he Supreme President of Ihe First Calhoiic Slovak Union, and reguested his suspension, expulsion, or dismissal as Supreme President The Rev. Stephen Furdek D>stncl also contacted ail ol the twenty tfrstricis of the First Catholic Slovak Union asking them to join the Furdek Distnci m its actions before the Insurance Department of Ihe Slate of Ohio, and before the Supreme Court ol Ihe First Catholic Slovak Union. Only the Frank Holly District ol Uniontown. Pennsylvania, whose President is Mrs. Audrey Balazik, pined with (he Furdek District in this complaint Without going mto detail, as most of ihis material has already been published In our JEOWQ7A newspaper the Insurance Department Of the Slate ol Ohio, after listening to the complaints of the representative of the Rev Stephen Fu'dek District and after conducting an investigation on its own behali; and after having considered ail the evidence presented to the Department of Insurance, found our Society, i|$ Supreme Officers, its Board ot Directors, and its Supreme President, to be fully innocent of an charges brought before Iha Insurance Department ol the State o! Ohio, in vindicating our Society and ihe Supreme President ol all charges ihe Insurance Department further found no reason for a Show Cause Heanng. contirmed to our Society that all the business transactions conducted by our Society to date were legal under Ohio Statutes, and more importantly, ruled that the Rev. Siephen Furdek Distnci of Cleveland, Ohio, bed woiated our Society Bylaws by not seeking remedies lo their complaints within the forums of the First Catholic Slovak Union as specified m our Bylaws, before coming to the Ohio Department of insurance This unnecessary action by the Rev. Stephen Furdek District has cost our Society over $45.000 in the 1987 fiscal year in legal expenses, administrative cosis. and all other costs associated with the defense of the First Catholic Slovak Union. This is another S45.0OQ línat could have appeared on the bottom line of our 1987 Annual Statement in the Society surplus column Instead, it was spenl to defend the First Catholic Slovak Union against a fruitless and unethical attempt to discredit our Society in the fraternal insurance system, and with ihe Ohio Department oi insurance This harassment by the Rev Stephen Furdek District is not expected lo cease unlil this Board of Directors takes ihe necessary steps to praveni irfese attacks upon our Society. Legal and administrative costs can be expected to continue during 198&. The Rev. Siephen Furdek Distnci again complained to toe Insurance Department of the State of Ohio that our Society was again violating |he Bylaws of the Flrsl Calhoiic Slovak Union by appointing a "Mr. William B. Leahy. Esq " as the new legal counsel far the First Catholic Slovak Union. For foe record, these charges were filed with the Ohio Insurance Department Oy Attorney John Vintilla. Esq., who is not a member of the First Catholic Slovak Union. In his filing. Attorney Vintilla indicated to (he Insurance Department, mistakenly, that Ihe Supreme President has instituted this appointment, and that Ihe Board ol Directors ol the First Catholic Slovak Union endorsed this aciion by the Supreme President As foe Board ol Directors well knows, (here has been nosppomtmenl to the office ci Legal Counsel in tact, following provisions ol our Bylaws, the Supreme President has advertised in our JEDNOTA newspaper a vacancy in this supreme office However, again additional legal costs were created tor our Society in refuting these new allegations before the in- surance Department, and again 1985 wifi continue lo see needless legal and administiative expenses because of the harassment by foe officers of the Rev Slophen Furdek District Another extreme action, generated by a report ol our internal auditors Hied with ihe Board of Directorsat its Semiannual Mealing in August. 1987, precipitated Ihe dismissal Ol the Executive Secretary, Mr Joseph R Vehec. from the duties Ct his e.ected office by action of the Supreme President on September 24,1&87. and as mandated by our Bylaws This action was upheld by a vote taken n the Executive Committee, a subsequent vote taken at a Special Meeting ol the Boord ol Directors, and upheld at an Appeal Hearing by the Supreme Court of the First Catholic Slovak Union held On January Ô. 19Ô8, in Cleveland. CM^iO H should be noted that Attorney John Vmiilta. Esq . was the attorney of record representing the dismissed Executive Secretary. Mr. Joseph R Vehec. Brother Cyril M. FerenchaK Treasurer of Ihe First Catholic Slovak Union, was appointed by the Supreme President and confirmed by vote of iha Executive Commitlee to assume the office of Executive Secretary/Treasurer until replaced or re-elected at the 43rd National Con- venfton of the First Catholic Slovak Union which will be held in Pittsburgh. Pennsylvania, in August 190B. jusl five months from now I gm pleased to report that there has been no work interruption as the result ol the' dismissal of our tonrier Executive Secretary, and Ihe normal business procedures al our Home Office continue smoothly and efficiently. Two other matters remained to be explained, ihe resignation of Brother Frank Feltcvtc ol Perth Amboy. New Jersey, our former Auditor, and the res gnaliof cf our former legal counsel, Attorney Virginia L Sirptnak On August 31,1957. immediately loliowing our Semiannual Board ol Directors Meeting n Cleveland. Ohio, our late legal counsel resigned het office as counsel to our Society Many rumors were circulated throughout out Society that there were serious internal problems within our organization, yet nothing could have baan further Irom the truth In conversations with our late legal counsel. I was assured that her resignation han little to do with any internal problems wiibm pur Society. Her major difficu'ty had to do wrlh the amount ol time that she was able to devote IP our Society business as compared to her private law practice, and a potential upcoming judicial appointment. She slated that her major reason for resignation was because of the extreme amount ol work she foresaw wnn ine complaints filed with the Insurance Department of the State of Ohio, ano complaints filed with Ihe Supreme Court oi the First Catholic Slovak Union by the Rev. Stephen Furdek District ol Cleveland, Ohio. This was her primary reason lor resignation — an increased workload — which she fall was strictly political in nature, and of no real benefit to our Society Sadly, in October 19Ů7. our forme: legal counsel was called to her eternal reward, ano poth I. as President, and Brolher Guidish. as Vice- Presidenl. were present io pay final respects in behalf of our Society. 'n the instance of the resignation of Brother Frank Felfovic, in personal conversations with Brother Feltovc l was advised that his resignation was for personal teasers, and he indicated no dissatisfaction or problem within his area of auditing responsibility. I believe that Brother Feltovic also addressed those Sentiments to other members ol Ihe Board Ol Directors As I suggested earlier, during the course of cur Annual Meeting, financial reports will be presented by ou/ outside, independent Certified Public Account ants. Coopers & Lybrand; by our Society Actuary. Bruce & Bruce Company; cur Executive Secretary/Treasurer. Brother Cynl M Ferenchak. and dur internal Auditors, of winch Brother Steven G. Luca, CPA. is Chairman. All Questions relative IO our annual Statement tor 1987 can be presented during these presentations. Al each meeting of the Board of Directors in the past, I have presented reports which encompass all areas of our Society's business operations outside of linanciai reports. Al this juncture. I would like now to touch upon each department in our Society, so that this Board of Directors may have a fuller understanding at the scope o! our Internal operations, EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE — The Executive Committee ol our Society meets monthly and is composed of five members, one ol whom is a Canadian representative, and which jointly conducts all business ol out Society between Boardoi Directors meeetrngs. The Executive Comnjittee has continued Ils excellent performance in the area of disposing ow-yelding bonds al times when tond prices are high, and buying higher-yielding corporate and government issues when bond prices have peaked during a decirne. We continue to use the consultation services of the CS McKee financial investment firm, which continually monitors our bond portfolio prior to making buy or sell recommendations One issue that must be addressed ai our Convention in August 1988, is the belie) that major financial decisions can only be made at National Conventions of the First Catholic Slovak Union. Nothing can be further from Ihe lruth. The Bylaws ol the firs! Catholic Slovak Union mandate the Executive Committee and Board of Directors lo conduct ihe business of the Society between conventions, and the authority of these two administrative bodies Is defined by the Bylaws, The National Convention of the First Calhoic Slovak Union is the supreme legislative and judicial tribunal Ol Ihe first Catholic Slovak Union, but the administrative functions and fiscal responsibilities have always been in the domain of the Board of Directors and toe Executive Committee Pi cur Society. If major financial decisions could be made only at conventions of fhe Society, normal business COuW be transacted oniy four days every three years. MEMBERSHIP AND MARKETING DEPARTMENT - One of the most importani departments In our Society is our Membership and Marketing Department, which is the responsibility of our Vice-Ptesideni. Thomas J. Guidish. F.J.C.. and our Marketing Director. Jehn J.

NEW HOME OFFICE QUARTERS IN INDEPENDENCE, OHIO — On October IS, 19B7, our Society signed the legal documents which gave our Society title to a new, ihree story office building located in ln- dependencB^^hio. This building is located in a sprawling business and industrial com^rti^aled on Rockside Road, just off the exit ramp from Ohio lnt6ŔtäE&77. The address of our new Home Office quarters is 6611 Rocksde Road, and Our Society Will COCupythe third floor which contains approximately 7.200 square feet ol usable space. Occupancy of these quarters for our Home Office purposes is now scheduled tor early April. 1988, and an official dedication of our new facilities will be held shortly thereafter We have been fortunate in obtaining Crown Life Insurance Company of Toronto. Ontario, as a tenant, as well as CBS Records, a division of the Sony Corporation, as tenants lor our first floor office space. This newly purchased property has already appreciated considerably since its purchase, which is again evidence of the proper decision making processes of Ihis Board cf Directors of the Fiist Catholic Slovak Union. I have staled to our membership on many occasions that this Board of Direc tors has been the most productive in the history oi our Society, and the linanaal statements of our Society over the next few years will continue to attest to ihe accuracy of this statement JEDNOTA, INC- HOLDING COMPANY — The concept of a Holding Company lor ihe First Celholic Slovak Union’s nomeiated business activities has proven io have been a good decision by the Board oi Directors of ihe First Catholic Slovak Union far many reasons, the most important of which has to do wilh protection of our tax-free status as a nonprofit fraternal organization. The most important development to come from the Holding Company to date has been the issuance of the first dividend from Jed nota, Inc. Holding Company, lo the First Catholic Slovak Union. The Board of Directors ol Jednote, Inc. has for 1987, declared a dividend of $115 per share of common stock owned by the First Catholic Slovak Union, for a return to ihe Society of 8.65^ on ils common stock investment in Jednota, Inc. This is the firai time in tits history of the First Catholic Slovak Union that it has been the recipient of a dividend from one of its own whofiy-owned corporations, a process which is expected to be continued and dramatically increased in Ihe months and years to come. The fraternal Monitor magazine of February, 1988, carries an article entitled. “How lo Improve Your Leadership Skills ” I mention this article since inthe section entitled "Dealing wilh Decisions," il stales that: "Another aspect of effective leadership measures decision-making abilities. Whenever you make a decision, you take a risk Risk taking surely builds up considerable stress As a result, we find people who subconsciously believe it's better nor to try rather than fail.. Yet avoiding the stress of decisionmaking may be a disservice to the company, its employees, or its customers.’’ Over ihe pas! iwo years, in the implementation of the holding company concept. we. as a Board of Directors, have laken many ri$ks, taking steps which have built up quite a bit ol stress upon this Board, but now we can see lhal il has been the correct decision, and the Board ol Directors isto be congratulated for making these forward-looking decisions, and its ability io lead our Society into the twenty-first century. The Jednota Holding Company I? incorporated in the Slate of Ohio and has been doing business as a corporation since the first of January, 1987 JEDNOTA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION — The Jednola Communications Corporation is composed of two separate sections, the Jednota Press and Ihe Jednola Communications departments.

Money «der only lor Cariatü and other cpyntriee. of Directors Meeting at least hall ol the Beard’s time wee attributed to the ’ problems" of the printery operation and ihe financial fosses attributed to this operation. The printery operation was under particularly harsh and abusive attack from 1976 through 1979, as can be evidenced by reading the Board of Directors Minutes during this time period, and attacked somewhat less critically from 1979 through 1982. With subtle internal changes which began to our printery operations in 1983. coupled wilh the IRS challenge ol our ncn-felated business activities, subsequently ground was lard tor ihe institution of the corporation concept as we presently find in our printery operation. It Is pleasing to report to this Board of Directors and our membership. lhal during the last quarter pl 19Ö7 and eariy 1988. our printery buildrng has undergone major internal changes. New presses have been purchased for increased production, rftqflarn security and fire prevention systems have been installed, and a major renovation Ol Office quarters has been accomplished. During 1987, the printery operation enjoyed a positive cash flow operating as a corporation, and showed a profit which permitted a dividend to be paid to ihe Jednota. Inc. Holding Company. During the second quarter of 1988. we will totally move into our Orphanage Building, Ihe working quarter^pf our Editor and his staff, the working quarters of the Curator ol the Slov^Museum and Archives, the Society bookinventory. and somewhat later, the entire Slovak Museum and Archives itself. This move ia part of an overall plan 10 reduce Society internal costs incurred by space rental in the printery building by the Society for these fraternal Society tanctions The Jednota Communications Corporation was incorporated in Ihe Slate of Ohio as of January, 1987 The President cf the Jednota Communications Corporation is Thomas J Guldish. JEDNOTA PROPERTY CORPORATION — Our Jednota Property Development Corporation has been very active since toe beginning of 1987. but activity was restricted due to Ihe hold put on our property negotiations by toe insurance Department of the State of Ohio because cf (he complaints filed by the Rev. Stephen Furdek District oi Cleveland. Ohio. As everyone in our Society is aware, our property holdings in Middletown. Pennsylvania, are ±315 acres. We have had 44 acres zoned and sub-divided ior development purposes, and have permits granted tor putting a ramp from the Olmsted Connector onto our Jednota acreage We_ have had offers to purchase aN of our 44 acres Qy a single interested concern, and we have had criers lor the purchase of individual subdivided lots We have also had öftere for a |omt venturing of our 44 acre sub-divided site, and are presently evaluating each of Ihe various propositions offered our Society by interested parties. Brother Regis Brekosky is the President of the Jednota Property , Development Corporation, which was incorporated in January. 1987- Land development is another area in which increasing income to our Society is being forecast through increased dividends generated by development. |0i nt venture operations. or outright sales of certain parcels ol our property. JEDNOTA GENERAL CORPORATION — Tne Jednota General Corporation has Lo date no functions assigned to it. since its primary role is dependent upon the completion of our Orphanage Building remodei’za- tion. and spinoffs from our printery operations. It is not anticipated that any profits will be generated by the Jednota General Corporation during 1980. Brother Cyril M. Ferenchak is the President of Jednota General Corporation, which was incorporated in January. 1987 CONCLUSION — It is a fact that 1907 was a very good year tor Ihe financial operations of our Society. II is also a tact that 1988 and each year hereafter should, because of the groundwork laid by this Board of Directors. be even better financial successes. This has happened because you. as the Board of Directors, have recognized early the need tor new income sources far our Society and have implemented those programs which have made these new income sources possible. The Firet Catholic Slovak Union today is a very different Society than it was just ten years ago Today, as we approach the lOoth Anniversary of the founding of our Society, we can feel secure that we have taken the steps necessary to make and keep our Society a viable organization for the next century tn retrospect, you. as the Board of Directors, can now compare our operations with any other Slovak fraternal organization. We are the only Society today with a commercial printing operation which is an independent corporation We are the only Slovak society with a land development corporation. We are the only Slovak fraternal with a Slovak museum and archivas of national significance, and we are the only Slovak fraternal that now has the ability to effect Stovák ppmion world wide through the publication ol our national newspaper, the JĚDWTA. and through publication of books, newspapers, and other periodicals. What does this mean to the Slovak Community at large? It means that the upcoming young person Of Stovek background can ng longer use the excuse that there is nothing in the Slovak world with which he or she can identity personally Today Iheie exists a Slovak language and literature pro- gam gn toe university level with which all Slovak students cag identify. There exists a Slovak museum and archives which is designed to protect the Slovak heritage and culture in the United States and Canada, and with which our Slovak youth can now personalty identify. There are Sovak cor portions owned by a Slovak organization with which any young Slovak can identify,, if he is a member of the First Catholic Slovak Union. These are significant contributions to the Slovaks as a people, and credit must go to you. Ihe Board of Directors of the First Catholic Slovak Union, lor having the courage, and for having the determination of making Ihe First Catholic Slovak Union the leading Slovak fraternal in the United States and Canada Let us be thankful that our Society has to date been the benefiaaty of the many blessings which have been bestowed upon the Slovak com mumry worldwide over the past several yeais. Without question, the dream ol Father Fuidak is slowly coming 10 pass, as we begin our venture in the world of American business and education. Lal us pray also that our Society will continue to be blessed in its efforts to promote Slovak unity, to preserve the Slovak culture and heritage, to prepare Slovak youth 10 fulfill their objectives in pursuing ihe American dream, and to prevent the suppression of the religious and human rights cl Slovak communities anywhere in the world. JOSEPH FL KRISTOFIK Chairman, Board of Directors Exhibit #6 Report of the Vice-President Mr Presaenl and Members of ihe Board ol Drrectars; .v. 1987 is history.

As Vice-President, I travel to various districts and branches to conduct educational seminars and conferences We encourage members to enroll m the Fraternal insurance Counselors program, There are 11 people enrolled in the "F.LČ." program. The District Sales Managers program grows stronger each year. There are now 17 managers in the 20 districts These managers continue to be our leading salespeople and are a major lactor in our sales program As the Vioe-Presidenl. I continue to be very active in the fraternal move ment I have attended the National Fraternal Congress where I serve on the Fraternal Field Managers Section 1 am now serving as Vice-President of this Section and should be elected as President of F.F M-A. in October. I also attend the meetings ol the Pennsylvante and West Virginia Fraternal Congresses. As a member of Ihe Executive Committee. Claims Committee.

Exhibit #7 Report of the Executive Secretary Reverend Fathers: Supreme President; and Fellow Members ql ihe Board oi Directors of the First Caiholio Slovak Union at the United Slates of America sod Canada: It is with greet personal satisfaction and pardonable pride that I point ř out to you the significant strides made in the Home Oflice operations during my tenure. We have taken the positive steps 10 move forward through the purchase or a three-story, reflective glass office building witn a gross area of approximately 24.929 square feet, or which 21.730 square feet are rentable Also included is a tower level consisting ol approximately 1.985 square feet. The building is situated on a tract of land contanmg approximately 1 15 acres, This facility was acquired for $2 39 million The Society will occupy the entire third Itoor of approximately 7.326 square feet and the remaining two floors will be leased. Presently. I am happy to report that we have signed leases with Crown Life Insurance Company of Toronto. Canada, and CBS Records, a Division of Sony The scheduled date lor occupancy by the First Catholic Slovak-Union is Apnl 15. 1988 One of the most aggravating problems to Ihe members in the direct billing program has been our rather inadequate billing process This prob lem was the result of a rather complicated program which was intertwined with the regular billing program, and as a result was rather cumbersome A new computerized program has been developed to lift Ihe direct billing operation from the regular billing system. Our results to date have been successful and many members have expressed extreme satisfaction with the ongoing results. Getting into basic telecommunications. I have initiated a program utiliz ing a FAX system The principal instrument is in the Home Office in Cleveland. Ohio, with satellites in Dearborn. Michigan; Toronto Canada, and Middletown. Pennsylvania. This has proved to be a very wise investment. it facilitates moving correspondence between Canada, the President's oftree, the Printery, and the Home Office. It also expedites correspondence between our consultants whq also have facilities to receive FAX messages from the Home Office and our other satellites. Furthering our loray into the computerized field, we have installed a desk top publishing and word processing system from which we prepare many of Our reports and print some Of our forms We have moved forward into a new generation of computer hardware and nave acquired a Iratarnal insurance software package that will totally enhance our computer operations and make them more productive We are currently having our old records microfilmed prioru the move to the new facility. There are approximately 400,030 records that have to be filmed. They are being processed by an outside firm at a very competitive price. In departmentalizing the Home Office operations, we have segregated Iha functions into th© following d^an~e~ts: — Marketing — Treasury . — Controller — Insurance — Direct Billing Operations In Ihe three months oi my tenure, I am proud to report that we have put into action those things that in prior Board Meetings were merely excuses for lack ol action.

President The Board of Oireciora First Catholic Slovak Union of the United Stales and Canada 3269 East 55th Street Cleveland, Ohio 44127 Mr President and Members of the Bear'd of Directors. We have reviewed the compiled Balance Sheets of the various units of the First Catholic Slovak Union of the United States and Canada as of December 31, 1988. and ihe related Statements of income for the year (hen ended, m accordance wüh the Bylaws established by the First Catholic Slovak Union. These Finanyaf Statements nave been prepared internally by Management and have been included in this report. As Internal Auditors, we have continued to assume our responsibility to investigate and appraise and to recommend improvements to the system of internal accounting control ana ihe efficiency 'with whch the various units of ihe organization are carrying out their assigned functions as directed. Effective January 19. 1987. we commenced our Imai analysis and the internal audit ot the First Catholic Slovak Union or the United Slates and Canada (FCSU) tor re year ended December 31. '986 The objective of Internal accounting control is to provide reasonable, but nol absolute, assurance as to the safeguarding of assets against loss Írom unauthorized use or disposition, and the reliability of financial records lor preparing financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. The concept ol reasonable assurance recognizes that ihe cost of a system of internal accounting control should not exceed the benefits derived and also recognizes that the evaluation of these (actors necessarily requires estimates and judgments by management. Our study and evaluation qf the organization’s system ol internal accounting control far toe year ended December 31.1986, was not designed lor toe purpose of expressing an opinion on Ihe internal accounting conlrol and our study and evaluation would not necessarily disclose all weaknesses in the system. Our comments are based on our observations at the time of our review without making a special study of the system of internal accounting control or operations. We have submitted cur internal control letter to management under separate cover, which outlines the areas of operations In need o! Improvements. [We have impfemented the following oulfine performed for this annual report period.] A. Internal Audit Procedures Performed 1.

B. Recommendattons/Conolusions 2 1. Home Office Operations — A complete and detailed analysis í of our Home Office Operations should be prepared. An office ? organizational flow chart should be designed to improve opera- 2 tional efficiencies. Additional staff personnel will be required especially in the accounting, direct billing, and marketing 4 departments. Personnel Cuties should be defined and J segregated for internal control purposes and lines of authority ? should be established. A staff manual should be developed. The employee policies of the organization will have to be clearly defined 3 and structured to Increase and Improve operational ' efficiency. r Secretarial lime Is being used Inefficiently in thearea . of typing, etc. Duplication of effort could be controlled i by the use of word processing equipment. Home Office computer operations must be expanded to Include all current updates of our software as enhancements are released. The acquisition of personal computers is of extrema Importance In achieving future operational efficiencies. [Home Office computer cperaficns shoud be installed that would meet not only the current pul else future goals of our society ] Operations oi the marketing department must be expanded immediately with concentration being emphasized in new product development. The fuiure of our insurance operation will depend on competitive product releases. 2. Accounting Department — The accounting department continues to be non-effective In accomplishing the goals of the Society- Various recommendations which have been suggested by the auditors of the FCSU and by Coopers end Lybrand, Certified Public Accountants, have not been addressed andrer Implemented. । Special subsidiary ledgers should be designed to improve the record keeping system in both the mortgage loan end poticy loan departments. Accounting workpaper techniques should oe improved and/or expended Significant accounts should be reconciled to the general ledger on a monthly basis and döaiied schedules should be kept by (he accounting department A standard journal entry log should be designed to assist the accounting department In posting journal entries of a recurring nature. Documenta In the loan mortgage files should be reviewed and brought up lo dale with current insurance requirements. Verification of Insurance and/or real estate taxes are not being completed due to non-existent followup procedures. 3 Branch Delinquencies— The billing department Is currently experiencing billing delays and premium collection delays. The function cl the billing department should be reviewed and improved upon A policy of collecting delinquent premiums should ba established and proper follow-up procedures should be implemented to minimize losses. It is suggested that strict adherence to the Bylaws be followed Delinquent branches not In compliance should be reviewed for future restructuring or liquidation. 4 Purchase and Payment of Invoices — Purchasing policies should ba defined and implemented. Purchase orders and receiving reports are not being used in the purchase cycle. The acquisition process of fixed assets, etc. should be properly defined. Limitations should be sei on ell expenditures with proper authority required prior loan/expenditure being made by any officer, director, employee, etc-Of the FCSU- Guidelines □n expenditures should be established. Payments to vendors, payments for advances, officer expenses, etc should not be disbursed until all proper documentation is received. Original invoices should be obtained prior to any disbursement. 5. Investments — The audit process of our investments is currently completed on a semiannual basis. Additionally, bond coupons are clipped lour to SIX times a year and bonds are pulled for sale purposes ten to twelve times a year. This has become a very costly process to the FCSU. Consideration should be given to the future use of an investment institution in the safeguard- f ing of our bonds, etc. Il is believed that the above processes can then be completed on a cost saving basis. Our current bond purchasing system should also be expanded tq include other brokerage houses. Diversification of our invesimenl portfolio should also be considered to include the purchase of high grade common and preferred slocks: • 6. Financial Reporting — The monthly and quarterly financial statements of our Society are not being prepared on a ' timely basis in accordance with the Bylaws. Strict adherence to the Bylaws should be maintained. Year end reports should be property reconciled prior lo (he release 0! any financial data and all reports should be in agreement Again In 1966, our year end reports are not In agreement. 7 Printery Operation — Printery, Rome Office, etc. charges should be reviewed for their future applications. Various other overhead, etc. chargeswill have to be redefined In light of the restructuring process of the FCSU. During 1986, improvement has been made In the accounting and . reporting system of the Printery Operations. [Overtired and other various charges wilt have la de redefined tn fight ol the restructuring process of the FCSU J 8 . Budget and Cost Containment — Although budgets are currently being prepared, it is suggested that limits be established and cost reductions be required in all departments.

We were attempting to make it easy by sending one check la the Leagues instead of 4 or 5 checks to the different branches. For example. some teams have 7 or 8 bowlers on a team and the most any team can get is $30.00 per team. In the future we will revert back to the old schedule and send the money to the branches.

Now we can get on with our job oi building abigger and belter First Catholic Slovak Union of ihe United States and Canada. Once more let me touch on a few activities that we held in 1967 First, the Man's and Women's Bowling Tournament held in Cleveland. Ohio W? had 148 teams entered and everyone enjoyed the “under one roof concept and, il possible, we will try to continue this idea The Junior Bowling Tournament is going down hill. We are not getting enough of our youth to participate in this event. I know we have a lot of our young members who bowl elsewhere, but we can'i gei anyone to form leagues in Chicago, New Jersey. New York. Allentown, and Scranton areas I hope someone reads this and decides lb do something iniheir area to bolster this event The Golf Tournament has always been a good drawing card. We could use about 100 more golfers. Everyone has a good time at this event except the losers. I can’t say enough about the Family Day Picnic. It is getting better and better every year. The sports program was a success. The young and old participation in this program was Overwhelming and this year we are considering grv- ing out more prize money. We will have Ihe CARE AND SHARE program again this year, because it went over so well last year, only this year. I hope we can double the take. So Start saving your non-perishable food stuffs and put a little money aside for the success ot the CARE AND SHARE program. I want to thank you for ihe fine support you gave me in the past and may God bless you all.

Eighty one people were rewarded for their efforts rn securing new business for ouf Jednota. 1988 is ihe year of our 43rd Triennial Convention. Therefore, our new campaign will be called the ”43rd Convention Campaign." We have set our goals high, but we feel confident that they will be met. Goals tor 1988: 1) New Business áH’ís^'íiP^racts — $ 35.000.000 - 3 3,600 of the Literary Committee. It needs io be comprised of people with literary scholarship who must work with Ihe JEDNOTA editor and perhaps the Executive Secretary. At present, the structure is weak and ineffective. More qualified individuals in the literary field are needed to do the job responsibly. Respectfully, FR. CHARLES E HAWKINS.

Sheen put it.,is .. the teaching instrument . . thal takes us beyond the category Pi a newspaper and makes it not a record of crumbling foundations, but oi trumpet blasts summoning to battle." The knowledge explosion keeps doubling the information available, and based on this acknowledgement, collective changes are necessary to keep geared to changing needs. The Catholic Press must continue to fulfill ils intrinsic and indispensible function of serving the common good. Pope Paul VI, in commenting on the Catholic Press said, "What, above all. may be expected of the Catholic journalist today is that he will refuse to embitter controversies, thal he will ehdeavor lo promote understanding in the ecctesigj body, and that he will help his readers to acquire gradually lhal ’sense ol ihe Church' which will guide Bieir judgment among so many discordant opinions.’ The JEDNOTA has a responstbtltty not id cause needless trouble, nd to disturb arbitrarily or mischievously, end not lo loste» dissension. Our aim is positive and constructive — our philosophy is not negative and we strive to stress objectivity and accuracy. There j j t no question, like everything else, we are constantly m the process of change There is no going back to former days and ways. Our target is toward more maturity and we must bear the tnais of transition so we can develop hane$( responsibility and serve the truth. fn the accomplishment of this thinking and our aims, we gratefully acknowledge the cooperation and assistance of ihe Supreme Officers, the Districts.

Two points ol interest were discussed al the 1987 annual meeting in New Orleans. The N$i poini was to consider updating a Slovak-English liturgy booklet which would include ail parts of the Mass in both languages, as well as Slovak and English hymns. The Slovak Catholic Federation reminded us lhal they had already published such a booklet and that the Jedhola Literary Committee should bring this master before the Federation tor discussion I have done so and am presently awaiting cost estimates lor a reprinting. Additionally, it was recommended that ihe printed names and addresses ol the Slovak clergy, which are published in Slovak in ihe Calendar. should now be updated, printed in English, and givan lo ihs Slovak Catholic Federation lor publication in their annual book,. Secondly, it was suggested by a Supreme Officer that the Kalender and Furde* be patterned into an attractive annual similar to the booklet published by the Greek Catholic Umon The officer fell lhal this would be more appealing to Ihe Jednota membership. Further discussion would be needed before implementation. On a differed rote. I would like lo suggest a complete restructuring MAP OF SLOVAKIA Right Reverend Fathers, Esteemed Brother Supreme Officers Of the First Catholic Slovak Union of the United States and Canada now in gene»ai session at the Catamaran Harel iocatsd at 3999 Mission Boulevard tn San DiegO, California: I wish to convey my greetings to you gif ano may ypur deliberations result m a greater Jednota.

JUNE 1. 1988 JEHO BÁSNE SÚ ZRKADLOM SLOVENSKA 100 rokov od narodenia básnika Ignáca Grebáča-Orlova Pozdrav Baťkovi Potockému čestnému predsedovi Kanadskej Slovenskej Ligy Už dobrých šesťdesiat rokov opatrujem vo svojej knižnici siedmy ročník (1914) časopisu "Svätá rodina". Tento časopis v celopláteuncj väzbe som dostal na záverečnej skúške v prvých povojnových rokoch v rodnej dedine — Veličnej. Nepamätám sa, ä mi časopis daroval maj prvý učiteľ Jozef Hromada, alebo náš pán farár Ignác ôreháicQriov. V časopise bolLvi^sŕréGrábáČove básne: Prosba, Návšteva, Žlžillru, Zvesť jara, Alleluja, Rozhovor. Návšteva, Na krížovej češte, Októbrové zvony, Noe nad bo- jišťom, Smutné Vlanoca. Posledné 3 básne sa zrodili na bojisku cez prvú svetovú vojnu. Básne, ako aj poviedky (lAs- kavy dar, Cl to mosi byť?) prebudili vo mne lásku k slovenskej literatúre už v žiackych rokoch. Od detstva som žil po boku Ignáca Grebáía-Orlova Ako Jeho žiak predstavil som bo uvojim spolurodákom na oslave jeho päťdesiatky. Ak by som chcel po päťdesiatych rokoch predstaviť bo pri jeho storočnici (narodil sa 25- januára 1898 v Námestove), to by som musel hlboko načrieť do svojich spomienok. Preto v tomto jubilejnom Eimytíenl dotknem sa niektorých úsekov jeho plodného života. Po stredoškolských štúdiách v Tratenej. Ružomberku a v Rožňave odchádza do spišského seminára, kde po ekončenS teologických štúdii bol 1. júna 1911 vysvätený za kňaza. Pri tej príležitosti zložil báseň: "Tu som Pane, bos' ma volaL Tu som hotový do boja.. .* B peknou kôpkou básní pri- cbádza za prvú svoju kaplánsku stanicu do Veličnej, kde sa sláva hlavným spolupracovníkom Svätej rodiny s Jej kalendárov. Nacvičuje divadlá, spevácke zbory. Roku 1913 zorganizoval oslavu stého výročia smrtí Antona Bsraoláka v Sla- idei a v Námestove. Jeho je aj text na pamätnej tabuli Ber- noláka v alanickom kostole. Udržiava) priateľské styky B českými katolíckymi básnikmi (Jakub Dem). Otakar Brezina). chodieval do Martina na národné slávnosti. Jedna jeho účasť sa mu stala osudnou. Roku 1913 na martinských slávnostiach sa účastnici dožadovali zriadenia slovenského gymnázia. Účastníkov vyhJšmh za panslávistov a ich aj súdili. Ignáca Grebáta-Oriova odsúdili na 200 d. pokuty a na desať dn( väzenia. Po tomto treste stihol ho aj ďalší: preloženie z Veličnej do Smižian, odkiaľ po vypuknutí prvej svetovej vojny narukoval na front. Roku 1912 mu vyšla zbierka básni Piesne a dumky a ú- vodným textom Svetozára Hur- bana-Vajanského Autor v ňom píše: "Z hlbokého veriaceho srdca pramenia Tvoje pekné verše.

Septembrové číslo Svätej rodiny (hneď po vypuknutí vojny prinieslo bšseň Na krížovej ceete: "A saje krv ako tiger ľutý a drúzga lebky nevinné ... smrť v každom jeho kroku, hnutí. Jaj, ten ľud celý zahynie." To ako keby sme čítali Hviezdoslavove Krvavé sonety (tie však vyšli Jen po vojne). Ďalšie jeho báseň je až z Indie (Októbrové zvony), tretia (Noc had bojišťom) z Balkánu. Jeho básne Z frontu prinášali aj iné časopisy (Živena, Dennica, Slovenské pohľady, Kráľovná sv, Bužemm) a noviny (Národníe noviny). Po vojne (roku T01O) mu vyšla básnická zbierka V povíchrici a Z mojej prózy. Katolícke noviny vychádzajúce v Nitre (r. n., č. 35) na margo týchto publikácií napísali: "Jeho básne sú zrkadlom Slovenska. Orlov je majstrom elovanakéha slova. Jeho slovenčina je vyššia., elegantná, kúzelná, slovenčina našej básnickej trojice: Hviezdoslav, Vajanaký a Tichomír Mik- lín. Na jeho básňach vidieť štúdium týchto troch básnických veľduchov. Orlov je básnik ľudu." Ta treba pripomenúť, ie pseudonym Orlov začal používať až pri vydaní zbierky Piesne a dumky. Predtým mal pseudonym: Vraniak a Horimll Vraniak. Pod uvedenými pseudonymami ma) uverejnených 27 básni. Do konca roku 1918 xoviny a časopisy priniesli a£ 350 jeho básní. Koľko ich bolo po vojne, to už ťažko zistiť. Po vojne do roku 1921 pôsobil v Ružomberku ako profesor, redaktor Slováka a jeho kalendárov. Kalendár prinášal pútavé Ilustrácie s Grebáčový- nň veršíkmi. Všetky sú sociálne ladené. Napríklad v básni Drotár na cestách čítame tieto verše.' "Od dediny do dediny chodím s drôtom, nosím klietky každý deň mám nocľach Iný e tak živím ženu, dietky." Roku 1921 sa stal farárom vo Veličnej Iraku 1927 dekanom a roku 1935 čestným kanonikom) Vrátil sa do obce, z ktorej ho pred prvou svetovou vojnou vyhostili. Popri dušpas- tierakej práci (mal na starosti aj žaékovskú farnosť, zakladal náboženské spolky, staral sa o mládež, dal vymaľovať kostol) venoval sa vo zvýšenej miere literárnej činnosti. Písal divadelne hry (Až lipa zakvitne, Svitaj nám, svitaj), pokračoval v píräní básní (roztratené eú po všetkých náboženských ča- SCpiaoch) a venoval sa prekladateľskej činnosti.

Kalendár Pútnik svätovoj. teíský na rok 1987 píše. že bol od roku 1921 až do smrti — 26. apríla 1957 farárom a čest- ným kanonikom vo VeĽínej. Do smrti vo Veličnej nepôsobil. Niekoľko mesiacov pred smrťou sa odsťahoval do Ružomberka. kde umrel.

V Thunder Bay, Ont., Batiko Andrej Potocký, patriarch slovenského života v Kanad«, dožijú sa dňa 28. mája 1988 požehnaných 95- narodenín svojho plodného života vyplneného povznášajúcou prácou a činnosťou na tej našej príslovečnej “dedičnej roll slovenskej”. Pri oslave 95. narodenín Baťka Potockého, žá&da sa povedať, že ich meno sa čestne radi k menám veľkých siovensko- «árodných a spolkárskych dejateľov, ktorí sa zlatými Utera- ml zapísnh do análov budovateľskej histórie života Slovákov v Kanade. V každom ohľade Ide tu o ' úctyhodný vek čovéka-bojovní- ka, o ktorom platí výrok. Že ce- lý svoj život nenáročne a ne- žistne zasvätil Bohu, národu a Lige. U Baťka Potockého Boh bol vždy a všade na prvom mieste. Všetko, čo začínali, či to bolo v súkromnom, alebo spolkár- akom živote, začínal to v Božom mene. Ako hlboko založený kreaťan-katolík, pevne veril — a veriť neprestali — že všetko na tom svete pochádza od Boba. S Bohom prišla nezlomná viera, a ktorou nerozlučne zrástli už v rodičovskom dome a 81 ju so sebou odniesli z rodnej Sedliackej Dubovej na Orave do ďalekej, neznámej a v živote mnohoráz drsnej a chladnej cudziny. Ako celkom mladý človek, sotva 16-ročný, na vlastnom u- trpení spoznali horkosť chleba vysťahovalca odtrhnutého ďaleko od svojich vlastných. No práve tento ťažký osud života utvrdil v nich lásku a oddanosť k Bohu, k svojetl a k rodnej vlasti. Po Bohu to bol národ — ná& národ slovenský! — prostý, jednoduchý slovenský ľud, z ktorého Baťko Potocký vyšli a sa naučili ho mflovať celým svojim srdcom od otca, a matky v časoch národného útlaku a silnej maďarizácie. Ostali mu nerozlučne verný i na tejto strane “veľkej mláky", v dobrých i zlých časoch, i vtedy, keď nežičlivci slovenského národa a ľudu hrozili Slovákom diármi & oplzlým udavačstvom za “enemy aliens" u kanadskej RCblP. len preto, že sa hlásili 2a Slovákova že sa nedali "presvedčiť” zrieknuť sa boja za svätá práva svojho bičovaného národa. Baťko Potocký pod žiadnym tlakom nezakolísali a sa nepoddali. Potláčali rozvratné živly, ktoré judášsky zapredávali svoj vastný ľud. Škodcov národa účelne odzbrojovali a slovami básnika na nich volali “márne vaáe proti nám sú vzteky!". Po Bohu a národe to bola Liga — Kanadská Slovenská Liga — ktorá prí svojom zrode a krédo sí vzala verne slúžiť Bohu, národu a slovenskému ľudu v Kanade. Baťko Potocký takmer od jej založenia boli jej hybnou silou — doňou jej celej činnosti a podnikavosti a po každej stránke jej váženým a na slovovzatým vedúcim funkcionárom v úlohe hlavného tajomníka — boli spoĽcárom "par exellence”. Povedal by som, že v Lége našli svoje miesto, s ktorou neroz- dvojrae zrástli, pre ktorú bolo hodno He a sa jej obetovať. V rámci SL pre Baťka Potockého otvorilo sa nové pole ich pôsobnosti. Pustili sa so všetkými svojimi malosťami, u- RECEPT NA SCHUDNUTIE Poslal ho ktagj ako veľmi o- avedčený. Napíšte si ho: — Sto piluliek.

Bičovali nezáujem a tú našu slovenskú malovemosť. Odsudzovali ľahostajnosť a nedbalosť slúžiť svojeti. Volali na pomýlených, &by prestali byť lokajmi v službách cudzích záujmov na úkor slovenských. Hlasom proroka volali: "... nepozerajme na cudzie, nám škodlivé, ale cl(apme sa svojho a tak povznesieme meno slovenské i samých seba. Cudzí nám nič nedajú, bod nám mnoho sľubujú. Preto držme sa len sami seba a nedajme sa zavádzať!" Takto volali v dávnych rokoch Baťko Potocký do sveta Slovákov v Kanade v článkoch a príspevkoch, ktoré sa Často zjavovali na stranách našich novín, ktoré pre historika zaiste budú bohatým prameňom dobovej činnosti s života Slovákov v Kanade. Pre toto svoje národné cítenie i preto, že bránili vieru svojich predkov, stidi sa terčom opätovných ú- tokov v novinách Robotnícke Slovo a Pravda. Nevoľno zabúdať ani na ich dopisovateľskú činnosť, ktorou sa vyznačili na stranách Ka- nadekého Slováka počas druhej svetovej vojny, za trvania Slovenského štátu, kedy stáli v prvých radoch a medzi tými, ktorí sa tu v Kanade bezvýhradne postavili na stranu slovenskej pravdy a proti tým. ktorí nežičili Slovákom žiť a rozvíjať sa v svojom vlastnom štáte. Kto by vedel spočítať, koľko článkov a príspevkov napísali do slovenských novín za celé polstoročie ich aktívnej činnosti. Bolo ich sto? Päťsto? Tisíc, alebo viac?... A koľko listov rozposlali na všetky strany7 Len u mňa samého možno ich napočítať v stovkách... Popritom všetkom starali sa o národné. kultúrne, náboženské a or- gunizačné povznesenie Slovákov v Kanade. Cez deň zarábali na každodenný chlieb. Noce, nedele, sviatky a odpočinok venovali práci za Boha, za národ a za Kanadskú Slovenskú. Ligu. Vakácie, tie u Badea Potockého neexistovali. Pri hodnotení celoživotnej práce a činnosti Baťka Potockého na poli národa a organizácie i nevdojak núka sa tu otázka: Solo to fyzicky možné pre jedného človeka vykonať taký ohromný kus priekopníckej práce, pritom všetkom starať sa o ženu, dom, vychovať a vyškoliť Šesť deti? Iste, ta nebolo to ľahko, zvlášť nie v rokoch depresie. No život a dielo človeka, ktoré prevzal na svoje plecia s čest- □ým úmyslom, niekedy sú tak mocne späté v jeden zväzok, že sl jedno bez druhého nemožno predstaviť, tým menej oddeliť. Patria spolu ako “horse and carriage“. Pri jednej dávnejšej jubilejnej príležitosti dal som sa u- nicať citovému rozochveniu a o Baťkovi Ptrtockom som sa vyslovil. že sú “zlatým srdcom organizácie". Vždy jej dali prednosť, jej venovali svoju po- zornosť mnohoráz na úkor svojho rodinného blahobytu. Spo- mfonm to preto, lebo tak sa mi vidí, ako keby tá naša národná vatra, ktorá kedysi horela plameňom, dnes už len tleje — pomaly hasne. Je až príznačné viditeľný rozdiel v práci a činnosti za slovensko-národné a spolkárske podujatia medzi generáciami súčasnej doby a generáciou, ktorú tu reprezentoval Baťko Potocký, terajší . Čestný predseda Kanadskej Slovenskej Ligy. j súčasné politické dejstvo- vanie je len málo odlišné od politického života našej dávnej i nie tak dávnej minulosti. Ako vtedy i dnes treba bojovať proti slovenskej malovernosti a presvedčovať S1 o v a č, že Jej miesto je na strane slovenského ľudu a jeho boja za sväté práva národa. Nepriatelia Slovákov nezmenili taktiku, len tváre ľudi. Na začiatku tridsiatich rokoch Baťko Potocký volali: “Slováci v Kanade, prebuďme sa ’ Časy sú vážne. Zo všetkých strán striehnu na nás nepriatelia, chcejúc nám vyrvať z našich sŕdc ten najdrahší poklad, ktorý sme zdedili po našich rodičoch — našu slovenskú reč, slovenskú kultúru a viaru ... A ío my? ČI my vidíme tých našich nepriateľov, ktorí na nás striehnu, ako zakladajú všelijaké spolčeky pod rôznymi menami. aby náa tam dostali a potom nás pozbavili našich najdrahších pokladov." 2ivS sú slová Baťka Potocké» ho aj dnes po 50-rocnom časovom odstupe. Dýchajú životom, lebo práve tak ako vtedy i dnes treba nám stáť v stave pohotovosti a brániť záujmy národa pred škodcami Slovákov. Z našej tlače priamo šľahajú výstražné hlasy.- "Buďme realisti — nedajme sa mýliť poblúdi- lými Slovákmi a Inými nepraj- nQcmi národa!" Počuť i varovné hlasy "dať si pozor na vlkov v ovčej koži í". I také, ktoré prezrádzajú, že "pomery medzi Slovákmi sú veľmi nezdravé... Ani nie Česi a iní robia neplechy, ale robia ich niektorí Slováci... Strieľajú jedovaté šípy do vlastných radov". Čo by nám za daných okolnosti odkázali Baťko Potocký? To čo odkázali svojim slovenským rodákom pred 59 rokmi. "Postavte sa proti nim... pre čert slovenského mena a za j^á- va slovenského národa!" Obetavosť a úsilie, akými sa Baťko Potocký zapojili do života Slovákov v Kanade, dnes si pripomíname e obdivom a vrúcnou vďakou. Hodnotíme sl ich tichú a nenáročnú prácu. Hodnotíme si ich ako človeka vysokých kvalit a ľudskej odvahy, preto že nezostali ľahostajným a nevšímavým k množ, stvni problémov, ktoré sťažovali náš slovanský vývoj a spolkár- sky život v Kanade, najprv v rokoch hospodárskej depresie, potom v rokoch vojny a po nej. Pri príležitosti vzácnych 95. narodenia Baťka Potockého, skláňam pred ich šedinami svoju hlavu v synovskej úcte s vďakou za veľkú prácu vykonanú na národa roli dedičnej a pre slovenské etnikum v Kanade a vrúcnym želaním dobrého zdravia do ďalších rokov života, ktoré im ešte ráčila vymerať Prozreteľnosť Božia v svojej nevyspytateľnej múdrosti prežiť v kruhu svojej vlastnej rodiny 1 v kruhu rodiny Slovákov v Kanade.

SINÁKOVÁ (Pokračovanie J “Hoei aj na Slovensku ea všetko zmenilo k lepšiemu, ale predsa nemala som toľko príležitostí ako tu. napríklad derme čítať dva denníky. Zdá sa mi, ako by som len teraz začínala poznávať svet. Všetko, čo som dosiaľ čítavala a zemepis, ktorému setn sa učila v škole, dnes mi je svet zreteľne vyobrazený pred zrakom. Leu to neviem, prečo sa tak obávum mora? Cítim, že moja noha nikdy viac nebude krááať po rodnej zemi. Bojím sa tej morakej hlbiny. A tak rada by som ešte raz precestovala Slovensko, aby som ho poznala aspoň tak ako náš Detroit, ktorý za tri roky môjho tona j. šíeho pobytu začínam dosť dobre poznávať." "Nuž, možno," a blažene sa zasmiala, "o dvadsať, tridsať rokov nechá ma strach, aký ma zothytil na mori. A potom a tebou ai budem môcť dôkladne poobzerať všetko na Slovensku, čo som pred mojím odchodom nemohla urobiť. Len si predstav, ty a ja, keď už naše vlasy budú pokryté šedinami, vydáme sa ešte raz na tú cestu a ako sa budeme veľkolepe cítiť!" Katka nikdy nechcela ináč zmýšľať. Nebojácne hľadela do budúcnosti a tak ju ani krušné časy neohrožovali, o ktorých sa v každej domácnosti predpovedalo. Každý sa obával a ustrnuté hľadel do budúcnosti, najmä že nastane veľmi nepríjemná zima Fo rozmýšľaní Dávid podotkol: "Dúfam, že s nami bude aspoň tak ako teraz. Ak nebude práce, domy budú klesať na cenách a tak aj všetko iná. Už bude aj po voľbách, nasledovne aj pomery by mali byť ustálené. Toho však nevidieť, naopak, všetko sa začína kolísať v nerozhodnosti." "Prečo sa máme predčasne obávať?" trvala Katka na svojom. "Veď je tu všetkého hojnoať, viac ako pred minulou svetovou vojnou, keď si ľudia skvele žili. Nikto nemal nedostatok. Zlé povesti zapríčiňujú najviac zlého. Každému je príliš dobre. A keď nadíde chvíľa nezamestnanosti, í obavy každý je netrpezlivý a predstavuje si zúfalosť. Ó, Dávid, v tejto bohatej a zlatej krajine nikto si nevie ani predstaviť, ako mu je dobre.

Ani zďaleka jej neprišlo na um, že by ju nejaká pohroma mala zastihnúť v živote. Po krátkom tnlóani zajasala; "Dávid, či naozaj by ei ma chcel previezť okolo jazera, ako si mi to už niekoľko ráz spomínal? Hovoril si aj o vidieku. Mohlo by sa to Stať ešte v tomto lete? Lebo pochybujem, že na budúce leto by sa mi ušli podobné prázdniny. Ako sme boli na ceste S pa.nl Šimonovou popoludní a teraz večer s tebou, akosi ma vidiek okúzlil. Nedbala by som pozerať na krásnu prírodu za hodiny, ba za mnohé dni." "Dobre," rozjarene odpovedal Dávid. "Môžeme to urobiť ešte tento týždeň, hoci Veronka nebude ešte úplne hotová eo svojim domom. Prečo by sme sa nemohli vydať na cestu už hneď zajtra?" neočakávane vybúsila z Dávida. "Keď myslíš, že to nebude urážka pre našich hosťov, nedbám, pristávam na tvoj návrh." "Pochybujem, že by to vzali za urážku, či .sa oni pýtajú náu, keď si vezmú do hlavy a rozbehnú sa až na Floridu? Alebo ea náa Milka pýtala, či jej dovolíme alebo nie prázdniny? Vzala si ich bez nášho povolenia í vedomia. My bi môžeme autom zaviezť do Muskegon Heights, odtiaľ nás prevezie loď do štátu Wisconsin. Stadiaľ autom naspat do Chicaga a tak domov. Nebojíš sa, že ochorieš na lodi?" "Čo som dnes videla v nemocnici, tak ma dojalo, že by som utiekla niekde, kým vládzem bežať. Nemienim byť chorá, nie, rozhodne nie!" Pritiahla sa bližšie k nemu a obvinula niku okolo jeho ramena. "Tak ea mi zdá, že sme kdesi na neznámom okolí, či sme ešte ďaleko od nášho domu? Vari by som sa tu mohla aj stratii. Myslela sem, že už poznám každý kút Detroltu." "Teda nevieš, kde eme?" pýtal ea mäkkým hlasom a pozrel sa na ňu tak milo, láskavo, že ju to až dojalo, "čoskoro budeme už doma. Zastavíme sa u Šimonových, alebo pôjdeme rovne domov? Máme si prichystať vecí ešte dnes večer, aby sme sa mohli zavčas rána vydať na cestu." "Nie, nezastavíme sa nikde, len poďme domov." čulé odpovedala, 'Ak chceš sa vydať zavčasu rána na ccatu, treba aa nám schystať. Mala by aom síce píeať. ale radšej pôjdem s tebou na cestu. Môžeš si tom ešte rozmyslieť- Ja chcem ešte niečo napiflať aby aom neposabudla na myšlienky. Ty za ten čas odpočívaj." Katka by bola rada, keby sa boí Dávid zastavil u Šimonových, hoci ona vyhýbala ich domu. Teraz by bola bývala, čo by bola panj Šimonovi hovorila o ich návšteve pri Anke. Ona sane nechcela pred Dávidom spomenúť an: alora g Anke, Lebo sa obávala, že sa rozčúli, lebo 88 vyhýba rozhovoru o nej. Katka vedela o tom. ako Dávid chodieval s Ankou ku Šimonovým. Vedela aj to. že Anka a jej rodičia požičali Šimonovým niekoľko tisícok do obchodu. A preto Šimonova pokladala si za svoju povinnosť navštíviť ťažko chorú Anku Katka vedela o všetkom, o to sa postarali Mihm Veronka a JuJka. Z ich údajov poznala Dávidov b Ankin životopis, keď spolu chodievali ako snúbenci. Auto zastalo pred ich domom. Všade bola tma. Katka sa tešila, že nikoho niet doma a ošetrovateľka už zaiste spala. Ešte môže teraz písať. Tešila sa, že skoro ráno sa vyberú na cestu a nebude sa mnsibť stretnúť s Róbertom. Líca sa jej znpírili pri tejto spomienke. Nikdy sa dobro necítila v jeho prítomnosti.

Veronku miloval, to ne- mohol nikto odäkriepiť. Keď es však stretol e Katcu, táto ea cítila nepohodlne. Nechcela oa postretnúť s nim. či azda len preto hovorila o ceete Dávidovi? Potom sama nad sobou sa musela smiať. Azda $a hanbila Róberta a či preto, že bol vždy taký zábavný a rád si zamieňal a ňou vzájomné myšlienky ? Tešil ea, keď mohol rozprával s takým, kto mu rozumel. Ona bola výnimkou, lebo tó akosi zmiatla, keď ea chcela a ním zhovárať, neovládajúc angličtinu, ako si to želala. Preto mu vyhýbala. Jej sa však videlo, že ju schválne vyhľadáva. Tešila sa, že sa to pominie, keď Róbert a Veronka odídu preč na celú zimu. Na písacom stolíku žiarila malá lampa. Katka pilne dokončievala bárok, keď začula auto sa skrútiť okolo domu a potom do dvora a tak do garáže Dávid už spal. Ona bola tiež ustatá. Prvá jej myšlienka bola zhasiť svetlo, ale to by bolo od nej nezdvorilé, keď už videli, že sa v tej izbe ešte svieti A potom medzi švagrinami a ňou by mohlo prísť k nedorozumeniu. Pozrela na hodiny. Rúčky ukazovali päť minút po tretej ráno. Ký div, že je taká unavená, veď pracuje od desiatej hodiny, posteľ ju tak vábi- Ci nemohla už apač. Teraz sa musí aspoň ukázať a povedať dobrú noe. Azda všetci sa budú ponáhľať ísť spať. Unavenosť ju takmer přikula ku stolíku. Vôňa kvetín viala 2 verandy. Pod oblokmi ozvali sa kroky, o chvíľu všetci budú dnu. Muei hneď vstať. Keď tak urobila, za nejaký Čas bola nútená upierať sa o stoličku, lebo natoľko mala etrpnuté údy. Pri dverách m ozvali známe hlaay “Katka, či ešte nespíš. Môžeme íať dnu, alebo radšej ty poď sem'" boli to hlasy Veronky s Milky. Aby sa Dávid nezobudil, vyšla von. Obstúpili ju obidve, vyobjímali a vybozkávali ju. Na očiach im zbadala, že Dávid musel im dačo vyzradiť. Pretvárala sa za chvíľu, ale dlho nevydržala. “Katka, prečo si nám to nevyzradila?" dohovárala jej Milka, znova ju objala. "Dávid je taký šťastný a naradostený, mysleli sme, žc vyskočí z vlastnej kože, keď nám oznamoval tú radostnú novinu.” Znova ju bozkali, Veronka horela zvedavosťou. Merala ju očami do hlavy po päty. Objala Katku a bozkala ju na obe líca: "Katka, aspoň nám povedz, kedy to bude? Ach. ako som rada!" Keď švagriná videli, že Katka je unavená, posielali ju spať, lebo aj ony chceli byť čím skôr v posteli. Keď Veronka videla, že Róbert sa dvíha zo stoličky v jedálni, pokývla hlavou ua Milku a Katku, aby odišli. Sestra cdorevadjla Katku do spálne, kvm Veronka chcela vziať Róberta do ich spálne. Keď však zbadal Katku žiadal, že ju chce vidieť. Veronka ho chytila za ruku a ťahala ho do ich izby, čo aa jej po hodnej námahe podarilo. A tam mu pomáhala pri zobliekani. Róbert kričal, že chce blahoželať Katke, ale Veronka ho tíšila sladkými slovami, aby len spal a nevyrušoval celý dom v nočnom odpočinku. Len asi o pol hodiny podarilo sa jej utíšiť manžela, ktorý uežadlho tvrdo zaspal, šla ešte pozrieť synáčka Róbertka a potom sa chcela znova vrátiť ku Katke a sestře. Ale si to rozmyslela a vrátila sa do svojej spálne- Bola rada, že si môže ľahnúť. Na okamih sa ustarala, že Katka vyzerá zmenená, ale sen ju vykúpil ío všetkých myšlienok. Katka sa úplne prebrala z cspanlivosti. Aj Milka bola čerstvá, ako by len teraz bola vstala po dlhom odpočinku- Rozprávala Katke, ako sa dobre zabávali, len ona b Dávidom ich chybovali, škoda, že neboli a nimi. 1 Obe sedeli na posteli v Milkinej Spálni. Milka aa prevalila cez posteľ a Katka na druhom konci uložila hlavu k odpočinku. Vedela, že Milka bude ešte niečo hovoriť a preto napínala sluch, aby jej neušlo ani jedno slovo, hoci ju kostí boleli, ako by ju bol niekto kyjom namlátil. A Milka zamyslene pokračovala: "Poviem ti ešte, ako sme sa dnes skvele zabávali. Vieš, Róbert nikdy nezažíva mnoho nápoja, ale dnes si trochu viac přihnul. Nijako sme ho nemohli dostať domov. Preto dnes tak mnoho hovoril, lebo je podgurážený; inokedy je dosť skúpy na slová. Vzal nás na večeru do Ann Arbor, čakali eme vás do pol ôsmej hodiny v Smith reštaurácii v susednom Dearborne. Tu chcel Róbert vyčkať na Dávida. Vraj keď tak prídete, potom už ľahšie vás bude môcť dostať s nami do Ann Arbor. Viem, že Dávid nerád ide na večeru autom na TO-míľovú diaľku, preto sme sa dohovorili, že prvá zastávka bude bližšie v Dearborn, mestečko susediace a Detroitom. Mala si vidieť, oko sme ea všetci cítili, keď sme prišli Ďalšie podrobnosti z bratislavskej manifestácie Kým sa v mysliach obCanov Bratislavy, celého Slovenska, ba celého štátu kryštalizujú city a pojmy o sviečkovej manifestácii na sviatok Zvestovania 25. marca, prenikajú stále nové podrobností o tejto udalosti. Najpikantnejšía zo všetkých sa tyká špičkových predstaviteľov strany a vlády. Podľa Deutsche Tagespost, odvolávajúcej sa na zvyčajne dobre informovaní bratislavské knihy, sa na pokojnej manifestácii zúčastnili aj predseda vlády SSR Peter Colotka, minister vnútra Štefan Lazár. vedúci tajomník mestského výboru strany v Bratislave Gej za Šlapka a Viliam Saigon — ako diváci z hotela Carlton. List biskupa Korca Išiel trda na správnu adresu. Na Kvetnú nedeľu konalo sa, teda dva dni po manifestácií, mimoriadne zasadanie mestského výboru strany. Nedištancoval sa od brutálneho policajného zásahu na Hviezdoslavovom námestí. schválil postup vysokých a stredných škôl v dŕoch pred, manifestáciou, nariadil bezpečnostným orgánom púdnikoin’ a vysokým školám Zistiť účastníkov manifestácie a vyvodiť z toho dôsledky. Potvrdil, že S3 na Hviezdoslavovom námestí a v priľahlých uliciach nachádzalo asi I5.onn ľudí, a vyjadril nespokojnosť s politickou a kádrovou prácou v podnikoch a na vysokých školách. Napriek tomu sa neočakáva, že hy vysoké školy alebo podniky vylúčili zo štúdia alebo z práce tých, o ktorých sa zistilo, že sa zúčastnili na manifestácii. Takto by Iba vzrástlo rozhorčenie v krajine a v zahraničí pre nezákonný a neľudský postoj úradov proti veriacim, a to tým viac, že o týždeň začali zasadania Helsinskej konferencU v susednej Viedni. O priebehu manifestácie preniklo na Západ niekoľko nových podrobností. Priamo pred Národným divadlom pred fontánou sa nachádzala žena v siedmom mesiaci tehotenstva. Dozaista následkom vody, podchladenia a šekov musela ešte V ten večer do nemocnice. Porodila bez problémov zdravé dieťa, najmladšieho svedka Bratislavského Veľkého plůtku.

Zarazený zastal a dával jej rukou znak, aby sa uhla, žena však neustúpila. Pred notredamským kostolíkom polievacie auto začalo c strekovať modliacich sa ľudí, Spontánne odskočil nabok, akrem jedného dievčaťa. Otočilo sa chrbtom a so sviečkou v rukách sa vystavila plnému zásahu «studenej vody. Najhlbšie dojmy z manifestácie si odnášali tí, ktorí boli v strede námestia. Keď sa začali modliť ruženec pohli sa policajné autá za zavýjania sirén smerom k nim. aby ich rozohnali. Veriaci ustupovali autám, ale sa nerozpŕchll. Rytmická modlitba ruženca s& v hluku motorov a sirén premenila na hlasné volanie k nebu. Boli to zdravasové výkriky. A čim väčší bol hluk a zmätok, tým viac sa stupňovala intenzita modlitby, Účastníci mali dojem turíčneho nadšenia. Bol to vraj taký silný- duchovný zážitok, že na to nemožno zabudnúť. Istý starší pán v kruhu priateľov sebavedome prehlási? "Rok som nebol na spovedi, ah bol som na manifestácii" Tesne pred začiatkom manifestácie stál pred kostolíkom Notre Dame dopisovateľ Hlssu Ameriky Jolyon Kegele spolu 90 svojím zahraničným kolegom. Všetci okolo nich sa modlili, oni dvaja nie. Istá staršia pani sa na nich obrátila: "Mladí muži, aj vy by ste sa mohli modliť." Negate odpovedaľ: "My sme no- vinárí" Pani na ta: "Ale nie že budete klamať o tom, čo sa tu deje..Odpovedal: "My sme s Hlasu Ameriky." A ona: "Tak pardon, pardon.. .* A e chvíľu: "Ale aj tak. by ste sa mohli modliť." Istý rádioamatér zachytil rozhovory medzi veliteľstvom bezpečnosti a jednotlivými operačnými jednotkami. Kúpte jeho záznamu kolujú po Bratislave oko senzácia. Istý člen bezpečnosti, ktorý sa zúčastnil na manifestácii, ss vyslovil, že asi polovica jeho kolegov vnútorne so zásahom nesúhlasila. A bolo lo aj poznať. Keď ľudia napríklad na jednej ulici ponúkali policajtom občianske preukazy s prosbou, aby ich pustili na námestie, títo sa na ne ani nepozreli, a ako kebv sa chceli ospravedlniť povediac.- "Nesmieme vás tam pustiť, na- komandovali nás sem.“ Ti príslušníci bezpečnosti, ktorí sa sprá valí agresívne a brutálne boli aj podľa svedetva zahraničných novinárov pod vplyvom alkoholu. Postup vlády, strany a bezpečnostných orgánov proti účastníkom manifestácie vyvolal aj medzi straníkmi a vysokými funkcionármi veľký rozruch a tvrdú kritiku. Vo vláde cítiť ešte stále napätie a neistotu. Vertaet v Bratislave a na celom Slovensku opanoval určitý pocit svätej hrdosti. Otvorene a odvážne vystúpili na verejnosť so svojim presvedčením. To vzbudilo úctu a obdiv aj u ateistov- Vládny systém ponižuje drvivú väčšinu obyvateľstva a núti Ju přetvařovat sa. jedno, čt sú veriaci alebo nie. Aj tí, ktorí sa na manifestácii nezúčastnili, cítili, že ľudia na Hviezdoslavovom námestí a v priľahlých ’Utolach vyjadrili niečo aj z nich a za nich. Takto sa dá vysvetliť mohutná odozva manifestácie a solidarita s ňou v celej spoločnosti Správanie sa veriacich malo takú vysokú duchovnú úroveň, že otvorilo pre život jed notuveov a celých skupín v štáte novú perspektívu dc budúc nos B.

EVANJELIUM Toto Je moje Telo, toto Je Krv moja čítanie zo svätého evanjelia podľa Marka. —- Prvý deň nekvasených chlebov, keď zabíjali veľkonočného baránka, povedali učeníci Ježišovi: "Kde ti mány* ísť pripraviť, aby si jedol veľkonočného baránka?" I poslal Ježiš svojich dvoch učeníkov a povedal Im: "Choďte do mesta a tam vás stretne človek, ktorý ponesie džbán vody. Nasledujte bo! A kde vojde, povedzte pánovi dumu: 'Toto tí hovorí Učiteľ: Kdeže je pre mňa sieň, kde by som Jedol veľkonočného beránka so svojimi učeníkmi?* A on vám ukáže veľkú miestnosť, prestretú a pripravenú. Tam nám pripravte!” Učeníci teda odišli, prišli do mesta a našli všetko tak, ako im predpovedal. I pripravili veľkonočného baránka. A keď Jedli, vzal Ježiš chlieb, požehnal, lámal s dával Im ho abovpri): "Vezmite, toto je moje Telo.” A vzal kalich, požehnal s podal lín ho, a pili z neho všetci, t povedal im; "Toto Je Krv moja, novej zmluvy, ktorá bude vyliata za mnohých.

Skrze Krista, nášho Pána. KRVOU PÁNA SPEČATENÍ "Vezmite. toto je moje Telo... tolo je Krv moja" (Mk 14, 22) Slávny nemecký hudobník Herman Kohen bol známy ako. že nič neverí. Jeho dobrý priateľ bol organistom v miestnom katolíckom kostole. Istého dňa sa stalo, že organista onemocnel a nemal kto hrať na popoludňajšej pobožnosti. Kohen sa podujal organistu zastúpiť. Hral všetko presne, ako mu noty ká- zalLKeď kňaz dával požehnanie s Prevelebnou Sviatosťou oltárnou, Kohen ostal sedieť 3 uprene sa díval na oltár. Stalo sa, že zrazu omdlel. Prebral sa len v kňazovej izbe, kde sa priznal, že keď kňaz dával pn^hnante, íq z oltára počul hlas: "Ja som Kristus, ktorý som zrazil z koňa pyšného Savla a pretvoril som ho na Pavla." Kňaz ho poučil o Prevelebnej Sviatosti oltárnej. Napokon sa dal pokrstiť, ba dal sa aj študovať za kňaza a stal sa slávnym kazateľom veľkého tajomstva Božieho... Slovo Božie tohoto sviatku oslavuje Telo a Krv Kristovu, ktorými bola spečatená zmluva medzí Pánom Bohom a človekom. žime tejto zmluve, aby sme mali nádej spasenia. 1. Telom 1 Krvou Pána spečatení. Cirkevní otcovia 2. vatikánskeho snemu vo svojej konštitúcii o Zjavení (14, 15) hovoria o pláne spasenia. Hovoria, že: “Láskyplný Bob, starostlivo zmýšľajúc a pripravujúc spásu ľudského pokolenia uzavrel zmluvu s Abrahámom (Gen 15. 18) a prostredníctvom Mojžiša s izraelským ľudom. (Ex 24, 8) Tieto zmluvy však boli spečatené len krvou zvieracou a preto boli len prípravou na obetu Tela a Krvi Ježišovej na kríži, potvrdenej jeho zmrtvýchvstáním. Čim sá stala spečatením nádeje spásy všetkých, ktorí v Krista uveríš. Toto "spečatenie“ je krásne předobrazené v príbehu prvého čítania tejto sv. omše. (Ex 2i, 3-8) Mojžiš tu vystupuje ako prostredník zmluvy medz! Pánom Bohom a vyvoleným ľudom. Mojžiš k tomu postavil oltár z dvanástich kameňov “masabah", ktorý označoval Božiu prítomnosť. Dvanásť kameňov zastu povalu dvanásť kmeňov Izraela. Krvou mladých býčkov, ktorá Je ncäteľkou života, naznačili, že u mávajú Boha za Pána všetkého života. Mojžiš kropil ľud krvou zvierat, aby boli účastní na božom živote. Ľud prisahal vernosť Pánovi a Pán im sľuboval svoje požehnanie, pravda zatiaľ kým mu budú verní. No, všetky starozákonné obete neboli vstave očistiť človeka od hriechu. Boli len predzvesťou najsvätejšej obete Syna Božieho, Ježiša Krista, ktorý svojou krvavou obetou na kríži zadosťučinil za hriechy sveta a ovocie svojho vykupiteľského diele zanechal v Prevelebnej Sviatosti oltárnej, aby ním posväcoval jednotlivca í celú ľudskú rodinu na ceste dc zasľúbenej zeme, do neba. Preto sv. Marek v dnešnom sv. evanjeliu (Mk 14, 12-16; 22-281 tak podrobne opisuje, ako náš Pán ustanovil Prevetebnú Sviatosť oltárnu. Bolo to, ako hovorí na deň nekvasených chlebov, keď svlatkoval so svojimi učeníkmi: “Keď Jedli, vzal chlieb, požehnal, lámal a dával ho svojim a hovoril: vezmite, toto je moje Telo. A vzal kalich, požehnal ho a... a povedal: toto je Krv moja, novej zmluvy, ktorá bude vyliatá za mnohých Robte to na moju pamiatku.” Boh Ježiš, ktorý pri svojom Vtelení vlo žíl svoje večné Božstvo dc ľudského tela, v Prevelebnej Sviatosti oltárnej svoje božstvo, so svojim osláveným Telom a Krvou, vkladá pod spôsoby Chleba a Vina, aby v nich zázračne mohol posväcovať tých, čo ho v pokornej viere prijímajú. Svojím Telom spečatil ich spasenie, po ktorom oni musia siahať a ho v pokore prijímať, aby sa posväcovali a boli spasení. 2. žime aj my tejto zmluve Nového zákona, aby sme mali nádej spasenia! Tragédia Jednotlivca, ako ej ktoréhokoľvek národa, malého i veľkého, spočíva v tom, že môže odumrieť v očiach Božích. Najprv odumrie jeho duša, lebo pretrhol svoje styky s prameňom všetkého života, so svojím Pánom Bohom. Potom to už Ide všetko dolu vodou: jednotlivec si zúfa, rodina sa rúca, nemravnosť sa šíri, vraždy sa páchajú bez akéhokoľvek strachu .. a nakŕmia jednotlivec, ako 1 celý národ zmizne z povrchu zemegule na veky. Jediná záchrana Je Vzkriesený Spasiteľ, Ježiš Kristus. On spečatil naše spasenie svojím Telom a Krvou a ponúka nám záchranu, aby sme žili, ako dietky novej zmluvy, dietky Vykúpenia. Sv. Pavol, ako čítame v druhom čítaní (žid 9, 11-15) nás o tejto pravde uisťuje. Hovorí, že Kristus: “Ktorý večným Du chom seba samého priniesol Bohu ako bezúhodnú obetu, očistí nám svedomie do mŕtvych skutkov, aby sme mohli slúžiť živému Bohu.” Vzkriesený Spasiteľ teda, ktorého prijímame pod spôsoba- ml Chleba a Vína, je všetko všetkým! Takto Vzkriesený Spasiteľ posväcuje aj to posledné dieťa na svete, posilňuje aj vojaka na fronte, ochraňuje pod zemou a aj matku, ktorá*^ sužuje nad svojou rodinou. V Prevelebnej Sviatosti oltáritej Ho prijímajú celého nielen na Slovensku, v Amerike, v Japonsku, na Filipínach, ba aj v Rusku a v Cíne. Preto sv Pavol hovorí, že: "Kalich požehnania je účasťou na Krvi Kristovej a Chlieb, ktorý lámeme. Je účasťou na Tele Kristovom. Keďže chlieb je jeden aj my sme jedno Telo.1' < 1 Kor 10,16-17) Keď toto všetko vieme, právom sa môžeme pýtať, že kde Je tá svätosť, ktorá by sa mala Javiť na tých mnohých, ktorí Pána prijímajú . . . ? Odpoveď môže byť len Jedna, Mnohí alce Páta. prijímajú, ale v neho neveria a preto v nich Jeho prítomnosť neprináša žiadne ovocie svätosti. Je to niečo, ako keď jeme aj obyčajný chlieb. Ak ho zdravo strávime, mení sa v našu ävotnú podstatu a udržuje nás na Žive. Tak Je to aj s nebeským Chlebom, s Ježišom v Prevelebnej Sviatosti oltárnej. Keby sme Ho prijímali v živej viere s v pokore srdca, musela by sa Jeho vôľa javiť na našom celom živote, na našej duchovnej podstate. Keby sme sa dali Kristovi posväcovať a pretvárať v 02a)- atmi dieťa Božie, napokon by sene mohli povedať so sv. Pavlom: "Dá nežijem Ja, ale žije vo mne Kristus." (Gal 2, 20) a keby sa tento posväcujúci proces uskutočňoval aj v našom blížnom, priateľovi 1 nepriateľovi, na svete by zavládla ozajstná svätosť života, ozajstný pokoj, pokoj bez strachu a násilia, po ktorom naše ubolené a rozcapartené storočie tak veľmi vzdychá. Bez Krista ho ale oni Jednotlivec a ani svet nedodali! Keď na tento sviatok prijmeme sv Prijímanie, náš Pán nás zas uistí, keď nám povie, že: "Toto Je moje Telo . . toto je Krv moja", ktorými sl nás pre seba spečatil, aby sme boli len Jeho. Neklaďme mu u? žiadne prekážky! prijmime Ho vždy v živej viere a v horúcej láske, aby sme mohli s medzispevom tejto sv. omše povedať- "Vezmem kalich spasenia a vzývať budem meno Pánovo" (2 113) až do dňa, keď Ho osobne stretneme, ako nám predpovedal, že zas príde a príde naisto! Čítanie z Knihy proroka Ozeáša. Toto hovorí Pán: “Keď bol Izrael mladý, nulová) som ho a z Egypta povolal som svojho syna A Ja som vodil Efralma, vzal som ich na ramená, no nezbadali že Ich opatrujem. Povrazmi ľudskosti som ich tiahol 8 lanami lásky; bol ako kto dvíha jarmo ponad ich líca a skláňal som sa k nemu, chovať ho. Srdce sa vo mne obracia, a budí sa zľutovanie moje. Nevylejem svoj rozpálený hnev, neznivočím zase Efralma. veď som ja Boh a nie človek. Svätý uprostred teba a nevojdern do mesta." Počutí sme slovo Pánovo. MEDZISFEV HTb, Boh spásy moje|, dúfam a nebojím sa, veď sila moja a chválospev môj je Pán a on sa mi stal spásou. Budete čerpať vodu v radosti z prameňov spásonestných. m Oslavujte Pána, vzývajte meno jeho, oznámte národom skutky jeho, rozhlasujte, Že je slávne meno Jeho. Budete čerpať vodu v radostí e prameňov spásonostných. Ospevujte Pána, veď veľkolepe konal, nech je to známe na celej zemi. Plesaj a Jasaj, obyvateľstvo Siona, lebo veľkým uprostred teba Je Svätý Izraela. Budete čerpať vodu v radostí 2 prameŕov spdsunostných. DRUHÉ ČÍTANIE Poznať lásku Kristovu, ktorú prevyšuje všetko poznanie čítanie z Listu svätého Pavla apoštola Efezanora. — Bratia! Mne, najmenšiemu zo všetkých svätých, dostalo sa milosti, že môžem pohanom zvestovať hlabozvesť o nepochopiteľnom Kristovom bohatstve a objasniť im, ako sa uskutočnilo toto tejomstro, skryté od vekov v Bohu, Stvoriteľovi všetkých vecí, aby sa takto nebeským kniežatám s mocnostiam v Cirkvi ukázala mnohotvárnosť a múdrosť Božia. To sa stalo podľa odvekého ustanovenia, ktoré sa uskutočnilo v Kristu Ježišovi, našom Páoovi. V ňom spočíva naša odvaha, že vierou v neho môžeme sa s dôverou blížiť k Bohu. Preto skláňam kolená pred Otcom, z ktorého má pôvod každá rodina na nebi aj na zemi, - aby vára dal podľa bohatstva svojej slávy prispením svojho Ducha mocne zosilnieť vo vašom vnútri; aby Kristus vierou prebýval vo vašich srdciach; abyste vy, v láske zakorenení a založení, mobil so všetkými svätými porozumieť tú šírku a dĺžku, výšku a hĺbku, poznať totiž lásku Kristovu, ktorá prevyšuje všetko poznanie, a aby vás naplnila všetka plnosť Božia. Počuli sme slovo Pánova. PRÍPRAVA NA EVANJELIUM (:Aleluja:) Vezmite na seba moje Jarmo a učte sa odo mňa. lebo som tichý a pokorný srdcom. CAleluJa:) EVANJELIUM Otvoril mu bok a vyšla krv a voda Čítanie zo svätého evanjelia podľa Jána — Keďže bol prípravný deň pred Veľkou nocou, židia požiadali Piláta, aby dal ukrižovaným polámať kosti a sňať ich telá, aby neostali.na kríži aj v sobotu, lebo to bola Veľká sobote. Prišil teda vojaci a polámali kosti prvému a tak aj druhému, Čo bol a ním ukri žovaný. Keď však prišli k Ježišovi a videli, že je už mŕtvy, nepolámali mu kosti, ale Jeden z vojakov prebodol mu kopijou bok. A hneď vyšla imr a voda. A ten, čo to videl, vydal o tom svedectvo b Jeho svedectvo je pravdivé; vte, že hovorí pravdu, aby ste aj vy verili. Stalo sa to preto, aby sa splnilo Písmo: Nepolámete mu kosti!

Jeho vzkriesené Srdce je preplnene bohatstvom lásky, ktorú tak veľmi potrebujeme, ako jeho dietky. Ak: "Budeme čerpať vodu v radosti z Jeho spásonosných prameňov", (iz 12) hovorí nám medzispev tejto sv. omše, že nám dá svoj pokoj a Istotu. po ktorých svet dnes tak lačnie KDE PREBÝVA LÁSKA "A ten, čo to videl. vgtUä o tom svedectvo" (Jn 19, 35) Keď 53 raz bolí pýtali istého zbožného veriaceho, že prečo toľké hodiny trávi v kostole, povedal: “Prečo by nie!

Slávnosť najsvätejšieho Srdca nášho vzkrieseného Spasiteľa nenl len oslava jeho nesmierneho milosrdenstva k padnutému človekovi. Je to aj oslava Jeho Lásky, ktorou chce usvedčiť každého, ako nás nesmierne miluje, ako mu na nás veľmi záleží. U proroka Ozeáša, ako nám hovorí prvé čítanie tejto sv. omše (Oz 11,1b; 3-4; Sc-9) sa nebeský Otec už dávno pred Kristom uvádza, ako plný mimoriadnej nehy. Prostredníctvom Oze- áša hovorí, že: "Keď bol Izrael mladý, miloval som ho 3 z Egypta som povolal svojho syna... Povrazmi ľudskosti som ich tiahol a lanami lásky." Ked sa mu ale Izrael odpláca svojou neverou, hovorí: "Srdce sa vo mne obracia a budí sa zľutovanie moje. Nevylejem svoj rozpálený hnev ... veď som Ja Boh a nie človek." Vo sv. evanjeliume dnešného sviatku (Jn 19, 3-37) sv. Ján dosviedča, že v Srdci Ježišovom prebýva Láska nášho Boha a Pána. Ján hovorí, že najvyšším dôkazom Jeho lásky bola Jeho žertva na Kalvárii. Keď hole žertva dokončená, mali Krista vyhlásiť úradne za mŕtveho. Aby sa vraj predišlo znesväteniu veľkonočnej soboty, ukrižovaným dolámali kosti na nohách, aby urýchlili Ich zomieranie, aby ich mohli pochovať pred západom slnka: "Keď ale prišli k Ježišovi a videli, že je už mŕtvy, nepolámali mu kostí, ale Jeden z vojakov mu prebodol koplou bok. A hneď vyšla krv a voda. A ten čo to videl, vydal o tom svedectvo." To bol Ján. Jánovi však nešlo o to, aby vydal historický dôkaz o Kristovej smrti, ale skôr, aby vysvetlil to, že z Kristovho mŕtveho boku vyšla "krv n voda". Ján hovorí, že to znamená nový zrod, sv. Eucharistie, začiatok Cirkvi, teda zaučinkovanle Ducha Svätého, Ducha Božej Lásky. Veď, po otvorení Kristovho boku na kríži, už nikto nemôže viac povedať, že Boh Je kdesi vysoko a ďaleko od človeka, že človeka nerozumie, alebo, že s ním nemôže cítiť ... I Bohočlcvek, Ježiš Kristus, prišiel týmto slzavým údolím, zakúsil chudobu, blen opustenosti... vzal na seba aj našu hanu hriechu, aby zaň vykrvácal. Teraz sa ku každému vo svojej nekonečnej Láske prihovára: “Vezmite sl na seba moje Jarmo a učte sa odo mňa, lebo som tichý b pokorný srdcom 8 nájdete odpočinok svojím dušiam Lebo moje jarmo Je lahodné a moje bremeno ľahké." íMt 11, 28-30) V Jeho Srdci ešte vždy prebýva plnosť Lásky, ochotná objať a občerstviť každého. 2. Za Jeho nekonečnú Lásku náš Pán očakáva našu odpoveď úprimnej lásky. Keď sa tak na tento sviatok úprimne zahľadíme na Srdce Ježišovo, živé, vzkriesené, v Prevelebnej Sviatosti oltárnej, obetované na dreve kríža, mali by sme byť pohnutí milovať Ježiša, ako najlepšie vládzeme a vieme. Sv. Pavol v druhom čítaní tejto sv. omše (Ef 3, 8-19) uvažuje o veľkosti Kristovej lásky a o nej hovorí, ako o: "Nepochopiteľnom Kristovom bohatstve..ktoré bolo: "Skryté od vekov v Bohu", a ktoré dnes Cirkev zvestuje celému svetu. Nám sa tiež z toho bohatstva dostáva, lebo aj my sa dnes: "Vierou a dôverou v neho rnôžme k Bohu blížiť". Preto viac, ako Inokedy, by sme sa mull na tento sviatok s Pavlom modliť: “Aby nám Ježiš dal, podľa bohatstva svojej s’ávy, prispením svojho Ducha, mocne zosilnieť v našom vnútri, aby Kristus prebýval v našich srdciach, aby sme v láske zakorenení a založení, mohli so všetkými svätými porozumieť tú šírku a dlžku, výšku a hĺbku, poznať totiž lásku Kristovu, ktorá prevyšuje všetko poznanie .. Kristovi preto nenl jedno, že sď nesmrteľné duše, za ktoré sa obetoval, v našich časoch vystavujú večnému zatrateniu a svojou ľahostajnosťou voči jeho Láske, zvolávajú na seba a na celú ľudskú rodinu kliatbu, ktorej sme už teraz svedkami. Práve toto ho viedlo, že sa v roku 1686 zjavil v meste Faray le Mo nial sv. Márii Margite Alacoque. Ukázal jej svoje krvácajúce Srdce a pripomenul jej, čo toto Srdce pre človeka vykonalo a ako sa mu človek odpláca, žiadal si, aby sa z úcty k Jeho Srdcu zaviedol zvláštny sviatok a tým, čo budú Jeho Srdce zvlášť milovať s uctievať a budú ho odprosovať za verejné urážky, sľubuje veľa dobrodenia a milosti. Svoje prisľúbenia Margite Alacoque Kristus zhrnul nasledovne: a. — Tým, Čo sa budú vo svojich ťažkostiach v dôvere na mňa obracať, dám potrebnú milosť ich stavu a povolaniu. b. — Tým, čo ma budú uctievať, budem na pomoci v Ich prácach a potechou v ich utrpeniach. c. — Rodinám, ktoré si ma budú uctievať, dám opravdivý pokoj a Lásku. d. — Požehnám všetky podujatia tých, čo ma budú úprimne milovať. e. — Hriešnici nájdu v mojom Srdci more milosrdenstva a zľutovania. f. — Vlažné srdcia prebudím zo spánku a zapálim ich svojím plameňcm lásky. g. — Duše, ktoré budú rozširovať lásku k môjmu Srdcu odmením a budem im na pomoci. h. — Požehnám demy, v ktorých obraz môjho Srdca vyvesia a uctia. a túži... Otec Augustín J. Záň Božské Srdce Pozrite na toto ranené ardce, Z ktorého za vás vytiekla krv a voda. Toto je to srdce, čo vás tak čisto & vrúcne milovalo, že nemohlo byť spokojné bez vás, že sa aj neba zrieklo a prišlo na ľudský spôsob milovať a trpieť, a vykrvácať. To je to Srdce láskavé, tiché a ponížené. Do smrti bilo za vašu spásu a odpúšťalo. Postite, v ňom sú poklady lásky a vedomosti, v dom stánok Boží, v dom večná láska, v dom vaša skrýša a život večný. Preto ho ničím neobrážajte, kopiju hriechov 3 podlej zrady doú nevrážajte. Kľaknite pred ním a s veľkou úctou klaňajte sa mu v poníženosti. Pozrite na toto ranené srdce a ďakujte mu, že za vás z neho vytiekla krv a voda. Kto by ho mohol za to nemilovať, kto sc slzami neodpresovať za svoje hriechy a všetky hriechy hriešneho sveta? Ukry nás, Pane, do svätej rany, Z ktorej ti srdce vykrvácalo! Na ardce si nás daj ako pečať, aby sme mohli milovať teba vždy v&čšmi a väčšmi LIST VERIACICH PREDSEDOVI VLÁDY Viaceré tlačové agentúry, ako napr. Associated Press, priniesli v týchto dňoch správy o liste, ktorý 512 bratislavských veriacich na obrátilo na predsedu vlády C-SSR Ľubomíra Strougsia 13. apríla Lr. List znie takto: "Vážený súdruh, predseda vlády! Obraclune sa na Vás s naliehavou žiadosťou, aby ste prešetrili, kto dal podnet a rozkaz na brutálny zásah príslušníkov zboru Národnej bezpečnosti, ktorí zaútočili dňa 25. marca 1998 v Bratislave o 18. hodine a 10. minúte ■ autami a obuškami na pokojne stojacich a modliacich aa ari 5 tisíc osôb, ktoré pred kostolom našej farnosti Notre Dame nijako nenarušovali verejný poriadok. Napriek tomu, v uniformách zboru Národnej bezpečnosti oblečení muži do davu vrážali za jazdy s nákladnými a osobnými autami ohrozovali životy občanov. Tých, ktorí unikali pred týmto životu nebezpečným zásahom, bili obuškami a tlačili do áut. Jednomyseľne sa pridávame k listu nášho biskupa Jána Chryzostoma Korca, ktorým protestoval u predsedu vlády Slovenskej socialistickej republiky proti tomuto činu. Pretože dodnes nedostal vysvetlenie o tom brutálnom zásahu zboru Národnej bezpečnosti v Bratislave, obraciame aa na Vás b rozhodným protestom proti tomuto konaniu príaluánflcov zboru Národnej bezpečnosti. Nikto z prítomných veriacich občanov na námestí nijako neohrozoval poriadok, sal nenapadol ani len slovne, žiadneho z príslušníkov zboru Národnej bezpečností. Preto musíme tento zákrok zboru Národnej bezpečnosti odsúdiť ako nepochopiteľný a neoprávnený. Pridávame sa k listu O- biskupa Jána a k listu O. kardinála Františka Tomáška, ktorí upozorňujú na dlhotrvajúce ne- rieáenic oprávnených požiadaviek veriacich u nás. Rozhodne sa dištancujeme od vystúpenia Štefana Záreczkého v československej televízii a dennej tlači a spcľutovanlm konštatujeme, že jeho vystúpenie malo prnticlrkcvný charakter. Prosíme Vás, aby ste dali túto záležitosť prešetriť federálnemu ministrovi vnútra C-SSR a požiadali ministerstvá kultúry Č-SSR a SSR, &by urýchlene prispeli k vyriešeniu oprávnených náboženských potrieb veriacich v zmysle listov na- älcb biskupov a Otca kardinála. Prosíme Vašu odpoveď zaslať na dole uvedenú adresu, aby sme ti ju všetci 512 čelupodpí- saní mohli prečítať, kde bude vyvesená na dverách nášho farského a dekanského kostola. Naše podpisy zasielame na náš ordinariát, kde sú k dispozici! k nahliadnutiu a k počítaniu. Zaslanie k Vám by však predstavovalo, ako nás o tom učí skúsenosť z minulosti, vlnu vyšetrovania príslušníkmi zboru Národnej bezpečnosti a analýzu podpisov príslušníkmi Štátnej bezpečnosti. Sme presvedčení, že by ea k Vám nedostali, preto ich odosielame n& náš ordinariát S úctou: veriaci farnosti Svátého Martina a ďalších bratislavských farno. Ml.

Stále si robil žarty na budúceho pána poslanca Krticu, niekedy raäel trochu priďaleko. Prísediaci sa začali bádať sem tam padlo 1 ostrejšie slovo. Keď krčmár Slopaníak priniesol fľašu na stôl, bolo všetko v poriadku potom sa jazyky rozviazali, ako kudela. — Paľo Guláš zazdrav- kal: — “Nech žije náš b&ťko Stalin!” Gejza Tutlík sa naňho díva a hovorí: — “Pred rokom d kričal, nech žije Hitler'" Paľo Guláš sa usmial a hovorí: “No, a žije?" Po dobrej domácej sa politizovalo ešte tuhšie, sito predtým. Paľo Guláš si strieľa] z budúceho poslanca demokratickej strany Krticu.
