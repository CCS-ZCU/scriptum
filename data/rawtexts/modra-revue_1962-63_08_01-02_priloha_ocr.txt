Dr. ŠTEFAN OSUSKÝ'S ADDRESS ON THE ANTI-COMMUNISTS FREEDOM DAY, JANUARY 23, 1962 [pageend1]I am taking the floor to voice the sentiments of the Czechoslovak Delegation to commemorate the eight anniversary of the 22,000 Chinese and Korean prisoners of war, in the custody of the United Nations forces in Korea, who refused to return to their Communist-enslaved homeland of Northern Korea, and of Communist China. Having a choice to return to their Communist ruled home- lands and freedom, they chose the latter, despite the systematic efforts of Red agents to brainwash them. The Czechoslovak Delegation, joins in celebrating the anniversary of those heroic Chinese and Korean prisoners, as their fellow victims, not only of the evil men of Moscow and Peiping, but of the so-called good men and self-deceivers whose genius crowned their efforts with but an ephemeral success. This requires an explanation on my part. The Prime Minister of India, JAWAHARLAL NEHRU, addressing the Germans in 1956, said: “A good man, who commits an evil act, is more dangerous than an evil man“. In saying that, he articulated a profound truth. When we speak about Soviet or Red China brain-washing, we mean double talk, double standard of morality, and deceit, which constitutes Communist ethics. We feel, we believe that this brain-washing cannot happen in free democratic countries. What an illusion. The Western World and the Assembly of the United Nations have grown used to Mr. NEHRU in the role of a good man, preacher of justice among nations and apologist of neutralism. As late, as last November, he pleaded, before the United Nations General Assembly, for a new approach to international affairs, “the approach of cooperation“. In the General Assembly of the United Nations he excelled in tightrope walk while the Hungarian people, clamoring for self-determination, were slaughtered by the Red Army. The same NEHRU found no word of condemnation for Soviet Russia's renewal of nuclear tests, in violation of her solemn agreement. 1 [pageend2]For nearly ten years, Red Chinese troops occupied several thousand square miles of Indian territory, and JAWAHARLAL NEHRU said nothing about it either to the Indian Parliament or to die Indian people. On the contrary, he was brain-washing the 400 million people of India. Until 1959 he went out of his way to compliment Red China and to thrust his friendship upon her. He championed Red China's admission into the United Nations, and the eviction of the present China representation of that China where the 22,000 North Koreans and Chinese prisoners of war, in the custody of the United Nations forces in Korea, took refuge. Mr.NEHRU, championed Red China's admission into the United Nations, despite the fact that she remains condemned as the aggressor, in the Korean war against the United Nations. And the same Mr. NEHRU, apostle of international justice, of peaceful co-existence and negotiated peace, sent 30,000 Indian troops, backed by jet planes and ships, to take 1300 square miles of Goa, to “liberate“ it, however, without asking the people whether they wanted to be liberated. Yes, the ruler of a great and noble country of 400 million people, NEHRU, with his world wide reputation of being a good man, commited evil acts, both by commission and omission, and, therefore, by his own words, is more dangerous to peace and to the free world, than the evil men of Moscow and Peiping. More dangerous, because men, reputed to be good, by committing evil acts of omission or commission, spread disillusionment about higher values, such as truth, honesty, pledged word and confidence, upon which the security of nations and peace of the world depend. Let me give you another example of the freightening truth, as to how, by ignorance or self-deception regarding their personal genius good men of great nations sitting in the drivers seat, bring misfortune upon their own country as well as upon humanity. Neville Chamberlain, the last British Prime Minister preceding World War II, was regarded by the British as being in the best tradition of British Prime Ministers: a kindly, agreable and human family-man, with clear and muscular mind, and an outstanding social reformer. Not versed in foreign affairs he did not fully realize what it was he was doing; but he had a naive confidence in his own judgement and powers of persuasion and a- chievement. MEIN KAMPF,in which Hitler outlined his own programe for taking over Europe, did not impress him. Hitler s systemathic violations of the 2 [pageend3]Versailles Peace Treaty military and political provisions, on which peace in Europe depended, did not bother him. Mass massacres of Jews and of Hitler s blood-bath of his own collaborators, did not disturb Chamberlain. The violation oi the Locarno Treaty of 1925, of which Great Britain was a guarantor, and which Hitler, on his accession to power, in 1933, officially confirmed as binding, did not unsettle Chamberlain. Hitler's rearmament and Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations did not upset him; and Austria s annexation did not deprive him of his peace of mind. After his visit to Hitler at Berchtesgaden, 15 September 1938, Mr. Chamberlain wrote his sisters: “I got the impression that there was a man who could be relied upon when he had given his word“. After the Munich sell out of Czechoslovakia, September 29th 1938, Mr. Chamberlain announced that it meant “peace for a life time“. He believed that by sacrifying the nations of Central Europe, he can make a deal with Hitler. The ultimate effect of Chamberlain's efforts was just the opposite. It is Hitler himself who disclosed it, immediately after the Munich Conference. Hitler was dissatisfied with himself that he accepted the partitial solution about Centrale Europe. Chamberlain made on him the impression that the West was cowardly, degenerated and weak. When the Military Governor of Bavaria, General von Epp, congratulated him on his success at the Conference table, Hitler, offended by the congratulation, retorted: “And even you come to congratulate me to it?“ rhe British Prime Minister s behaviour gave Hitler the impression that henceforth he can dictate in Europe, and impose on England the solution which he had in mind when writing his MEIN KAMPF. When, five and a half months later, Hitler violated the Munich Agreement, and Mr. Chamberlain hastened to sign an agreement with Poland to defend it against agression, Hitler no longer took him seriously. He concluded with Stalin a non aggression pact, containing the provision that in event of a Polish-German war, the Germans would not seize the Ukrainian, White Russian and Lithuanian Provinces, belonging to the Polish state, bui would leave them to be occupied by the Soviet army, in the event of a Polish defeat. Thereupon Hitler attacked Poland and divided the spoils with Stalin as agreed. 3 [pageend4]As far as Great Britain and France were concerned, ultimately they had to fight Hitler to save their own skin and, to lose their colonial empires. All that remains of the political genius of those good men who lived by self-deceit, are the evil acts of omission and commission of which our nations are the victims. Let me say this: Stalin, Khrushchev, Mao-tse-tung and their satellites in Europe and Asia, can match, point by point, all the categories of crimes, faithlessness and deceit of which Hitler made himself quilty. Prof. George Santayana, American poet and philosopher of Spanish discent, uttered this great warning: “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it“. Are the victorious Western free nations remembering Neville Chamberlain's tragic example? Since at Yalta and Potsdam they arrogated to themselves the right to dispose of our nations and decide their destiny, we have the right to remind them that by doing so they simultaneously assumed the responsibility never let our common enemy commit an evil act against our enslaved nations without challenging it. If they omit to do so, they are privy to and accessary before or after the act, as the case may be, of every crime committed by the Soviets and their satellites, and responsible for the sufferings they cause to our nations. However, the most reprehensible aspect for the free world and the most painful for the enslaved nations in Europe and Asia, is the spectacle of brain-washing going on, not behind the Iron and Bamboo Curtains, but in the United Nations. Let me refer to the most revolting case. The General Assembly of the United Nations is hammering away on the right of self-determination of the Asian and African colonial peoples. These debates are taking place in the midst of the most eloquent, sanctimonious mutism of the representatives of the free nations, regarding the right of self-determination of the now enslaved nations in Europe and Asia whose national existence goes back into distant centuries. This constitutes the most damaging world-wide brain-washing. It gives a distorted image of the free and communist nations. It blurs in the minds of peoples a distinction between freedom and slavery, right and wrong, truth and lies. Those who wish to save the United Nations should remember that liberty, democracy and peace are endangered in, and outside, the United Nations, not only by the Soviets and Red China, but also by the absence of an avowed moral purpose, implying dedication to the Rule of Law, and to the ideas and principles for the implementation of which the United Nations was created. 4 [pageend5]
