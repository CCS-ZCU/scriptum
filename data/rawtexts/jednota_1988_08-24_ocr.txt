Those words were spoken on September 6,1890, in Cleveland, Ohio, by Father Stefan Furdek 42 conventions ago.

While maintaining and improving through good leadership its insurance programs and a good financial base, the Society, asagood steward. has also continued to be aware of its responsibility as a caretaker of the timeless treasures which the Slovak family possesses The business of the Society is not. and was not intended to be, simply the business of a financial corporation; but. also the matter of being a "custodian" ol a precious heirloom: the spini and faith of a people.

Sincerely In St. Benedict. RT. REVEREND RÖGER W. GRIES. O.S.B. Abbot The First Catholic Slovak Union is soon to celebrate a milestone in its history — the centennial anniversary of Its founding by Fr. Stephen Furdek. He began with a vision ninety-eight years ago In Cleveland, Ohio, by concentrating on the strength of Slovak Catholics for the formation of a society that would unite other associations to form a single union — the Jednota. True to his priestly devotion to God and the people, the motto of tiie Jednota became. "Za Boha a narod" — "For God and Nation.” Our Society has had an illustrious and challenging history. With any great organization, there are peaks and vaiieys, joys and sorrows, harmony and controversy. All of these have touched our Jednota, but all of these have made the Jednota the outstanding organization that it Is today. As we have heard before. God has His hand In the work we do. We can only become stronger as a result. This 43rd National Convention will be historic because what we do as delegates will flow Into the next centennial year. Already weare on the threshold of great progress- Together we need to stand united as a Slovak people, a Catholic people, that we may always work for the greater honor and glory of God and be faithful to our Slovak heritage. Our forefathers and mothers have given us a proud legacy to imitate — fidelity to the Church and loyalty to the traditions of Che Slovak nation. May we never forget what they have handed down to us. Father Furdek and the pioneers of the First Catholic Slovak Union were visionaries.

Supreme Chaplain Washington Letter The Black Catholic Vote and the Issue of Abortion Illusions and Realities WASHINGTON (NC) - Many pro-life leaders have said the abortion issue could be "the winning issue” in Lhe 1988 elections. They have predicted that Democrats who voted for Ronald Reagan would vote for Vice President George Bush as his • successor if the Republicans repeat their strong 1980 and 1984 plank against abortion in their 1988 platform. Among, those Democrates could be many black voters because "the black pro-life community Is Just beginning to organize and exercise its politi- (USPS 2735001 Catholic Weekly Issued Every Wednesday Publisher and Proprietor FZKST CATHOLIC SLOVAK WHOM of the United State* of America and Canada JOSEPH C.

Archbishop Eugene A. Marino of Atlanta and other black Catholic leaders point out that reverence for'life has been a traditional value of African American culture. The archbishop in an interview said reverence for life has endured "through the horrors of slavery, the tragic breakup of families and generations of unequal status." bul that black AM other «mntries — S20.00 Catholics. and Catholics in general, are not "as visible as they ought to be" on the issue. Mrs- James said the challenge before Nov. 8 for Black Americans for Life, with Its 4.000 members in 40 states, "is to take that overwhelming pro-life sentiment that already exists in the black community and translate it into social and political action." Statistics from Black Americans for Life show that blacks have abortions at almost twice the rate of other races. Of the 1.6 million abortions performed each year in the United States. 400,000 are performed on black women. The nation's black Catholic bishops In a 1984 pastoral letter on evangelization said society's and the black community's acceptance of abortion as a common procedure and "even as aright” has eroded the black perspective on life and "Che mystery of Its transmission and growth. "The loss ... is a cultural and spiritual Impoverishment for us as a people." they wrote, adding that black Catholics have a duty to reassert their traditional values of family and children. They also said that blacks plagued by economic problems "are too often encouraged tó (Continued on Page 7) What Is It about Jesus that temps a top filmmaker and a first-class novelist?

The women carried baskets of carnations. distributing them to onlookers along the parade route. "Even though we had no float this year, what made this parade special Is that our Slovak group won the award for "Best Ethnic Unit. Slovak Performers " Our unit received a plaque in remembrance of the event and a check for $400 was presented to the Tatra Slovak Dancers- The units were Judged by several TV anchor people, business administrators, and dignitaries. "On Parade Day. Saturday. June 25. the temperature soared to 100 degrees. The heat pouring up from the asphalt and concrete brought the heal to 105-degree levels yet all the marchers In costumes and uniforms carried on stolcly to the end. "The parade festivities began with the simultaneous unfurling of 26 huge banners across the city. Happing In Lhe breeze and proclaiming Milwaukee a 'Midwestern Camelot.' As the banners unfurled hundreds of colored balloons were released from the downtown Federal Plaza. These banners will continue to fly during the summer "A group of Slovaks also represented us at the pre-parade luncheon held Friday, June 24. in the renowned Pfister Hotei grand ballroom. Among those present were co-chairpersons, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Chabron. Mrs. Bert Kramoris. representative, Mr. and Mrs Stan Lance. Mrs. Mary Misany and Mrs. Idka Rajec.

We are a fraternal organization, and as such, our excess funds arc io be spent for the promotion of the objectives for which our Society was founded ninety-eight years ago. We were founded to protect the common Interests of our membership in the area of religion, culture, history, literature, and generál well being. Initially this was accomplished through the creation of the JEDNOTA newspaper for the enlightenment and education of our membership. and the construction of our orphanage building in Middle- town in 1913, in which over 4,000 orphans were raised over the years. In later years these common interests were expanded to include the Institute of SS. Cyril and Methodius in Rome, to which over $190-000 was donated for its creation over twenty-five years ago; to the Slovak altar and chapel at the Immaculate Conception Cathedral In Washington. D.C.. to which wc donated over $ 125.000 twenty years ago; to the Benedictine Abbey Program, to which we donated $200.000Just six years ago: and to the Conference of Bishops Building Program in Washington. D.C.. to which we are being asked to donate funds at this 43rd National Convention. "These common interests also include our contributions of 825,000 annually for the establishment of a Slovak Chair at the University of Pittsburgh In Pittsburgh. Pennsylvania; our contributions to the Slovak World Congress, the Slovak League uf America, to the Slovak Catholic Federation, and our contributions to hundreds of other philanthropic programs in the Slovak and peripheral communities. "The Jednota, inc holding company was created to protect the tax free status of our Society so that funds could continue to be made available for Slovak fraternal programs and projects Without the Jednota, Inc holding company and its affiliated subsidiaries. our tax free status was in jeopardy and it was highly possible to have lost our tax free status, requiring the payment of taxes on all of our earnings within the First Catholic Slovak Union, both insurance related and non-insurance businesses.

Every Memoria] Day he puts on hit I American Legion cap and reflects on hls experiences of । many years ago. Now at age 90 he is one of the dwindling number of World War 1 veterans and one of the few left who fought In the 1916 campaign to cap* ture the Mexican bandit and revolutionary. Pancho Villa. Lauf was bom in Slovakia and came to Torrington with his mother. Hls father followed them three years later. At age 17. being undecided on what to do with hia life, he joined the Connecticut National Guard. Shortly thereafter. President Woodrow Wilson ordered the Guard to southern Arizona to protect the border from Pancho Villa, whose raids into the state had already killed several ľ Americans. The expedition was led by the General Jehn J. "Black Jack" Pershing. It was an experience that Lauf would never forget. He clearly remembers General Pershing and hls meticulous sense of order. He always went by the book. Lauf recalls. Everyone was anxious to get to Arizona but once there, the enthusiasm died. The combination of heat, bad water, rattlesnakes and glia monsters made life there most difficult. When he was discharged. Lauf was a living 110-pound skeleton. After his return to Connecticut, Lauf Joined the 21st French Foreign Legion, which was made up of mostly Slovaks. He fought at Verdun and received the French Croix de Guerre. There probably were many other Jednotar members who served with General Pershing in the American Southwest during the spring and summer Of 1916. but unfortunately we have only a few names. Pictures of a few like Jan Prokop and Jan Juriga of the St. Joseph the Guardian Society (Branch 166 in Binghamton, N.Y.) appeared Ln the JEDNOTA paper on August 2. 1915. Both men were part of Battery C. Another Jednotar, Juraj Pavol from Chicago. 111., was sent to the Southwest to take part in the expedition. He went first to San Antonio, then to Arizona. He wrote to JEDNOTA saying that there were many ■ Chicago Slovaks in hls unit. He requested that the JEDNOTA paper be sent there so they could follow the news of the Society. But neither John Lauf, Jan Prokop. Jan Juriga. Juraj Pavol nor General Pershing ever did catch Pancho Villa The Mexican's knowledge of the terrain was just too good. We are fortunate, though, in knowing that some Jednotars such as John Lauf were part of the famous American expedition.

"At the annual Jednota Picnic we were heartened by the support and interest shown by many people who came to the display table for this U.S. postal stamp effort, Óne nice lady offered a donation for our postage costs etc., but we declined the offer as we are only asking that people write letters and continue to petition as their contribution to this worthy cause.

She married Michael Senyitko in Patton. Pa., in 1905. "I am also looking for relatives of George Vinder who was related to my Grandfather. Michael Senyitko. Michael was born in Nizny Hrusov, Zemplín County. "Please contact Mrs. Carolyn Senyitko Corcoran. 459 Canterbury Road. Bay Village. Ohio 44140. Thank you." Married Peapie Need an Embrace Too There was a memorable line uttered by the old lady in "Gulden Girls," the TV sit-com. "I haven't had sex In 15 years." she said, "and Lt’s starting to get on my nerves." Hilarious laughter followed as the audience Jnstatnly expressed its empathy. "It's starting to get on tny nerves” is a line that captures the difficulty of chaste Jiving. Chastity Involves the cross whether it is marital chastity, single chastity ar celibate chastity. When Pope John Paul II visited the United States, he surprised everyone when he embraced Father Frank McNulty who had Just delivered an address which made significant references to the difficulties priests face in living out their celibate commitment. It was a rare moment, the Pope smiling with his arms around the priest. I wish the Pope would embrace and smile upon all those noble married, people who have carried the burdens and obligations af marriage for so long and With such courage, not always in perfect harmony with the Ideals of our faith, but with generosity nonetheless, [ wish the magisteritun would communicate a little more sensitivity to the problems of ordinary’ people. The world Is preaching that sex is a personal right to be used at will according to one’s pleasure. The church teaches that it is a gift to be used wiihin the context of a human love commitment, namely marriage. The call co holiness is clear. The church believes and teaches that holiness is possible. I only wish that our shepherds had the ability to communicate their love for souls in a more effective way, At times the language of the magisterlum lacks the human dimension. People In our society are not lined up to receive church teachings as in a schoolroom exercise. We have to get their attention. Some good people are nolyel willing or able to live up to the call to holiness, but they want to be better. We should encourage them more. We should embrace them with love and respect as Jesus did. After afl, it was He who said. "Has no one condemned you. neither do ] condemn you ” Even though He was careful to add. "Go and sin no more." still. He reached out in love to one who was more a victim than a malicious person. Fora free copy ortho Cdrlstophcr News Notea.

And. here we are. almost 50 years later, almost a century beyond lhal first convention. Ged has blessed our Society with leaders who have foresight people of vision and courage. Through Iheir leadership, we are experiencing growth and have entered into a new era. There is a freshness about the Jednoia today, ft's on the move. It doesn't take much to observe ihat Ihings are happening.

And, while we expend a great deal of energy on the means wiih which to do. we are continually called and challenged by God to do that for which we have ihe means. In the Lord's scheme of things, those two aspects always go together. The mission In which the FirstJS^.ak Caiholic Union can ptey a part al ihrs particular time al its history, even to a greater degree than it has in the past, has to do (in my humble opinion) with the slrargihening of the ties which bind the Slovak Community together Living cut ihe Eucharist which we celebrated this morning is the taking ol God's gifts and giving them back to him as gifts of our own, — particularly in service of his people Blessed is he who can keep a family together.

As proud as we may be of accomplishments thus far attained. Ihere are others lor which lo reach. And proud, in Ihe good sense at that word, we, as the Slovak community, indeed should be.

They had observed a few of his disciples eating meals without having purified — that is to say. washed — their hands. The Pharisees, and in fact all the Jews, cling to ihe custom of their ancestors and never cal without scrupulously washing their hands. Moreover, they never eat any thing from the market without first sprinkling it. There arc many other traditions they observe — for example, the washing of cups and jugs and kettles. So the Pharisees and the scribes questioned him: "Why do your disciples not follow the tradition of our ancestors, but instead take food without purifying their hands?" He said to them: "How accurately Isaiah prophesied about you hypocrites when he wrote. 'This people pays me lip service but their heart Is far from me. Empty is the reverence they do me because they teach as dogmas mere human precepts.' You disregard God's commandment and cling to what is human tradition." He summoned the crowd again and said to them: "Hear me. all of you. and try to understand- Nothing that enters a man from outside can make him impure, that which comes out of him. and only that constitutes impurity. Let everyone heed what he hears! "Wicked designs come from the deep recesses of the heart: acts of for- nicadon. theft, murder, adulterous conduct greed, maliciousness, deceit sensuality, envy, blasphemy, arrogance, an obtuse spirit- All these evils come from within and render a man impure."

British Columbia (NC) — A papal document on the mission of Ihe laity in the church and in (he world is expected to be published In late September, said Archbishop Jan P. Schotte, general secretary of the wörld Synod Ol Bishops. The archbishop said that me follow-up document to the 1987 synod on the laity would bring the major points of the synod into “the mainstream of the church 's rife and action." Bary With Dignity CHICAGO (NC) - Cardinal Joseph L Bernardin of Chicago led more than 500 pro-life activists in a service al a Catholic cemetery near Chicago lo "bury wiih dignity" the remains ol nearly 2.000 unborn babies The July 30 event at Queen of Heaven Cemetery . HflP side, consisted of a memorial Mass in the mausoleum chapel and a simple graveside rite, celebrated by Cardinal Bernardin al Ihe request of anti-abortion groups organized by Ihe Pro-Life Action league From a news point of view, important breakthroughs probably wJI involve the new labor office and the Vatican bank. But any major changes here will illustrate papal administrative thinking, not where he wants to lead the church, doctrinally and spiritually. Tucked into the document, though, were signs of the pope's faith in collegishty and his desire to foster greater unity between the papacy and the world's local bishops. Cotiegiakty involves shared responsibility between the pope and the world hierarchy in running church affairs The decree devotes a section to "ad limine" visits made by local bishops Io the Vatican every five years lo report on the status ol their dioceses to the pope and curial officials Pope John Paul's reform describes the visits as cdiegiel interaction between bishops and lbe Curia II also pledges that the Curia will not become a barrier between the pope and local bishops and asks the Curia to consult bishops when preparing major documents The decree also describes the work of a papally appointed Council cl Cardinale advising the pope on Vatican finances and organization as having curial significance, atthourýi not a formal Curia agency Since the council was formed in 1981. the pope has chosen noncuria) cardinals with long experience heading major archdioceses The Vatican bank must inform the council of its activities, according lo the reform decree. This is a new responsibility lor the council The decree establishes a five- year tern for council members allowing the pope to periodically rotate the membership lo keep fresh ideas liowing.

Speaking at a weekly general audience at the Vatican Aug. 17. the pope described Christian spiritual progress as a “gradual transformation" undertaken in imitation ol Christ. "Jesus did not merely leave his followers wrth a magrWrcenl theory of how to act. Rather, he put into practice what he taught." Ihe pope told several thousand visitors. The supreme example of this was Christ's death on the cross, the pope said. He said Christians should see their own suffenrig as a "moral trial" anfl use hardships as occasions ol "interior purification." The pope offered spacia’ greetings lo pilgrims who visited Rome lor ceremonies marking the close of the Marian year. "This great ecclesiai event should signify for each and every one a very deep call to feel our selves true sons of holy Mary and to express ii each day by the example of our Christian life." he said. “May the spiritual fruits of the Marian year endure in your lande." the pope said. Also present was a group of Mio Mac Indians in native costumes from Ihe Canadian province of Quebec. The Indians were part of an international youth group called Youth for Ihe Earth, which was in Rome lo promote an aid campaign for Africa's hungry. By John Tbavls The young Indians presented the pope with handmade gifts "symbolic ol life.' a spokesman said.

It Won’t Be the Last Temptation (Continued from Page 4) Monsignor Krispinsky Offers Tribute to Jubilarians BOOK REVIEW Neither NK nor MS tried particularly hard to be faithful to that truth. Neither placed himself under any social discipline to assure fidelity, in the light of so many past and often bloody misapprehensions. Here they may have been novices: but by now the Christian community isn't. The truth about Christ is a life and death matter to the ChrlsUan community. Getting that truth wrong, living it falsely. would mean Its dissolution. Both Kazantzakls and Seen- <0<cse seem lo think they portrayed a "religious experience" In their work. They flatter their Inner torments. They make a mockery of the one life tn history that Is of greatest moment to billions of human beings. So II should corneas no surprise that Kazantzakls was excommunicated by the Greek Orthodox church and later denied a public Christian burial, exactly because hJs idiosyncratic Christ is not that of the □Christian community. The vJJast Temptation of Christ was also Judged to fall outside the faith and morals of the Roman Catholic church, and placed on the Index. Kazantzakls and Scorsese fall short of the truth about Christ in a particularly grotesque way. Both seem to think that the central temptation of Christian life Is the temptation of the flesh. It isn't. Flesh is good. In Christ. God "became flesh." This was one crucial difference between the gospels and Greek paganism. Weak as we Christians often are with regard to disorders of the flesh and any confessor will tell Ä ou how boringly banal our frequent falls are — the sins of the spirit are far more deadly, and every bit as common. The fundamental struggle, is not between flesh and spirit, but between love of God and self-love. The Black Catholic Vote (Continued Irorri Page 4) ^cek an abortion by the conventional wisdom of our society today.” Archbishop Marino said there are genocidal dimensions to the issue, but also said abortion demonstrates "an attitude that we live in a throwaway society." "Blacks. Hispanics and the poor get thrown away in disproportionate numbers in this society.” he said, "it's easier to help a girl with an abortion than help her through an unplanned pregnancy." "Black Catholic leaders also raid many blacks have been reluctant to get Involved in national pro-life activities, like the annua] March for Life, because they see It as exclusive — a white, middle-class women's concern. But Nellie Gray, head of the annual march, said the invitation to participate is "made of all pro-life Americans. We’re against the killing of Innocent children, no matter who they are. 1 find it highly offensive ^hat anyone dare suggest we segregate." Jacqueline Wilson, executive director of the Office of Black Catholics for the Archdiocese of Washington, said many blacks prefer to keep the abortion Issue a private matter within the family. But she said from her years as a catechist she believes people need to talk about it openly and the church needs to educate its people more thoroughly about sex education and morality. ji "Too many people do not YTally understand what the church teaches about abortion. Ihe dignity of every human being and the right to life." she said. When God sent his Light into the world and humans "received Him not." His agony sprang from their widespread rejection of His love and truth, not from the good and the sweet allure that He had Joyfully placed 1n human flesh In the most affecting 30 minutes of the film (the "temptation"). Scorsese attributes the love of man and woman in marriage, and the building of a family, to the devil. And more than once, he gets off the greatest sexist Une of all time: There Is only one woman in the world, with many different faces. The very first commandment given to Moses says emphatically; "1 am the Lord your God: you shall not put other gods before Me." Puttings false Christ in the place of (he true Christ violates this commandment. But Scorsese's sin isn't so much Idol-worship: he prob ably means well. HJs sin Is self- love and willful disdain for the faith of others. SUU. artists do the best they can. It's hard for them to distinguish the distortions of their own state of soul from realities still beyond their reach. And some persons, entranced by this film about a false Christ, may be promoted to set off in search of the true Christ. The Jewish and Christian God has a habit of using even human fallings to bring us beyond ourselves, Into the presence of • the God Who surprises us in His closeness to the ordinary things He made. Thus wc ourselves, in our wretched generation, may be the ones being tempted by the true Christ, who hovers at the edge of this film by his absence. If so. this is only the most recent temptation of Christ who will go on tempting us down the ages, unUi He comes again. Alpha and Omega. Dolores Bernadette Grier, a vice chancellor for the New York Archdiocese and founder of a local group called Black Catholics Against Abortion, said abortion is a racist social policy. "Yesterday they snatched the babies from our arms and threw them into slavery. Today they cut them out of the womb and throw them in the garbage." she said. "(Abortion) Is black genocide provided free of charge by a racist society.” Clarence Pollard, a law student at Indiana University, Bloomington. Ind., and law clerk at the U.S. Civil Rights Commission In Washington, said blacks often don't sec abortion's "connection to civil rights" Making it clear he was speaking for himself and not the commission. Pollard also said that what also puts blacks off from pro-life activities 1s that they consider many of the movement's leaders — such as Sen. Jesse Helms. R-N.C. — "ex-segrcgationlsts- ” Helms often has been amain speaker at the March for Life, held each January to observe the anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion. In the 1960s, he made his name with voters as a Raleigh. N.C.. television and radio commentator who strongly opposed local, stale and federal civil rights legislation. Pollard, a member of Black Americans for Life, said that "a lot of blacks are so angry they refuse on principle to become involved and continue to be victimized. ..

I videli, že niektorí Jeho učeníci Jedia chlieb poškvrnenými, to Jest neumytými rukami, lebo farizeji a Židia vôbec nejedávajú bez častého umývania rúk. v čom sa pridŕžajú podania predkov. Keď sa vrátia z trhu, nejedia, kým sa nevykúpu. A Je ešte mnoho iných vr č í, ktoré prijali a mail zachovávať, ako: umývanie člaš, däbAnnv. medenic a postelí. I pýtali sa farizeji a zákonníci Ježiša: "Prečo si tvoji učeníci nepočínajú podľa podania predkov, ale icdía chlieb poškvrnenými rukami?" On im však odpovedal: "Dobre o vás. pokrytcoch, prorokoval prorok Izaiáš, ako Je napísané: Tento ľud ma ctí ten árcjími perami, ale jeho srdce ďaleko je odo mfla.

MODLITBY VERIACICH Bratia a sestry, modlime sa s'dôverou k nášmu nebeskému Otcovi, ktorý nás ochraňuje ustavičnou láskou, aby sme aj my prejavovali lásku k blížnemu. * Za kňazské povolania: — aby Duch Svätý oduševnil mladých a pripravil horlivých robotníkov do duchovnej žatvy, prosme Pána. • Za celé ľudstvo: — aby ťlo v svornosti, povzbudené príkladnou láskou Kristových vyznávačov, prosme Pána. • Za chorých a hladujúcich: — aby kresťanskou láskou doplnená spravodlivosť zmiernila bolesť a odstránila hlad, prosme Pána. • Za nás všetkých: — aby sme sa neuspokojili pokrytec kým zdaním kresťanského života, ale aby sme sa snažili o vnú tornú čistotu a činorodú lásku, prosme Pána. Všemohúci a večný Bože, ty si potecha zarmútených a posila trpiacich; vyslyš naše prosby, keď voláme k tebe vo svojich starostiach s udeľ nám svoju milosrdnú pomoc. Skrze Krista, náähô Pára SKUTKY A NIT SLOVÁ "Tento ľud len svojimi perami ma ctí“ (Mt 7, 7> Jedno rimné ráno, asi o 3. hodine, telefón zvonil na fare. Syn istej rodiny volal kňaza, lebo mu zomieral otec. Kňaz vzal PrevblBbcul sviatosť Oltárnu a sv. olejky a dal sa peši na cestu. Za rohom ktosi k nemu priskočil, revolverom mu tlačil do Máme len Jedného Prostredníka, podľa slov Apoštola: "Jeden jetotiž Boh, jeden Je Sprostredkovateľ medzi Bohom a ľuďmi, Človek Je&S Kristus, ktorý dal seba ako výkupnú žertvu za všetkých." (1 Tím 2:5-61 Materské poslanie Márie voči ľuďom však toto jediné prostredníctvo Kristovo nijako nezatie- fiuje, ani nezmenšuje, lež dáva najavo jeho účinnosť. Lebo akýkoľvek spasiteľný vplyv Panny Márie na ľudí nespočíva v dajakej nutnosti, ale má svoj pôvod v Božej blahosklonnosti a svoj prameň v prekypujúcej hojnosti Kristových zásluh: zakladá sa na jeho sprostredkovaní, od neho vonkoncom závisí a z nebo čerpá všetku svoju účinnosť, a pritom vôbec neprekáža bezprostrednému spojeniu veriacich s Kristom, ba ho napomáha. Panna Mária od večností spolu s vtelením Slova Božieho predurčená za Matku Božiu, riadením Božej- Prozreteľnosti bola na tejto zemi rodnou matkou božského Vykupiteľa, jeho neporovnateľne veľkodušnou spoluúčastničkou a poníženou služobnicou Pánovou. Počnúc, porodiac a živiac Krists, prinesúc ho do chrámu Otcovi, trpiac spolu so svojím umierajúcim Synom na kríži .spolupracovala na diele Spasiteľa celkom mimoriadnym spôsobom, a to poslušnosťou, vierou, a vrúcnou láskou, aby tak obnovila nadprirodzený život duší. Práve preto je našou matkou v poriadku milosti. A toto materstvo Márie v poriadku milosti trvá neprestajne odvtedy, čo dala pri zvestovaní svoj verný súhlas, v ktorom neochvejne zotrvala pod krížom, až kým sa nezavŕši večná spása všetkých vyvolených. Lebo ani po svojom nanebovzatí nepře stala v tomto spasiteľnom poslaní, ale svojím mnohonásobným orodovaním aj naďalej nám získává dar večného spasenia. S materinskou láskoti sa stará o bratov svojho Syna, čo ešte pu tujú a nachádzajú sa v rozličných nebezpečenstvách a úzkostiach, dokiaľ sa nedost'mú do blaženej vlasti. Preto sa Panna Mária uctieva v Cirkvi ako Orodovnica, Ochrankyňa, Pomocní- oa a Prostrednlca To sa však chápe takým spôsobom, že nič sa ani neuberá, ani nepridáva hodnosti a účinnosti Krista, jediného Sprostredkovateľa. Isteže nikdy nijaké stvorenie nemožno prirovnať k vtelenému Slovu a Vykupiteľovi. Lenže ako majú duchovní i veriaci ľud rozličným spôsobom účasť na kňazstve Kristovom a ako sa jediná dobrota Božia rozmanité, ale skutočne šíri v stvoreniach, tak aj Jediné prostredníctvo Vykupiteľovo nevylučuje, ale skôr vyvoláva, mnohorakú súčinnosť stvorení prameniacu z Jediného zdroja. A toto podriadené poslanie Márie Cirkev neváha vyznávať, neprestajne ho skusuje a odporúča ho láske veriacich, aby sa vďaka tejto materinskej pomoci užšie spojili s (Jediným) Spro- . stredkovateľom a Spasiteľom. Blahoslavená Panna, vzhľadom na dar a hodnosť Božieho materstva. Čo ju spája so Synom Vykupiteľom, a pre svoje neobyčejné milosti a úlohy. Je veľmi úzko spojená aj s Cirkvou. Bohorodička Je predobrazom Cirkvi, ako to učl! už svätý Ambróz, a to v poriadku viery, lásky a dokonalej jednoty s Kristom. Lebo v tajomstve Cirkvi, ktorá sa tiež právom nazýva matkou a pannou, blahoslavená Panna Mária predchádza ako vynikajúci a jedinečný vzor panny a matky. Veď pre svoju vieru a poslušnosť, zatienená Duchom Svätým, porodila na zemi. b«E Rtyku s mužom, samého Syna Otcovho, sťa nová Eva, ktorá úprimne uverila bez akéhokoľvek váhania Božiemu poslovi, a nie dávnemu hadovi A priniesla na svet Syna, ktorého Boh určil za prvorodeného medzi mnohými bratmi (Rím 8:9), totiž medzi veriacimi, na ktorých zrode a výchove Mária spolupracuje s materinskou láskou. Nuž aj Cirkev, ktorá rozjíma o jel tajomnej svátostí, nasleduje jej lásku a verne plní vôľu Otcovu, stáva sa matkou tým, že verne plní vôľu Otcovu, stáva sa matkou tým. že verne prijíma slovo Sohle; lebo kázaním a krstom rodí pn? nový a nesmrteľný život dletky počaté z Ducha Svätého a splodené z Boha. A je aj pannou, čo zachováva neporušenú a čistú vernosť svojmu Ženíchovi; a nasledujúc Matku svojho Pána, mocou Ducha Svätého zotrváva v panensky neporušenej viere, pevnej nádeji a úprim- nej láske. Zatiaľ čo v Preblahoslavenej Panne Cirkev už dosiahla dokonalosť, ktorá je bez poškvrny a bez vrásky (pórov. Ef. 5:27), vetriaci sa ešte usilujú vzrastať vo svätosti, bojujúc proti hriechu. A preto upierajú svoje oči k Márii, ktorá žiari celej vospol hosti vyvolených ako vzor čnosti. Cirkev na ňu mysli s láskou a rozjíma o nej vo svetle Slova, ktoré sa stalo človekom. S posvätnou úctou preniká stále hlbšie do preveľkého tajomstva Vtelenia a stáva sa čím ďalej tým podobnejšou svojmu ženíchovi. Lebo Mária, úzko spätá s dejinami spasenia, určitým spôsobom zjednocuje a odzrkadľuje v sebe základné pravdy viery s preto keď sa o nej káže a keď sa uctieva, privádza veriacich k svojmu Synovi a k Jeho obete, ako aj k láske k Otcovi. No í Cirkev, tým že hľadá slávu Kristovu, stáva sa podobnejšou vsiešenému predobrazu, neprestajne rastúc vo viere, nádeji a láske a hľadajúc i plniac vo všetkom vôľu Božiu. Z toho dôvodu Cirkev 1 pri svojej apoštolskej činnosti právem hľadí na tú, čo porodila Krista, ktorý sa počal 2 Ducha Svätého a narodil sa z Panny preto, aby sa skrze Cirkev narodil a rástol aj v srdciach veriacich. Táto Panna bola vo svojom živote vzorom tej materskej lásky, ktorou sa majú dať preniknúť všetci, čo spolupracujú s Cirkvou na Jej apoštolskom poslaní pri prepo- chrbáte a žiadal od neho peniaze. Kňaz odhalil svoj golier a hovorí mu: "Tu vo vrecku mám nejaké peniac» vezmite si ich." Keď zlodej zbadal, že je to kňaz, ospravedlňoval sa, že on nevedel. že Je on kňaz. Kňaz mu mto ponúkol cigaretu. Zlodej sa mu ale poďakoval, že on sa vraj zriekol fajčenia, lebo je sv. čas pôstu. Kňaz mu napokon dokladá: "Teda vy si robíte svoje vlastné náboženstvo. Veď viete, že Boh žiada skutky a nie prázdne slová, žiada naše skutky vždy, aj keď neni pôstna doba." Slovo Božie tejto nedele Sad* to isté: Skutky a nie len slová. Buďme si istí, že aj my neoslavujeme Pána lenperami. I. Skutky a nie len slová! Nesmieme sa teda mýliť! Nikto nebude spasený preto, že načúva krásne kázne, že denne opakoval nejaké pekné modlitby, žé bol nr. náboženských'-ô^monlach, ktoré lahodili Jeho ušiam. Toto všetko môže byt1 dobré, ale ak človek nekoná vôľu Božiu, mu to všetko nepomôže, a nikto sa nemôže vyhovárať, že nevie, čo si Pán Boh od nebo žiada. Cirkevní otcovia 2. vatikánskeho snemu vo svojej konštitúcií o Božom zjavení (11) jasne hovoria: “Bohom zjavene pravdy, vo Sv, písme písomne vyjadrené a zachované, boli napísané z vnuknutia Ducha Svätého ... A teda každé Písmo, vnuknuté od Boha, je užitočné na poučovanie, napredovanie a vychovávanie vo'spravodlivosti, aby sa človek stal Boží, dokonalým 8 schopným konať všetko dobré.” (2 Tím 3, 16-17) V prvom čítaní tejto sv. omše (Dt 4, 1-2: 6-8) Pán neba l wm*, prostredníctvom Mojžiša Izraelitom oznámil, že je ochotný vypočuť ich prosby pod podmienkou, že budú nielen počúvať, čo si praje, ale že to budú aj skutočne plniť. Mojžiš Ich varuje: "Aby k slovám, ktoré im hovorí, nič nepridávali a ani z nich nič neodňali. Aby zachovávali prikázania Pána, Boha svojho. Aby Ich zachovali a plnili nadobro, lebo to bude Ich múdrosť. Zachovávanie Božích prikázaní byde svedectvo Ich viery pred všetkými národami." žiaľ. Izraeliti v tomto ohľade zlýhali nielen v časoch Mojžišových. ale aj v časoch Kristových, ako nám o tom hovorí dnešné sv. evanjelium. (MJc 7, l-8a; 14-15; 21-23) V tých časoch farizeji ako vedúci ľudu, zachádzali do rôznych výstredností. Prísne trvaĽ na zachovávaní rôznych druhoradých, ritualistlc- kých predpisov a liturgií, kým vôľu Božiu obchádzali, kde sa Im to len hodilo. Pán Ježiš, ako nám hovorí dnešné sv. evanjelium, o Ich predpisy nedbal. Farizejov to dráždilo, lebo seba samých pokladali za •'spravodivých’’ a inými pohŕdali. Preto aj Pána napadli otázkou: "Pročo r.1 t\’ojí učeníci nepočínajú podľa podania predkov a jedla chlieb neumytými rukami?” Pán Ježiš ich jednoducho zavrátil slovami- "Dobre o vás pokrytcoch, predpovedal IzateS, keď povedal: tento ľud len svojimi perami ma ctí, ale Ich srdce Je ďaleko odo mňa." V tomto ohľade bol Pán ležíš neúprosný! Veď už predtým bol vyhlásil, že: “neprišiel zrušiť Zákon alebo prorokov. Nie zrušiť som ich neprišiel, ale vyplniť.” (Mt 5, 17) Veď aj zákon umývať si ruky pred Jedením bol dobrý. Držal národ v čistote a zdravý. Pán Ježiš ale trval- na tom, aby tento zovňajší obrad každému pripomínal, aby sa staral o svoju duševnú čistotu v očiach Božích. Lebo, darmo by sa niekto umýval od rána do večera, ak by Jeho srdce ostalo znečistené hriechom, nič mu to neosoží. Preto Pán Ježiš horlil, aby ľud neoslavoval Jeho Otca len perami, ale srdcom a v pravde, každým skutkom a celým životom 2. Buďme si istí, he e| my neoslavujeme Pána len svojimi peraijú. Žiaľ, že ej v našich časoch sa nájdu, čo by radí videli Desatoro Božích Prikázaní rilkvidnvé, alebo obchádzané, ako neúčinné a bezvýznamné. Pri čom svet viazne v bahne nerestí, vrážd a neistoty A sú aj niektorí, čo sa uspokojujú rôznymi liturgickými obradmi, možno aj pri tom pristúpia ku sv. prijímaniu, ale ich srdete a ich praktický život sú ďaleko od toho, čo veria a čo perami vyznftvalú. Týmto všetkým treba aj v Novom zákone pripomenúť, že Ježiš neprišiel zrušiť Zákon, ale ho doplniť tak, že ho nenapísal na kamenné tabule, ako to bolo v starom Zákone, ale ich napísal na naše pokrstené srdcia, v ktorých On sám, ako Vzkriesený Pán a Bob prebýva Vlastne, za toto Ježiš trpel, zomrel a vstal z mŕtvych, aby náš celý život posvätil, aby sme dušcu i telom a každým skutkom oslavovali svojho nebeského Otcs, ktorý má na nás plné právo. Veď On si nás stvoril a vykúpil pre sebe. Sv. JaJcub v druhom čítaní tejto sv. omše (Jak 1, 17-18; 21b-22; 27) nás nabáda, aby sme Slova Božie nielen načúvali, ale ho aj verne plnili. Slovo Božie, hovorí: “Pochádza zhora a prichádza od Otca svetiel, ktorý nás splodil Slovom pravdy, aby sme boli akoby prvotinou jeho stvorení.” Preto dokladá svätý Jakub: "Pokorne prijmime vštepené slovo viery, ktoré má moc spasiť naše duše Slovo Božie teda aj uskutočňujeme a nepočúvajme ho len, klamúc seba samých." Svoju úprimnosť v plnení Slova Božieho, potom, máme dokazovať svojou dobročinnosťou: " Keď napomáhame sirotám a vdovám, keď sú v tiesni a že sa chránime bez ooškrrny od toboto pominuteľného sveta.” Keď počujeme toto naliehanie Pána Ježiša, aby sme ho ne- oslavovali len perami, robili by sme veľkú chybu, keby sme si mysleli, že sa to týka kohokoľvek iného, len nie nás. Pán Ježiš tu nalieha na každého ? nás a to bez rozdielu, aby sme vôľu Božiu plnili svojím životom a plnili ju nadovšetko. Lebo Pán Ježiš nás všetkých vážne upozorňuje: "Nie každý, kto ml hovorí: Pane, Pane, vojde do kráľovstva nebeského, ale len ten, kto plní vôľu môjho Otca, ktorý Je na nebesách." (Mt 7, 21) Buďme opatrní, aby sme sa nedopustili om^u farizejov dnešného sv. evanjelia. Nemyslime si, že keď plníme akési zvyklostí svojich otcov, keď sme sl istí, že patríme do Cirkví, ktorú Kristus založil, keď zachovávame toto lebo ono.... že už budeme spasení. Takéto “farizejské náboženstvo” vedie do duševne] letargie, lebo srdce človekove ostáva prázdne, hladné, ktoré hľadá. túži... Preto dnes vidíme toľko rôznych ázijských filozofií, Joga a Budha a prívržencov Son Mcona, lebo kresťánia nepoznajú svoje vlastné náboženstvo a nežijú plným duševným životom, ktoré Im tak štedro Kristus v ňom ponúka. A dáva ho len tým, ktorí ho oslavujú nie perami, ale celým srdcom. Nechcime, aby nás Vzkriesený Spasiteľ dnes pri sv. prijímaní obvinil, že: "Sme ľud, ktorý ho ctí len svojimi perami.” žime dľatoho, čc veríme, aby sme každý deň mohli Pánovi povedať: "že sa naozaj zfliäavíun? v jeho stane.1' (ž 14} Otec Augustín J.

AUGUST 24. 1988 Page 11 Deň národného smútku Na temnú oblohu osud píše krvavou rukou výstražné slová. Za noci Ježiš navštevuje chyže a teší národ, križovaný znova Osirel ľud tan bohabojný v smútku pod rukou 'pomstivou lstivého vraha.

Pomôžeš ľudu svojmu, Jezu Kriste? Nikto to nevie — ale každý verí, deň vykúpenia že je už blizo. V slobode žiť bude národ zas celý — martýrskou smrťou vykúpil ho Tiso. Andrej Hora Básnik načiera do boľavých skutočností doby, aby premietnu! do budúcnosti silnú nádej i vieru v nový slobodný život národa nášho. Najvyššia obeta prinesená prvým prezidentom Slovenskej republiky vytrhla národ z objatia smrtí, aby žiť mohol ďalej a plniť svoje historické poslanie až do plnosti čias. Svojím životom zasväteným Bohu i slovenskému národu, Tiso bol osobnosťou, ktorá v tomto storočí zanechala nezmazateľnú stopu vo vývoji, formovaní a historickej projekcii slovenského národa. Dr. Jozef Tiso • z čistých prameňov kresťanstva a irečitej slovenskosti dvíhal slo- ▼ venský národ do výšin ducha. Jeho náuka, jej ideová a filozofická náplň, jeho osobný prínos do života slovenského národa na poli mravnom, politickom i sociálnom sú bohatým žriedlom, z ktorého budú čerpať múdrosť celé slovenské generácie budúcnosti a pri ktorom sa budú zastavovať myslitelia a budovatelia slovenského života v budúcnosti. Tiso svojou martýrskou smrťou spečatil evoju nesmiernu lásku k Bohu i slovenskému národu, ktorý tak sebavedome, presvedčivo i úspešne formoval počas celého svojho života, svojho verejného účinkovania, ako kňaz cirkvi Kristovej i politik a neskôr ako prvý prezident Slovenskej republiky. Cieľavedome a múdro kládol nerozborné základy života slovenského národa na kresťanskú náuku a mravnosť, na prirodzené právo, vzájomné porozumenie, tolerantnosť a lásku. Počas svojho verejného účinkovania, vždy majúc na zreteli všeobecné dobro celého národa, staval svoju verejnú činnosť a život národa na ’ pevné zásady žitého kresťanstva a nezištnej lásky ako podstatu nášho národného bytia a existencie. Zásady kresťanskej lásky, ako podstatu nášho národného bytia a existencie. Zásady kresťanskej a národnej ideológie stali sa širokou základňou slovenského života nielen počas slovenskej samostatnosti, ale zostávajú a zotrvávajú v národe našom i v jeho dnešnom ťažkom navštívení i pre veky budúce. Len preto je dnes národ náš schopný chrániť si vieru otcov, svoj vlastný život, svoju dušu. To môžeme povedať, že myšlienka slovenskej štátnosti je stotožnená s veľkou osobnosťou prvého prezidenta Slovenskej republiky Dr. Jozefa Tisu, Prostredníctvom jeho veľkej obety je spätá s našim dedičstvom kresťanským i národným, aby bola pevnou základňou ťažkej prítomnosti, A predstavujúc víťaznú nádej i pevnú vieru v slobodnú & samostatnú ' budúcnosť medzi ostatnými národmi sveta. Len pred niekoľkými týždňami slávna naša Bratislava bola svedkom veľkých demonštrácií za náboženskú slobodu a ľudské - práva, po ktorých dnešný režim tak surovo šliape. Demonštrantov musela polícia rozháňať vodnými delami a masové zatvárať tých, čo sa opovážili dovolávať Ba základných ľudských práv a dôstojnosti človeka. Slovenský národ, aj keď dnes musí žiť v okovách, vždy nájde toľko sily, aby pred tvárou celého sveta dokazoval nespravodlivosť, ktorej je obetou a dovolával sa tých práv, ktoré mu ako mravnej osobnosti neodškriepiteľné patria, lebo mu boli dané do vena Bohom. Žiada pred celým svetom základné ľudské práva a rešpektovanie ideálov slobody a samostatnosti, žiada otvorene tie práva slovenského človeka i národu, ktoré surový režim Moskvy a Prahy na Slovensku už štyri storočia potláča v krvi. Za týchto okolností je ozaj veľmi ťažko si vysvetliť a chápať - konanie určitých jednotlivcov narodených zo slovenslmj matky, ktorí sa snažia vedome podminovat slovenskú národnú podstatu, národnú jednotu a vzájomnú súdržnosť, nahovárajúc nás, aby sme zabudli na veľkých slovanských martýrov slobody a samostatnosti Slovenska. Vo svojej arogantnosti idú tak ďaleko, že si sadajú za stôl s našimi zaprisahanými nepriateľmi, strkajúc bezočivo pred náš zrak svojho otrockého ducha. Týmto jednotlivcom, ktorí začínajú strácať mieru pre únosnost určitých akcií, týmto jednotlivcom, ktorí sa považujú za verejne činných a niektorí i za politikov, adresujem slová, ktoré svojho času na adresu verejných činiteľov povedal Dr. Jozef Tieo: "Politik, viac ako ktokoľvek iný, musí byť konzervátorem j (tradičných hodnôt národa a musí byť pohotovým tlmočníkom prirodzeného práva národa v danej situácií. 01 jedno, či druhé by niekomu chýbalo, nie je spôsobilý byť reprezentantom námria, lebo stane sa súčasnými politickými prúdmi metanou figúrou, ktorá nemá zapojenia do živého tela národa, lebo bude muzeálnym strážcom národa, ktorý ďaleko stojí od súčasných ciest, po ktorých prúdi život a na ktorých sa rozhoduje o osude budúcnosti národa."

WASHINGTON — "Vývoj postojov súčasnej spoločnosti voči manželstvu, tehotenstvu a rodinnému životu poukazuje na skutočne "prorockú múdrosť" cirkevného učenia v týchto oblastiach, predovšetkým encykliky Pavla VI. “Humánne Vitae". Toto vyhlásila biskupská komisia o ochrane života v Spojených Štátoch amerických, ktorej predsedom je chicagský arcibiskup kardinál Jozef Bernardin. "Keď roku 1968 bola uve- ' rejnená encyklika "Humanae Vitae” — hovorí sa v spomenutom vyhlásení — V Spojených štátoch bol rodinný život na ú- padku, postupne sa zvyšovali rozvody, útočilo ea na posvätnosť ľudského života a zvyšovali aa potraty. To sa odzrkadľovalo aj v postoji-katolikov voči encykliko. Dnes sa situácia zlepšuje; americkí biskupi sú ochotní pomáhať manželom, a- by si uvedomili pozitívne strán- • ky učenia encykliky Pavla Vt JAPONSKO —Známa japonská filmová herečka Tukioka Yumeji sa dala pokrstiť v máji tohto roku v tokijskej farnosti Seijo. Spolu s ňou bola pokrstená aj jej matka, sestra a neter. Fo krste povedala novinárom, že na jej obrátenie veľmi vplýval film “Zvony v Nagasaki", v ktorom ona sama interpretovala život manželky dr. Nagaia Takaéiho. Tento film, ako je známe, predstavoval následky atomíckého vyžarovania. — Osobitná komisia japonskej biskupskej konferencie sa zaoberala obnovou systému kňazskej formácie v tokijskom veľkom seminári, ktorý roku 1929 založila Parížska spoločnosť pre zahraničné misie. Do roku 1970 bol pod vedením jezuitov, teraz bo spravuje biskupská konferencia, ale seminaristi aj naďalej študujú na katolíckej univerzite Sofia.

Pa r íž-— Vo Francúzskom, hlavnom meste sa už po druhý raz konal Národný kongres liturgických spevokolov, na ktorom sa zúčastnila vyše 10 tisíc spevákov. Na záverečnom stretnutí v športovom paláci Bercy vytvorili mohutný spevácky zbor, ktorý účinkoval počas sv. omšu v prítomnosti kardinála Lustigera a 130 biskupov a kňazov. Kardinál Lustiger sa im poďakoval za ich neoceniteľnú službu prí bohoslužbe. Tohto roku na kongres prišiel aj zbor drážďanských speváčikov z Nemeckej demokratickej republiky. Ta l ia nsk o — "Centrum pápeža Lírefaniho" v Santa Giu- atina Beliunense pri príležitosti desiateho výročia smrti pápeža Jána Pavla I. začala vydávať ''Opera omnia" tohto obľúbeného pápeža, ktorého pontifikát trval len 33 dní. V týchto dňoch vyšli prvé trí zväzky. Prvý zväzok obsahuje dielo “Katechetika v odrobinkách", “Pôvod ľudskej duše podľa Antona Rosminiho” a "RlustrisSi- mi”.

Je to skutočný bestseller. “Opera omnia" bude mať 9 zväzkov, ktoré vyjdú vo vydavateľstve mesačníka "Messaggero” v Pádové. KÓREA — Kórejskí biskupi vydali pastiersky list, v ktorom prísne odsudzujú potraty v ich krajine. Medziiným píšu, že Kó- rejčania nemajú dôvod obávať sa vojny, lebo vojnové obete nikdy nedosiahnu také závratné čísla, ako dosahujú nateraz obete potratov — vyše dva milióny ročne. HONG KONG — V Hong Kongu sa nedávno konalo Medzinárodné sympózium na tému "Konfucianizmua a kresťanstvo v modernom svete". Sympózium zorganizovalo “Ü- stredie kresťanských štúdii o čínskom náboženstve a o čin- rod na tribúnu na svojich ramenách. A Dr. Milan Hodža už potom vytahoval ruku k nemu a vítal ho: "Vaše miesto je tu medzí nami!” Voľaktorý "úradný" rečník nemohol dokončiť reč. A Hlinka dal rukou pokyn: "Vypočujte ho, lebo i on je Slovák!” A rečník dokonči! svoju reč. Keď začal rečniť A Hlinka, zástupy volali: Nepočujeme, rozhlasovače nefungujú! Hlinka odpovedal: Nech nefungujú, ale ja fungujem. No, napravili potom rozhlasové zariadenie. "Videl som veľkosť Turčianskeho Sv. Martina (30. októbra 191g), veľkosť Liptovského Sv. Mikuláša (1. mája 1918), ale toľkého ohňa ako tu (15. augusta 1933) som ešte nevidel", zapal reč A. Hlinka. "Drahý národe, korím sa ti a som tvoj, ale mi sľúb, že vypočuješ aj vysokú vládu! Nech nám povie, čo nám doniesla! My sme sa tu do Nitry prišli pokloniť pamiatke pribinovskej, pamiatke našej, kresťanskej a národnej!" Msgr. Andrejovi Hlinkoví nechceli dať na oslave vážne slovo a potom on dával slovo. A rečnil aj Rev. Martin Rázus. Potom prišlo a nasledovalo prenasledovanie. Pražský ministerský predseda Malypctr dal vylepiť na Slovensku plagáty, že sa na Slovensko dopláca. To Slovákov nazlostilo! Andrej Hlinka a Martin Rázus pokračovali spolu. Roku 1935 zaznelo vo voľbách; Hlinka—Rázus, ako jeden, preto voľme číslo sedem! T. akej kultúre". Úvodnú prednášku mal rektor Fujen univerzity v Taipei Mons.

NEMECKO — Ruldský arcibiskup Johannes Dyha v rozhovore uverejnenom v denníku "Die Welt" prísne odsudzuje potraty, ospravedlňované sociálnou situáciou matky. Prirovnáva ich eugenedekej praží nacistického režimu. Statisíce potratov, ktoré aa prevádzajú v Spolkovej republike Nemecko, "sú pohoršením, s ktorým aa Cirkev nikdy nezmieri Právo na život aa dostalo do nemeckej ústavy ako reakcia na nacistickú prax. Nemci sa musia pýtať, či nie sú národom, ktorý najviac na svete nenávidí deti a život". SLOVENSKO —17. júla bolo sté výročie narodenia biskupa Pavla Gojdiča. Pri tejto príležitosti 16. júla o 10. hodine bola koneelebrovaná slávnostná liturgia v katedrálnom chráme gréckokatolíkov v Prešove.

O. Hirka v kázni zrekapituloval život biskupa Gojdiča, jeho u- väzuenie a smrť. Na biskupskom tróne boli vyznačené insignie biskupa Gojdiča a vedľa nich visela tŕňová koruna a roky narodenia a smrti. Na slávnosť sa zišlo pomerne veľa kňazov a veriacich. Pred liturgiou sa veriaci v chráme modlili bolestný ruženec. Rozjímania boli jednotlivé epizódy zo života biskupa Gojdiča. O. Hirka v kázni osobitne zdôraznil lásku biskupa Gojdiča k veriacim, ku kňazom a k nepriateľom. Spomenul aj jeho výrok: “Milujte ľudi takých, akí sú, aj s ich chybami. Ak by sme chceli milovať len ľudi, ktorí nemajú chyby, nemohli by sme milovať nikoho." Keď sa ho vo väzení pýtali, kto mu ublížil, odpovedal, že on nemá nepriateľov a že rád trpí. Aj keď biskup Gojdič nebol štátom rehabilitovaný, každý vie a cíti, že bol odsúdený nespravodlivo. Heslom biskupa Gojdiča bolo: Boh je Láska, milujme ho! Poučená — Nebojíte sa cestovať lietadlom? — Prvý raz som sa bála. — A druhý raz? — Druhý raz som už nelietala. Otec Ján Moravský, S. J. predstavený [pageend11]Page 12 JEDNOTA. WEDNESDAY.
