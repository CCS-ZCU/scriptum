BULLETIN English Supplement to “Zprávy SVU’’ Vol. VI, No. 4____________________October, 1985 SVU Activities PREPARATIONS FOR THE THIRTEENTH WORLD CONGRESS September 18-21, 1986 Northeastern University, CIHED Boston, Massachusetts The local committee (Dolansky-Leidel-Surka- Vogel) continues to meet regularly, clarifying all partial tasks and details. As the Congress will take place in September, they will need to finish much of the preparatory work before summer vacation. That concerns especially all the components of the program and the printing of Abstracts. Cooperation of all participants will be needed for prompt action. By a mistake, the last Bulletin did not correctly announce that Anton Novačky, SVU Vice-President (Sciences), is in charge of the academic program. His invitations to participate will be sent out soon. Igor Nabelek, Executive Vice-President, is working on another project for the Society, the possibility of establishing a research institute. He will tell the membership more about it when the plans are closer to realization. * + PREPARATION OF THE NEW DIRECTORY OF THE MEMBERS OF SVU Preparations are under way for the new 6th Edition of the Biographical Directory of the Members of the Society. We urge all Members to fill out the enclosed Questionnaire without delay and send it immediately to the Directory Editor, Mrs. Eva Rechcigl, 1703 Mark Lane, Rockville, MD 20852, USA. In addition to the vital data, we would like to include scientific, artistic and cultural interests of our members, as well as basic information about their work,including the titles of their publications works of art, etc. cont. p. 2 A NON-PROFIT CULTURAL ORGANIZATION [pageend1]We encourage you to enclose your Curriculum vitae as well as references to other biographical sources that contain your biographical data.

Milos Kucera Secretary General ★ ★ ★ THE THUN CONFERENCE A report on the SVU Conference, “The Threatened Heritage of Central Europe,” which took place, on August 16-18, 1985, in Thun, Switzerland, was sent by Karel Hruby, the organizer of the meeting, President of the Swiss Chapter and editor of Proměny (Metamorphoses). He expressed appreciation that the members of the Executive Board and others from the United States participated in the official program and informal debates. In the opening speech of the General Assembly, SVU President Jiri Nehnevajsa explained the ramifications of the Society’s current activities and outlined plans for the future. It was also possible to discuss the different conditions under which SVU chapters in England, West Germany, Austria and Switzerland have to function. It seems that there is public interest in SVU, and the membership is growing, but there are some problems, especially financial ones. Milos Kucera, Secretary General, announced the nominations for honorary membership of Professors Jan Milic Lochman (University of Basel) and Mikulas Lobkowicz (Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich), Cardinal J. Tomko and the film director Milos Forman. Olga Komersova, Secretary of the Swiss Chapter, was nominated as a founding member. All nominations were unanimously approved by the assembly. The statement about the Budapest Cultural Forum, reprinted elsewhere, was also discussed. Bulletin, edited by Zdenka E. Fischmann, Box 134, Corona, CA 91718 Date of issue: October, 1985, Vol. VI, No. 4, issued four times a year. Published by: Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences, Inc. Office of Publication: R. Bunza, 75-70 199th Street, Flushing, NY 11366 Phone (212) 479-0870 2 [pageend2]More than 150 persons from fourteen countries attended and participated in the academic program. Of great importance was the fact that several lecturers were exiles from countries other than Czechoslovakia: the historian P. Gosztony living in Bern and the sociologist A. Reszler living in Geneva are Hungarians; B. Cywinski living in Fribourg is a Polish sociologist. SVU members Ivan Svitak (Chico, California), Jiri Nehnevajsa (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), Ladislav Matějka (Ann Arbor, Michigan), Antonin Mestan (Freiburg, West Germany), Karel Hruby (Basel), Lubomir Durovic (Lund, Sweden) and Jaroslav Krejci (Lancaster, Great Britain) exemplified the Society’s geographical diffusion. Jan Vladislav then represented Paris, France. The exact program of the conference was printed in the last Bulletin. It seems that ail the presented papers had something in common, notwithstanding their particular topics: that the Central European countries, finding themselves in the same situation vis-a-vis the two superpowers, are re-evaluating past nationalistic and political conflicts that kept them apart before WWII. However, the search for some superstructure that would respect the diversity and would be strong enough to resist any totalitarian imposed “normalization,” must not be based on nostalgic memories but needs to develop some concrete goals and means how to achieve them. The Swiss chapter, whose members are spread all over Switzerland, used the opportunity to have their meeting and elections. Their programing for the past year has been varied and amply attended, also by the general public. Lectures, concerts, festivals of Czech films, symposia on Czech literature and similar events have been their successful cultural contributions to their new home country. ★ ★ ★ SVU BULLETIN Publication of an English newsletter had been considered an important goal since the beginnings of the Society. It was tried out once or twice but did not get beyond the initial issue. For this reason Jan Triska, SVU President 1978-80, and the current editor decided to start the Bulletin on a trial basis as an English Supplement to Zprávy SVU and make it independent later, if it survived the birthpains. In that form, the Bulletin has been mailed for six years. At the last meeting of the SVU Executive Board the decision was made to start mailing the SVU Bulletin independently to SVU members in all English speaking areas, and to continue mailing Zprávy SVU to all members wherever they live, for that has been the main means of communication of the Society for over the past quarter century. Those members in the nonEnglish areas who do read English will have to notify Mrs. Ružena Bunza (75-70 199th Street, Flushing, NY 11366), to be added to the Bulletin mailing list. ★ ★ ★ 3 [pageend3]Společnost pro vědy a’umění Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences A NON-PROFIT CULTURAL ORGANIZATION • CONTRIBUTIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE The Executive Board of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences, convened in Washington D.C. on October 5, 1985, Approved the following statement foi presentation to the delegations attending the Cultural Forum in Budapest, October 15 - November 15, 198-5: Human institutions are imperfect and fallible. No societal practice has thus far provided definite answers to the problems of human existence. Yet - notwithstanding the variety of proposed solutions - it is freedom that has to be recognized as the essential and indispensable prerequisite for achieving excellence while keeping faith with one's conscience. Admittedly, great artistic, scholarly and scientific works may occasionally spring from soils in which the brittle flowers of freedom may not be allowed to bloom. However, they are often suppressed in a dictatorship where they originated, and become part of the evolving civilization only because they were made public in countries where freedom prevails. Yet, just as the multiple needs, desires, and interests of people cannot be recognized and served unless freely articulated within the body politic, so is the genuine expression of creativity dependent on unfettered access to the totality of our cultural heritage. If freedom of scholarly pursuit and creativity were impeded and state censorship were to be inflicted on the entire world, the evolution of civilization would stop and mankind would scientifically and culturally stagnate or decline. 4 [pageend4]Freedom is the very foundation of peaceful relations among interdependent societies, in which mutual understanding and help is needed by individuals, families, and nations. The Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences, whose worldwide membership includes artists, writers, scholars, journalists, and scientists with roots in Czechoslovakia, and those with Central European and Czechoslovak expertise, appeals to the Governments, signatories of the Final Act of Helsinki: - to develop and implement policies and programs protecting those whose views may not agree with official cultural policies of their governments; - to strive toward the removal of all barriers to the pursuit of artistic creativity and of scientific research, including those limiting public display or publication of resulting works; - to insist that persecution and discrimination against artists and scientists on the basis of their non-conformity to existing ideological tenets be stopped; - to allow the broadest development of the limitless possibilities and talents of all people so that each human being can find opportunity for self-fulfillment and satisfy his yearning for respect and human dignity. On behalf of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences: Miloš K. Kučera Secretary General Jiří” Nehnevá j sa President 5 [pageend5]KOSMAS. JOURNAL OF CZECHOSLOVAK AND CENTRAL EUROPEAN STUDIES Volume 3, No. 1 and the double issue Vol. 3, No. 2 and Vol. 4, No. 1 As the editor’s letter to subscribers, reprinted in the last Bulletin, explained, the publishing of Kosmas has been delayed for various technical difficulties, but, by the next year’s volume, the journal should be “caught up.” As the editor promised, two issues were dispatched this month. Vol. 3, No. 1 of Kosmas, intended for summer 1984, has some materials relating to the cultural events of that year. It is introduced by Jaroslav Seifert’s poem “The Weight of the Earth,” in Vera Borkovec’s apt translation, to remind us of the 1984 Nobel Prize for literature awarded to the poet living in Prague. “Who Is the Good Soldier Svejk (A few marginal remarks to the literary interpretation of Svejk’s character)” by Hana Svobodova, University of Amsterdam, relates to the 100th anniversary of the birth of Jaroslav Hasek, Svejk’s creator. She discusses the many contradictory attempts to categorize Svejk that have seen him as a popular fool, a clown, a narrator of “pub stories,” a mocking representative of black humor, a surrealist storyteller of the absurd, the Czech Sancho Panza, the plebeian anti-hero, the naive “little man” and so on. Dr. Svoboda in this essay amply proves what a complex literary criticism Hasek’s seemingly simple protagonist has provoked over the years. A group of articles then belongs to the commemoration of the end of WWII. The editor of Kosmas, Zdenek L. Suda, University of Pittsburgh, introduces them in his “Forty Years After: Neither War nor Peace.” He sees the Yalta Conference agreement as “another postponement of the Soviet Thermidor, another generous lease on life to an already outmoded system... an opportunity to replicate an appallingly costly social experiment that already had failed in Russia, at the expense of one hundred million hapless individuals in Central and Eastern Europe.” The status quo of a permanent Cold War does not allow for the innovations - such as those of Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968 and those in Poland since 1980 - which have tried to modify the stagnating Soviet traditional system. It also leads to the anomalous situation that “geography has become destiny,” because the degree of a person’s freedom fatally depends on the accident where one was born. Mary Hrabik-Samal, a specialist in East European political systems, and Zdenka Brodská, philosopher and translator, develop the topic of “The Yalta Myth and Its Consequences.” One main point they stress is that “nobody recalls any more that free elections in Eastern Europe had been one of the clauses of the Yalta agreement.” Forgetting this point, the myth that Europe had been permanently divided through the Iron Curtain, with the West’s explicit consent, has been perpetuated. However, “the nations of Central and Eastern Europe continue to press for desovietization,” and such attempts have been forcefully repressed by the Soviets. So far the West has not asked, nor pressed for any revisions that would adhere “more closely to the Yalta agreement on free elections.” On pp. 35-39 pertinent “Tripartite Agreements of the Yalta Conference. Communique Issued at the End of the Conference” are reprinted in full. Section V, “Declaration on Liberated Europe,” states the intent very clearly. 6 [pageend6]“The Liberation of Prague: An American Blunder?” by Radomir V. Luza, Tulane University, is a documentary essay delving into the controversies among the allied military leaders in the early days of May 1945. It seems that Sir Winston Churchill and the U.S. Department of State understood the importance of having Prague liberated by the Americans while General Eisenhower and General Marshall hesitated to do so, and the American Third Army did not proceed beyond the non-existent, imaginary Carlsbad-Pilsen-Budejovice line. Of special interest are the confidential memos and other reprinted correspondence. The writers are Anthony Eden, General Marshall, General Eisenhower, President Truman, Minister Hubert Ripka, General Bosy, and a few more. Jan F. Triska, Stanford University and past SVU President, writes on “Dominant Powers and Their Dependencies.” It is a preliminary report on his research findings, bringing a theoretical approach to the problems of the coexistence of the superpowers and the countries in their sphere of influence. In concrete terms, he compares the Soviet-East European relations with those the United States has with some Latin American countries. He tables the factors of the dominant powers’ influence and the regional differences and similarities in Eastern Europe and Latin America. He also describes some strategies of the dominant and the dependent areas. The next essays refer to various aspects of the “old country.” Jaroslav Nemec, retired librarian of the National Library of Medicine, SVU first Secretary General and later SVU President, goes back into the 18th century in his article “The First Austrian Learned Society (Societas Eruditorum Incognitorum in Terris Austriacis).” Its founder was Joseph Baron Petrash (b. 1714 in Slovenia, d. 1772 in Moravia) who studied with the Jesuits in Trnava, Slovakia; in Olomouc, Moravia, and at the University of Louvain in Belgium, earning several degrees in different disciplines. After a military career and somě extensive traveling he finally settled in Olomouc where his house (still existing) became a cultural center of the city. Petrash studied mathematics, philosophy, law, classical languages and arts, and joined several learned societies in Italy where he published a volume of essays in 1742, under the pen-name Petrus Cinerius. In 1746 he founded a learned society in Olomouc, whose members mostly lived elsewhere and kept in touch through monthly “newsletters” or visits. There was criticism and strong opposition to the society which lasted only some six years. Reading this article, one cannot but think that SVU, whose founder Dr. Nemec was with a group of Czechoslovak intellectuals in all parts of the West, has done better than the first,learned society on the territory of Austria. The principles of free expression and of free research, however, form a link. Jaroslav Opat, a historian living in Czechoslovakia, explores in depth “the Czech question” as it was defined in the late 188O’s in various Czech dailies and periodicals. His essay, published in Kosmas without his knowledge, carries the title “Schauer’s ‘Our Two Questions’ and T. G. Masaryk.” Hubert Gordon Schauer (d. 1892 at the age of 30),born of a Czech mother, was a journalist who came to Prague from Vienna on Masaryk’s recommendation. His article appeared in the first issue (December 20, 1886) of the new periodical Cas, whose editor and publisher was Jan Herben. In it he posed the two provocative questions which were: 7 [pageend7]What is the task of our nation? and What *is the nature of our national existence? The article was printed under the writer’s initials - and many readers somehow jumped to the conclusion that the author was Thomas Masaryk, professor of philosophy at Prague University. The doubts about the authenticity of Hanka’s manuscripts, the ideological struggles between the Old and Young Czechs, Masaryk’s audacious book on suicide and other of his unpopular opinions formed the background to the prolonged controversies about Schauer’s questions. The author of this essay offers many details and suggests that the history gave real but harsh answers to these questions about the very existence and the raison d’etre of a small nation such as Czechoslovakia. “Literature and Politics: The Case of Czech Communist Poet Josef Hora” is the topic chosen by Peter Hruby, Senior Lecturer at the Western Australian Institute of Technology. Among the books published by Dr. Hruby is one that seems to have a relationship with this essay, Fools and Heroes: The Changing Role of Communist Intellectuals in Czechoslovakia. In case of the poet Hora (1891-1945), the enthusiasm for the Russian Revolution, also shared by other Czech writers of the “proletarian school” of the early 1920’s, was soon followed by the action — identification with the Communist Party and an early expulsion from it. Hora wrote about his disenchantment in some of his poems and in his prose. Dr. Hruby illustrates Hora’s development by selected fragments from his work, some being translated by him into English apparently for the first time. The literary samples cover the span since Hora’s First Book of Poems of 1915 to Notes About An Illness of 1945, written before his death on June 21, 1945. Ivan Svitak, Chico State College, contributed with an article called “The Tatra Veterans. An Auto-Biography.” However, the title is a double pun which could perhaps be rephrased as something like: “The Birth and Early Existence of the Tatra Automobiles.” The biographical elements concern the grandfather Leopold Svitak, an engineer who built the first Kopřivnice automobile, the “President.” The Kopřivnice plant was later renamed Tatra. Leopold Svitak was in charge of the production between 1897 and 1905. Eventually, Tatra became one of the outstanding Czechoslovak car brands. When the Tatra Historical Committee and the Museum of Automobiles in Kopřivnice tried to reconstruct the early history of the factory, Ivan Svitak prepared his late father’s, Jaroslav Svitak, memoirs and a collection of documents for print. He found the family-, Tatra factory-, and auto-biography fascinating - and writes about it with the authority of a veteran connoisseur of antique cars, the first ones produced in the then Austria. The essay “Augustine Herman Bohemiensis” belongs to a different historical context. The author, Miloslav Rechcigl Jr., Agency for International Development, has been SVU President (but never the Secretary General), academic program organizer of the first two SVU congresses and editor of the proceeedings from those congresses, published in Holland. His special, ongoing project has been the preparation of a Who’s Who of the Czechoslovaks abroad. In that research he worked out biographies of several early immigrants to the United States. Augustine Herman is the first known one and also one of the first naturalized citizens of Maryland. He led a somewhat adventurous but successful life and came to be known as the [pageend8]Lord of Bohemian River where he built his Bohemian Manor. One of his memorable accomplishments of historical significance was a survey he made of Virginia and Maryland and the excellent map he prepared for that territory. The map was engraved in London in 1673. Augustine Herman was proud of his Bohemian descent. His date and place of birth are not certain but his last will of 1684 is well documented. We hope Dr. Rechcigl will publish more of similar biographies of the early Czechs in America. Reviews of Vera Laska’s Women in the Resistance and in the Holocaust by Z. E. Fischmann; Karel B. Absolon’s Developmental Technology of Gastric Surgery by Stacey B Day; and Paul R. Magocsi’s The Rusvn- Ukrainians of Czechoslovakia by Zdenek Suaa complement the volume of 179 pages. All contributors to this issue, except Jaroslav Opat and Stacey Day, are SVU members. The following Kosmas issue is dedicated to history and will be reviewed next time. ★ ★ ★ SVU DID A long review of several books on genetics from the pen of the Harvard Professor of Biology, R.C. Lewontin, was published in The New York Review of Books (Vol. XXXII, No. 15, October 10, 1985). The title Darwin, Mendel & the Mind,” indicated the thrust of the article. The book Past Masters: Mendel by Vítězslav Orel, translated by Stephen Finn (Oxford Universitv Press, 111 pp., $3.95 paper) was the reviewed Czechoslovak contribution to the topic, l he reviewer tound it paradoxical that Darwin is represented by hundreds of books and thousands of pages in the catalog of Harvard’s Widener Library list, while Mendel reaches “a mere one hundred pages” with the inclusion of Orel’s publication. He also recalled the heavily celebrated Darwin centennial of the publication of Origin of Species and stated that “the centenary last year of Mendel’s death went completely unnoticed by the institutions of science.” To this statement we take an exception, for there was the Mendel Memorial Meeting on Sunday, October 28, 1984, during the Twelfth World Congress of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences held in Toronto, in conjunction with the Mendel-Frimmel Society for Genetics, Freising, FRG. The Mendel Exhibit was a part of the symposium, consisting of five lectures by experts from West Germany, Sweden and the United States. Professor Lewontin appears to have been interested in Mendel, his contributions to science and his place in the development of genetics. He presented the highlights of Mendel’s life and work in this article and outlined some reasons why Darwin is better known than Mendel. He also referred to the English translation (1932) of Life of Mendel by Hugo litis as another source. It is a pity he missed the Mendel Memorial Meeting, if it was the only one remembering Mendel’s centennial on this continent. ★ ★ ★ 9 [pageend9]CZECHOSLOVAK SOCIETY OF ARTS AND SCIENCES (SVU) COMMEMORATION OF THE CZECHOSLOVAK INDEPENDENCE DAY, 28 OCTOBERjl918yGEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY, INTERCULTURAL CENTER. 27TH OCTOBER 1985 OPENING ADDRESS BY VLADIMIR M. KABES Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Friends; Endless is the range of human emotions, infinitely subtle the means of expressing them. Cur chairman pointed out in her opening remarks that we are gathered here to commemorate rather than to celebrate the 67th anniversary of the 28th of October 1918. I should add that we are doing so with fervor rather than with jubilation. ?or the national holiday of free Czechoslovakia is different from other red-letter days of the international community. On the calendars of the country the freedom of which it was supposed to manifest, it has been blotted out in black and, outwardly, reduced to just another drab autumnal day. Well, not exactly. It is now "nationalization day." And yet - the 28th of October is probably a national holiday closer than any to the 4th of July. That cheerful summer day was dear to Czechoslovakia’s first President, Thomas Masaryk, whose American wife brought him a rich dowry of her native country's democratic ideals and humanitarian beliefs. He considered and cherished the 4th of July as one of the mainsprings of Cze&oslovak resurgence. The Philadelphia Declaration of Independence was spiritually present in both political theory and practice of Prague between the two world wars. But here the similarities end. There were so far 209 official celebrations of the 4th of July, but only 21 of the 28th of October. Prom 1937 through 1944, and again since 1948, there have been no fireworks in Czechoslovak skies and no parades on Czech and Slovak streets. The newly declared national holiday, the day of liberation from nazí occupation, never really caught on as a surrogate of independence day. •‘■ hat is quite unnerstandable: the country, though freed from foreign oppression, was not allowed to rekindle - let alone to recapture - the spirit of that liberty under which truth prevails against all types of evil.. Still,there is good reason to observe with pride this special day in the national history of Czechs and Slovaks. And that is the realization that we remain proud heirs of traditions and achievements dating back far into the European past. Our ancestors' road to ethnic survival and, subsequently, to self-determination, was a slow and hard one. The jet age did not make it any less tortuous. Periods of enlightenment and darkness alternated through centuries and much too often have exiles been called upon to sustain their homeland's resistance to violence and foreign rule. Let us recall a few examples. At the very time the first of the many ill-reputed "normalizations" got under way, in the period following upon the battle of the White Mountain in 1620, Jan Amos Komenský, internationally known as Comenius, the world-acclaimed educator and prototype of the intellectual exile, was sounded out nn becoming the first President of Harvard University. A century later, at the time of the first authoritarian drive toward Vienna-imposed centralization, it was cur nations that gave to the world musicians of the renown of Mysliveček, Stamic, Koželuh, and so many other artists and scholars eventually integrated in a new habitat, including these United States. Fortunately, we have Mila Rechcigl to trace their record and to preserve their memory! It was indeed arts and sciences that have for generations kept alive the Czechosaovax cause in the conscience of the world. Later, at the dawn of this century, Masaryk added another crucial international dimension, namely that of affirmative humanitarian concern, of an engaged struggle against bigotry and nostile 10 [pageend10]Superstition, triggered off by the notorious Hilsner affair. This courageous intervention,and a few other resounding defenses of human rights in Europe, strenghtened in the subsequent years considerably Masaryk's and his collaborators' wartime arguments in favor of Czechoslovak independence. Come to think of it, there are indeed few other countries which derive their birthright from humanitarian ideals rather than from forceful unification or conquest. The United States is one of them and that fact constitutes another common bond between the American Founding Fathers and the Czechoslovak "Men of the 28th of October". Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Friends, to uphold one's country's honor through activities outside its national boundaries may at times appear to be a sad lot, especially from the vantage point of those spared such an experience. But for those directly involved, there could be no more challenging task. Let us not deplore or regret it; rather, while counting our blessings ď living free, let us recommit ourselves today to proving worthy of all those who were this year once again not allowed to publicly observe their true national holiday. ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ Personalia Vladimir M. Kabes - Vice-President (Public Relations) Vladimir M. Kabes was born in Prague on January 6, 1918. He was employed since 1936 in the company AERO while he studied at Charles University. His studies were interrupted by the closure of the university in 1939 and he finished them by being conferred the degree of Doctor of Law in November 1945. He became the Czechoslovak representative in the negotiations with the American Lockheed Company in 1947 and was active in politics. The changes in the Czechoslovak nationalized industries and February ‘48 were then the reasons why he left Czechoslovakia. After two years in West Germany, he arrived in the United States in 1950. He studied American law at George Washington University, earning the degree of Master of Comparative Law in 1957. He worked in the Library of Congress, producing the two volumes of Government Law and Court in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe (London: Stevens & Sons Ltd., 1959). Dr. Kabes’ career then consisted of work with the United Nations in New York and in Geneva, as a consultant to the Prime Minister in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire), being the Swiss representative of the Chicago law books company (Commerce Clearing House), and finally becoming the Secretary General (1971-1983) of the Alliance Internationale de Tourisme, with the seat in Geneva and membership branches in 85 countries. In 1983 he returned to Washington, D.C., and, besides being a consultant for various international companies, was elected SVU Vice-President. His special task is Public Relations. He has started to build a net of non-Czechoslovak persons and institutions interested in SVU and to improve the Society’s contacts with the ethnic press. In the last SVU Congress he presented an original paper on “International Tourism - Mass Movement of Our Times.” ★ ★ ★ 11 [pageend11]Anton Novačky -- Vice-President (Sciences) Anton Novačky was born in Bratislava, on June 3, 1933 His father was a renowned Slovak botanist Jan Martin Novačky. It is not surprising that the son early developed interest in botany specializing in his studies - at Charles and Comenius Universities - in mycology, phytopathology, entomology and biochemistry. He earned a Ph.D. from the Czechoslovak Academy of Science, Prague, in 1965 and a RNDr. from Comenius University, Bratislava, in 1966. In 1966, Anton Novačky became a post-doctoral fellow, Department of Plant Pathology, University of Kentucky, Lexington. Since 1970 he has taught at the University of Missouri-Columbia, becoming a full Professor of Plant Pathology in 1982. Grants for his research, international visiting professorships, frequent lecturing, leading seminars in Holland Hungary, West Germany and Japan have followed. Dr. Novačky has authored and co-authored a number of articles in his specialty, published in international learned journals. It is somewhat difficult to pay proper attention to SVU members in very specialized scientific branches. They seem to be “hidden” in their laboratories, inaccessible to non-scientists, while the literati and artists are more visible and more audible. Now, Dr. Novačky accepted the responsibility for organizing the academic program for the Xlllth Congress, and we all will use the opportunity to get properly acquainted. ★ ★ ★ Emi) Stephen Purgina - Vice-President (Arts) Emil Stephen Purgina is another SVU member born in Bratislava, on October 21, 1937. He knew that drawing and painting was “his thing” since his childhood. He eventually studied architecture, fine arts and the history of art in his native city and, for one year, at the Academy of Fine Arts in Budapest. He also became a teacher of graphic arts. Between 1959 and 1968 he worked in Czechoslovakia as an independent artist, active in TV, theaters and films, illustrating many books, and exhibiting there and abroad. He entered various contests, and some of his works won prizes. Since 1968 he has lived in Ottawa, associated with the University of Ottawa. He is active on his own and with an international avant-garde artistic group. He is organizing the SVU fine arts section and will be in charge of the exhibition at the Xlllth Congress in Boston. ★ ★★★★★★•&★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ What’s Your Thing?

Kovtun, The Czechoslovak Declaration of Independence. A History of the Document. (Washington, D.C.: Library of Congress, 1985; pp. 59, illustrations) George J. Kovtun, SVU member who works in the European Division of the Library of Congress as an area specialist, researched the documents pertaining to the historical moment in Washington, D.C., when Professor T. G. Masaryk decided to make public the wish of the Czechs and Slovaks to completely break away from the Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy and become a free state. While President Wilson’s sympathy for the oppressed ethnic groups, especially the Slavic ones, was well known, his Fourteen Points of January 8, 1918, seemed not to go as far as to favor the dismemberment of Austria-Hungary. As late as the beginnings of October 1918, Masaryk was not sure whether President Wilson would agree with the aspirations the Czechoslovak National Council represented. By that time the Council was recognized by the Allies as a de facto provisional Czecho-Slovak government. Benes achieved this recognition through his negotiations in Paris and London. Masaryk did so in the United States. And General Štefánik was in Russia, busy with the problems of the Czech Legion in Siberia. Despite the difficulties in communication, the representatives abroad and those in Bohemia were in acccord not to accept any last minute offers of any limited autonomy within the framework of the defeated Monarchy. Mr. Kovtun presents in detail the antecedents of Emperor Charles’ Manifesto proposing reforms in Austria and of Masaryk’s Czechoslovak Declaration of Independence. Both these documents appeared in the' Washington Post on Saturday, October 19, 1918, when peace negotiations were expected to start at any moment. Masaryk prepared a Czech draft of the declaration, partially modelled on • the American declaration, on the 12th and 13th, dating it October 14. An English translation was immediately done by his secretary Jaroslav Cisar. This first English version was then edited and finalized by seven American friends of Masaryk’s, headed by Herbert Adolphus Miller, in a session during the night of October 16-17. The definitive final version was handed to President Wilson on October 18 and the press published it the next day. All these documents are reprinted in Kovtun’s booklet, the Czech draft being published for the first time. He gives due credit to the American editors and calls attention to the fact that the Czechoslovak Republic came into existence on the basis of the Declaration of Independence written in English and later translated into Czech, which is an unusual event in the history of the nations seeking their liberation. Masaryk’s basic ideas of a republic, of all guarantees of civil rights for the future Czechoslovak citizens and the minorities, separation of church and state, and the plan to form a militia instead of an army were incorporated in the document, as well as his reasons why independent Czechoslovakia should be founded. As the signatories we have: Professor Thomas G. Masaryk, Prime Minister and Minister of Finance General Dr. Milan R. Štefánik, Minister of National Defense Dr. Edward Benes, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Oi Interior 13 [pageend16]George Kovtun’s study of the Declaration is very thorough and interesting, as his “Thomas G. Masaryk’s Road to Revolution” published in T.G. Masaryk in Perspective had been (see Bulletin HI, 1, January 1982). He also compiled the work Czech and Slovak Literature in English, published by the "Library of Congress in 1984, which covers the period of 1832 to 1982.

Both theoretically and empirically, this is an important world. This volume seeks to bring together both international relations and comparative politics. The revised edition contains up-to-date material and the discussion of theory has been sharpened.

We now want to add the sincere congratulations of the whole Society to Mrs. Provazník on her 95th birthday on October 24. She has been active, and her new book is another proof of her concern for perpetuating the traditions of the Sokol movement, today dispersed in various Western countries. The book is addressed to the Sokol instructors and all Czech readers interested in Sokol activities, be it the regular participation or the special occasions as the Sixteenth Slet (Festival, Meet) of the American Sokol taking place in Chicago last June 26-30 and the Vlth Slet of Czechoslovak Sokol Abroad to be held on July 4-7, 1986 in Zurich, Switzerland. The book is illustrated by Vaclav Pergl and Magda Schay, and also includes the original text by Miroslav Tyrs about the Sokol system of gymnastics. 14 [pageend17]The year 1985 signified the 120th anniversary of the first American Sokol unit established in St. Louis on February 14, 1865 and the 75th anniversary of the foundation of the Pacific District represented by the Los Angeles very active unit.

In May 1985, The University of Chicago Press congratulated the author for having been awarded The Haskins Medal of the Medieval Academy of America for Volumes 3 and 4 of his The Christian Tradition. A History of the Development of Doctrine. In the November issue his Jesus Through the Centuries is prominently presented. It says, among other statements, that Jaroslav Pelikan, “an eminent theologian and historian examines Jesus’ impact not only on the culture but also on the political, social and economic history of the last two millenia. Studying the images of Jesus cherished by successive ages - from rabbi in the first century to universal man in the Renaissance to liberator in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries - Pelikan suggests that the way Jesus was depicted in a particular age is an essential key to understanding that age.” ★ ★ ★ Martina Navratilova with George Vecsey, Martina (New York: Knopf, 1985; 287 pp., illustrations; $16.95) Martina Navratilova, the tennis star and a defector from Czechoslovakia (1975), wrote an autobiography, with the help of George Vecsey, New York Times reporter. She describes her childhood, her road to the international championships, her decision to stay in the free West and her adjustment to her life in New York. The book was reviewed in the Los Angeles Times (September 1, 1985) by Karen Stabiner who is the author of a book concerning young girls aspiring to become professional tennis players (Courting Fame, to be published next spring). She characterizes Martina as “a heartfelt story, bluntly told” py a “young woman who has lived two wildly disparate lives, mostly alone, and has persevered.” The two lives refer not only to the change of the countries but also to the public image created by the media and the private Martina Navratilova. ★ ★ ★ 15 [pageend18]Two publications in German are of special interest to SVU members: Bedrich Fritta, Fuer Tommy zum dritten Geburtstag in Theresienstadt 22.1.1944 (For Tommy to his Third Birthday in Terezin on January 22, 1944) (Pfullingen: Neske Verlag; 108 pp., DM 38.00) In the book The Artists of Terezin (New York: Hawthorne Books, 1978) by Gerald Green, the author of Holocaust, we find many drawings by Bedrich Fritta. Among them is a sample of ten pictures, out of the fifty comprising the collection Tomickovi, which he had painted as a present for his son’s third birthday. The collection remained hidden in Terezin in a wall and was published privately after the war. Bedrich Fritta was a pseudonym of Friedrich Taussig (b. 1906), an editor at the Prager Tagblatt. He and his wife perished in 1944 under special circumstances, as a punishment for the Terezin artists’ realistic paintings which were discovered by the Nazis and declared to represent “horror propaganda,” a crime punishable by death. Little Tommy, prisoner F 172, survived Terezin with the help of his parents’ friends Leo and Erna Haas who later adopted him and took him to Israel. Today, Thomas Haas lives in Mannheim. He is married and has four children . The whole collection appeared in the Netherlands and now in Germany, with the subtitle translated from the Czech edition: a document of humanity and hope amidst the grayness of a national-socialist extermination camp. ★ ★ ★ Rudolf Strobinger’s Poker um Prag. Die fruehen Folgen von Jalta (Playing Poker to Win Prague. The Early Consequences of Yalta) is very timely. The author works for the documentation department of the Cologne radio and television. The book appeared in the series Texte + Thesen. It is available from: Verlag A. Fromm or Edition Interfrom AG Postfach 19 48 Postfach 50 05 D-4500 Osnabrueck CH-8022 Zurich West Germany Switzerland ★ ★ ★ Robert McCrum, The Fabulous Englishman (Boston: Houghton Mifflin; $14.95) The reviewer Elaine Kendall from the Los Angeles Times wrote about this book under the title “Tale of Love and Fear in the Tense Atmosphere of Prague.” She states that the author skillfully blends “recent history and fiction” and that his knowledge of the city adds the “dimension of a documentary.” The protagonist is an English author who carries on a correspondence with a Czech bookseller and eventually visits Prague. The story seems to be quite complex and McCrum brings all the factors to a satisfactory conclusion. ★ ★ ★ 16 [pageend19]ARTS An interesting and not too usual artistic expression is practiced by the new SVU member Floyd D. Shaman. He was born in Wyoming (1935) where he grew up on a farm. At the University of Wyoming, Laramie, he studied sculpture, earning the degree of M.A. in this discipline in 1969. His thesis versed on “Chemical Patina for Bronze.” Between 1970 and 1980 he was an Assistant Professor at Delta State University, Cleveland, Mississippi, with some guesting and workshops in Italy, Saratoga Springs, Nebraska and his home state. Mr. Shaman developed wood sculpture of a very specific type as his specialty, though he also works in stone and other media. He received several awards nation-wide, is represented in several collections and has had many one-man shows. His sculptures of life-size figures are realistic enough, though some critics consider them somewhat sarcastic. One description of his work exhibited last year at Mississippi State University under the title “Americana” says: “His pieces are a kind of commentary on the humanity he has observed or worked alongside throughout his life.” We have here a sample of one of his sculptures, though it does not copy very well and had to be a little shortened to fit the page. ★ ★ ★ MUSIC Jenufa Revival at the Met Janacek’s Jenufa, first performed at the Metropolitan Opera in 1924, with Marie Jeritza in the title role, has been restudied for this season. The opening performance was Vaclav Neumann’s conducting debut at the Met. The translated text by Yvetta Synek Graff and Robert T. Jones, which tries to imitate in English the speech patterns of the original, was used. The cast consisted of Roberta Alexander (Jenufa), Mignon Dunn (Kostelnicka), Timothy Jenkins (Laca), William Lewis (Steva) and Geraldine Decker (Grandmother Buryj a). ★ ★ ★ Saint Ludmila in California Last May 18, the Choral Society of Southern California and the Downey Symphony Orchestra presented Dvorak’s oratorio Saint Ludmila, Opus 71. John H. Yoell, M.D.,member of the Friends of Czechoslovak Music, wrote a review of the performance which was published in Musical America, September 1985. He gave the background of the work’s British premiere and of its contents. One point of special interest is the question whether the Downey performance was the U.S. premiere as claimed. According to John Clapham, the British musicologist who did research on the American documents for his biography of Dvorak, the oratorio appears to have been given in this country once only by J. E. van Olinda, on May 9, 1888, at Troy, New York, with Lilly Lehmann in the title role. Even if it was the second ever performance, it was a laudable revival of a neglected composition. ★ ★ ★ 17 [pageend20]Photo by Chailotla Mullinnix WANT A BITE? — The wooden sandwich looks tempting to Becky Goza, age 7,. who seems ready for an afternoon snack.

Professor Jaroslav Mraček (Department of Music. San Diego State University, San Diego, CA 92182) is the Executive Director, and Marie P. Dolansky (Mathematics, same school) is in charge of the membership. ★ ★ ★ Lydia and Doreen Sterba Lydia Smutný Sterba and her daughter, Doreen Mannette Sterba, were the soloists on a special Gala Testimonial Concert for Richard Noble who is celebrating his 50th year as a radio announcer. The concert was held in the Crystal Ballroom of the Blackstone Hotel, on November 13, 1985 , at 7:00 P.M. Lydia and Doreen gave a concert of solos and duets at Cantigny and another concert on the Blackstone Hotel series in early Fall. They were presented on a 25 minute interview with Mr. Noble on Station W.E.B.Z. at which time a portion of their “Rhapsody in Blue” duet from the Cantigny tape was also played.

Tatiana Calhamer, a student of Lydia’s was chosen by competition to be a soloist with the Chicago Pops Ensemble and will be piano soloist sometime this Fall. Doreen is now also on the faculty at Morton Colege as her mother, Lydia, has been for 31 years. ★ ★ ★ Bach Program in Vienna The SVU Austrian Chapter joined the Club International Universitaire in Vienna in organizing a concert to commemorate the 300th anniversary of J. S. Bach’s birth. On May 29, 1985, Mirek Bonhart (piano), Eva Jilg (voice), Joseph von Czibere (violin), Sager Aiashin (flute), and Oldřich Polášek (voice) performed Bach’s instrumental and vocal works. ★ ★ ★ Czech Music in Ottawa The SVU Chapter in cooperation with the Czechoslovak National Association organized a concert of organ and vocal music, which took place on June 1, 1985. Works by Linek, Dvorak, Kuchár, Bach, Mozart and Schubert were performed by Vera Bruna (voice), Stanislava Hlavaček (piano) and Jiri Hlavaček (organ), all graduates from Prague academy and/or conservatory of music. ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★A 19 [pageend22]News Received ILAVSKY SCHOLARSHIP Thanks to a beauest from the estate of the late Jan and Pavla Ilavsky, the Balch institute for ethnic Studie« will be granting a $2,000 echolarahip starting in Septemoer, 1986.

We reprint some of it and hope to keep in touch. “The Czechs of Texas can rightly be proud of their accomplishments. They are an industrious people. Czechs can be found throughout the state in all walks of life, and they are some of the nations’ most productive farmers. Yet their wealth cannot truly be measured in monetary terms, for perhaps their greatest resource is their heritage. The Czechs of Texas have preserved many of their forefathers’ values. Supportive of their churches, schools and communities, the Czechs still take part in an active community life which usually centers around the Czech fraternal organizations. This is true in the smaller Czech communities, as well as in the larger cities such as Dallas, where the Czech population is scattered throughout the city. The Czechs of Texas have preserved their heritage to a degree which perhaps no other ethnic group can match. The language spoken by Czech immigrants one hundred years ago can still be heard today in Texas, even though the great majority of speakers were born here in America. The music and many of the traditions of the early immigrants have also been preserved to a remarkable degree. Few other groups have shown such a commitment to the democratic form of government as have the Czechs. From their beginnings in Texas, Czech immigrants eagerly acccepted the responsibility of learning the English language and learning about and participating in our form of government. Czech public office-holders in Texas have exemplified the phrase “for the public good.” The most valuable resource possessed by the Czechs of Texas is a way of life characterized by faith in God and loyalty to family, community, and country. Many Texans, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of immigrants from “the old country,” have preserved their ethnic identity and pride of being Czech. The photo-mural exhibit “CESTI TEXANE” on display at the Czech Club of Dallas illustrates the story of the Czechs in Texas, from their difficult beginnings to modern-day prosperity.” Catljolic Czecli (^ub Historical Society 4930 Military Parkway - Dalias.

The Anti-Defamation League of B’nai B’rith is cooperating with RCDA in this important project. The topic of the conference is very timely in view of the changes in Soviet leadership and the developments in Central Europe, which are frequently eclipsed by the events and conflicts in other parts of the world. It is therefore the intention of the organizers of the conference to discuss such issues as the consequences of the 1945 Yalta Conference; the unprecedented challenge to the Conmunist regime in Poland by Solidarity, the free trade-union movement; the murder of Father Jerzy Popieluszko, an outspoken critic of the Jaruzelski government, and the trial of the secret police agents involved in that crime; anti-Semitism and the vanishing Jewish congregations of Central Europe; the impact of the Charter 77 human rights movement.on the developments in Czechoslovakia; peacemaking and the attempts by Communist governments to use churches in peace campaigns; independent peace groups in East Germany and Czechoslovakia; tensions between the church and the state in Hungary and East Germany, and other topics. The conference will be chaired by the Hon. Richard T. Davies, distinguished retired U.S. Foreign Service officer, expert on the USSR and Central and Eastern Europe, former U.S. Ambassador to Poland, and President of the Research Center.
