The Society and I are looking forward to sharing with you news about the Society, its members, the professions they represent, and the Czechoslovak culture and its arts and sciences. The Society is a non-profit, tax exempt, cultural organization of some 1600 members - scientists, creative artists, academics, and intellectuals in the professions, government and business who are either of Czech and Slovak background or are friends of Czechoslovak culture. Most of them are actively participating in seventeen local chapters in the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Africa. Established in New York in 1958 and incorporated first in N.Y. (1961) and finally in Washington, D.C., the Society has been active in many ways. It has published over forty books and monographs, in addition to periodicals in Czech and Slovak. Moreover, every two years the Society convenes international congresses at which distinguished members and guests give lectures, participate on panels, arrange exhibits of paintings, sculptures and books, and give concerts and musical performances. After twenty-two years of existence, the Society is now ready to begin to publish an English language news bulletin of general interest to its members and general public (in the English-speaking countries) alike. The Bulletin will appear on a trial basis three times a year. It will introduce ideas and news emanating not only from us, artists, scientists and intellectuals in the free world, but will speak also for artists and scientists in Czechoslovakia. And if we are successful, we may publish the Bulletin in other world languages as well. The artists and scientists organized in the Society believe that they have something important to say to the interested public, and that the Society has a contribution to make to world culture. If you are interested in the Society’s activities, please let us know and we will be pleased to answer your inquiries. And if you wish to become a member, we will gladly send you a membership application. Jan F. Triska A NON-PROFIT CULTURAL ORGANIZATION CONTRIBUTIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE [pageend1]W H AT IS IT ALL A B O U T “It-gets worse and worse. Another year and a half in misery, and the end is not in sight. Look at how many more people have been murdered since then. Look at how many more have been arrested, how many more have died of famine and disease, cold and nakedness, melancholy and grief... How many more people, high born and of lower class, have been impoverished. H ow many more have been robbed of their souls, by imprisonment and various tortures, or by clever wiles. And there is no hope in the world of any help...” Does this lament sound relevant and contemporary? It is what Jan Am os Comenius (1592-1670) felt and wrote in 1624. In his small allegorical dialog, as Sorrowful he mourned the fate o f Moravia and Bohemia and desperately argued with Reason that advised him: "... don’t let them exile you; go of your own free w ill,... then you will he a newcomer rather than an exile. The wise man is at home anywhere; the fool is in exile even at home, since his mind is unsettled anywhere.” Similar arguments have repeated themselves many times in the lives of Comenius’ countrymen - and people of other ethnic groups - caught over the centuries in the power struggles of ideologies, political systems, economics, religions or personal conflicts. In their search for refuge and major freedoms, many landed on these American shores, some arriving as exiles and others as immigrants, some hoping for an early, happy return home and others integrating themselves fully into the new world without, however, forgetting their roots. A s of today the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences, Inc. is an outgrowth of the three emigration waves of the past forty years, mainly reflecting the events that affected Czechoslovakia in 1938,1948 and 1968. The Nazi occupation, the communist takeover and the Soviet invasion did not affect like groups and individuals in the same way, but the thrust of the powers-that- be basically went against freedom of speech and of conscience, against the civil rights of non-conforming citizens, against “dangerous” intellectuals and “cosmopolitan” artists and scientists, against the free exchange of ideas on a world-wide basis. Such trends explain the motivation for founding in 1958 this learned Society, whose formal declaration of purpose and scope is here reproduced: “The Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences, Inc., generally known by its Czech or Slovak abbreviation as SVU, is a cultural, non-partisan and non-profit organization, dedicated to the principles of free search for truth and know- Bulletin, edited by Zdenka E. Fischmann, Box 134, Corona, CA 91720, USA. Date of issue: January 1980, Vol.I, No. 1. Issued three times a year. Publisher: Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences, Inc. Office of Publication: 2067 Park Road, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20010. Tel.: (202) 387-8580) Annual subscription price: members $2.00, non members $6.00. Second class postage paid at Flushing, N.Y. [pageend2]ledge, free contacts among peoples and free dissemination of ideas. SVU associates scientists, scholars, artists, writers and other interested individuals throughout the world who, either because of their national origin or because of their particular interests and callings, pursue activities related to Czechoslovakia, her peoples and their contribution to the world culture. Full membership may be granted to graduates of universities or equivalent institutions of higher learning, to professional artists, writers, scholars, scientists, and to other persons prominent in cultural and public life. Associate membership is open to others who subscribe to and wish to support the aims of the Society. Temporary student memberships may be granted to full-time students.” This calls to mind what President W oodrow Wilson, who stood at the cradle of the independent Czechoslovak Republic in 1918, said in his July 4, 1914, address: “Liberty does not consist in mere declarations of the rights of man. It consists in the translation of those declarations into definite actions. ” Within the sphere of its endeavors, the Society has been putting its declared principles into action in a consistent and multi-faceted manner, within the atmosphere of intellectual give-and-take guaranteed by the democratic constitution of this country that has becom e a new home. The Society has grown in the twenty years of its existence from a mere 200 to almost 1600 members at present. The majority reside in the U.S. and Canada while smaller groups exist in England and Australia/New Zealand. Consequently, English has become the second language of communication after the native Czech or Slovak, leaving out the growing membership in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, who rely on German, while French, Spanish and other European language areas are less strongly represented. The Society has been providing the unifying communication outlets in C zech and Slovak, in the form of an organizational newsletter (ZprauySVU, S V U News, currently Vol.XXI) and a cultural quarterly (Promeny, Metamorphoses, currently Vol.16). However, the need for an English periodical that would interpret the Society to a larger community has becom e imperative. Besides, an increasing number of our members and friends, as well as many of their spouses and children, do not speak or read Czech and Slovak. Attempts in the past have not achieved periodicity. Therefore, this Bulletin is a fresh start. T o get acquainted with the Society, the reader will find one of its English language publications very practical. It is the Biographical Directory 1978, fourth edition, compiled and edited by Eva Rechcigl and Miloslav Rechcigl, Jr. In addition to the alphabetical list of members, the book offers a detailed history of the Society, its major achievements, and the by-laws in full. Further, it lists the places and dates of the General Assemblies, W orld C ongresses, and National and Regional Conferences; past Presidents and Secretaries, nonorary, founding and deceased members; local chapters; and other interesting details. The list of publications, more in English than in C zech or Slovak, is informative. And especially helpful for quick reference are the sections listing the members by disciplines, expertise and geographical location. N o wonder this book of lists is the Society’s # 1 publication! W e hope 3 [pageend3]it will also become a bestseller with others interested in the activities of our members and in topics concerning Czechoslovakia. By the way, the initial paragraphs of this introduction were quoted from the book Comenius, ed. Vratislav Busek, published by the Society in 1972. The articles stem from the Symposium held during the 5th Congress on N ovem ber 13-15, 1970, at N ew Y ork University School of Law, N Y C , to commemorate the 300th anniversary of Comenius’ death. Copies of this book were recently sent to over two hundred selected U.S. universities as a donation. It was a novel action realized by the present Executive Board in their effort to share with the U.S. academic community something that the Society had produced and that is not readily available through commercial outlets. PERSONALIA Each Bulletin will introduce a few of our members. It will start with those who are currently shaping the functioning of the Society as elected officers. JAN F. TRISKA - PRESIDENT Professor Triska was born on January 26, 1922, in Prague. He spent the years 1943-45 in the Nazi concenration camp at Eisenach. After the Liberation he read law at Charles University until his escape in spring, 1948, to Germany and then emigrated to the United States. Somewhat symbolically, he entered the Law School of Yale U. on October 28, 1948. After Yale, he studied political science at Harvard where he also started his teaching career. H e taught at Harvard, the University of California at Berkeley, Cornell U., and since 1960 has been Professor of Political Science at Stanford University, Palo Alto, California. His California-born wife teaches English at a junior high school, and both sons are students at Stanford. Dr.Triska has been active in many professional societies, received many honors and awards, and has an extensive bibliography of published books and articles to his credit. In his inaugural speech as President of the Society, during the 9th International Congress in Cleveland, Ohio, (1978), he emphasized as a special goal making accessible the knowledge of Czechoslovak culture to English-speaking academic circles, in the form of published material and through the foundation of centers of Czechoslovak culture and studies at leading universities. This winter, Professor Triska teaches in Vienna. ★ VERA BORKOVEC - SECRETARY GENERAL She was born in Brno, Czechoslovakia, and grew up in Teheran, Iran. In 1949 she left Czechoslovakia, lived in Germany and Bolivia for several years, finally settling in the U.S., where her husband and she became citizens in 1957. 4 [pageend4]She did her undergraduate work at Charles University in Prague, majoring in English and Oriental literatures. In 1961 she received an M.A. in French from Hollins College, V A , and taught French in the secondary schools in Maryland. In 1966 she received an M.A. in Russian from The American U., Washington, D.C., and in 1973 the Ph.D. from Georgetown U., Washington, D.C.

She teaches graduate courses in Russian linguistics and literature and supervises the Russian undergraduate program. In 1968 she organized a two-year Czech course which was offered at The American University for several years thereafter and prepared C zech instructional materials and tapes. Her husband, Alexej B.Borkovec, past Vice-President of the Society, was one of the very early members. They became interested and joined the Society in 1958. She served on several committees for a number of years and was locally active on the Washington chapter’s Board of Directors. In O ctober, 1977, in Ottawa, Canada, she was elected to replace the late John G. Lexa as Secretary General. In October, 1978, she was elected in Cleveland, Ohio, to serve another two-year term. ★ WILLIAM EDWARD HARKINS - VICE-PRESIDENT He was born on Novem ber 10, 1921, at State College, Penna. He served as an officer in the Supply Corps, U.S. Naval Reserve, 1942-45. He culminated his graduate studies in Slavic Languages at Columbia U. with the Ph.D. dissertation (1950): “The Russian Folk Epos in Czech Literature, 1800-1900 ” H e lectured on American English at Charles University, Prague, 1947-48. From 1949 on,he taught Slavic Languages at Columbia U., N .Y. He is full professor (since 1964) and besides Russian literature he teaches a course on Czech literature every year.

Dr. Harkins has held offices in many professional and cultural societies, e.g., as President of the Masaryk Institute (1970-74) and as Director-at-Large of this Society (1969-71). His chief hobby is collecting Japanese art, but he also owns interesting pieces of Czech and Russian art. ★ 5 [pageend5]LADISLAV MATEJKA - VICE-PRESIDENT Dr.Matejka was born on May 30,1919, in Czechoslovakia, and came to the U.S. in 1954, becoming a citizen in 1959. He received his Ph.D. from Charles University in 1948 and another one from Harvard in 1961. He worked as research assistant at Harvard from 1956-59, then as associate professor at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, becoming professor in the Dept, of Slavic Languages and Literatures in 1965. One of his very important jobs is being the general editor of the Slavic publications at the U. of Michigan. He was a Fulbright fellow in 1965, Ford fellow in 1972 and Guggenheim fellow in 1979. He is a member of several linguistic societies. He authored, with others, Word Accent in Serbocratian (1971) and Crossroads of Sound and Meaning (1975) .

Ebenfelt in 1957 and they have two children. Before coming to the U.S. he was active at the University at Lund, Sweden, and with Radio Free Europe in Munich, Germany, and in N .Y.C . ★ M ILOSLAV RECHCIGL, Jr. - PAST PRESIDENT Dr.Rechcigl was elected President of the Society in 1974 and again in 1976. He was born on July 30, 1930, in Mlada Boleslav, Czechoslovakia, the son of a member of the Czechoslovak Parliament in the First Czechoslovak Republic. He studied at Cornell U. where he obtained his B.A. degree in biochemistry in 1954, Master of Nutritional Science degree in 1955, and in 1958 a Ph.D. in biochemistry, nutrition and physiology. After the completion of his studies, he was awarded a postdoctoral research fellowship by the U.S. Public Health Service at the National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Md., where he rose to the rank of senior investigator. In 1968 the U.S. Public Health Service selected him for special programs, the objective of which was to train intensively future key executives in government service in scientific areas. As a part of this training he rotated through a series of challenging assignments. In 1970 he joined the staff of the U.S. Agency for International Development in the U.S. Department of Health, first as Nutrition Advisor, subsequently as Chief of the Research and Institutional Grants Division, and most recently as Director of the Interregional Research Staff. Dr. Rechcigl is a member of over thirty scientific and professional societies. He is also a prolific writer, having edited over 100 publications in various 6 [pageend6]fields, such as biochemistry, nutrition, physiologyT enzymology, pathology and molecular biology. In 1973 the C R C Press published his Man, Food and Nutrition - Strategies and Technological Measures for Alleviating the World Food Problem. At the same time Karger & Co. issued his Food, Nutrition and Health - A Multidisciplinary Treatise Addressed to the Major Nutrition Problems from a Worldwide Perspective. In 1975 the World Food Problem was published by C RC Press. Tw o other major works followed, namely Comparative Animal Nutrition and Handbook of Nutrition and Food. Both Miloslav Rechcig! and his wife, Eva, have been very active in the Society. He was a Secretary of the Washington, D.C., chapter (1962-64), Director-at-Large (since 1962) and member of the National Board (since 1964). He organized the program of the First Congress of the Society in 1962 and the Second Congress in 1964. He also edited the proceedings of both congresses, which were subsequently published by Mouton & Co., The Hague, The Netherlands: The Czechoslovak Contribution to World Culture and Czechoslovakia, Past and Present. As chairman of the Publication Committee for a number of years, he successfully negotiated contracts with several private publishing houses and university presses to publish a number of the Society’s publications. ♦ MEETINGS The latest meeting of the Society was the General Assembly in Los Angeles, C A , October 26-28, 1979. In the formal business meeting reports by the officers were presented and discussed, as well as goals for the future. On Saturday, Oct.27, a day-long Symposium, “ Czechoslovakia 1979,” took place at, U C LA , co-sponsored by the Center for Russian and East European Studies. Prof.Barisa Krekic, Director of the Center, welcomed the Society. Andrzej Korbonski, Chairman of the Dept, of Political Science, was the moderator for the morning session while Michael S.Flier, Chairman of the Dept, of Slavic Languages, introduced the afternoon session. A Canadian film, “ The Forests and Vladimir Krajina,” was seen in lieu of a lecture, because Prof.Krajina could not attend. He has worked for thirty years at the University of British Columbia, concentrating on the problems of ecology and conservation, especially on Vancouver Island, long before such issues caught the attention of the general public. Jiri Valenta from the Naval Postgraduate Academ y, Monterey, C A, spoke on “ Czechoslovakia and Euro-Communism.” He presented an overview of the history of the Czechoslovak communist party and analyzed the periods under Smeral, Gottwald and Dubcek. While the Soviet invasion in 1968 strengthened Euro-communism, it isolated Czechoslovakia, where the Soviets do not tolerate any such ideas. “Language and Ethnic Identity” was the topic of Vera Henzel from Stanford University, Palo Alto, C A. She analyzed the function of the language as 7 [pageend7]an instrument of communication and its role in the ethnic consciousness and solidarity o f the minority cultures who perceive their national languages as symbols o f their identity in pluralistic societies. Michael Heim, U C LA , Dept, of Slavic Languages, Los Angeles, CA., author of a Czech language instruction book, presented a lecture on the writer Milan Kundera now living in France and enjoying great popularity in Europe. Prof. Heim is translating his latest novel (C zech title Kniha smichu a zapomnění; English title not yet definitive). H e also mentioned the upcoming retrospective of films directed by the late Jan Kadar and other activities at U C L A related to Czechoslovak topics. The next paper, by Stanislav Segert, U C LA , Dept, of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures, commemorated the 100th anniversary of the birth of Bedřich Hrozny (1879-1952), the Bohemian-born orientalist who is renowned mostly for his pioneering work on the Hittite language and hieroglyphs. Prof. Segert’s last contribution in this field is A Grammar of Phoenician and Punic, published in 1976. Another anniversary, 125 years of the birth of Leos Janacek (1854-1928), was also remembered. Zdenka E.Fischmann, Corona, C A , presented “ A Study o f Janacek’s Creativity,” connecting his art with his life story. Jaroslav Mraček, Music Dept., San Diego State University, San Diego, CA, spoke about the development of the composer, emphasizing his roots in Moravian folklore. Slides and short musical examples illuminated the lectures. During the evening social gathering, scholarship awards were presented to students of Czechoslovak ancestry. This has been for several years an annual event of the Los Angeles chapter. The last activity, during the early afternoon of Sunday, O ctober 28, was the Czechoslovak Flag Raising ceremony in front of the Los Angeles City Hall in which the Society and other local Czechoslovak organizations participated. October 28 is the traditional national holiday of the founding of the first independent Czechoslovak Republic in 1918 and is celebrated by free C zechoslovak organizations in many localities by special programs. In Washington, D.C., Dvorak’s opera The Jacobin was presented with great success by the Sokol Opera in the Lisner Auditorium under the direction of Lida Broděn, Karel Husa conducting, (Both are SVU members.) ★ 10th W O R L D C O N G R E S S of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences, Inc. is stated for O ctober 17-20,1980, in Washington, D.C., at Georgetown University. William E. Harkins is in charge of the program. Abstracts of the papers will be published as in the past. Current general topics, not connected with Czechoslovakia, and participation by non-members are welcome. W e should have more information in the next issue. 8 [pageend8]For information write to: W.E.Harkins 1214 International Affairs Columbia University 420 W est 118th St. N ew York, N .Y. 10027 ★ W H A T’S YOUR THING? One of the main characteristics o f the Society is the diversity not found in the usual professional associations. N ot only do the members live on all continents but they represent so many branches of the human knowledge that, in a way, they have little in common. This can be seen as a special strength but also as a certain disadvantage, making it more difficult to form clearly defined ties with other learned societies, except on an individual basis. Some disciplines have formed, at various times, “ specialized sections” to achieve inner cohesiqn; e.g., the journalistic, bibliographic, historical, music, beaux arts, and other sections have been tentatively and sometimes tem porarily organized. Similarly, each one of the seventeen local chapters has a different character depending on the particular members living in that geographical area. The oldest chapter, Washington, D.C., was founded as early as 1959, while the newest one, San Francisco, came into existence only last year, and the one in Pretoria, South Africa, is in the process of being formally constituted. Consequently, the Society is an umbrella organization loosely associating Czech and Slovak immigrants, persons of Czechoslovak descent and a considerable number of other nationals interested in our varied activities, besides “friends,” who for various reasons occasionally participate but have not become members. W e shall in the future publish updated names and addresses of persons to contact in the various fields and geographic areas. Meanwhile, the Secretary General and all officers whose addresses are included, as well as the editor of this Bulletin, will serve as liaison. Here are some of “our things” that might interest you, presented at random, to be amplified and continued in later issues. Czech and Slovak languages The population of Czechoslovakia, plus all ethnic Czechs and Slovaks living abroad, is less than the population of California, but there are two official, related but distinct languages. It is therefore commendable that the C zech and the Slovak languages are taught at a considerable number of American colleges and universities. Information about where these two languages are taught, also in England and other countries, is welcome, as well as data about such courses as Czechoslovak history, literature, music, etc. 9 [pageend9]Czechoslovak Collections As the Society does not own any buildings, our archive has been housed in several places thus far, though we hope to centralize it one day. Meanwhile, we send materials to those libraries and archives that have contacted us. We need more information about the content of some such collections. Here are some samples. The Archives of the Czechs and Slovaks Abroad located in the Special Collections of the Regenstein Library at the University of Chicago contains the largest collection of Czech and Slovak periodicals published outside of Czechoslovakia. Address: Regenstein Library, Special Collections, Archives of the Czechs and Slovaks Abroad 1100 East 57th Street Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA Our member, Zdenek Hruban, a pathologist by profession, has been in charge of this collection. ★ We are not sure how extensive is the collection at the Center for Immigration Studies, 826 Berry Ave., St.Paul, Minn 55114, under the care of Prof. Rudolph Vecoli. ★ Our printed materials also go to the Library of Congress, Exchange and Gift Division, Washington, D.C. 20540. it An interesting Preliminary Guide to Ethnic Resource Materials in Great Plains Repositories, compiled by Joseph G.Svoboda (University Archivist) and David D.Dunning, 1978 (University Libraries and Center for Great Plains Studies, U. of Nebraska - Lincoln) came to our attention. Pages 6-10 are dedicated to the Czechs and list materials from Denver, Colo; Kansas,. Nebraska and South Dakota (several localities in each state). There are taped interviews, personal papers, newspapers and other periodicals, naturalization records, manuscripts, Czech books etc. Especially interesting examples are the Henry J.John Papers (1912-1968) in Lincoln which include correspondence with T.G. Masaryk, Max Svabinsky, Gabriela Preiss and other well known personalities, or the manuscript “Scenes from Two Worlds” (in Czech) by the late Otakar Odlozilik, reposited at the Willa Cather Pioneer Memorial, Red Cloud, Nebraska. The historian Odlozilik was our honorary member. ★ 10 [pageend10]Special Bibliographies For the Bicentennial year when the 8th W orld Congress took place in Washington, D.C., the Society, jointly with the Czechoslovak National Council of America, published an impressive book, Czechs and Slovaks in North America, A Bibliography. Esther Jerabek, of Czechoslovak ancestry, compiled over 7600 items and classified them by subject, ranging from Agriculture to Travel. Many entries are in English and a considerable percentage are materials published in the 19th century. The compiler worked for thirty- seven years as librarian at the University of Minnesota Library and Minesso- ta Historical Society, St.Paul, until her retirement in 1963. As she said, she began this bibliography as a part-time project in order to bring together much scattered information that would be of use for historians, researchers and libraries. It is also fascinating just to browse through for pleasure. ★ Another special bibliography is Vojtech N.Duben’s Czech and Slovak Press Outside Czechoslovakia, Its Status in 1978, the Society’s Occasional Paper No.4, ed. Eva B.Polach. Besides the Czech and Slovak periodicals, the publication also lists those in other languages, mostly in English, and indexes them by geographic areas. ★ Different in character is Occasional Paper N o.2, Eva B.Polach’s TheSVU List of Lectures, Studies and Other Materials (1976), that gives information about the Society's publication activities and materials that can be of general interest. ★ A thorough guide is Alice Tischler’s Karel Boleslav Jirak: A Catalog of His Works (Detroit Studies in Music Bibliography, N o.32, 1975). The com poser, our honorary member, died in Chicago in 1972, at the age of 81. He was associated with Roosevelt University since 1947 and was also very active in the Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM ). Almost half of his com positions were created in this country. The book gives precise data on publishers, first performances, duration, discography, etc. ★ The Hussite Movement and the Reformation in Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia (1350-1650). A Bibliographical Study Guide (With Particular Reference to Resources in North America), Michigan Slavic Publications, 1977, compiled by J.K.Zeman, now active in Canada, was supported by the Center for Reformation Research in St.Louis and calls attention to many sources reportedly not known even to those working in this field. ★ 11 [pageend11]Linguistics and Literature Sound, Sign and Meaning: Quinquagenary of the Prague Linguistic Circle is a' publication edited by Ladislav Matejka as No.6 of Michigan Slavic Contributions, Ann Arbor, Mich., 1976. There are four articles in German and 23 in English. Am ong the contributors are the editor, Roman Jakobson, Rene Wellek, Bertil Malmberg from Sweden, et al. ★ Arne Novak, Czech Literature, Michigan Slavic Publications, N o .4 ,1976, translated into English by Peter Kussi, edited by William E. Harkins, who also wrote the complement about C zech literature 1945-74, is an important work for any student of literary Bohemica. ★ Rene Wellek, second President of our Society (1964-66) and a honorary member, Sterling Prof.Emeritus (Comparative Literature), Yale University, published his Essays on Czech Literature (The Hague: Mouton, 1963) in the series “Slavistic Printings and Reprintings,” ed. by C.H. Van Schoone- veld, Stanford University. It.is a book of lasting value, available from SVU Books. His textbook Theory of Literature, 3rd edition, written with Austin Warren, is available as a paperbook reprint by Harcourt, Brace & World, Inc. (a Harvest book) and is considered a “classic,” as are his books on literary criticism. ★ In Germany, an interesting book recently appeared in the Suhrkamp Taschenbuch edition: Max Brod, D er Prager Kreis, with a contribution by SV U member Peter Demetz, Professor and Chairman, Dept, of Germanic Languages, Yale U. M ax Brod (1884-1968), who saved and published Kafka’s major manuscripts and discovered the G ood Soldier Svejk, Leos Ja- nacek and other Czechoslovak artists for the German-speaking countries, a Praguer by birth, was our honorary member. Poetry In 1973, Czech Poetry. A bilingual Anthology Vol.l, edited by Alfred French, introduction by Rene Wellek, published by our Society and The Dept, of Slavic Languages and Literatures of the U. of Michigan, appeared as N o.2 of Michigan Slavic Translations and was sold out immediately. Now a second, hardcover edition has just com e out. The book covers C zech poetry from the Middle Ages to Karel Toman (1877-1946). There is always the original on the left page and a linear English translation opposite it. Short informative and biographical introductions are enriched by numerous illustrations from authentic Czech sources, such as medieval bibles and various manuscripts, to contemporary painters and photographers. The facsimile of the Song of Songs, as found in the historical 12 [pageend12]Kralice Bible (16th c.) is reproduced in full. Alfred French is the principal translator. W e hope that a second volume, on 20th century Czechoslovak poetry, will be feasible in the future. W e reprint one example, “ Is This Earth?” , by the eminent poet Otakar Brezina (1868-1929), whose 50th anniversary of death was celebrated last year. The translation is by Paul Server. Is This Earth? World upon world looms up, Star upon star in midnight’s dark reign, And one in their midst abides, round a dazzling orbit circles, And the sound of its flight is a joyous and baffling refrain, And the souls of them who have suffered most May enter within its domain. Brethren by hundreds have said: We have fathomed its secret, There do the dead from slumber arise, in slumber the quick pass away; Lovers have said: Its surfeit of lustre will blind us And time, like fragrance of blossoms unknown, all its dwellers will slay: And those whose vision has power to range through the ages, Is this earth? they smilingly say. Music It is interesting to compare the above poem with another version which became a part of a successful composition by Karel Husa, who worked out his own free translation for his American Te Deum (world premiere on Dec. 5,1976, at C oe College, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, conducted by the composer). Is It Earth? Behind a world is another world, star follows star when midnight darkens, and among them is one, circling around the white sun, and its flight thunders with mysteriously radiant music, and souls of those, who suffered the most, can enter within its sphere. Hundreds of brethren have said: We know its secrecy, the deceased awake there from their dream, the living are passing away into sleep; lovers have said: Its excessive radiance blinds us and time, like fragrances of unknown flowers, will destroy everyone; and those who knew the vision of seeing through ages, are smilingly asking: Is it Earth? The American Te Deum for mixed chorus, baritone solo and a band, uses segments of the English text of the Te Deum, a Moravian folksong, Swedish immigrants’ ballad, quotations from the writings of several American authors and poets (Ole E.Rolwaag, Amana Songbook, Paul Engle, H.D.Thoreau), and the text by Brezina. Dvorak’s Quintet in E flat and a melody of a Lullaby 13 [pageend13]of Chippewa Indians are briefly quoted. The introductory Ceremony for Percussion uses Afro-American and Amerindian rhythms. The main idea of the work is a Thanksgiving to God and the praise of nature and humanity. The concept of the multiethnic heritage of the United States is clearly expressed. The complex work is not yet available on records but has been performed several times, one being May 1, 1979 performance in Ithaca bv the Cornell Chorus and Glee Club and the Eastman Wind Ensemble, Karel Husa conducting. He has a very high opinion of the young musicians of this country, (“I have found that young people seem to understand my music best. They have such open minds,”) and loves to work with them. Husa’s most popular and most performed composition is Music for Prague 1968 for a symphonic band or in a version for regular orchestra. The recording conducted by the composer with the U. of Michigan symphonic band combines Music for Prague with his Apotheosis of the Earth (1971). His quartets were recorded by the Fine Arts Quartet and include No.3 which was given the Pulitzer Prize in 1969. His 2 Sonnets from Michelangelo were recorded by Jorge Mester and the Louisville Orchestra. The same performers have to their credit also a record of Music for Prague. Other works available on records are: Concerto for Alto Sax and Concert Band (1968); Divertimento for Brass Quintet (1968); Evocations de Slovaquie for Clarinet, Viola & Cello (1951); Landscapes for Brass Quintet (1977); Mosaiques for orchestra; Sonata for Violin and Piano (1972-2); Symphony No. 1 and other pieces. Karel Husa studied in Prague, then in Paris with Honegger and Nadia Boulanger. He came to the U.S. in 1954. Musicology Notes, the Quarterly Journal of the Music Library Association, Sept. 1979, Vol.36, No. 1, p. 186-187, has a lengthy review by Dee Baily, Brooklyn College, C U NY, of the book Seventeenth-Century Instrumental Dance Music in Uppsala University Library Instr.Mus.Hs.409., transcribed and edited by Jaroslav J.S.Mracek. It is volume 8 of Monumenta Musicae Svecicae, published in Stockholm: Edition Reimers, 1976. The reviewer lauds “the clear, concise commentary” and considers the edition “an important contribution to the study of baroque instrumental ensemble literature, and a worthwhile addition to music library collections.” Jaroslav Mracek is professor of music at San Diego State University and has participated in several of the Society’s congresses. He has made a special study of Czech Rorate chants, besides other topics in the field of Czechoslovak music. He is very active also in the American Musicological Society. ★ A timely publication is Dvorak by John Clapham, N.Y.-London: W.W. Norton & Co., 1979, coming out for the 75th anniversary of Dvorak’s death. 14 [pageend14]John Clapham was Senior Lecturer and later Header at Edinburgh University before his busy retirement. His earlier book, Dvorak: Musician and Craftsman, appeared in London, 1966. Before and since then he published an extensive series of articles on Dvorak, presenting various specific new discoveries, especially from English language sources. This Dvorak incorporates all new facts and details derived from 25 years of research. It is a very compact and factual book, providing an updated bibliography and interesting appendices. John Clapham is also the author of Smetana, The Master Musicians Series, N .Y.: Octagon Books, 1972. H e is a friend of our Society and presented papers at our past congresses. ETHNIC STUDIES A N D HISTORY The Czechs in America, 1633-1977: A Chronology and Fact Book, com piled and edited by Vera Laska (N ew York: Oceana Publications, 1978.) This new volume in Oceana’s “ Ethnic Chronology” series is devoted to the historical contributions o f the Czechs to the culture of the U.S. It contains a chronology of C zech immigrants from the early 1600’s to the present; their migration patterns from the Eastern Seaboard westwards; religious,journalistic, literary and cultural trends, etc. The author has translated numerous entries that are lively and would otherwise be unavailable: eyewitness accounts of Czechs at the Lincoln assassination or at the Chicago fire; excerpts from letters and diaries of C zech pioneers, cowboys and other rural and urban oldtimers. There are also official letters, including one from President Benes acknowledging financial support to the war effort. Vera Laska applied to the Czechs in America the meticulous scholarly training she has received at the University of Chicago, where she was awarded her Ph.D. in American history. ★ Building Czechoslovakia in America: 1914-1918 (Occasional Paper N o .l, ed.J.G.Polach) is a short analysis of the role the Am erican C zechs and Slovaks played in the struggle for an independent republic. Am ong other accomplishments, they created the first Czechoslovak flag. The author, Victor S.Mamatey, is professor of history at the University of Georgia, Athens, G A . Am ong other publications he co-authored, with R.Luza, Tulane U., The History of Czechoslovak Republic, 1918-1948 (Princeton, 1973.) ★ Josef Kalvoda: Czechoslovakia’s Role in Soviet Strategy (Washington, D .C.: University Press of Am erica, 1978) examines the long-term strategic interests of the USSR, as reflected in their relationship to Central Europe. H e goes back to the international situation in 1918 when the new C zech oslovak Republic formulated her external political relations and aligned herself with the West, represented by France. This conception did not survive 15 [pageend15]Munich. The re-orientation toward the Soviet ally during WW1I prepared the soil for the communist takeover in February, 1948. D raga B.

To continue I need your cooperation, along following lines: 1) Names of persons, with addresses, who volunteer to figure as co- ordinators/liaison in various fields, e.g., the secretaries of local chapters or chairmen of specialized sections. Your informal consent is necessary before your business or home address is printed (except for officers of SVU). 2) Somebody willing^to help with the “sciences” as I usually do not receive and cannot exactly evaluate that kind of material. 3) Factual current information you consider newsworthy for the general public, preferably but not necessarily in English. 4) Information from Europe and other areas of the world. 5) Suggestions about the contents. There is no reason why we shouldn’t have some longer book reviews, short-short commentaries on specific toDics, or even original creative writing once in a while. ★ EDITOR’S APPEAL ZEF Bulletin S V U 2067 Park Road, N.W .
