A 20-member commission, headed by Lee A. lacocca, has been named to raise funds for the restoration projects. The goal of the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Centennial Commission is to raise some $230 million from private sources for preservation, future maintenance, celebrations and educational programs. Contributions are being sought from the general public and from corporations and foundations. The Statue of Liberty, a gift to the United States from France to commemorate France’s alliance with the American colonies during the American Revolution, is visited by about 1.8 million people a year. It will be 100 years old in 1986. Plans call for the renovation to be completed in time for centennial festivities. Ellis Island Immigration Station opened in 1892 and operated until 1954, when it was declared surplus government property. Since then, apart from a few elements which have been partially preserved, the island has become a ruin. Between 1892 and 1954, some 17 million immigrants passed through the New York harbor site. These were the forebears of some 40 percent of today’s U.S. population. “Join us,” said lacocca, whose fellow commission members include Bob Hope and Lionel Hampton. “Help us ensure that these two great symbols of our past continue to serve as living memorials — as inspiration for the future.” Indeed, unless the public respond, officials fear the statue and island will continue to decay beyond repair. As with the original funding for the statue and its base, the money for its preservation will be raised from private sources — from schoolchildren and other individuals, companies, foundations, and associations. How bad is the deterioration? As for the statue, her upraised torch may have to be removed in order to reinforce the thinning copper skin of the hand and torch and the iron skeleton. Worse yet, according to the National Park Service, is the condition of the mammoth network of underpinnings. Corrosion of the iron contacting the copper skin has caused weaknesses that must be corrected. The 271/2-acre Ellis Island, site of a federal arsenal and fort before being picked as the entry point for immigrants, now houses a crumbling Great Hall, infirmary and other ghosts of once sturdy buildings. During World War II, the island housed a hospital for wounded GI’s, Coast Guard station and a detention center. The various celebrations scheduled include a Fourth of July observance in 1984 to mark the gift of the Statue of Liberty from the French people. During the summer of 1985, a 100-day International Festival will be held in tribute to the nation’s cultural and ethnic background. In 1986, more sailing vessels than participated in Operation Sail during the nation’s Bicentennial will sail into New York harbor as part of a special salute to the statue’s 100th birthday. Also during the 1986 summer, each of the 50 states will participate in two days of celebration of their heritage as part of another 100-day festival. Jhe centennial of Ellis Island will be acclaimed in 1992 with the opening of the refurbished buildings and a historical mucpiim “More than 100 million Americans had relatives who first saw America by sailing past the Statue of Liberty on their way to Ellis Island,” said lacocca. “These are monuments that affect you and me personally.” Funds donated by the general public will be applied to the preservation of the statue and Ellis Island and not to administrative, fund-raising, or other expenses. Contributions may be sent to: Your individual lodges or Statue of Liberty Fund c/o Vera Wilt CSA Plaza 2701 S. Harlem Avenue Berwyn, IL 60402 Statue of Liberty Nears Centennial Observance million were account for s Through the storms of winter and the shimmering heat of summer, she has stood majestically for nearly a century as a symbol of America’s independence and strength. For millions of immigrants fleeing hunger, turmoil and oppression in the Old World, the Statue of Liberty was their first glimpse after a long journey of a New World that promised freedom, hope and opportunity. Now nearing her 100th anniversary (1986), Liberty poised on her lofty pedestal at the entrance to New York harbor has experienced the ravages of time and the elements, her gigantic iron framework is corroded and structural problems require extensive renovation. The 200,000 pounds of hand-hammered copper sheathing that cover her iron framework are in serious disrepair. But once again the American people, whose forebears earlier gathered contributions to build the pedestal on which the Statue Corrosion and the stresses of almost 100 years have impaired the internal structure of the Statue of Liberty and major preservation work is needed to forestall serious damage, the monument remains open to visitors, but will have to be closed periodically for about a year as repairs go on. Iron bracing shown supports the statue’s copper exterior.

Statue of Liberty CSA NATIONAL PROJECT THE LEGISLATIVE VETO rests, are being called upon to help raise money to restore her and nearby Ellis Island where immigrants were processed until 1954. A total of $230 million in funds is being sought, equal to only about one dollar from every American. Our CSA Fraternal Life has chosen this project for their 1984 fund raising campaign. On May 18, 1982, President Reagan and Secretary of the Interior James G. Watt announced the formation of the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Centennial Commission and appointed Lee A. lacocca, Chrysler’s chairman and chief executive officer, as its chairman. The Commission’s goals, in addition to raising the money for the restoration of the Statue and Ellis Island, are to advise the Ellis Island, an integral part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument, opened in 1892 and was abandoned in 1954. Most of its historic buildings remain sound but suffer from the decay of age and require major restoration. View from second floor of main building. PHOTOS: Peter B. Kaplan (c) 1983. Almost everyone has heard by now that Congress recently vetoed a Federal Trade Commission regulation which would have required used car dealers to post a notice on each car listing major defects and stating warranty rights. But there’s another key point you may have missed. This is the first time an F.T.C. regulation has ever been vetoed by Congress. On substantive grounds, some may favor the used car proposal while others oppose it. But forget the used car aspect for a moment. What about the procedural issue of Congress actually vetoing a federal regulation? It's about time. Usually, Congress just lets the bureaucrats do whatever they want with regulations whether the regulations accurately reflect the intent of the law or not. Here's how it works: After Congress enacts a law, the law is handed to the bureaucrats in Washington who write stacks and stacks of regulations to “implement" it. The bureaucrats use these regulations — which have the force of law themselves — to build their empires, to aggrandize themselves, to increase the paper-shuffling, and to harass citizens and businesses. Because the regulations have the force of law, the unelected bureaucrats, in effect, legislate through their rule-making powers. The politicians love to make new laws, but they seldom take the responsibility to see that the bureaucrats interpret and administer them as Congress intended. Never mind the thousands of dollars the used car lobby poured into the politicians' campaign war chests; at least for once Congress exercised its responsibility to keep tabs on the bureaucrats. Congress set the precedent for carrying out its oversight duties. It should be noted that it took both houses of Congress — the Senate and the House of Representatives — to throw out this F.T.C. regulation. If the politicians would pass a one- house veto-of-bureaucratic- regulations law, we might see more and more of such responsible oversight activity.

They currently lease a gym. The plan various activities now and thru the summer. Los Angeles Dancers coming to Fresno in October to participate in Heritage Days; and annual affair in Fresno featuring all nationalities. Los Angeles reported all age groups are participating in all activities. May 20 will be a Public Exhibition, and they welcome visitors and participants from other Units. There are 45 participants in the program which includes 8 men. Peter Dusek presented a clinic while on a visit to the area. Educational: Everyone is invited to Sokol, but should be informed of Sokol ideals which is the gob of the Educational Director of each unit. Articles from publications good for use in this regard. Sokol Camp: See other pages in this publication for full information. Beautiful camp site with dormitories more like a motel than camp. There is a swimming pool and facilities for several kinds of sports. Help is needed in the staffing - kitchen helpers, instructors, and councilors. Other business: Pacific Zupa is planning a District Slet in 1985 prior to the National Slet in Chicago. A motion was approved to have the Slet, and to set a date sometime in May or June. Fresno will check on Unit approval and location for a Slet were they to host it. San Francisco and o ther units are invited to do likewise before a final decision as to location is approved. The general feeling was that Fresno would be a center point for travellers, but members must approve such an undertaking. During the Chicago Slet there is a relay race consisting of a team of 1 Jr, boy, 1 jr. girl and a senior man and woman. We should consider this for our Zupa. A motion was made an(^ passed that Clinic travel expenses of participants in a clinic be paid by the Unit sending, instructors or gymnasts rather than Zupa paying that expense. Participants to be confirmed and/or approved by Sokol Unit. Unit sponsoring the clinic will arrange housing of gymnasts or instructors attending the clinics. This does not apply to Sokol courses. Clinics only. A delicious dinner followed the meeting - served by our Sokol San Francisco Sisters.
