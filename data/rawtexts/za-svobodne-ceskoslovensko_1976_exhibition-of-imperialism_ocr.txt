EXHIBITION OF I MPERIALISM SOVIET EXPANSION IN EUROPE SINCE 1917 European Russia, where the Communist Dictator - ship was initiated by revolution in 1917. Countries, occupied by Red Army and annexed to the Soviet Union. Satellite countri- ie, occupied by Red Army and controlled by U. S. S. R. _____ Communist coun- ___l tries, independent of the U. S. S. R. When you are looking at the Soviet exhibition which will portray artifacts and cultural aspects of life in the Soviet Union, question the source, the setting and the circumstances under which these exhibits have been produced. Several exhibits were produced in their entirety with slave labor by the oppressed people in the Soviet-occupied countries of Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Byelorussia, Ukraine, Armenia and many others under the communist tyranny. Thousands and thousands of refugees escaped from the U.S.S.R. and its satellites. Thousands and thousands tried to come out but they were shot at the borders or sent to concentration camps. We, the witnesses of the Soviet terror are presenting these pages of facts, which you will not find in the Soviet official exhibition. [pageend1]2 THE MAIN IMPERIALIST ACHIEVEMENTS OF "PEACEFUL" SOVIET COMMUNISM 1917 - Invasion of Byelorussia. 1920 - Invasion of Ukraine. Invasion of Poland aimed at a breakthrough into Germany which is defeated in the battle at the Vistula River. 1921 - Invasion of Georgia. 1921 - Invasion of Armenia. 1932 - Six million die in the Ukraine of famine artificially created by Moscow. 1939 - After the signing of the Hitler-Stalin Pact, the Red Army joins Nazi troops in aggression against Poland. 1940 - Huge Red Army attacks little Finland on three fronts. 1940 - Occupation of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania followed by mass deportations. The Red Army seizes large parts of Romania. Katyn Forest massacre. 10,000 Polish officers are taken from the Soviet prison camps and brutally killed at Katyn, near Smolensk. 1944 - Red Army assists the Soviet Government in Sovietization of to 1945 Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, 1953 - Suppression of workers' demonstrations in East Germany followed by mass arrests. In Leipzig and its immediate environs, the Soviet Army deploys some 275 tanks against the workers. 1954 - Soviet tanks crush to death over 500 Ukrainian women on strike in a slave labor camp at Kirgiz in Kazakhstan. 1956 - The Soviet Army crushes the Hungarian Revolution, executing prisoners, massacring civilians and treacherously arresting Hungarian generals whom they had invited to negotiate. 1968 - Five Warsaw Pact Armies, under Soviet leadership, invade Czechoslovakia, crush that country's attempt for an independent socialism. 200 defenseless young people are killed; 60,000 Czechoslovaks leave the country. 1960 - Soviet Union and its satellites send 90% of the tanks, jet to 1975 fighters and other arms to Communist forces in North and South Vietnam. 1975 - Soviet Union sends 50 Soviet-made MIG jet fighters, 250 tanks 300 armored personnel carriers and 1,500 Russian "advisers" to Somalia, Africa. It is the beginning of the Soviet arms "help" to African anti-Western dictatorships. 1976 - Soviet Union sends 12,000 Cuban combat troops to Angola to help Angola's Soviet-backed Popular Movement. [pageend2]3 WHO ARE CAPTIVE NATIONS? From the United States Public Law 86-90, 1959: "... the enslavement of a substantial part of the world's population by Communist imperialism makes a mockery of the idea of peaceful coexistence between nations and constitutes a detriment to the.natural bonds of friendship between the people of the United States and other people; ....these submerged nations look to the United States as the citadel of human freedom, for leadership in bringing about their liberation and independence and in restoring to them the enjoyment of their Christian, Jewish, Moslem, Buddhist, or other religious freedoms, and of their individual liberties; ... The catalogue of Captive Nations which in 1959 was incorporated into the law included Albania, Armenia, Azerbaidzhan, Bulgaria, Byelorussia, Mainland China, Cossackia, Croatia, Czechoslovakia, Georgia, East Germany, Estonia, Hungary, Idel-Ural, Latvia, Lithuania, North Korea, Poland, Romanis, Tibet, Turkestan, North Vietnam, and the Ukraine. That list could be considerably expanded today with Cuba, South Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Angola, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and others; with still others like Peru, Ethiopia, Iraq, and Jamaica even now being turned into satellites. Perhaps we should ask, Who will be next? Will it be South Korea, the Republic of China, Thailand, Rhodesia? [pageend3]4 WHAT IS THE CONDITION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN CAPTIVE NATIONS TODAY? A few examples must suffice: * A quarter of all heavy labor in the Soviet Union is done by political prisoners in slave-labor camps where the sadistic brutality easily matches the torments devised by their former Nazi allies. Estimates of the number held in these camps today exceed one million. * In 1968 Czechoslovakia last sought to secure its human rights. When it did, that country was promptly invaded by the Soviet Army, which remains in Czechoslovakia today to keep the puppet regime in power. This year, hundreds of Czechs and Slovaks signed a manifesto called Charter 77 to remind the West that the human rights supposedly guaranteed by the Helsinki Accord have not been extended to those ruled by the Soviet Union. In response, the secret police arrested many prominent signers and began to assault Western journalists. * World War II ended in 1945, some 32 years ago. The East German regime today is kept in power only by an occupying force of 370,000 Soviet troops. In the last decades over one million East Germans escaped to West Germany. To maintain the inmates of the East German "kennel", the border has been heavily mined with explosives and is lined with automated machine-guns activated by heat of the live bodies of those creeping through the mine fields toward freedom. Mine fields are also at the Czechoslovak, Bulgarian, and Soviet borders with non-communist countries. * Castro's Cuban Communists operate a slave-labor system in which 20,000 to 30,000 political prisoners are held captive. Only the work sweated out of the slave-labor gangs, combined with Soviet subsidies of $2 million a day, keep Castro's economy from total collapse. Yet the Administration is rushing to open diplomatic and trade relations subsidized by American taxpayers so that we can pick up the Soviet economic burden in Cuba. Human rights are simply nonexistent wherever the Communists rule. But the people have demanded their restoration to freedom as provided under existing laws. V. GRUNDMANIS, U. S. A. [pageend4]5 DO YOU BELIEVE IN PEACE AGREEMENTS WITH THE SOVIET UNION IN THE SPIRIT OF "DETENTE"? This would be naivete. The Soviet Union has broken many different peace and non-aggression treaties in the last several decades. Remember the year 1940? The armed forces of the Soviet Union invaded the territories of three independent Baltic Republics: Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. One month later, after having staged illegal "elections" in violation of the Constitutions and Electoral Laws of these three States, the Soviet authorities forcibly annexed Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania contrary to the sovereign will of their peoples. It was an act of aggression and a flagrant violation of numerous international treaties and agreements. The Soviet Union had a peace and friendship agreement with Hungary but occupied it in 1956. The Russians killed the Hungarian prime- minister, thousands of people in the streets and thousands in Soviet concentration camps. The Soviet Union had a peace and friendship treaty with Czechoslovakia but Soviet tanks crushed the beginning of the self-rule in this state. For the Communists, any international agreements are just pieces of paper. The people of the United States tasted this experience too; however, politicians and media are very quiet about this matter - in the spirit of "detente", of course. The Soviet Union paid practically nothing for war material, food and modern technology, which was sent to the USSR after Hitler's invasion to Russia. Billions of dollars from the pockets of American citizens were lent, but Moscow did not even pay any interest. However, for development of H-bombs and rockets, for war material to Cuba, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Africa and for brutal attacks by Palestinian guerrillas, the Soviet Union had enough money. One of the avowed aims of the United Nations has been to pursue "the principle of equal rights and self-determinations of peoples,” as expressed in the United Nations Charter and the General Assembly Resolution 1915 (XVII) of December 22, 1962. It is therefore appropriate to remind the world community today that the above principle should also be applied to the peoples of the Captive Nations, who were forcibly and illegally deprived of their independence and self-determination by the Soviet Union. The rights of Captive Nations are violated whenever statesmen meet and omit to raise the question. We ask for freedom for Captive Nations now! We do, because this is a case of genocide, ethnocide and murder on a worldwide scale, threatening to engulf the whole world. [pageend5]6 Tortured and still faithful Underground Greek-Orthodox priest in Ukraine praying with believers in the middle of nature. All Greek- Orthodox churches were closed or destroyed and most priests died in prisons. Note the swollen legs of the priest. Christian hanged by the Soviets! A last picture of brother Ivan Ostapenko, a Russian Baptist and father of 6 children. Ostapenko was an elder of the unregistered underground church in Odessa and had spent 7 years in prisons and deportation. Since he continued his ministry unafraid the Soviets hanged him in March 1974. He was 60 years old. Since 24 years in prison Yuriy Shukhevych, the son of a Ukrainian freedom fighter languishes in Soviet jails since he was 15 years old. Authorities have continuously renewed his sentence. [pageend6]7 Tortured with mind-bending drugs. A rare inside glimpse into Soviet psychiatric asylum. This picture was smuggled out of the Soviet Union. In such asylums our Christian brethren are tortured with drugs intended to destroy their minds and thus also their faith.
