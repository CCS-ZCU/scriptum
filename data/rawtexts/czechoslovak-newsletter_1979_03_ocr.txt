P-7 THIRTY YFARS OF THE COUNCIL OF FREF CZECHOSLOVAKIA Thirty years ago, in February 194-9, a year after the communist coup in Prague had stifled freedom in Czechoslovakia, Czech and Slovak exiles met in Washington, DC, to form the Council of Free Czechoslovakia. The declaration below was issued last month on the occasion of the council’s thirtieth anniversary and in commemoration of the founding declaration of February 19^9* Declaration of 1979 The General Assembly of the Council of Free Czechoslovakia met in New York City on February 24 and 25, 1979, to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the foundation of the worldwidp central organization of Czechoslovak political exiles, the Council of Free Czechoslovakia, and adopted the following resolution: In appreciating the fact that prominent personalities and organizations in many countries have sent congratulations on the occasion of our anniversary, we express our thanks especially to the American political leaders who have warmly commended the past activities of the Council and reaffirmed their support for our future endeavors. Among them were Senators Frank Church (chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee), Bob Dole, Jacob K. Javits, Edward M. Kennedy, Fdmund S. Muskie, Claiborn Pell, and Charles H. Percy; Representatives John J. Rhodes (House Minority leader), Millicent Fenwick, Fdward Derwinski, and Theodore S. Weiss; Edward I. Koch, mayor of New York City; and George Meany, president of the AFL/CIO. 1 [pageend1]- 2 - r We also thank the Democratic National Committee and t'nr Republican National Committee, whose statements were greatly anorcciated. The assembly also acknowledges greetings from numerous organizations of exiles and fellow countrymen throughout the world, in particular, the Czechoslovak National Council of America, Czechoslovak National Association of Canada, Alliance of Czechoslovak Democratic Associations of Australia, Council of the Czech and Slovak Minorities in Austria, Union of Czechoslovak Associations in Switzerland, Czechoslovak Advisory Committee in Western Europe, and Permanent Conference of Slovak Democratic Exiles. From all these expressions of trust and support the Council of Free Czechoslovakia will gather strength for a further intensification of its struggle against communism and for the restoration of freedom, independence and democracy in our country. The assembly sends warm greetings to our people in Czechoslovakia and to all our countrymen living abroad, as exiles or as citizens of their second homelands. We pledge to cooperate with them in a common effort to dislodge the present regime in Czechoslovakia, which serves solely the interests of Soviet imperialism, and to reincorporate our people and their state into the European political, cultural and economic community of nations, where they historically belong. We recognize our duty to formulate our political goals in harmony with opinion at home. We realize that the focal point of the struggle to liberate our country is there. People at home continue to resist the dictatorship of the communist party and its leadershin, and openly demand the rights guaranteed +-o them by Czechoslovakia's constitution and other laws. We salute the Charter 77 Movement, the Commit+-ee for the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted, and the brave behavior of many individuals. We shall continue to use every opportunity to call to the attention of people everywhere the persistent violation of human rights by the Czechoslovak regime, and the systematic persecution of all who protest against such violations or demand compliance with the Helsinki agreements and other international treaties ratified by Czechoslovakia, or implementation of the minimal rights embodied even in communist law. The ruthless and continuous violation of these basic rights have been confirmed in an open letter recently sent by the Charter 77 Movement to United Nations Secretary General Kur4- Waldheim and the heads of all the states that signed the Final Ac4- of Helsinki. The letter points to "the rapidly deteriorating human-rights situation in our co; ntry ancį ^he steady intensification of the persecution of those who try to advocate human rights in Czechoslovakia." The situation, it states, "is approaching Orwell's vision—a society that prevents individuals from leading free and dignified lives.’1 We take advantage of this occasion to declare solemnly that we qualify, philosophically, morally and legally, all acts of injustice and brutality against our citizens as a betrayal of our national interests, and to issue a s4ern warning that all those who commit acts of repression, collaboration and denunciation will be held accountable for their deeds. This warning is particularly directed at the judges and security officers who, as the Charter 77 Movement has pointed out, "are trying to elude all controls in order to pursue their own aim: the restoration of a Stalinist regime." We remind them that only the Soviet occupation protects them from the wrath [pageend2]- 3 - and retribution of the Czechoslovak people. This warning accords fully with the opinion and sentiments of the citizens at home. We are anxiously watching the position of religion in Czechoslovakia. Despite constitutional guarantees and government pronouncements, freedom of religion has been severely curtailed and the activities of the churches have been made nearly impossible by a series of administrative measures. We are filled with admiration for the brave resistance of believers who risk persecution to claim their rights. We declare our full support for the leaders of the churches and assure them that we shall keep the world informed of the plight of religion in Czechoslovakia and of their efforts to protect and preserve the Christian heritage of our people. The Council of Free Czechoslovakia is informing labor organizations and the whole world of the situation of the trade unions in Czechoslovakia and their misuse by the communist regime. It is tragic that in a country proud of its long heritage of progressive trade unionism the communist government has turned the unions into an instrument of the repressive policy of a party and a state that have a monopoly on employment. We highly esteem the work of our artists and scientists living abroad and are proud that their achievements are a proof of our people’s advanced culture and form an integral part of our cultural heritage. They are maintaining the continuity of our culture, which in Czechoslovakia has been forcibly and intentionally cut off from its European roots. We express our appreciation for all those at home who at great personal risk continue their artistic, literary and scientific endeavors forbidden by the regime. We welcome the preparations for the first direct elections to the European parliament. It is a further step in overcoming historic antagonisms and improving cooperation among Europeans. We appreciate this new integrative move which will enhance European influence on the international level. In the interest of European and world security, we sincerely hope that the East Furopeans will not he forgot+en in this process. We therefore look forward to the newly elected European parliament establishing a special commit+-ee for those European countries which Soviet imperialism precludes from freely deciding their own affairs and national interests. Declaration of February 19^9 (abridged) We democratic Czechs and Slovaks in exile have founded +he Council of Free Czechoslovakia. Our people want to be free. They are not now free, but +-hey will be free again. Our country, silenced by cruel and sophisticated instruments of modern terror, cannot speak for itself. We shall speak on its behalf. History cannot be successfully rewritten. Whenever a preeminent Czech or Slovak public figure has taken up his pen, he has expressed a deep conviction that freedom is the only state worthy of intelligent man. Alive or dead, we have never felt otherwise. When jail or execution was inevitable, our people have stood the trial with the fear natural to the human body but with resolution worthy of the free snirit. [pageend3]- - It is in such a si^-ua^ion that out unhappy country once again finds itself. One year ago, emboldened by +he proximity of the Red Army, *-he communisms liquidated democracy, shattered freedom, crushed civilized relations among people, and made Czechoslovakia a mere forefield in the Great Power game. Slavery has become known as freedom, loyalty as ^-reason, and trPason as loyalty. They ridicule us democratic Czechs and Slovaks for living in misery in exile. Yet we have not been paid treason’s thirty pieces of silver. They ridicule, then, our honor. The communists faced defeat in the elections due in 19^+8. which would have shown the world on which side of the fence our people wished to stand in the divided world. The day they realized this, they staged a coup d’etat. We are perfectly well aware of the destructiveness of dictatorships of both the right and left. Each has taught the other brutality. Our people have experienced both. They will overcome. Until they do, we promise them to keep the world informed, to support their claim to freedom, t0 keep the unity of our ranks, and to prevent anything that would threaten the unity of the Czechoslovak state. Whoever would follow another path has no place among us. On social matters we are united. Many misfortunes have beset the world because they have remained unsolved. We reject the communist siren song that social problems can be solved only through the renunciation of freedom. Man is advanced enough to repudiate such a crude and irresponsible antinomy. Nations have struggled long for the ideal of freedom and we must not turn our backs on this ancient and noble endeavor and call it a mistake. There will be no peace so long as the old and new ideas of freedom are confused and the material is equated with the spiritual. We are convinced our people are talented enough to solve the dilemmas of hunger and civil and human dignity. We would learn from experience. Twice in the last decades the small nations of Central Europe have been the victims of larger aggressors. What is needed is more organized power and cooperation. Our great mentor T. G. Masaryk was of the same belief when he surveyed the wreckage of the past af*-er World War I. He welcomed freedom for small nations, but he also wondered how to make the new order viable. Mindful of this, we look to the councils of other Central European nations to consider ways of organizing cooperation. The world cannot live divided indefinitely, with people in one area free and those elsewhere unfree. There are only two alternatives — democracy or ♦■error* Man has fought arbitrariness, too long simply to surrender to it. We know what you at home expect of us. We shall try +-0 live up to your expectations. Living in a danger area as you do, we dare not tell you what to do. We shall keep silent about your activities. You run the risks. But we plead with you in your thoughts to preserve the purity of the nation's character even under a regime of insanity. Distinguish between freedom and tyranny, truth and falsehood. In your thoughts remain free. Bring up your children as honest citizens. Teach them the difference between good and evil. As long as the nation’s character is kept intact, everything can be revived. [pageend4]CHARTER 77 ON THE STATE OF THE TRADE UNIONS The following is the abridged text of a letter addressed to the Central Trade Union Council in Prague by the spokesmen for Charter 77. The Ninth Congress of -*-he World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) re-echos iovak Newsletter, Vol. Ill, No. 5/20 (May 1978)1 was held in Prague in April 1978 and adopt- ed important programs. We consider the Universa] Declaration of Trade Union Rights to be the most significant of these. It calls on unions everywhere to enter the lists not only for trade union rights proper but also for civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights as an integral par* of trade union rights. The Central Trade Union Council voted for this and the Revolutionary Trade Union Movement publicized it in Odborář EThe Trade Unionist.] No. 10/78. Some of its provisions are in force even in our country, but other important ones are neither incorporated in our laws and regulations nor applied in practice. We offer some instances where our practice does not accord with the Declaration. Article 26 of the Declaration, for example, says: "States in their constitutions, laws and practices shall guarantee full respect for democratic freedoms and human rights and shall ensure that all enjoy basic individual and collective rights, especially freedom of movement and personal safety, freedom of opinion and expression, freedom of assembly, freedom of information, and trade-union rights.” Many Czechoslovak citizens, most recently those who signed Charter 77, have on frequent occasions cited numerous cases of violating civil rights, particularly the rights to freedom of opinion and expression, freedom of assembly, and freedom of information. Certain Czechoslovak citizens have served terms in jail simply for expressing views different from official ones. Many Czechoslovak citizens have suffered discrimination at work, even though Article 27 requires employers not + o discriminate against employees for union activities or personal opinions and beliefs. Over the last decades tens of thousands of citizens have been dismissed for political reasons and forced into less skilled or menial jobs. This discrimination has even been sanctioned by the organs of the Revolutionary Trade Union Movement which have approved all notices given for political reasons. When local units have withheld such approval, they have been ousted on orders from higher trade union organs. Some units have even been expelled from the movement because of *heir political views and beliefs. Such behavior by the movement contravenes Article 8. The provisions of Article 55 are also important: ’’All organizational methods and measures taken against workers with the aim ... of preparing blacklists, keening workers under surveillance and informing against them are forbidden. Employers' files and official personnel records may contain no information that could be used for any purpose that is not job-related.” It is well known that the cadre records *hat employers keep on employees contain information on their political views, on the a’-tįj-udes of the employees and their relatives, on their religious convictions, activities in political and social orgar.zations, etc. These records go from their school years to their graves. There is no escape from them, yet those to whom they refer may never see them. Surveillance and denunciation are common practice in Czechoslovakia. They are [pageend5]- G - practices required of employees, political, social and union organizations, apartment house superintendents, civic groups, sometimes even friends and colleagues- This is without mentioning State Security whose informers in workplaces and dwelling units keep hundreds of thousands of citizens under surveillance, check their mail and tap their telephones. We have not noticed the Revolutionary Trade Union Movement exercising its right "to participate in the choice of . . . plans for social and democratic development” (in accordance with Article 34), even though many of these plans have been unrealistic and contained too little guarantee of any improvement in the standard of living. Nor have we known of any case where union organs have taken a critical stand on rising prices and demanded a compensatory wage increase. We propose that the Central Trade Union Council should present the following amendments to the laws of Czechoslovakia for adoption by the Federal Parliament of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic: 1) To make the Czechoslovak legal system conform with the international agreements on oolitical, civil, economic, social and cultural rights that have become part of the Czechoslovak legal system by virtue of the government’s ratification of these agreements; to implement Constitutional Law 143/1968 on the Czechoslovak Federation and establish a constitutional court to secure legality in the area of civil rights and freedoms'. 2) To amend the Labor Code to prevent discrimination in employment and the professions and to undo past discrimination. 3) To add to the Czechoslovak legal system provisions that would guarantee that cadre records are used for no purpose that is not job-related. 4) To request the Federal Parliament of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, in its capacity as an organ of control, tO secure consist^? observance of the law and prevent the surveillance and denunciation of workers who have committed no criminal (nonpolitical) ac*. 5) To submit a bill that would give Czechoslovak workers the right k o strike, boycott, +-ake over workplaces, and take part in demonstrations, and would ban reprisals for such acts. We propose *ha+ the Revolutionary Trade Union Movement should amend its statutes and other regulations in order to implement th<= provisions of t|r Universal. Declaration of Trade Union Rights, specifically so: 1) That trade union organizations will always offer all the assistance at their disposal to workers who have suffered discrimination for claiming their individual and collective rights. 2) That union organizations will take part in planning social development, including preventing environmental deterioration, so that all po’-ts nf the Czechoslovak Federation develop in a balanced manner. [pageend6]5) That prices are controlled effectively and wages compensate for price increases. 4) That unions defend the interests of Czechoslovak workers in negotiations on economic integration in supranational associations. Prague, December 18, 1978 Charter spokesmen: Václav Havel Ladislav Hejdánek CONGRESS OF CZECHOSLOVAK FARMERS A congress of Czechoslovak farmers is to take place in Prague on April 9 through 11. In announcing it, Rudé právo, the daily organ of the Central Commit*-ee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, said it would ’’consider the further development of socialist agriculture and life in the countryside,” evaluate past performance, and elect a new union central committee. According to official reports, socialist agriculture has been "very successful,” bu+ Czechoslovakia is still largely dependent on imports, especially of grain and fodder. Self-sufficiency, particularly in the production of grain, has been one of the most elusive goals of Czechoslovakia’s five-year economic plans. Despite rosy reports of last year’s bumper grain harvest, the overall growth of agricultural production was only one and a half percent. Official pronouncements may hold that farmers are one of the pillars of communist society, but the fact of the matter is that in Czechoslovakia farmers for all practical purposes are second-class citizens. After the Union of Czech Farmers and the Union of Slovak Farmers were abolished in the 1950s, farmers were bereft of an organization of their own until 1968. In that year, under the impact of +-he liberalization process, new Czech and Slovak organizations were set up, only to have their activities suppressed after the Soviet invasion of August 1968. This situation is reflected in the preparations under way for the April congress. They are being made not by farmers’ organizations but by the government, and the congress committee is headed not by the leader of a farmers’ organization but by the Federal Minister of Agriculture. Czechoslovakia's communist regime still denies farmers the right 4-0 handle their own affairs through their freely elected representatives. The forthcoming congress is likely simply to underline this point. AUSTRIAN PRESIDENT VISITS PRAGUE Austrian President Rudolf Kirschlager paid an official visit +-o Prague in March. At the conclusion of his talks with Czechoslovak President Gustav Husák, a communique issued on March 14 pledged, among other things, that Austria and Czechoslovakia would [pageend7]- 8 - continue to deal with humanitarian questions in accord with the Helsinki Agreement. Husák and Kirschlager said they expected that next year’s meeting in Madrid to review the results of the Helsinki Agreement would be conducive to progress in security and cooperation in Europe, particularly in the field of disarmament. They agreed that a reduction of armed forces in Central Europe would be a great contribution to peace and security in the continent. During his stay in Prague, the Austrian president paid an unscheduled call on the Primate of Czechoslovakia, Cardinal František Tomášek, whom he invited to visit Austria this summer. President Kirschlager then left for Bratislava, the Slovak capital, where in an interview with a Slovak radio correspondent he reiterated his statement of accord with President Husák on the Helsinki Agreement. A similar statement of accord was made in November 1977 by Austrian Chancellor Bruno Kreisky and Czechoslovak Federal Prime Minister Lubomír Štrougal during the latter’s visit to Vienna. The way the Helsinki Agreement is implemented in the free world, however, is very dissimilar from a communist regime’s interpretation of its human-rights provisions. Evidence of this was contained in a letter sent to President Kirschlager while he was in Prague by Václav Havel, the Czech playwright and a spokesman for the Charter 77 human-rights movement. Havel, who has been under house arrest since last December, urged the Austrian president to bring up the persecution of Czechoslovak human-rights activists during his conversations with Czechoslovakia’s communist leaders and cited a number of specific cases of Czechoslovak dissidents under pressure from the Prague government.
