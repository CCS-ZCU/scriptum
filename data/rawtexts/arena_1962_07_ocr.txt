[pageend2]ARENA LA PARABOLE DE L’HOMME D’AUJOURD’HUI Dans la capitale de toutes les richesses et de toutes les misères, — au cœur du pays où palpitent tant ď aspirations et se révèlent tant de besoins, — dans la cité du labeur et du libertinage, le Solitaire arriva un jour qu’il était descendu de sa montagne altière et tourmentée. Il était venu pour prendre contact lui aussi avec la vie des hommes. Pour reconnaître ses semblables. . . Pour les ajouter à son humanité, forgée là-haut, sur la cime. Et cela, en se prévalant de sa volonté, accumulée dans les instincts et les murmures de ses ancêtres réveillés de leurs songes et de leurs méditations grandioses. Pour aider enfin les hommes qui souffrent et qui cherchent un refuge. Il était venu pour créer autour de lui — et se réaliser lui-même. Dans son humilité, il s’imaginait ignorer beacoup de choses. La science le fascinait. L’amour ľ appelait. . . Les vicissitudes de la lutte ľ attiraient. Et il s’en fut voir le Savant — ľ omniscient — qu’il croyait être le nouveau prêtre de l'époque, de l’esprit, de l’intelligence et du corps. Il désirait obtenir de lui la lumière qui dissipe ľ obscurité, la parole qui oriente, la sécurité suprême enfin. . . Et le Savant le reçut en une chambre qui paraissat construite de livres. Et le Solitaire demanda: “Qu est-ce que l’Humanité?” Et le Savant répondit: “C’est un organisme dont toutes les parties intégrantes doivent s’harmoniser, 1 [pageend3]à l’instar des engrenages d’une machine. Voici...” Et le téméraire Savant sortit d’un rayon de sa bibliothèque, qu i portait ľ inscript ion “Sociologie”, un traité qu’il se mit à lire. . . Et l’Individualiste demanda: “Qu’est-ce que l’individu?” — “C’est l’une des cellules de ľ organisme. Il doit obéir aux impératifs de la Société; il doit se comporter en fourmi laborieuse dans le labyrinthe de la fourmilière; c’est un numéro d’ordre parmi les millions ď anonymes disciplinés. . et d’un autre rayon, étiqueté “Morale”, le vieillard tira un traité, qu’il se mit à lire. . . Et l’Optimiste demanda: “Qu’est-ce que le progrès?” — “Cela n’existe point! L’homme est toujours la inême brute qui extermine ses semblables, qui vole, qui détruit, qui. . .” Et le sceptique Savant prit dans le rayon “Histoire” un traité qu’il se mit à lire. . . Et le Croyant démanda: “Que’est-ce que Dieu?” — “Les religions ont maintenu les peuples dans ľ ignorance ; elles ont noyé la vie dans la nébuleuse du monde de ‘ľ au-delà’. . . Cependant, il existe un seul Dieu: la Raison Pure. . .” Et ľ orgueilleux Savant emprunta à la tablette “Métaphysique” un traité et se mit à le lire. . . Et le Spiritualiste demanda: “Quelle est l’essence de la vie? Qu’est-ce que l’âme?” — “ Ľ Atome. . . l’attraction et la repulsion. . . l’osmose et ľ endosmose. . . Matière! Matière!. . . Notre âme n’est que le produit de l’activité physique. Avec le corps meurt l’esprit. . .” Et, cynique, le Savant amena à lui, du casier “Physique”, un traité qu’il se mit à lire. . . Et le Lutteur demanda: “Qu’est-ce que la lutte des hommes?” 2 [pageend4]— ‘'‘Struggle for life. . . La sélection naturelle. . . le droit du plus fort. . . ľ adaptation au milieu. . Et cruel, le Savant atteignit, sur le rayon “Biologie”, un gros volume orné de nombreuses illustrations. . . Mais celui-qui-se-cherche-soi-même demanda: “Que dois-je faire?” — Tu dois obéir aux règles, ou lois, aux formules consacrées par les Académies et les Parlements, par les Siècles et les Majorités. Apprends, apprends!. . . Donne tous tes efforts pour acquérir un diplôme. Diplôme de sagesse, d’intelligence, de conformisme. Le Diplôme! Ultime épreuve et suprême récompense!” Et, ironiquement, ľ Omniscient lui montra, suspendus tout autour de sa bibliothèque, une douzaine de diplômes qu’il avait conquis de haute lutte. Et ľ Homme, frappé d’horreur, contemplait le Savant. Seulement pour quelques instants. Son épouvante ne tarda pas à être dominée par l’énergie de sa volonté. Par la fermeté avec laquelle il considérait son unité, qu’il avait rencontré, creusant au fond de lui-même, là-haut, sur la cime — la vérité que la Nature, ľ eternelle harmonie universelle avait confirmée — illuminait sa réalité intérieure. Et lui, l’Homme, se sentait revigorisé par toutes les forces de la vie, que les monstres de ľ Abstraction, les “fatalités” artificielles ne peuvent pas altérer. Et le Solitaire regardait fixement le Savant: l’ardente intuition traversait de part en part le dogme glacial. . . Et le Savant commençait à éprouver le sentiment que la puissance créatrice pénétrait, à la manière d’ondes immenses, les rocs stériles du fanatisme. . . Cela, malgré qu il fut encore possédé de suffisante audace pour les affronter: — “Quoi, qu’est-ce? Ne me crois-tu pas? Ne ť in3 [pageend5]clineras-tu pas devant la vérité reconnue par les Académies, certifié par les Parlements, par. . .” En cet instant, Celui-qui-aimait-les-semblables sourit avec tendresse. . . — “Qu’est-ce? Oserais-tu mépriser la civilisation forgée grâce « la science?” Alors, le Silencieux fronça le sourcil. Son silence parlait, mais l’autre ne ľ entendait pas. — “Parle donc! Expose tes opinions. . .” Du silence, rien que du silence. . . Et l’humanité du Silencieux se déversait pour ses regards, par sa respiration. Et sur son front le sillon de la pensée vitale se creusait verticalement; et ľ amertume de l’amour incompris crispait ses lèvres. . . Et ses doigts tremblaient: ils voulaient consoler ce frère qui avait épuisé son humanité en devenant ľ Omniscient. Mais devant ce geste ď affection, le vieillard s’écarta rapidement: — “Un fou! un fou! C’est un fou!” s’écria-t-il, et il appela la Société à son aide. Malgré cela, le Solitaire insistait: — “Frère! Ne sens-tu pas mon amour? Pourquoi ne consens-tu pas à ce que la lumière de ma conscience s’unisse à la lumière de ta connaissance?” — “Un fou! un fou! C’est un fou!” Mais Celui-qui-savait-supporter insistait encore: — “Frère! Ne sens-tu-pas que la vérité de mon cœur peut se mettre d’accord avec la vérité de ton cerveau? Mon impétuosité avec ta prudence?. . .” — “Un fou! Un fou! Au secours!” Pourtant, le Jeune Homme revenait à la charge: — “Frère! Ne sens-tu-pas que le monde renaît, après ce déluge de sang?. . . Que l’esprit a brisé la matière?. . . Que le centre du monde se trouve en chaque homme?. . . Qu’il ne reste à Vidée qu’à se traduire en faits?. . . Que toutes choses doivent de4 [pageend6]venir vivantes?. . . Qu’en chaque individu réside un Dieu qui attend de se révéler à celui qui le cherche?” —■ “Au secours! Au secours!” clamait le vieillard de toutes ses forces. Et la Société accourut à son appel. Il aurait voulu qu’on liât le dément. Mais l’Homme s’y opposa, avec un geste de mansuétude infinie et, les yeux remplis de larmes par la douleur, il quitta la sacro-sainte bibliothèque, la pharmacie de la Raison Pure, qu’ emplisaiemt les remèdes les plus miraculeux qui soient. Et il s’enfonça alors dans l’océan de la vie, avec ses abîmes et ses phares. Le Solitaire descendit parmi les hommes. Il portait en lui le monde qu’il s’était crée là-haut, sur la montagne. Et il se mit a lutter parmi les hommes qui cherchaient en vain leur rédemption dans la vaine querelle des apparences. . . Il voulait leur démontrer la première des réalités: celle de l’esprit; et la première des connaissances: celle de se connaître soi-même. . . . . . Depuis lors et sans trêve, il lutte et il travaille. Il croit en lui-même et en ses frères que la cécité en- ténèbre. Il dame sa vérité et porte ses actes — le lourd tribut de son existence — sous les éternelles harmonies de l’univers. . . Il travaille, travaille, travaille. . . Et il ne se demande pas s’il parviendra au bout ou s’il triomphera. . . Cependant, un moment suivant l’autre, un geste suivant l’autre, une parole suivant l’autre, il réalise peu à peu son idéal. Son idéal qui grandit, pareil à un être qui se développerait au dedans de son propre corps. . . A travers de cet idéal, il vit dès à présent le lumineux avenir de tous les hommes qui ont vaincu en eux la sanglante sauvagerie et qui aspirent à se surpasser eux-mêmes, en route vers une perfection toujours plus lucide et toujours plus aimante. EUGEN RELGIS 5 [pageend7]PEN IN EXILE Hungarians PAUL TABORI THE SIX WAVES Between the two world wars and long before Franco, Spain discovered a brilliant new playwright. His name was Lorenzo Azertis—a fine Iberian name. But in reality it hid a defiant pun. It was the nom de plume of a Hungarian called Lóránt Orbók who combined the two Magyar words azért is into the Spanish-sounding pseudonym. The words meant: “in spite of’’ or “in defiance of all.’’ Azertis or Orbók died young but his name and his fate symbolized the attitude of scores of Hungarians who defied the world and the handicap of their isolated, infinitely rich and beautiful language and became exiles—self-chosen or driven by economic and political pressures. Like waves breaking on a rocky shore or hurtling far inland, literary emigration battered at the coastline of world literature, made its impact or was lost tracelessly in the sands. All small nations have to brag, a Finnish professor told me once, in order to be noticed. Indeed, in Hungary we had philologists of the “mirage’’ school who maintained, in all seriousness, that both Adam and Eve were Hungarians. This is going a good bit further than even my friend George Mikes in his celebrated thesis that everybody is a Hungarian—or can be turned into one. The Hollywood jokes, still current, bear this out—“my parents were poor but Hungarian,’’ the typical success-story is supposed to begin; or “it isn’t enough 6 [pageend8]to be Hungarian, you gotta have a third act, too. . ; or, bitterly: “if you have a Hungarian friend, you don’t need an enemy.” Hungary has always produced far too many artists, scientists, composers and writers. There was the standing threat of “forty thousand secret dramatists marching on the National Theatre”—and for a small country the newspapers, the literary magazines, the publishers were surprisingly numerous and ambitious. There was, however, just not enough newsprint, there were not enough readers or playgoers for the plethora of talent. And so, quite apart from any political exigencies, writers and artists became emigrants if not émigrés; just as the feudal system of huge estates and entails drove almost a million Hungarians overseas in the years when the vast empty spaces of the United States were filling up. The continent which—so the somewhat sanguine historians maintain—was named after the son of Hungary’s first king; for, so say, Amerigo Vespucci’s father chose for his son the Italianized version of Imre or Emery, the name of the saintly youth canonized soon after his death in the eleventh century. There was a young Hungarian lost in one of the early expeditions to the North American shores ; and a sixteenth century Hungarian poet, Bálint Balassi (1554-1594) was not the first to taste the bitterness of exile of which he sang: When autumn dews are done, Across the waning sun November winds come blowing. They snatch the falling leaves, Across the bitter eves Their yellow fragments strowing. Soon where I walk today Along the greenwood way Strides winter with its snowing. [pageend9]Balassi’s exile was at least in fraternal Poland whence he returned to fight, the Turk and die in a siege. Others, especially Protestants, chose voluntary and temporary exile to study in Italy, at Wittem- berg, Geneva, or Cracow. The first wave of exile was that of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century, connected with the repeated and tragically unsuccessful revolts against Habsburg rule, led by Imre Thököly and Prince Ferenc Rákóczi. Pál Köszeghy (secretary of Rákóczi’s principal supporter, Count Miklos Ber- csényi) and Pál Ráday became poets in exile though neither of them a major figure ; but the letters of Kelemen Mikes, Rákóczi’s “scribe”, written to a fictitious aunt from the shores of the Sea of Marmora, are a classic of Hungarian literature, the very essence of nostalgic exile. Though in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century a number of Hungarian writers suffered persecution, imprisonment and other hardship at the hands of the Habsburg rulers, there were no important exiles. The second wave began with the crushing of the 1848-49 Hungarian War of Independence, led by the towering figure of Lajos Kossuth. Writers were in the vanguard of this national rising. Sándor Petöfi, Hungary’s greatest poet, died under Cossack lances on the battlefield of Segesvár. Maurus Jókai, who has been called with full justification the Hungarian Walter Scott awl the Hungarian Charles Dickens, spent many months a hunted, homeless wanderer within his own country. Those who fled, spent varied periods in exile. They included Baron Miklós Jósika, a novelist of considerable achievement who settled in Brussels and took an active part in the ambitious and tenacious schemes of Kossuth to regain Hungarian independence; and the poet Fri- 8 [pageend10]gyes Kerényi who, after two years of bitter struggles, committed suicide in the United States in 1852 and to whom Mihály Tompa, the sensitive and eloquent poet addressed his famous: “Letter to an exile friend”, chiding him for leaving his land of birth “the holiest of all mothers” in her “hours of hardship, like a thankless child. . .” Kossuth himself, after triumphant but in the final outcome unsuccessful visits to England and the United States, settled down in Turin to almost forty years of exile, growing into a major political writer whose plans for a Danube Confederation were the first practical signposts towards the United States of Europe—a dream that is slowly, painfully and partially shaping into reality in our own days. There were many minor figures among the literary exiles of 1849. Nandor Eber became one of the most outstanding foreign correspondents of The Times, combining journalism with fighting in Thessaly under Fuad Pasha, covering the Crimean War, taking part in the Sicilian campaign of Garibaldi’s Red Shirts. Baron Cézar Mednyánszky, a strange Byronic figure who was a field chaplain in the revolutionary war, became a gold-digger in Australia and ended his own life in the South of France, leaving a striking and moving autobiography. A few years later, still under the absolutist Habsburg regime, Baron Bódog Orczy left Hungary, disillusioned and unhappy, to settle in England. His daughter, though she married an English officer, kept her maiden name for her colourful tales of adventures and intrigue— among them the famous “Scarlet Pimpernel” stories and “The Emperor’s Candlesticks”. The third wave followed the collapse of the shortlived double revolution of October 1918 and March 1919. The first was liberal-socialist and led by Count Mihály Károlyi ; the second Communist and headed 9 [pageend11]intelligence (or luck) to realise that sooner or later they would engulf Hungary. The list is a considerably one and includes Hungarian exiles in almost every AV estern country. A few of them returned after the war but most of them decided that a red dictatorship was in no way preferable to a brown one. Ferenc Körmendi whose “Adventure in Budapest” won an important international prize, followed this book with a whole series of impressive novels; he spent the war in England, working for the B.B.C. and now lives in Washington. Yolanda Földes whose novel “The Street of the Fishing Cat” also gained a great international prize, published several striking novels and volumes of short stories (“Heads or Tails”, “Golden Earrings”, “I’ll Make You a Good Wife”, “Moving Freely” were some of them) but elected to withdraw from literature some years ago; she still lives in England. Arthur Koestler left Hungary in the early twenties and has never written in Hungarian; yet the author of “Darkness at Noon”, “The Yogi and the Commissar”, “Arrival and Departure” and a whole series of provocative and widely translated novels, sociological, political and philosophical studies, is still conscious of his origin and has befriended many of his Hungarian colleagues. Two other Hungarian writers have never used their mother tongue: Peter de Polnay, a most prolific novelist and biographer, with a tart, cosmopolitan flavour of his own and Hans Habe (János Békessy) whose “Ilona” is only the most recent of an oeuvre that, including his various pen-names, would fill a three- foot shelf. Both Polnay and Habe, by the way, have fought in the French Army in the Second World War. The late nineteen-thirties vague included George Mikes whose immensely popular “How to be an alien” and other ironic examinations of countries 12 [pageend12]and peoples prove that he has achieved the almost impossible task: becoming a first-rate humorist in English; Sári Megyery whose novels written in French have earned well-merited recognition ; Laszlo Dormándi who also settled in Paris and proved a sensitive, prolific novelist; László Javor, poet, musician and painter who fought in the French Resistance, was severaly wounded and published two volumes of poetry in Hungarian. Among those who reached the United States was Ferenc Molnar, ecrtainly the most accomplished and international of all Hungarian playwrights whose “Liliom”, “Olympia”, “The Guardsman”, “The Play’s the Thing” and a score of others have delighted millions both on the stage and in the cinema. Before his death in .1952 in New York he wrote a moving book called “Companion in Exile” which was both a tribute to a remarkable woman and a deeply- felt analysis of the homeless creative artist. Melchior Lengyel whose “Ninotchka” gave Garbo her most popular vehicle, is also known as the author of such widely performed plays as “Typhoon”, “The Czarina” (with Lajos Biró) and the libretto of Bartók’s “Miraculous Mandarin”. Today Mr. Lengyel lives once again in Europe, the doyen of the Hungarian exile writers. In Hollywood most of the Hungarian writing colony seemed to consist of “Lászlós”. They included László Vadnay, a brilliant comic talent not entirely fulfilled; László Fodor who now works in Western Germany; Aladár László and Miklos László, both popular screenwriters; László Bus-Fekete, playwright and author of many movies—and literally dozens of others. Together with Hungarian producers, directors and actors they are said to have 13 [pageend13]added a welcome touch of paprika to the international flavour of the movie capital. A good many other names could be added to our fourth wave but such a list could easily degenerate into a mere catalogue. The fifth wave was of those writers who left Hungary either immediately after the last war or just before the Iron Curtain clamped down and the Communist dictatorship of Rákosi was established. Some of them had become involved in Nazi politics and committed themselves to beliefs and actions which no talent can balance or excuse. These included writers of such undeniable talent as József Nyiro, the Transylvanian novelist who died in Spain ; Albert Wass, Zoltán Szitnyai and János Vaszary (not to be confused with his brother, Gábor Vaszary who has created his own Vie de la Bohème in a series of impudently witty and generously sexy books and who has always been an uncompromising anti-Nazi.) Still others chose exile not because they were compromised but because they were equally opposed to Fascism and Communism. László Cs. Szabó, a poet, essayist and short story writer of immense erudition and great stylistic gifts, settled in London after an interval in Italy and Germany. Christine Arnothy whose first book “I am 15 and I do not want to die” was an instant success, has become a well-established French authoress with a charming inventiveness of her own. Lajos Zilahy, the great novelist and playwright whose “The Dukays” and “Angry Angel” were international best-sellers only a few years ago, lives in the United States; so does Sándor Márai, one of the most sensitive stylists and psychologists of the Hungarian novel who has also written several successful stage plays. Szabolcs Vajay, essayist, novelist and short story writer, spent many years in 14 [pageend14]South America and is now working for UNESCO in Paris. Among those in Latin America Paul Rónai, an indefatigable translator of Hungarian poetry and prose into Portuguese, a great Balzac-scholar, essayist and philologist, lives in Rio de Janeiro. Elizabeth Balla, whose short stories and poems mirror the tragedy of Central European Jewry with great sincerity and force, resides in Buenos Aires. Dr. Alexander Lenard has achieved world-fame with his brilliant Latin translation of A. A. Milne’s “Winnie the Pooh”; lie found a home in Brazil. Again, one could fill several pages with names and works; but already the sixth and final wave is hammering at the door. These are the most recent arrivals, the refugees of the 1956 Revolution ; and it was a truly tidal wave, involving more than 200,000 people, that swept them from Hungary. Most of these writers were ex-Communists whose “god had failed”. The majority of them had spent long years in prison, had been tortured and foced to sign confessions. Of the ex “jail-birds” George Pálóczi Horváth achieved the widest international success. His autobiography “The Undefeated” won both the Atlantic Monthly Prize in the United States and the Prix de la Liberté in France. His biographies of Khrushchev and Miao were (or are being) published in more than a dozen languages. He lives in London. So does George Faludy, a life-long Socialist, the Hungarian translator of Villon and a brilliantly versatile poet whose collected poems “Memorial of the Red Byzantium” were published in exile. His long autobiography “My Happy Days in Hell” is scheduled for early publication in England. Paul Ignotus a critic and essayist, published his “Prison Poems” in Hungarian and his “Political 15 [pageend15]Prisoner” in English, since his escape. Endre Enczi, novelist and essayist who is now co-editing the free Hungarian fortnightly “Irodalmi Ujság” in Paris, spent some years in Canada before returning to Europe. Tibor Dénes who writes supple, almost Cartesian French and has published several novels and volumes of short stories beside scholarly historical works, is a resident of Geneva. But there is hardly a country or a capital which does not have its quota of Hungarian exile writers. Victor Határ, whose rich Joycean invocations of a very private imagery have a sonorous power of their own, has settled in London— a novel of his is soon to be published in French; so has Béla Szasz, an essayist and novelist, who spent many years in South America. Ernest Halász, journalist, short story writer and essayist, has lived in Zurich and Berne for the past fifteen years. István Békeffy, a prolific author of films and plays, spends most of his time in Germany; Alexander Ujváry is not only a writer of novels, short stories and nonfiction books but also a publisher and printer in Munich. The Hungarian colony in Austria includes Georg Sebestyéii, novelist and essayist, until recently editor of “Magyar Hirado”, a bright weekly paper; Georg Molnár whose “Ara Hungarica” has become a centre for Hungarian artists, poets and writers and who has published several attractive volumes of prose and poetry; Gyula Klamár, essayist and political writer and several others. István Vajda’s novel “The Accident”, published in French, has shown remarkable powers of character-drawing, he is also a short-story writer of great originality; Péter Halasz’s “Tartars in Széna Square” was published recently in Hungarian in New York. Among those who did not suffer physical persecution yet chose exile, the most notable are Tamás 16 [pageend16]Aezél and Tibor Méray, both winners of important Communist literary prizes (Aezél was a Stalin Prize laureate) who had become deeply disillusioned by Stalinism. These two, in collaboration and individually, produced a number of works in the free world providing remarkable insight into Communist cultural and intellectual life. Aezél lives in London; Méray is a resident of France. Albert Vajda and Dénes Kovács who had formed in Hungary the humorist team of “Vayko” had also avoided prison but found that satire was a dangerous trade in Hungary. In the West they published a hilarious book called “How to be a Communist’’. Vajda, a prolific writer, has also written a tragi-comic account of an accident that led to the loss of his sight (to be published both in England and the United States and translated into several languages), a satirical novel and is editing a flourishing comic paper in Hungarian called “Fa- kutya” (Wooden Dog). Dénes Kovacs has just finished an autobiographical novel called “Almost”. The list is almost endless—and a good many names must be omitted for sheer lack of space. While it would be stupid to deny that the most important Hungarian writers still live behind the Iron Curtain, it is equally certain that Hungarian literature in exile is vigorous, many-voiced and has made a respectable contribution to world literature. And above all, whatever their political beliefs, their quarrels and arguments, their conceptions of the exiles’ responsibilities, these writers are enjoying the freedom which their friends and colleagues in Communist Hungary are sadly and persistently denied. 17 [pageend17]FERENC MOLNÁR BEDTIME STORY Shortly before Ferenc Molnar died in a New York hospital in April 1952, he sent the following story to the editor of Az Ember, a free Hungarian weekly celebrating its silver jubilee. He added a few lines as an introduction and we feel that these are essential to the appreciation of what is one of the great short stories of world literature. The original title, by the way, is ‘Lullaby Story’ in the literal translation. . . . I am sending you a piece of my antique collection, a so-called fantastic story which I wrote almost fifty years ago. There are two reasons why I send you this ‘Bedtime Story’. First because, in a manner of speaking, it is close to me: it served as a basis for my play ‘Liliom’. Secondly because in Hungarian it can be now considered a rarity. The book of which it formed a part has been burned, banned, excommunicated and banished before 1945 ; some of the surviving copies, hiding underground in Hungary, have been burned, banned, excommunicated and banished (together with all my other works) a short time ago—for the second time. In the original text the story was prefaced by the following lines: “This fairy story is designed for widows to put their small children to sleep with—or for good children to use as lullabies for their old and tired parents. It has to be told nicely, quietly and fluently; the beginning in a lively manner as if it were true; the end more slowly and softly so that by the time it ends, its listeners should have fallen asleep.” 18 [pageend18]I In tlie Town Park, in one of the booths, there was a strange man. His name was Závoczki. This Zá- voezki was a real scoundrel, insulting everybody, beating up many, some he even stabbed with a knife, he was a thief, a trickster, a robber—but in spite of it all he was a very kind man and his wife loved him deeply. Because his wife was a simple little slavey who had served some J ews at the age of seventeen and then, one Sunday, when she had the day off, she met Závoczki in the Town Park. He was wearing a two- tone pair of trousers, one leg red, the other yellow. There was a chicken-feather in his hair, tied to a string, the end of the string was reaching into his pocket and Závoczki kept on pulling at it so that the chicken-feather bobbed up and down on his head. Everybody laughed a lot about this and the prettiest servant girls patronised always the roundabout in front of which Závoczki was clowning. It was here that the simple little slavey met Závoczki and she stayed with him all day; though she should have been home by ten, she didn’t even leave at eleven, she stayed in the Town Park all night. And next day she no longer dared to go home. She stayed with the boy with the chicken-feather in his hair, she never went into service again and she was so> good and so gentle and such a pretty little slavey that Závoczki took her to the registry office and married her. This man was the biggest scoundrel in the whole Town Park. For a while he was a barker outside a booth, then he lived for months by cheating at cards. Whenever he stole something, he wouldn’t go to work as long as the stolen money lasted. Sometimes he was locked up for a few days and at such times his wife cried all day and all night and though 19 [pageend19]she knew that he couldn’t come from jail, she still made up his bed every night so that it would look as if he would be back any moment. And Závoczki was cheeky even in jail—and for this he was put into solitary. On such occasions he cried bitterly, poor man, and kept on saying: how miserable I am! There was no money at home and Závoczki was ashamed that he had no money. His heart ached because the pretty, pale little slavey had to eat a crust of bread for dinner—but in order that she shouldn’t find out about his heart-ache, he shouted at her angrily: “You’re wasting all the money I make, you so- and-so !” And the pale little slavey would look at him sadly and almost cried. And Závoczki lifted his fist: “Don’t you dare to cry. . . or I’ll break every bone in your body!” Then he walked out, slamming the door, hid in the courtyard and wept all night bitterly. The pale girl didn’t even dare to cry when she was alone because he with the feather in his hair had forbidden her to and because women know how to keep back their tears. That’s how it was. And all day long they were thinking of each other and Závoczki didn’t say a word about this. On such occasions he usually beat up the janitor and stabbed a little a policeman from the back and ran away. Because he was a man of sudden, violent rages, a totally dissolute fellow who had long matured for the hangman’s rope. One Saturday it was raining and Závoczki sat on the edge of a ditch behind Hermina Road with another n’er-do-well. They were playing cards in the rain. It was getting dark and they could barely see the cards —in any case, the rain had washed off their garish markings. This wouldn’t have bothered Závoczki, to 20 [pageend20]tell tlie truth, because he could tell the cards from their backs—but the other gentleman decided that he would stop the game. “Thank you, mister,” he said and climbed from the ditch. “That’s bad manners!” cried Závoczki. “Though I cheated, you won all my money, the three bits I had. Come on, let’s play!” But the other man invoked the rain and that it was almost night and said he would be glad to give him another chance tomorrow; then he ran away, swifter than an arrow. His bare feet slapped along in the mud. Now Závoczki took the kitchen knife from his coat and walked past Francia Road to the embankment of the Royal Hungarian State Railways. That’s where Mr. Linzman, the cashier of the tannery used to pass, carrying the pay-packets every Saturday evening to the workers. He slipped down along the embankment of the Royal Hungarian State Railways and waited for Mr. Linzman so that he could stab him and take the money from him. But he waited in vain. He realized that he was too late. Mr. Linzman had already delivered the money at the tannery—nay, he even returned to town with his empty satchel. Gambling is an accursed passion, indeed. One is apt to miss one’s most important business appointments because of it. And now Závoczki climbed up on the embankment of the Royal Hungarian State Railways, two teardrops rolled down his grimy face, he suddenly grew pale, then he smiled and cried: “Julia Zeller! Julia Zeller!” because this was his wife’s name; he grabbed the kitchen-knife with both hands and plunged it into his heart. He died then immediately, rolling from the embankment of the Royal Hungarian State 21 [pageend21]Railways, there was a dirty pack of cards in his pocket and three white hone balls which he needed for juggling, the chicken-feather in his hair and the name of the gentle little servant-girl on his lips: “Julia Zeller! Julia Zeller!” II Závoczki was buried in a ditch and there was no question at all of the Archbishop-Primate of Hunga- ry preaching a funeral sermon over his grave. But his wife was there, in a black dress which she sewed herself during the night. Everybody offered consolation in the house to the white-faced Julia, telling her: “the grace of God is great for He frees tormented little servant-girls from their tormentors, you are still young, dearie, God rest his soul, but it’s better like this, God is kind, you’re still young.” And Julia kept nodding, agreeing with the neighbours with her sad eyes, she even said: “Thank you, missis janitress, you’re very kind to me, Mrs. Braun, thank you, Mrs. Braun, thank you Mrs. Stufenberg, everybody’s very kind to me, thank you Mrs. Braun.” Even more, she also said: “You’re right, Mr. Inspector, it’s much better this way, God rest the departed.” For Julia was ashamed in front of the police that such a scoundrel as Závoczki should be loved by her even beyond the grave, without any cause, which was really something to be ashamed of. And already on the day after the funeral she started to sew the baby clothes because next month she expected her child to be born. As for Závoczki, they put him in the afternoon into the pauper’s grave but he only remained there until evening. Those who know the rules, also know that every evening the green wagon appears at the police 22 [pageend22]\ station and takes those whom the policemen had di- \ ligently collected all day to the detention barracks. i Tn the same way every night a big green wagon \ conies to' the cemetery to take away all the scoundrels who killed themselves with their own hands. These do not go straight to hell because first they go to, pur- Igatory. There their case is examined, the troubles are 'gone into. Many of them even end up in heaven. So Závoczki got into the green wagon, together with the others, the big knife sticking from his heart. Beside him there sat a wet man and he was wet because he had drowned himself in the Danube. Opposite them was a woman with a rope around her neck. This was a poor woman who had hanged herself. With the others, nothing showed. These had small bullets inside them which they put into their bodies. And the wagon rolled with them. It rolled on to the avenue, then turned towards the prison in the dark night. It rolled on and on until it started to get light. Suddenly the horses began to speed up, changing to a wild gallop. Závoczki glanced through a hole and saw that the wagon was hurtling down along a very broad road into a valley filled with a pink mist. Now the wagon was flying, the wheels turned in the air, cities and villages passed below but all this no longer hurt Závoczki because the knife in his heart was just to prevent anything hurting him any more. Then they stopped. They got out of the wagon one by one and the policemen escorted them into a big office. The}7 had to wait in an anteroom where smoking was forbidden and many were spitting and there was still a smell of smoke. Then an office messenger with spectacles came out and called them one by one. Finally it was Závoczki’s turn. “What’s your name?’’ asked the official, without 23 [pageend23]looking up from the big sheet on which he was filling out the various sections. “Endre Závoczki.” “Age?” “Thirty-two.” “Place of birth?” Závoczki did not answer this. The official still did not look at him. He said: I “Place of birth? Unknown?” Závoczki nodded. Now the official looked at him:1 “You have the right to go back for a day if you forgot something in life. Those who died in the regular way, do not have to go back, because they left nothing behind. But those who commit suicide, their death is irregular, so they sometimes forget something and thereby cause suffering on earth. Answer me.” And he looked at him severely as one looks at suicides. Závoczki replied: “I forgot to wait for my unborn child. Later I regretted that I hadn’t waited for it as I would have liked to see it but now it is too late. This is very sad but I am a man and once I have left, I’d rather stay here, thank you very much.” He puffed out- his chest proudly, looking defiantly into the official’s eyes and his own eyes shone as brightly as the kitchen-knife sticking from his heart. “Throw him into a dungeon, the heartless scoundrel!” shouted the official and the policemen grabbed Závoczki and dragged him away and Závoczki, with the knife in his heart, kept on laughing at them all the way and shook his head, saying: “You’re dirty cops, you’re no-good parasites, flat-feet, lazy no-good filth you are!” Thereupon the policemen kicked him hard while 24 [pageend24]one of them held the handle of the knife that it shouldn’t fall from his heart. III , Závoczki sat around for sixteen years in the Purgatory fire. It is a great lie that this fire burns. The Purgatory fire is nothing but a very strong pink light in which one must sit for many long years until it draws the bad qualities from a man. In time Závoczki became used to the light and felt that he had become greatly purified by it. Now he was already making all kinds of plans because his heart was cleansed and he would have liked to see his child of whom he didn’t even know whether it was a boy or a girl. Therefore when one day the Inspector walked through the pink fire and asked everybody whether he had any complaints against the personnel, Závoczki asked permission to speak. “Please, sir,” he said, “do I still have the right to go back for one day because I forgot something?” “You have,” said the Inspector gently because with those who sat such a long time in purgatory, they spoke in a more polite tone. “Just report to me.” Závoczki reported the very next day. The Inspector gave him a little slip of paper which said that he had been granted leave for twenty-four hours. Then he was taken down into the cellar and the knife was pulled from his heart. He was given a cloakroom ticket for it which he had to put in his pocket. Then he set out, nice and slow, walking, until he reached the jute-factory at Ujpest. There he enquired courteously where the widow Závoczki—who worked at the factory—lived. They told him the address and he set out again. His wife lived in a small workers’ house—the kind 25 [pageend25]of which there were always six in a row, all exactly the same. It was Sunday morning and the sun was shining. She was still the same little white-faced servant-girl, only she had grown a bit older. Závoczki saw her because she sat in the window on thp ground floor, sewing. Two pots of ordinary red flowers stood in the window and behind the flowers hung a little curtain. But beside the curtain there was enough space so that he could see her. Her face was gentle and serious. Závoczki knocked on the door. At his knock the door opened and a young girl stepped out. She was about sixteen and he recognized her at once as his daughter. The girl asked in a severe tone: “What do you want?” With his left hand Závoczki covered the place of his heart so that the girl shouldn’t see the torn jacket where he had stabbed himself. Then he felt that now he could go back for he had seen his daughter. But he had to say something because the girl bad asked him what he wanted. So, with his right, he reached into his pocket to pull out the three white bone balls which he could juggle with such devilish skill. “Well. . .” he said, “I can do all kinds of funny things. . .” And he grinned so that he could see his daughter laugh. But the girl did not laugh. She was a strict and serious girl like her mother. She said: “Go away. . .” And she reached for the doorknob to shut the door in the face of this beggarly fellow. She had a small, white hand with delicate fingers. In this moment Závoczki was flooded by all the anger which the fire had quenched in him in sixteen years. Like an oceanflood, bitterness rose in him. And he slapped the 26 [pageend26]white hand which had reached out to slam the door for ever in front of him. The girl looked at him, then reached out again and closed the door. The key turned in the lock, Závoczki was left outside. Now his anger ebbed and he felt terribly ashamed for having hit his child. He looked around in embarrassment and he felt that his pierced heart began to smart. So he started back, in a hurry. He hardly knew where he was going. But dead men can only go in one direction, back into death. It was late night by the time he arrived back at the big house whence he had started. There they already knew everything. The porter grinned at him from his lodge. He let his head hang and went silently upstairs where he had to report. The inspector was already waiting for him. They took his cloakroom ticket and pressed his knife into his hand. They shouted at him: “You’re the dirtiest scoundrel in the world! You go back from the Other World to slap your child!’’ He did not say a word. The knife was put back into his heart, then he heaved a big sigh. Then they took him, put him on a small iron trolley and rolled him down into hell. From the pink fire Závoczki rolled into the red fire where he was to boil and scream with pain for all eternity. That’s what happened to Závoczki. His little daughter went into the room to her mother. “There was a ragged man here,” she said. “He was grinning in a very ugly way, so I wanted to slam the door on him. There was a terrible fire in his eyes. His eyes wept, his face laughed. So I wanted to slam the door and he slapped my hand. He slapped me hard, it sounded quite loud.” The woman looked at the floor as if searching for 27 [pageend27]something. And she asked in a trembling voice: “And then?” “And then he left. And I’m still trembling. He hit me hard but it didn’t hurt. As if someone had touched me softly. The touch of his horny, rough hand was like the touch of lips—or touching somebody’s heart.” “I know,” the woman said very softly and went on sewing. And they never talked again about the whole thing and they lived until they died and here the fairy tale is ended. Sleep, my little girl. Translated by Paul Tabori LAJOS ZILAHY BUT FOR THIS He did not wash his hands, grimy with varnish, just wiped them with the rag hanging from a nail on the door. Then he took off his green carpenter’s apron and brushed the saw-dust from his trousers. He put on his hat and before he left the workshop, said to the old carpenter who stood with his back to him, stirring a pot of glue, in an unusually tired tone: “Good night.” Since early morning some unfamiliar sensation had shivered in him. He had no appetite and sometimes the plane stopped in his hand and he had to close his eyes for a few seconds. He went home and tried to eat his dinner. He was a lodger in a small, poorly furnished room in the home 28 [pageend28]of an old widow, a certain Mrs. Borka. Before she let it to him, she used it for storing fire-wood. That night—on the fourth day of October, 1874—at a quarter past one in the morning, the journeyman carpenter, John Kovacs, died. He was a soft-spoken, sallow-faced man, with sagging shoulders and a rusty mustache. He died at the age of thirty-five. Two days later, they buried him. He left no wife, nor child behind, no one but a cook living in Budapest in the service of a bank president, by the name of Torday. She was John Kovacs’ cousin Five years later, the old carpenter in whose shop he had worked, died, and nine years later death took the old woman in whose shed he had lived. Fourteen years later, Torday’s cook, John Kovacs’ cousin died. Twenty-one months later—in the month of March of 1895—in a pub at the end of Kerepesi-ut, cabbies sat around a red clothed table drinking wine. It was late in the night, it must have been three o’clock. They sprawled with their elbows on the table, shaking with raucous Laughter. Clouds of thick smoke from vile cigars curled around them. They recalled the days of their military service. One of them, a big, ruddy-faced, double-chinned coachman whom they called Fritz, was saying: “Once my friend, the corporal, made a recruit stick his head into the stove. . And at this point he was seized by a violent fit of laughter as he banged the table with the palm of his hand. “Jeez!” he roared. The veins swelled on his neck and temples and for 29 [pageend29]many seconds lie choked, twitched and shook with convulsive laughter. When he finally calmed down he continued, interrupting himself with repeated guffaws. “He made him stick his head into the stove and in there he made him shout one hundred times Herr Zwgsfierer, ich melde gehorsammst. . . poor chump, there he was on all fours and we paddled his behind till the skin almost split on our fingers.” Again he stopped to get over another laughting spell. Then he turned to one of the men. “Do you remember, Franzi?” Franzi nodded. The big fellow’ put his hand to his forehead. “Now. . . what was the fellow’s name. . . ?” Franzi thought for a moment and then said: “Ah. . . a. .. Kovacs. . . John Kovacs.” That was the last time ever a human voice spoke the name of John Kovacs. On November the tenth, in 1899, a woman suffering from heart disease was carried from the 0 Buda Tobacco Factory to St. John’s Hospital. She must have been about forty-five years old. They put her on the first floor in ward number 3. She lay there on the bed, quiet and terrified ; she knew she was going to die. It was dark in the ward, the rest of the patients w-ere already asleep ; only a wick sputtered in a small blue oil lamp. Her eyes staring wide into the dim light, the woman reflected upon her life. She remembered a summer night in the country, and a gentle-eyed young man, with whom—their fingers linked—she was romancing and roaming over the heavy scented fields and through whom that might she became a woman. That young man was John Kovacs and his face, his 30 [pageend30]voice, tlie glance of his eyes had now returned for the last time. But this time his name was not spoken, only in the mind of this dying woman did he silently appear for a few moments. The following year a fire destroyed the Calvinist rectory and its dusty records that contained the particulars and facts of the birth and death of John Kovacs. In January, 1901, the winter was hard. Toward evening- in the dark a man dressed in rags climbed furtively over the ditch that fenced in the village cemetery. He stole two wooden crosses to build a fire. One of the crosses had marked the grave of John Kovacs. Again two decades passed. In 1920, in Kecskemet, a young lawyer sat at his desk making an inventory of his father’s estate. He opened every drawer and looked carefully through every scrap of paper. On one was written: “Received 4 Florins, 60 kraj- cars. The price of two chairs polished respectfully Kovacs John.” The lawyer glanced over the paper, crumpled it in his hand and threw it into the wastepaper basket. The following day the maid took out the basket and emptied its contents in the far end of the courtyard. Three days later it rained. The crumpled paper soaked through and only this much remained on it: “Kova, . J. . .” The rain had washed away the rest; the letter “J” was hardly legible. These last letters were the last lines, the last speck of matter that remained of John Kovacs. 31 [pageend31]A few weeks later the sky rumbled and the rain poured down as though emptied from buckets. On that afternoon the rain washed away the remaning letters. The letter “v” resisted longest, because there were the line curves in the “v”, John Kovacs had pressed on his pen. Then the rain washed that away too. And in that instant—forty-nine years after his death—the life of the journeyman carpenter ceased to exist and forever disappeared from this earth. . . But for this. . . GEORGE FALUDY CHANT DES MERCENAIRES C’est nous, les fameux mercenaires Rapetassés devant, derrière. Pourvu qu’on aille, peu nous chaut Que ce soit par monts ou par vaux.

(1938) Adaptation de Jean Rousselot 34 [pageend34]LES SOURIS BLANCHES “Ces souris naissent si nombreuses, Me dit ma femme, soucieuse, Qu’il t’y faut mettre ordre à présent”. Sans bonne grâce, je consens, Et me lève, bien à regret, Pour exécuter cet arrêt. -Je m’y prépare à countre-cœur Comme un meurtrier ayant peur, — Etant aussi fait de poussière, — L’éteindre la vie éphémère. Ciel! lorsque j’ai saisi la cage, Par quel joyeux remue-ménage M’ont salué les souris blanches ! Elles se culbutent, se penchent, Tombent les unes sur les autres; Elles se mordillent, se vautrent, Chers petits êtres impudiques Qui m’évoquent la Rome antique Avec ses orgies qui revivent, Ou plutôt Sodome et Ninive. Je secouai la cage ouverte Et, me résignant à leur perte, Je tirai sur la chasse d’eau Pour qu’un Niagara au plus tôt Les couvre toutes de son flot. Mais non pas ! l’écumeux torrent Ne sait point décimer leurs rangs. Elles deviennent, ô miracle ! Chevaux bondissant sur l’obstacle, Minces lévriers ‘sautillants, Corps souples de poissons volants. 35 [pageend35]J’appelai l’eau; ce fut en vain. Elle était tarie et soudain Je fixai, privé de courage, Le tumulte qui faisait rage. Et j’attendis, l’âme au martyre, Que cette piscine en délire, Se calme, et qu’enfin sous l’eau lisse, Les faibles pattes se raidissent. J’aurais voulu fuir ce manège, Quand je découvris sur le siège Une souris frêle et gluante, Recroquevillée, hésitante ; De son œil rouge, elle fixait, Avec gratitude mes traits, Grelottante comme un marin Sauvé d’un naufrage lointain, Et dans son frissonnant bonheur, Elle me priait, moi, seigneur Des souris qui, calmant la faim, Donnait le pain quotidien, Le cachot vaste et merveilleux, La balançoire pour les jeux — Ordonnateur de son destin — Maître puissant et nécessaire, Contre qui l’on est sans colère, Même s’il vous noie de sa main. Ses griffes d’oiseau sans ramage Se crispaient, et sur mon visage S’attachait un amour si rare, Que je voulus fuir ce regard. Je me tournai contre le mur, Les yeux fermés, sans être sûr De cette souris retrouvée Et souhaitant l’avoir rêvée. 36 [pageend36]Je me sentis grandir soudain, Investi d’un pouvoir divin, Plein de la digne cruauté Qui convient à la majesté. Je devins, étrange alliance, Soudain minuscule et immense, Car comment perpétrer un crime Sans être bourreau et victime? Les yeux fermés, je me surpris A m’incarner dans la souris. Les genoux tremblants, je m’enfuis A travers la maison sans bruit, Vers le jardin frais et mouillé, Etreignant là ce vieux pommier Dont la rosée trempait les branches. — Sur moi, le regard effrayé De la souris plane et voltige, Et je vomis dans un vertige, Moi, le bon Dieu des souris blanches. (1961) Adaptation ď Anne-Marie de Backer LÁSZLÓ CS. SZABÓ A SIX HEURES PRECISES Le numéro deux était peint en rouge sur la lampe suspendue au-dessus de la porte. Cette lampe, on le voyait à sa forme, datait de l’époque où l’on s’éclairait encore au gaz. Trois marches conduisaient à la porte, en haut de l’escalier, fixé sur la grille qui séparait l’hôtel de l’immeuble voisin se trouvait un 37 [pageend37]distributeur automatique de cigarettes. L’homme recula jusqu’au bord du trottoir pour examiner encore une fois l’ensemble. C’était un hôtel de trois étages, ceinturé d’un balcon au premier ; le vert foncé du mur au rez-de-chaus- sés rappelait la couleur surannée des vieux bancs de square; délavé par d’innombrables pluies, le vert moins agressif des croisées avait viré au jaune soufre. C’était bien ici, il reconnaissait l’endroit. La maison dégageait un relent aigre, ses pores exhalaient l’odeur des lits de bois défaits, et celle de la cuisine viennoise que vantaient les journaux d’Europe Centrale. Mais la grande place ombragée d’autrefois s’était métamorphosée. Le jardin qui en occupait le centre avait disparu et la gare toute proche de Marylebone avait envahi l’espace jadis planté de platanes. La même somnolente et paisible atmophère de retraite l’enveloppait pourtant encore. Un taxi attendait sous la marquise aux piliers métalliques; son moteur tournait, il semblait prêt à assurer la fuite de quelques voleurs de banque. C’était là, c’était bien là. Il reconnaissait la porte bleue entrebâillée. Pénétrant dans l’étroit couloir, il reconnut également l’intérieur. Voici le porte- parapluies de cuivre dans le coin et près de la cheminée chargée d’un assortiment de balais, la statue d’un chef de tribu celte en cotte de mailles, la barbe en bataille, le casque surmonté de cornes d’aurochs. Le bureau, au bout du couloir, est vide comme toujours; factures, réservations de chambres, journaux et annuaires téléphoniques semblent s’accumuler sur la table depuis des années. A gauche, un petit escalier s’élance très raide vers les ténèbres; il est couvert d’un tapis usé couleur framboise, fixé par des tringles de cuivre. Chaudrons, tringles, poignées de portes, serrures, anneaux, tous les cuivres étincellent 38 [pageend38]dans le tourbillon silencieux de la poussière qui en partie s’infiltre de la rue et en partie se dégage des objets eux-mêmes comme une mauvaise baleine. Ni l’aspirateur ni le chiffon ne passent plus ici depuis longtemps, le laveur de carreaux ne vient plus, seuls se présentent chaque semaine les employés chargés de l’entretien des cuivres, parce qu’on a oublié de les décommander. Dehors, devant la porte, le bruit sec d’une pièce de monnaie qui tombe, puis un bref déclic: quelqu’un en partant a pris un paquet de cigarettes au distributeur automatique. Le cœur de l’homme s’est mis à battre très vite. Où est le salon? U se trouvait à gauche, près de l’entrée, tout de suite à gauche. Mais une psyché inclinée et maculée s’appuie maintenant contre le mur — ou contre la porte murée? Qu’est devenu le salon? C’est là qu’ils doivent se rencontrer à six heures précises. La femme arrive des Indes, tout droit des Indes, exprès pour lui, pour l’emmener avec elle en Hongrie. Où est le salon? Il était cinq heures et demie. Etait-ce bien là? Il jeta un coup d’œil dehors par la porte entr’ouverte. Le taxi avait disparu; un autobus jaune pâle s’avançait lentement vers la gare, il s’arrêta, et le chauffeur, la tête tournée vers le hall cria quelque chose en riant. Une serveuse de cantine en uniforme blanc bavardait avec un agent de police devant la porte de la gare. Les bras croisés, elle se balançait en cadence, une jambe repliée et le pied contre le mur. L’agent hochait la tête mais sans la regarder. C’était un tout jeune homme, au début de sa carrière, et sa réserve témoignait de son respect du règlement. Mais, les mains croisées derrière le dos, il imitait déjà l’attitude de ses collègues plus âgés. Le chauffeur descendit lentement de son siège, con39 [pageend39]tourna l’avant de la voiture, et, s’appuyant contre l’aile, il alluma une cigarette. La femme arrivait des Indes par le train de banlieue de High Wycombe. Les wagons vétustes, tout juste bons à mettre au rebut filaient maintenant parmi les tas de ferraille, les hangars et les jardins chétifs de quelque faubourg. Il y avait encore une demi- heure à attendre. Ils dévaient se rencontrer à six heures, six heures précises, la femme n’attendrait pas une minute; s’il n’était pas là, elle repartirait seule pour la Hongrie. Il s’était tout de même trompé. A Londres, il y a des milliers d’immeubles absolument identiques: deux fenêtres, trois étages, trois fenêtres, trois étages, trois fenêtres, trois étages, deux fenêtres, trois étages, porte, heurtoir, heurtoir, porte, tout autour de la place. Mais si c’est là, c’est bien là. Il n’y a pas d’autre distributeur automatique, en haut d’autres marches, seul le numéro de cet immeuble est peint en rouge. Et l’odeur, cette odeur lourde d’Europe Centrale, cette odeur de buffet de gare au début de l’après-midi, lorsque les mouches elles-même sommeillent. Il ne manque que le parfum des foins qui, venu des prés tout proches, imprègne les villes de là-bas. Où est le salon? Comment se rencontrer? Comment la prévenir, comment la rejoindre? Elle n’attendra pas une minute s’il est en retard. La pièce se trouvait à gauche, autrefois, à gauche tout près de l’entrée. Il s’est sûrement trompé. Mais il n’y avait pas d’autre immeuble sur la place. Tout le reste n’était que décors peints sur toile et les murs ondoyaient doucement au vent. — Qui cherchez-vous? Un aspirateur démonté à la main, une bonne se tenait derrière lui. C’était une fille robuste, beauté 40 [pageend40]vulgaire aux cheveux jaunes. Elle avait le rictus stupide d’un animal de faïence. — Je cherche le salon. Qu’est devenu le salon? Il était encore là, la dernière fois que je suis passé. La fille le fixait de ses yeux ahuris et exorbités par la. maladie de Basedow. — Nous avons rendez-vous ici à six heures. Elle vient des Indes, tout droit des Indes pour me chercher, vous comprenez? Sachez que si je ne suis pas à l’heure, elle ne m’attendra pas, pas une minute. Elle partira sans moi pour la Hongrie. Il regrettait d’avoir parlé sur ce ton. La fille pouvait se fâcher et disparaître sans laisser de traces. Désirant l’amadouer, il se mit à sourire lui aussi comme, un animal de faïence. — Je vous ai demandé qui vous cherchiez, fit-elle. Il lui était impossible de prononcer le nom de la femme. Même s’il l’avait voulu, il n’aurait pu le faire, des forces surnaturelles enchaînaient sa langue. H restait muet, fixant le reflet de son image, les jambes démesurément longues, la tête minuscule, dans la glace déformante qui se trouvait à la place de la porte du salon. Mais peut-être la fille avait-elle deviné le nom, car elle s’avança vers un tableau tendu de drap vert. Ce tableau se trouvait-il autrefois dans le couloir? U ne s’en souvenait pas. Les noms des clients y étaient inscrits sur d’étroites fiches blanches fixées en trois colonnes. L’index tendu, la fille épela les noms avec une extrême lenteur, puis, secouant la tête, elle avala sa salive et dit: — Il n’y a pas ce nom-là. Elle n’habite pas ici. — Son nom ne peut pas y être, évidemment. Elle arrive des Indes, par le train de banlieue de High Wycombe. Regardez les réservations. Je vous en supplie, regardez vite. 41 [pageend41]—• J’ai regardé. Rien, là non plus. Il était, six heures moins vingt-cinq. Le saisissant par une de ses cornes, la fille rectifia la position du chef de tribu celte. — Il n’y a pas de quoi se désespérer comme ça, tout de suite. Attendez, je vais appeler quelqu’un. Et elle disparut dans le bureau. Il se sentit soulagé. C’était elle, c’était la femme qu’il attendait. Elle lui était apparue sous les traits de cette géante aux cheveux jaunes, simplement pour le mettre à l’épreuve. Elle allait rejeter son masque derrière la porte et retrouver sa forme frêle et sa chevelure dorée de jadis dans laquelle apparaissaient quelques fils blancs. Il fixait la porte du bureau, attendant l’apparition du visage familier. Tout à coup, une étrangère surgit devant lui. C’était une femme mûre, à la peau bistrée et vêtue d’une longue robe de soie verte qui semblait avoir reçu la peinture d’un banc de square ou celle du mur. L’expression de sa figure étroite reflétait une politesse agressive, des encouragements menaçants et une certaine ironie bienveillante: c’est ainsi que l’on représente la tenancière d’un bordel dans des westerns qui commencent par l’enlèvement d’une jeune fille et se terminent par des coups de ré- volver qui châtient les traîtres et délivrent la vertu. — Que puis-je faire pour vous? Il avait dû se tromper tout de même, s’égarer dans quelque maison mal famée. Les fiches épinglées sur le drap vert ne portaient sans doute que des noms de filles, des prénoms de toute les couleurs de l’arc- en-ciel. Saisi d’une fureur impuissante, il s’avança vers le tableau. Il n’y avait rien de marqué sur les fiches, lui du moins ne voyait rien. — Que puis-je faire pour vous? 42 [pageend42]— Vous le savez bien. Où est le salon? J’en ai assez de cette comédie, dites vite, qu’en avez-vous fait? Il ne restait plus que vingt minutes. — Vous êtes une femme d’expérience, intelligente, bonne, et belle, ne me tourmentez pas. Oil est le salon? Pleine d’attention bienveillante, la femme en robe verte se mit à examiner les fiches. — Non, pas celle-ci, celle-ci non plus. . . non. . . non. — Au nom du ciel, laissez ce tableau, cela n’a aucun sens. Dans vingt minutes elle sera là, elle arrive des Indes. Elle ne peut pas attendre, si je ne suis pas à l’heure, elle n’attendra pas une minute. Elle n’attendra pas, elle n’attendra pas, comprenez donc, à la fin ! La bonne revint, les deux femmes échangèrent un sourire. Que cachaient-elles derrière cette bonne volonté sournoise? Le nom peut-être, son nom à elle, inscrit sur le tableau en lettres invisibles. Ou bien le salon, dissimulé dans quelque coin secret de la maison, pour qu’il ne puisse le découvrir. Et sans se douter de rien, la femme entrera par une autre porte, une porte inconnue. Ces deux garces la laisseront attendre en vain, par le trou de la serrure, en ricanant, elles surveilleront la pendule et la femme assise dessous. Elle restera là toute seule jusqu’à six heures précises, mais pas un instant de plus. S’il parcourait maintenant très vite les autres maisons, il pourrait encore trouver celle qu’il cherche, la bonne. Mais les autres sont en toile, elles sont peintes sur une toile ridée, ce ne sont que décors troués. — Du calme, du calme, lui dit alors la femme plus âgée, affectueuse et maternelle, et l’homme, tout à coup, se sentit ému et plein de confiance, il lui sembla qu’il se blottissait contre le sein charitablement dé43 [pageend43]couvert d’une infirmière pour y mourir en paix. Du calme, voyons, ne vous affolez pas comme cela tout de suite. Allez voir dans la maison d’à côté, il y a encore un registre. — Voici les clés des chambres, s’écria la bonne, tandis qu’il s’éloignait. Il y avait encore un quart d’heure avant le rendezvous . Cette porte entrebâillée, de l’autre côté de la grille, comment ne l’avait-il pas remarquée? D’un bond, il descendit les trois marches, pivota rapidement sur lui-même, saisit la rampe et s’élança sur la dernière marche de l’autre escalier. Poussant la porte, il se trouva dans un vaste hall que des guichets arrivant à poitrine d’homme séparaient en deux dans le sens de la longueur. Des clients attendaient un peu partout. C’était une erreur, vite, redescendre l’escalier, retourner dans l’autre immeuble. Une employée de la police et une aviatrice se tenaient maintenant devant le tableau vert, épaule contre épaule, rigides, serviables, souriant d’un air à la fois modeste et pincé. — La maison, la maison d’à côté, ce n’est pas un hôtel, on m’a mal renseigné. Les deux femme étaient immobiles, le visage tourné vers la porte. Colonnes grecques accouplées, korés anglo-saxonnes, anges de l’ordre, elles portaient toutes deux le même uniforme: casquette plate, cravate noire et ceinture réglementaire, veste à boutons d’argent, souliers plat à lacets. — Vous n’avez qu’à retourner. Ils savent tout maintenant, dit l’une d’elles, ou peut-être avaient- elles parlé toutes les deux, à l’unisson. — Les clefs des chambres sont là, répéta la bonne. Il connaissait bien cette voix, cette amabilité pleine de reproches, le ton neutre du chœur féminin de 44 [pageend44]l’Etat Providence où l’on ne retrouvait plus l’appel d’autrefois, le message tremblant au-delà du sens des mots. Il comprit qu’il n’avait plus rien à chercher ici et il retourna dans l’autre immeuble. Et soudain, il reconnut le hall. Il y avait une vieille agence de voyages à Budapest, avec d’immenses fenêtres donnant sur la rue, et une mappemonde au fond dont les continents avaient la dimension d’un homme. Des deux côtés de la carte, il restait un peu de place sur le mur, juste assez pour quelques affiches alléchantes: on voyait à gauche la reproduction en couleur d’un tableau de Corot représentant une cathédrale française et à droite la petite statue de la Vénus d’Aquincum, spécimen idéal de la beauté féminine. On se demandait quelle puissante végétation depuis longtemps engloutie dans les océans et les mers glacées avait, avant de disparaître, rejeté cette image sur le bord des continents, souvenir capricieux du passage éphémère de l’homme. A distance égale les uns des autres, trois employés s’affairaient derrière les guichets. L’un collait des timbres dans un registre de Société mutualiste, l’autre vérifiait une feuille d’impôts, celui du milieu jouait tout seul aux échecs. Six ou sept clients attendaient leur tour, un transistor à la main. Il y avait un immense tableau près de l’entrée, avec deux cents cases au moins. Un trousseau de clefs était accroché au clou, des lettres, des fiches, des journaux débordaient des casiers. Pas la moindre trace d’un portier. La femme l’attendrait à six heures, à six heures précises. Comment reconnaître la clef du salon? Elle n’attendrait pas une minute. Elle poursuivrait son voyage, partirait sans lui pour la Hongrie. Comment reconnaître cette clef? Il ne restait plus que dix minutes. Attentif, il longea lentement les guichets. Béats, les clients écou- 45 [pageend45]taieiit les bruits grinçants et criards qui semblaient sortir de leur corps et faire vibrer leurs mains. Allô, Allo, Kent. . . Allo, Allo, Warwick. . . . Allo, allo, Somerset. . . . l’Automobile Club conseillait aux véhicules d’emprunter des voies secondaires pour éviter les embouteillages du week-end. On entendait Tristan, joué dans un opéra de la Ruhr. L’Interpol recherchait des voleurs de bijoux. Puis, suivaient tous les renseignements relatifs à un trésor disparu donnés par un scénariste célèbre. Un plombier espé- rantiste cherchait dans l’éther une âme sœur. Yves Montand chantait une rengaine sentimentale sur des amants désunis. Cours d’anglais, Armstrong. Un jeune homme couvert de taches de rousseur écoutait impassible le brouillage monotone d’une émission par un poste soviétique. Ahuri, le colleur de timbres se mit à feuilleter anxieusement les pages de son registre, le second employé vérifiait une autre feuille d’impôts, le troisième s’était accoudé, sinistre comme un brigand d’auberge, puis fit un coup décisif sur l’échiquier. A qui s’adresser? C’est alors qu’apparut le douanier, surgissant de derrière la mappemonde: il portait un uniforme bleu ciel et une casquette blanche à galons d’or. Sa veste était si bien ajustée et si élégante qu’on l’aurait prise pour une réclame de tailleur. Pas de tailleur. Pas de client, il n’avait rien à faire. Il s’approcha des guichets et se dirigea tout droit vers l’homme. Sa façon de redresser la tête et de froncer les sourcils exprimait une prévenance compassée, une grande maîtrise de soi, un altruisme discipliné. L’homme comprit son regard pénétrant et plein de bienveillance. — Je suis venu pour le salon, pour le salon de réception. Dites-moi où il est, ce qu’on en a fait, où on l’a transféré, parce que. . . 46 [pageend46]— Vous êtes sorti du rang, lui fit remarquer le douanier, et dégageant sa main droite, il fit signe à un jeune homme débraillé, le dernier parmi les clients qui attendaient devant le guichet du colleur de timbres. — Vous avez quelque chose à déclarer? Son autre main apparut, tenant une petite tablette couverte d’un texte écrit en gros caractères. — Vous connaissez le règlement? Interdiction d’importer de la nourriture pour les oiseaux, de boutons de nacre et des trottinettes. — Non, je n’ai rien, non. . . rien. . . c’est-à-dire. . . non.. . — Enlevez votre montre-bracelet. Adaptant à son œil une minuscule loupe d’ivoire, le douanier se mit à examiner la montre à l’aide d’une petite pince. D’élégantes rides se jouaient autour de son œil fureteur. — Nous allons dresser procès-verbal. L’homme se dirigea vers la fenêtre qui donnait sur la rue. Le car jaune pâle avait disparu. Quelques taxis stationnaient à sa place. La serveuse de cantine était toujours adossée à la porte, mais les bras ballants, elle avait cessé de se balancer et l’agent de police ne hochait plus la tête. Il se contentait de sourire à un visage invisible sur le trottoir, comme s’il lui fallait partir et que la séparation lui coûtait. Un pilier rouge délabré se trouvait près de la porte cochère. En haut une flèche accompagnée d’un texte visait le distributeur automatique de timbres, une autre montrait l’emplacement du distributeur de cigarettes, une troisième, celui de la bouche de métro. L’un des panneaux invitait les taxis à rouler au pas, l’autre conseillait la prudence aux piétons. Billets du dimanche pour la mer, douze shillings seulement. Avez-vous déjà vu des corbeaux cette année? Beauté 47 [pageend47]des cygnes sur la Tamise. A l’horizon, des chevaux de frise. Suivez les lumières bleues, jaunes, et vertes dans les couloirs du métro. L’ordre régnait sur la terre et sous la terre. De la fumée montait derrière la façade de briques. Encore trois minutes, et il serait six heures. C’était peut-être le train de Harrow-on-the-Hill amenant les voyageurs du Japon et de la Birmanie. Un porteur était assis, les jambes croisées, sur le rebord de la fenêtre, son gilet à boutons d’argent entr’ouvert. Il descendit d’un bond, et empoignant les bras de son diable dressé à la verticale, il disparut dans le hall. Le première personne arrivait au pas de course. C’était une longue fille en pantalon, elle avait une mallette de toile, la changeait constamment de main et se cognait à chaque fois les genoux. Un petit homme à lunettes la suivait d’un pas rapide. Il était chargé d’une énorme valise, mais il se tenait si droit et marchait si vite qu’il semblait avoir les mains vides. Le train de High Wycombe, son train à elle aurait peut-être du retard. Il était peut-être immobilisé parmi des maisons de briques, crasseuses et mortes. Six heures- moins une. Il sentit sur sa nuque le regard du douanier et se retourna. L’autre le regardait en effet, avec une instance bienveillante et pleine de sous-entendus. Le procès-verbal était- terminé, il n’avait plus rien à faire. L’homme courut au guichet. — Je voudrais savoir, mais vite, maintenant, dans une minute le train sera là. . . je voudrais savoir. . . , dites-moi vite où est le salon, où. . . — Vous êtes sorti du rang, lui fit remarquer le douanier, et il fit signe à une jeune femme qui attendait devant le guichet du contrôleur d’impôts, tout au bout de la file. 48 [pageend48]— Vous avez quelque chose à déclarer? lui de- inanda-t-il, et il brandit sa tablette. — Interdiction d’importer des cartes postales sonores, des graines de courge et des confettis. La jeune femme releva la tête d’un air indigné. — Mais je n’ai rien. — Enlevez votre montre-bracelet. L’élégante loupe reparut et à l’aide de sa pince, le douanier ouvrit le boîtier. — Nous allons dresser procès-verbal. L’homme retourna à la fenêtre. Les taxis qui stationnaient sous la marquise soutenue par des piliers métalliques démarraient, les uns après les autres. Une vieille femme apparut à la porte du hall, poussant devant elle un fauteuil roulant dans lequel était assis un jeune homme enveloppé de couvertures. A la sûreté de ses gestes pleins de tendresse, on reconnaissait la mère qui défend son enfant et qui, jusqu’à la mort, lui promet la guérison. L’agent était parti, au bord du trottoir la serveuse se penchait, les bras croisés, pour suivre quelqu’un des yeux. Un garçon et une fille aux cheveux roux, vêtus chacun d’un tricot rayé, se promenaient, rêveurs. Le jeune homme se laissait pousser la barbe. Ils portaient en bandoulière des accessoires de pêche, un sac, un thermos et une chaise pliante. Us étaient, avec la mère et son fils paralysé, les derniers voyageurs du train de High Wycombe. Six heures cinq. Le tableau et les clés avaient disparu. Les clients attendaient patiemment devant le guichet. L’un d’eux s’était assoupi, il avait laissé tomber son transistor, mais même sur le sol, le speaker de l’Automobile Club continuait à renseigner les excursionnistes du dimanche. Le joueur d’échecs déplaça une figure. Il prit une tour, l’éleva verticalement avec l’incertitude et la lenteur d’un candidat au suicide qui hésite lâchement au dernier moment. 49 [pageend49]— Hé, Monsieur ! Le douanier l’avait interpellé. Il avait rédigé son second procès-verbal. Il n’y avait plus personne devant lui. Un homme ne pourrait contempler avec plus de tendresse sa jeune amante déflorée, un ami ne pourrait regarder avec plus d’affection celui qu’il avait cru mort. Une éternité séparait la fenêtre du guichet. — J’étais venu pour. . . j’aurais voulu savoir. . . mais il est trop tard. . . Il est plus de six heures, cela n’a plus d’importance, maintenant. . . le salon existe peut-être tout de même, où. . . — Vous êtes sorti du rang, lui fit remarquer le douanier et il fit signe à une vieille femme qui attendait devant le guichet du joueur d’échecs. — Vous avez quelque chose à déclarer? Et de nouveau il brandit sou réglement. — Interdiction d’importer des têtards, des photos de nus et la varicelle. La petite vieille voulut défaire les courroies de sa valise, mais dans sa hâte, elle ne réussit qu’à les emmêler davantage. — Je n’en ai pas, . . . vraiment pas, mon Dieu. . . pas cette fois, pourtant j’aurais voulu en apporter à mon petit-fils. — Enlevez votre montre-bracelet. L’homme retourna à la fenêtre. La place de la gare était déserte, abandonnée de tout. Le diable du porteur avait disparu lui aussi. Les flèches à la porte se visaient mutuellement. Cygnes, corbeaux, douze shillings seulement pour la mer pendant le week-end. Un papier de journal froissé glissait sur la chaussée, comme si quelqu’un le tirait au bout d’une ficelle pour taquiner un chat. Il était six heures un quart. — Nous allons dresser procès-verbal, entendit-il derrière lui. 50 [pageend50]Lorsqu’il releva :les yeux, la place était redevenue ce qu’elle était autrefois. De solides maisons de pierre avaient remplacé les décors flottants, à l’est un store rayé s’arrondissait audessus du balcon d’un hôtel, au nord, à demi déplové, un drapeau anglais flottait au vent. Les platanes ondoyaient en silence, calmes et sereins comme les pères de l’église primitive. Les rafales du vent d’automne ni les plus sanglants oukazes ne pouvaient rien contre eux. Un merle sifflait, perché sur une antenne parmi les cheminées. D’habitude, il n’appelait sa compagne qu’au coucher du soleil, ou le matin de bonne heure lorsque la ville commençait à s’éveiller. Six heures un quart. Et si c’était le matin? Le merle sifflait, de plus en plus joyeux! Traduit par Cécile Nagy et Ladislas Gara J. C. ARKA Y THE UNDISPUTED KINGDOM When sky and shadows aspire To put the seas on fire The hollow boats awake In the harbour’s sheltered abscess And turn towards the falling stake On which the sun Bound with clouds, hawser-shaped and dun, Collapses— 51 [pageend51]Like everyone who cannot rest The men turn west. They face the monstrous image of the sun Across the ripple flowered fields of water But the conflagration cannot stun The mind Already kindled on the thoughts of slaughter. They leave the world behind. The world—a word of boundaries, Of fences, levels low or high: How much sounder is Their claim to sea and sky, Distance stretching out her lands Towards the sail’s unfurling crest Like the child whose hungry hands Fasten on a mother’s breast, Helpless like the very young And restlessly impatient. Which from depths has sprung, Risen always self-occasioned, White youth is dancing in the waves Unencumbered by the fear of graves- Hardening substance in the water Binding life to death like mortar. The undisputed kingdom of the shark Is dark Yet nothing in it can grow old And in the depths, however cold, The tumbling fins will light a spark That will have left a burning mark Of molten gold When every bell has tolled. 52 [pageend52]Men must go to fight With the fall of every night. All tasks are simple When their armour is a symbol. Cast for the role of the fictitious fool You may regard your gun a tool: Whom with chains they fetter Convicts know much better. Now with their accounts complete, The men prepare themselves to foot the bill: Diminutively small, the fleet Is ready for the kill— The seasons Justify their reasons To invade the sea, The water’s steeled eternity— Because the seasons change And thus arrange The sequence they have learnt to fear In the abstract concept of the year When autumn gales are snarling— Because the sea ignores the farrago Of brittle leaf and snow-cloud driven starling The stage was set here long ago. They must pit The naturally sick abundance Of their kind against the permanently fit And shoaling silence-music of a dance— To fight eternity Below the age-pocked cliffs of green Magee— Near the Lagan, The dragon. 53 [pageend53]Poor portrayals of St. George’s Fashion Pawns engaged in chessboard orgies Pinned to rigid squares of passion, To step beyond Their day-grey bond They must fulfil the drill Of dreams and kill. What a conventionally puny war did To men who fought seems sordid After two decades of empty talk About un violated Dover chalk When other men, not these, will soon Be visiting the Moon— For each A star within his reach— The burning glory of its matter Tamed and “counted down” apace To shatter The Illusions of a race. The old men only understand The hunters and The fishermen while ruminating on the cast Of an incendiary glory long since past. Matter burning has no life. To the living death is like a wife. Standing round a bollard On the quay, the old men Grouped like stones around a fallen dolmen, Watch the crippled yearning of their blood. (Engaged to clay as meek As stones the greying shapes refuse to speak.) 54 [pageend54]Tlie memory of every crime ' Haunts manhood from its prime, 'And with survival as the only gain Each duel must, perforce, he fought again. Beyond the envy of the rock-rent Beach— The silence of a contest is more eloquent Than speech. The fish when struggling with the Hook Dives deep down for another look At darkness, all it means to those alive— No book, And Pascal’s least of all, Convinces those about to fall That through the Loss they will arrive At Everything that Nothingness forsook. With Rod, Line, Hook and Reel They sail the meadows of the conger-eel Where whiting hide Like flitting butterflies Among the seaweed cluttered piles Of currents woven by the tide Tracing the unerring rune Of the errand-bearing Moon. The straining lines will claim their take Of gurnard, haddock, plaice and hake And they will scrutinize The suffocating antics of the brown-pink cod Impatient as the drowning god Who, casting out his baited arcs, May watch them with his brooding eyes Like they the movement of the sharks. 55 [pageend55]GEORGE MIKES FOREIGNERS The English used to regard foreigners as strange and ridiculous people. The French—the most liberal- minded of all nations—did not agree with this view. They did not regard foreigners as people at all. They were métèque, or sale métèque, an expression the full flavour of which cannot easily be translated into English. Compared with it, “bloody foreigner” is a compliment verging on flattery. In the old days in France it was the English alone —among- all aliens—who did not count as foreigners. They were the English. The Scots were also the English. So were the Welsh and the Irish. The rest of the people were tourists—meriting no notice except from hotel-keepers, restaurateurs, night-club personnel, prostitutes and vendors of filthy postcards. The resident foreigners—if poor—were simply the métèque, the scum of the earth. They were not persecuted just as the dirt in the street is not persecuted ; they were not swept away just as the dirt in the streets is not swept away. Everybody knew that Paris was full of these people, they were part of the landscape like the bridges over the Seine, the bacilli in the air and the sparrows on trees near the river. Occasionally one of this métèque gained the Noble Prize for one thing or another; or killed a midinette; or returned home to his throne and ruled a faraway and unknown little country as absolute monarch until, a few years later, he turned up again in Paris as a refugee and once again was unable to pay his rent. This pattern has now changed in France. The problem of foreigners has become infinitely more compli56 [pageend56]cated. The English are still English but the French have acquired a vague notion that the Irish and the Scots are no longer the English. The Americans, too, have come into the picture occupying a special place of their own. In the old and golden days before 1914—there were no Americans or if there were, the great French public was unaware of their existence. Those were the days. Before the second World AVar came a new wave of refugees and after the war yet another wave followed. The pre-war wave refused to be called foreigners: they were refugees ; the post-war refugees refused to be called refugees: they were émigrés. This pride seems mysterious and puzzling to the uninitiated. Those émigrés who reached America are called immigrants —the Americans putting the emphasis on what is from their own point of view the more painful aspect of the matter. AAThen does a refugee become an émigré? And is the “immigrant” just the other side of the “émigré”- medal or a slightly different or even a completely different species? (If is of course different. You may get out of somewhere without at the same time getting into anywhere.) These niceties of definition never occur to the French. All they know about the émigrés is that they are people who have lost everything except their identity. But even this is a mistake: their identity is the very first thing they lost. “They have nothing but a load of nostalgia” some one remarked to me and he was quite wrong. The picture of their country which is fixed in the émigré’s mind perpetuates things as they looked on the day of his departure. The country changes even if we are no longer there; yet, this picture is unalterable. So even their nostalgia is unreal: they are longing for a place which does not exist. Their nostalgia is four-dimensional: 57 [pageend57]it takes tliem eastward in space and backward in time. This 4D Nostalgia does not mean that they have the slightest desire to return to Lvov ; it means that they long for the Lvov of 1937. They feel more nostalgic for their youth than for their country. Sooner or later all people emigrate from their youth but in a way the émigré is luckier than others. After all, it is more romantic to identify your lost or passing youth with a distant but interesting country than with lost teeth. So, even the little knowledge shared by the French—and the English—about émigré nostalgia is incorrect. The émigrés form a large, important and, in certain fields, even powerful nation. We might as well throw a quick glance at their problem and set ourselves the question: Who are these émigrés? What are they? ♦ * * It is generally supposed that an émigré is a person who has abandoned his country. But in most cases the émigré is a person who has been abandoned by his country. In Western Europe a quiet sociological debate has been going on for the last sixteen or seventeen years, in an attempt to decide whether the émigré is a tragic or a comic figure. Opinions are divided. The émigré regards himself as a tragic hero. He is the patriot deprived of his fatherland; the broken flower transplanted into strange and unfriendly soil; he is the brave warrior who1—with all the odds against him— fights bravely for his and his family’s livelihood. But the native French and British giggle at him; or in the very best case smile benevolently. In their eyes the émigré is a person of strange habits, with a long and outlandish name sprinkled with silly dots and dashes. He wears a long coat, long pointed shoes, commits ridiculous or horrible mistakes in French and Eng- 58 [pageend58]lisli and has an atrocious accent. He is now a filing clerk or a book-keeper but he keeps on boasting and rubbing* it in that in Novobriganz or Kristenkopolnik he used to be a teacher of ancient Greek literature, or an army officer or a wholesale dealer in jute. He keeps telling all the natives all over the world that the capital of a faraway and obscure little country in Central or Eastern Europe had a much higher level of cultural life than Grenoble; that there they cooked a dish called let cho incomparably better than they do in Padua ; and that there was much less draught there than in Leeds. The two opposing parties—émigrés and natives— naturally detest one another. The émigré is slightly offended because the French speak French and the English speak English; he is annoyed at not finding his favourite Budapest or Prague café on the corner of the Rue de Rivoli or Oxford Street ; and he is surprised to see that in a strange land he is not at home. The native, in turn, is irritated to see his privacy invaded by a lot of wayfarers who make life more difficult, compete with him in every field and, on top of it all, keep on complaining and criticising—and yet expecting sympathy. Besides, the native feels instinctively that while the poor émigré is not at home in a strange land, he would feel even less at home in his own country. At the moment émigrés are in a minority all over the world. But not everywhere; and, maybe, not for long. Emigration is an age-old vogue. The history of my own country of origin started when a few wild Magyar tribes emigrated from Asia. Before that, excitable and ill-mannered émigrés defeated the power of Rome and shook Greco-Roman civilisation to its foundations. Millions of Chinese emigrated to many places in and 59 [pageend59]around the Pacific, many Indians to South Africa and these examples could be multiplied almost indefinitely. In the United States everyone or everyone’s father is an émigré with the exception of the Indians; in Australia and New Zealand the position is the same but their Indians are the Australian aborigines and the Maoris. In olden days émigrés were massacred except, of course, when they were strong enough to massacre the natives. That is the real explanation why it was not smart to be an émigré. It was never smart to be massacred; what was regarded as smart was to massacre others. These primitive stages have now passed. Technical development is truly astonishing. We have recently witnessed an era when it is not the émigrés, who were massacred but those who stayed at home. Civilised countries accept the émigré with a sigh and a shrug of the shoulders. From some countries they are kept out if they have kidney-trouble or if their eyesight is not that of a Red Indian Chief ; other lands prefer ex-convicts to intellectuals and again others dislike people who had more than one Communist grandfather. But on the whole the world is behaving in a commendable fashion; and we must not forget that the émigrés are not all roses either. Yet, it is still not a smart thing to be an émigré. This lack of glory is the father of a huge inferiority complex in all émigrés. The émigré is ashamed of having been born at, say, Szolgaegyháza and not in Rouen or York, lie either apologises for this mistake or is angry about it and blames others. Or he tries to show that he is able to improve—once a foreigner is not always a foreigner lie shouts defiantly—and tries to be more English than the English, more French than the French and more American than the Americans. He 60 [pageend60]is engaged in taking roots; lie does it with boundless energy and keen determination. Of course, this is a full time job. He becomes arrogant or obsequious; able and diligent. Until the ’30’s Europe knew only one single émigré race: the Jews. (Apart from the White Russians who are an entirely different chapter altogether.) Now even the most rabid anti-Semites are starting to realise that those habits which they regarded as typical Jewish characteristics were simply émigré characteristics. In Europe every émigré is a Jew. Many people refuse to recognise this. But every émigré is—theoretically and not racially speaking— a Jew and that is why one cannot observe our post-war era without a wry smile. One looks at those émigrés who were former Nazis and one is amused. God has an exquisite sense of humour. He has turned all these Nazis into Jews. Green, inexperienced Jews into the bargain. Mere beginners. GYÖRGY GÖMÖRI UNECHTER ODYSSEUS Heimatverschlagner Odysseus, kein echter zwar, Irren wir hin durch die Welt, indessen daheim Penelopen, Welche jüngst noch gelacht, schwermütigem Ernste verfallen, Mit verschlossenen Lippen am Totentuch weben. Winter ist es, und Reif beschlägt die Barke, ein böser Nordwind bläst übers Meer, Und so unmenschlich sind über uns, so abstrakt auch die Sterne. 61 [pageend61]Nein, nicht haben wir uns bei den Lotosessern versessen, Nicht hat Charybdis uns aufgerieben, nicht Scylla gefressen: Dass wir hierhin uns dorthin geworfen werden, verzehrt uns. Seht doch: der Kampf ist lange noch nicht am Ende, Und daheim, da weben am Totentuche, Weben die plötzlich dem Ernste verfallenen Penelopen. Ihr aber, ihr, glorreiche Achaier, was hat euer leeres Schwatzen getaugt? Habt ihr Opfer gebracht dem einfältigen, dennoch so mächtigen Herrscher Poseidon, gewagt, ihn mit mutigem Tun zu bedrohen? Nein ! — Nicht war, nein? Habt uns zu essen gegeben, doch konntet ihr sonst nur bedauern Oder, in Worten behend, ein blitzendes Ballspiel eröffnen. Dieses vermochtet ihr nur, glorreiche Achaier. Heimatverschlagner Odysseus, kein echter zwar, Irren wir hin durch die Welt. Aus unseren Seufzern Webt die See ein Totentuch. In Nebel versunken Schwand die Vergangenheit, Nebel liegt über Ithakas Schicksal. Translated by Otto von Taube STIMME DES AUFSTANDS Der du uns auf gerufen hast zur Tat, Mein Gott, der du in unsern Tiefen 62 [pageend62]Den zarten Funken unsrer Sehnsucht schürtest, Dass er — ein horizontentzündendes Fanal — Aufloderte zum Flammenruf: Welt, Welt, erwache, Schlafende Welt, wach auf! Hilf diesem Volk, Dass es nicht an sich selber irre werde, Als sei es eine Fehlgeburt des Schicksals, Zum Scheitern vorbestimmt, Sein edles, teures Antlitz auserlesen, Dass es von eines Fremden ruchlosem Räuberfuss Zertreten werde. Denn, o mein Gott, es kann, es kann nicht sein, Dass du gleichmütig bleibst, was auch geschehe, Und du dies Volk bereits verloren gabst, Endgültig an das Böse ausgeliefert — Oder hast du uns die Passion bestimmt, Hast du das Kreuz, das einst dein Sohn getragen, Für immer unsern Schultern aufgebürdet, Dass wir es dulden müssten, bis am Ende Bei unsres Mundes letztem Seufzerhauch Die letzten deiner Heiligtümer sinken? Der du uns aufgerufen hast, mein Gott, Der du die Tat gewollt, der mit uns war Im Traumlicht der Verheissung jenes einen Strahlenden Nachmittags, da unsren Greisen Die Freudentränen aus den Augen stürzten, Weil sie des Aufbruchs grosse Stunde sahn: Hilf, o mein Gott, hilf du nun diesem Volk, Dem keiner half, das unverstanden blieb, Im Sehnen und im Hoffen ungesegnet — Ach, alle unsre Blüten sind erfroren. Translated by Gertrud von le Fort 63 [pageend63]SZABOLCS DE VAJAY THE TAPESTRY The Lady Sclaramonde could not sleep. She tossed and turned restlessly in the marriage-bed in which, for six years past, she had been waiting for the dawn alone. That memorable night, the twisted columns of the bed seemed taller, as if hewed by legendary giants from oaks reaching up to the sky. The silken canopy showed faintly blue, like the colours of the night before moonrise. The crimson embers were dying in the vaulted fireplace. Like small witches’ eyes they watched the Lady Sclaramonde. The wind from the mountains rushed jeering down the chimney and from time to time a gust would slowly lift and sway the only ornament in the room: a Flemish tapestry in which ten years of work were woven. The once bright colours of the tapestry had become blue and grey with time; Sclaramonde did not know when it had been started. Perhaps it had come down South with one of her ancestresses from Flanders or Holland. For her, the tapestry bad always been there. Sclaramonde had been living in the castle for some twenty years. She was still in tender girlhood when the Old Lady, — God rest her soul, — chose her for her son, and it was still the Old Lady who lived in the Bride’s room then. But exactly ten years ago, on St. Cecilia’s day, they had taken her remains down to the crypt. Gusts of cold air from the vault blew up into the chapel through the crack in a sunken flag- in the stone floor. When she was praying, Sclaramonde liked to stand over this crack. Then ishe did not feel lonely. The dead kept her company. So did 64 [pageend64]the Old Lady who, during all the years they had shared the same roof, had never loosened the knots of human solitude. They never spoke above a whisper. Even the Lord Béranger was unaware of the vast, almost tangible solitude in which their nearness was wrapped. The Lord Béranger was the Old Lady’s son and Sclanamonde’s husband. The wind blew down the chimney again and the little eyes in the embers glowed red. The heavy tapestry bellied like the sail of a ship. The icy blast gave life for a moment to the figures woven in the woollen cloth. Even the Old Lady knew nothing more about the tapestry, except that it was “very very old”. “It has always been there,” she used to say, like one resigned for generations to living against a changeless background in mute acceptance. Shaken by the wind, the figures on the tapestry sprang to life in Sclaramonde’s imagination, as the wind from beyond the grave brought the Old Lady to life in the chapel. In those moments she would bend her head low. The Chaplain, absorbed in the solemn whispering and gesturing of Mass, thought that she was praying. She was only- trying to understand the past—to understand the Old Lady who was dead and with whom, in her lifetime, she had never exchanged one living word. Even their low whispers never met, as if they had been addressed to somebody else. But each one knew that she had the other’s forgiveness. Many would have liked to know whether Sclara- monde was young or old. The pages who had seen her arrive at the castle were now seasoned knights. But all those who still remembered that memorable day no longer knew at what point of time to place it. Sclaramonde had become part of the castle, like the dungeon, the leering gargoyles, and the moat. 65 [pageend65]Some claimed that, in the past, they had seen her smile. They even boasted about it in the guardroom or when emptying a drinking cup, as if boasting of a hunting exploit or a victory in a tournament. But they all agreed that since the Lord Béranger had gone the Lady Sclaramonde’s face had become as still as a church. It would be six years since the Lord Béranger had gone. The blue sky was rent by a shrill golden flourish of trumpets and flashing brass dazzled the assembled peasants with a myriad sparks. The Lord Béranger was off to the Crusades. He rode his powerful steel-grey dappled charger, Malabor. The animal danced on itis well-muscled legs and champed the bit. On the blue and gold embroidered saddle cloth were the family arms. The same arms appeared, like a sinister bequest, on the wall of Sclaramonde’s room, antlers or on field azure, with the family device carved out below: Do el Morior—I give and I die. The Lord Béranger went off to the Crusades and with him went twelve gallant knights. They left the ancestral domain intoning psalms. As they turned out of the valley, they had a last glimpse of the old tower, outlined dark and squat against the sky. They could still see the hosts of jackdaws endlessly wheeling and turning, but they could no longer hear their cries. Yet they -cawed that day, as they still did, as they always did. The Lady Sclaramonde hated them. When she was alone, she dug her nails into the palms of her hands whenever a jackdaw passed in front of her window, pursuing its prey with long, harsh cry. Sclaramonde was often alone. She had never forgiven the Lord Béranger for not looking round at her as he crossed the drawbridge. It was then that the last smile had died on her face and since then the people of the castle had become accustomed to seeing it as 66 [pageend66]motionless as tlie floor of the chapel or the great stones of the fireplace. The Lady Selaramonde remained alone—alone in her marriage bed. But in the darkest corner of her room a multitude of cares lurked. They sometimes multiplied like fungi, devouring her last few moments of leisure. The castle, the pastureland, the fields, the serfs. . . Sometimes the harvest was destroyed by drought, sometimes the wife of one those trusty serfs died in childbirth. The sheep had to be re-counted, a swarm of bees flew away to freedom, sometimes the forests of the estate were haunted by brigands who had to be handed over to the Sheriff. The cattle were decimated by fever or an old woman was accused of casting spells. It was the Lady Selaramonde who for six years had borne it all on her shoulders. Her voice rung clear and hard. She had become accustomed to giving orders. No-one in the castle ever dared to contradict her. They had almost forgotten the Lord Béranger, from whom they had had no news since be left the castle intoning psalms as he crossed the drawbridge, with the clank of arms, but with no last glance for his wife. Yet that night the Lady Selaramonde felt that he would come back. An internal flame lit up the whiteness of her face. She knew that the Lord Béranger would come. She could not sleep ; she tossed and turned on her beaverskin coverlet and as the winter wind raged in the chimney, small drops of perspiration formed on her body. She was hot and shivering at the same time. The drops ran down her body like nimble fingers. The flame within her warmed her flesh be- neath their damp caress, but Selaramonde could still feel them. She felt as if the. drops of perspiration had bound her every limb. For isix years now, she had not been a woman, al67 [pageend67]though she was still the Lord’s wife. For six long years she had shared this room, this bed with the fine linen sheets, with no-one. Yet many would have offered themselves witli pleasure, and Sclaramonde, behind lier white marble mask had secretly desired one or two—that charming wide-eyed minstrel who sang the story of Amadis of Gaul in his sweet voice, accompanying himself on the lute ; then Raynald, the impulsive, fiery knight who came to the castle one day, after an exhausting wild boar hunt, to ask her for a cup of mead. Sometimes her lonely woman’s eye even rested on the sturdy chaplain. But quickly she turned her glance away from the homespun habit which she saw from the back rising up like a great black column, so as to leave no time for bad thoughts to take root in her heart. At such times she felt the icy breath of the Old Lady’s soul blowing up from the vault with a new force and her eyes would turn remorsefully to the dark crack in the loose flagstone. No man had entered her room for six long years, Sclaramonde wanted to punish the Lord Béranger for not giving her a last glance as he crossed the drawbridge. Yet she did not feel lonely: she knew the small familiar noise which the worms made as they gnawed the beam and the gurgle of the raindrops, as they ran down the gargoyle’s throat. She always knew what the weather was like outside from the crackling of the fire, and, when in the summer, she left the casement window open, she heard the plaintive cawing of the jackdaws wheeling round the old keep. But the incorporeal tapestry was her most faithful companion— those pale, faded blue and grey figures out of an Old Testament story, embroidered on the cloth by an unknown master of long ago. There was the Nile, rippling with blue and grey waves, on the shore, the 68 [pageend68]Pharaoh’s daughter was idling with her grey and blue ladies-in-waiting, surrounded by dusky guards. A young slave with a girlish face had been thrown prostrate at the Princess’s feet. His forehead was scarred with a scar or a slave’s brand mark or perhaps it was only that the thread was more worn just there. Two steps more and the Sun-King’s daughter would find the cradle in faded colours where the infant Moses was rocking in a blue forest of bulrushes. But the Egyptian ladies with their blue hair and grey faces would never take those two steps and the young slave would never rise from the ground. Time had stopped on the old tapestry—it had stopped twice: thousands of years ago, and also as the master weaver’s skilful fingers finished tying the last knot in these once bright threads, now faded to two colours only. Two moments had remained fixed forever in the tapestry in the bride’s room: the moment before the discovery of Moses, and the moment when the master’s hand put the finishing touch to his work. Sclaramonde felt all this and she fretted at the knowledge that she was powerless to change it. Whenever the wind from the mountains howled in the chimney, shaking the blue and grey tapestry, she hoped that a powerful gust would strip the leaves from the bulrushes and reveal the cradle so that the Pharaoh’s daughter would take the pale baby in her arms or that the slave with the young girl’s face would leap up and kiss the princess on the mouth. Only the dusky guards would remain motionless. Many a time and oft had she dreamed that she was the Sun King’s mischievous daughter, in airy veils and adorned with necklaces, and that she was holding out her arms to the young slave at her feet and embracing him. She would have ordered the ladies-inwaiting to leave the tapestry immediately. 69 [pageend69]Then came the brusque awakening, and the light shone. The tapestry danced in time with the flames. Sclaramonde left her bed, unashamed, and pressed her hot face against the faded cloth. She could feel the coldness of the thick wall through the stuff. Her lips were exactly on a level with the slave’s forehead —just there, where the artist’s fancy had drawn a mark or a soar. Sclaramonde closed her eyes, as if in expectancy. But nothing happened. The Lord Béranger did not return. The Lady Sclaramonde could not sleep. But now she knew that the night held something in store. The invisible traces of her perspiration bruised her body like burning chains—her body which was hardly thirty years old, but had been abandoned for six long years. The embers glowed brightly and almost burst into flame. The breath of winter sent long ripples through the tapestry. Yes. The Pharaoh’s daughter had moved ........ as if she were feeling her necklace with tentative fingers—that necklace made of a myriad small sharp-edged pieces, which Sclaramonde had so often seen round her own neck in her dreams. She saw her move quite distinctly, and the blue and grey waves of the Nile rippled too. Yes. Something was going to happen that night. Then she started ; a horn sounded shrilly in the watch-tower. Someone was demanding admittance, Sclaramonde (dosed her heavy eyelids. She knew that the Lord Béranger was coming back. Two halberdiers bearing torches accompanied him to the door of the nuptial chamber. A sleepy servant made haste to stir up the fire. The rekindled flames banished the wind, lengthened the shadows and made the Pharaoh’s daughter still again. Only the Lady Sclaramonde’s face became whiter in the dancing 70 [pageend70]scarlet light. She lay motionless, her breast quickly rising and falling. It hurt her to breathe. She was bound down by her perspiration. She had tried to get up several times since that blast on the horn. In her mind’s eye, she pictured the scene: now they are letting down the drawbridge; now they are calling thé halberdier on guard; he is baring his head; he is passing under the portcullis; he is crossing the main building. But she could not carry out her desire to get up. She had silenced so many desires, driven them away so often by sheer willpower over the years. So she stayed where she was, lying motionless. Her hair was undone and the sleepless night had left crow’s feet round her eyes, but some sage balm would soon take them away. So she was not even thirty yet. But who would think of such trifles and who would dare advise the chatelaine? She had not even passed a coinb through her hair. Her eyes turned to the blue and grey princess, the princess who would always remain two steps away from the infant Moses, lying motionless in his rocking crib. The blue bedcurtains hung down from the vastness of the dim half-light like a dark shroud from an ink-black sky and the columns supporting the ceiling seemed to have dwindled to incorporeal slenderness. The door creaked and torch-light flooded the room. The Lord Béranger came slowly towards the bed, with the torches behind him. They shone on the gold and azure coat of arms and lit up the motto carved out below: “Do et Morior”. The Lord Béranger remained wrapped in darkness, a black silk figure outlined against gold and scarlet. A long look passed between them. Then the Lord Béringer made a sign to the halberdiers, bidding them begone. He used bis left hand; his right band hung at his side, indistinguishable, from the black mass of 71 [pageend71]his hody. They remained alone, the three of them: the Lady Sclaramonde, the Lord Béranger and the fire crackling in the hearth. “My Lord, yon left me without a glance, six years ago.” “We besieged Jerusalem.” “I have taken care of the castle and all your domain is intact. What drought and disease took from us, hard work and prayer have given back.” “. . . Thirst! Hast thou ever known real thirst? I wandered in the desert seven days and seven nights. Stone and moving sand. A foreign, hostile sky. I buried two of my brave warriors in the sand. Then two more and again two more. . . We were near Diarbékir. Thirst is worse than all the Saracens in the world ...” “I could not chase the jackdaws away from the dungeon. Yet I had all their nests knocked down with, poles. They still caw just as they did the day you left me.” “I should like to go down to the crypt.” “At dead of night?” “I wish to take leave of my ancestors.” “But my Lord, thou hast just arrived.” The Lord Béranger stopped in front of the fireplace. He threw an oak log into the fire with his left hand. A shower of startled sparks flew up in the wake of the wind. Then, calmly, so placing himself in the circle of light that Sclaramonde could see him clearly, he suddenly rolled up the right sleeve of his doublet and, impassively, placed his forearm, black with sores, on the log. Sclaramonde had not the strength to turn the eyes away. Béranger’s voice seemed to come to her from another world. “Woman, I come to bid farewell. To-morrow I 72 [pageend72]shall take the rattle in my good hand and I shall not rest till I come to the hospice of Saint-Lazarus. The monks will have pity on me, as they have on all lepers.” “. . . the desert?” “Yes. In the desert—or in the bazaar of Antioch, or in the foul alleys of Ikonum.” The drops of sweat changed into icicles in the creases of the Lady Sclaramonde’s supine body. “. . . First a little blue spot, a slight shivering or a short-lived headache. Then hot and cold spasms, cramps, gangrene and last of all, insensibility. Vainly I touched holy relics, vainly I went round Golgotha twice, on my knees, . . . Ah I woman, how greatly must I have sinned.” “Thou gavest me not a glance as thou didst cross the drawbridge. . (Yes, had he but given her a glance, Sclaramonde would now draw to her breast that head so prematurely ageil by hardship and ravaged by disease, and humbly would she press her lips to the most loathsome sores on that lifeless arm. But she had no cause for repentance, no sins to be forgiven, and so she lay quiet as she was, gazing at the grey and blue daughter of the Pharaoh.) The sickening stench of burnt flesh spread through the room. “Come now to the crypt!” She rose without a word. Silently she held the stump of the torch to the flames. Then she raised it above the Lord Béranger’s head. Let the light shine rather on the vaulted ceiling, the tapestry, and the motto: “Do et Morior”. The Lord Béranger felt with his left hand in the pocket of the wide pilgrim’s coat which the weavers of Damascus had woven him from soft camel’s hair. 73 [pageend73]“I have brought this for thee, woman. From the desert”—he added. A metal object clanged against the mantelpiece. ‘‘Come !” They went without a word. Their steps rang out against the flags of the passage, the steps of the spiral staircase and then the gallery. They entered the chapel. First the black figure of the Lord Béranger, then the Lady Sclaramonde, with her face of marble. The torch shone high in her hand. Silently they seized the iron ring in the heavy stone. The crypt gaped darkly open and a cold draught blew up the steep, narrow steps, as if the Old Lady were rising from the tomb to greet her son. Béranger stepped down, moving heavily; the steps were very narrow. Sclaramonde beni down behind him. Then, with a sudden movement, she plunged the flaming torch into the heavy folds of the camel-hair coat—there, against the right sleeve, where the festering arm could not feel the scalding drops of resin. The coat took fire. She threw the torch into the narrow entrance. Then, willing her trembling body to a terrible effort, she sent the stone crashing down. The crypt was closed. A heavy fall, a dying cry came faintly from far, far away. Sclaramonde pressed her eye to the crack in the loose flag stone and stayed there, motionless, until the last red glow had faded away in the depths of the vault. It was there, face down on the flag-stones that the Chaplain found her next morning, as if in prayer. Then she shook with fever for days on end. When she regained consciousness, her first words were an order. Her voice rang clear and hard as it always liad for the last six years: “The door of the crypt—wall it up!” No one in the castle had ever dared contradiet her. 74 [pageend74]Hardly had the bearer of the order left the room than the Lady Selaramonde’s eyes turned to the blue and grey tapestry. Nothing had happened. They were together again. Alone. The Lord Béranger would never return. Her watchful eyes narrowed. She lifted her hand to lier head. Then suddenly her eyes opened wide. Yes, the scene on the wall still held those two moments frozen, impassively, for all time. But something had undoubtedly changed. Something had disturbed that age-old stillness. Yes, she was right. The Pharaoh’s daughter no longer had the necklace of sharp-edged silver pieces round her neck. Otherwise, all was as before. The dreamy smiles of the ladies-in-waiting, the dusky guards, the bulrushes, and the infant Moses waiting to be found. The slave with the girlish face was still prostrate as before. But the silver necklace had gone. Pensively, Selaramonde went over to the fireplace to have a closer look. Iler legs had become weak since the fever. She leaned against the mantelpiece. Her fingers (dosed on something. She did not look, but abstractedly played with it. Her fingers felt the coldness of metal. What was it? She looked: a necklace, the same as the one which, the Pharaoh’s daughter had worn on the incorporeal tapestry. The Lady Selaramonde made the sign of the cross. Then she fastened the ornament around her neck, as she had done so often in her dreams—in those dreams in which she had been waiting. . . The necklace felt cold, like the touch of the sweat of desire! But she would desire no more. She moved slowly towards the door, to see the domain, the fields, the pasture land, the forests, the village. As every day for the last six years, her face was as white as marble. [pageend75]Her hands, still trembling, left the door ajar. The plaintive cawing and endless wheeling of the jackdaws began again. A gust of wind from the dawn blew through the half-open door, stirred up a handful of cold as lies and set the blue and grey tapestry swaying. ALBERT VAJDA PETNAMES FOR EDGAR This morning was no different from any other. Elly slipped into her dressing gown, hurried into the kitchen and put the kettle on, humming pleasantly. Edgar crawled sleepily out of bed and lurched towards the bathroom muttering unpleasantly. Soon he emerged and, walking rather more briskly now, took his place at the breakfast table and picked up the morning paper. It was just an ordinary morning like any other. According to his habit, Edgar took cover behind his newspaper, crackling it sharply and uttering little grunts as he reacted to the news. “How very nice it would be,” thought Elly, “if now and then, maybe just once or twice in a year, he would talk and joke at breakfast the way he did when we were on our honeymoon ! But that’s all over now and all he cares about is that stupid paper and, of course, the pools!” These and similar wifely thoughts passed drearily through her mind as she poured tea and sat down opposite her preoccupied spouse. “Don’t let it get cold,” she said. “The tea is ready, Monkey-face.” 76 [pageend76]In response to lier coaxing, Edgar gave a finial angry rustle of newspaper and, with an impatient exclamation, revealed himself. Elly stifled a scream. A monkey had appeared from behind the paper. “Something’s the matter?”, the monkey asked, speaking in Edgar’s voice. Elly laughed delightedly. How wonderful if all her wishes were so quickly granted! Only a few seconds ago she had been thinking that all the fun was gone out of him and now he had put on that screamingly funny mask to amuse her. “Where on earth did you get it?”, she giggled. “Where did I get what?”. The monkey’s voice was savage. Elly’s giggles died away. It didn’t sound as if Edgar were joking. “Well, you do look exactly like a monkey.” “You must be out of your mind.” The monkey bristled ferociously. “What the devil are you talking about?” “Please, darling, don’t be cross. I thought you’d put that monkey head on for fun.” There was a silence charged with tension. Then, Edgar’s hand went slowly up to his head. Hesitantly at first, then frantically, his fingers investigated the hairy face. Violently he leaped from his chair, upsetting the table as he fled to the bathroom. He was back again in a minute, fairly jumping with rage and dismay in the kitchen doorway. “This is what your damfool petnames have brought about,” the monkey gibbered. “For years I have begged and implored you not to call me Honeykins, Eddykins, Bumbo, Tootoo or any of the other imbecilities that delight your infantile mind. All to no purpose. You wokln’t listen! Finally, you’ve done it ! Your crass stupidity has ruined me and brought [pageend77]about this tragic .metamorphosis.” Edgar sobbed with fury. “Monkey-face, indeed! Well, now you see the results of your work and I suppose you’re pleased with yourself.” Elly would have liked to say something consoling, but she couldn’t think of anything fitting. Nevertheless some comment had to be made. “Perhaps it’s only temporary,” she ventured. “Just a nine days’ wonder. ’ ’ “Thank you very much,” the monkey said nastily, “you really do relieve my mind.” Elly swallowed hard. Edgar had not been the easiest of persons in human form. What would he become now? It is common knowledge that monkeys are irritable and extremely quarrelsome. But there was no time for despondent thoughts. The office would have to be told something to account for Edgar’s absence. Elly sprang into action and telephoned the manager, giving him a convincing account of a sudden and excruciatingly painful headache. “After all,” she reflected, “it isn’t really far removed from the truth. So great a change must surely be very painful.” Her conscience appeased, she hurried out and bought a supply of nuts, bananas, apples and other food she thought suitable for her transformed husband. She also bought a book entitled “The Training and Care of Monkeys”. Nine days passed. Nobody suspected Edgar’s predicament despite a certain amount of malicious gossip on the part of the milkman. This worthy put it about that, happening to glance at a window in Edgar’s house, he had seen a pyjama-clad monkey swinging- on a chandelier while attempting to shave itself with an electric razor. Fortunately, this story was not believed by the neighbours who were inclined to think 78 [pageend78]tliât tlie milkman liati been drinking deep from other bottles than those he was employed to distribute. On the morning of the ninth day Elly opened her eyes to cope with yet another day of monkey-training. Wearily she glanced at Edgar’s bed and, wonder of wonders, the monkey had gone and there was Edgar’s head on the pillow. Squealing with joy, she ran to him and threw her arms around his neck. “You’re back, you’re back, you’re back,” she cried. Edgar sneered. “You’re back, you’re back, you’re back,” he echoed in a mean imitation of Elly’s joyful soprano. “You naughty boy, you’re mocking me like ,a wicked old parro. . .”. She clenched her teeth and swallowed the rest of the word. Too late ! She was holding a parrot in her arms. And what a parrot ! Down to the ankles the huge fowl was covered with brilliant green feathers. But the feet had remained Edgar’s<— large, flat and encased in battered old bedroom slippers. “You idiot! You brainless fool!” Edgar’s voice grated through the beak like gravel. “It would have been better if you had completed the word and finished the job properly. If it weren’t for these damned feet I’d fly anywhere to get away from your stupidity.” He turned a malignant, beady eye on his feet which would certainly have made even the shortest flight extremely difficult. Elly lapsed into a despairing silence, but soon became aware of her responsibilities and dutifully scattered a variety of birdseeds on the carpet. Edgar, grumbling and squawking, picked them up and greedily cracked them in his formidable beak. Elly began to laugh hysterically. She was truly sorry for Edgar in his undignified predicament, but a riot of laughter seized her. The sight of a man79 [pageend79]sized parrot shuffling about ou slippered, human feet was too much for her and the stream of bad language punctuated by the loud cracking of seeds did nothing to subdue her guilty mirth. After all, parrots are amusing creatures, and when a wife hears her husband’s voice emerging in wrath from the beak of a feathered monster, a little emotion is understandable. Nine days passed again. On the morning of the tenth, Elly was awakened by a hand pressed heavily over her mouth. Edgar, restored to his original form and shape, stood beside her bed. “Listen to me,” he said. “Listen very carefully. I solemnly warn you not to call me by any name other than my own. I’ve got a perfectly good name. Use it and nothing else!” Elly nodded in desperate agreement. “I will. Oh, I will! I promise to be very careful.” The next few weeks passed without serious incident. True, there were nine days when Edgar became a slice of apple pie following a carelessly affectionate “Sweetie Pie” from Elly. During this period there was an ugly moment when Elly was just in time to prevent a visitor's child snatching Edgar from the plate on which lie was resting. Having saved him from an ignominious engulf ment, Elly locked him in a cupboard. But the pie phase came to an end. Life became more normal and Edgar less crusty. It began to seem, indeed, that their marriage had weathered the storms of Edgar’s unhappy transformations to find anchorage in serene domesticity. So it seemed. Unfortunately, the anchor was not secure enough. It happened that one afternoon a friend of Elly’s looked in for a cosy woman-to-woman natter over the teacups. Their conversation was not profound and, as may well be supposed, it was not long before they were 80 [pageend80]exchanging confidences as to the failings of husbands. Let it be made clear that there was no acrimony. It was no more than a duet of wives reciting, with indulgent little smiles, the age-old tale of man’s imperfection. Words like “selfish”, “lazy”, “illnatured” and “insensitive” were gently voiced in this teatime plaint of ladies. But enough is enough. When the catalogue of Edgar’s faults had been sufficiently impressed upon the commiserating friend, Elly felt better disposed towards her wayward husband. “I shouldn’t be complaining, really,” she exclaimed generously, “compared with many men, my Edgar is an angel.” The expression of womanly forgiveness had scarcely been uttered when fear gripped her. A distraught Elly dashed to the telephone. She controlled her sobs as she dialled the office number. One of Edgar’s colleagues answered. “He’s not here at the moment, but he should be back quite soon. Can 1 give him any message? As a matter of fact,” the man went on, “a rather strange thing happened a few minutes ago. Your husband and I were chatting over tea witli some of our colleagues when there was suddenly an unbearably bright light and a noise like the beating of great wings. I imagine that your husband has popped out to see if there is anything about it in the newspapers.” Elly put down the receiver. For a time she did not worry unduly. This, too, would be a nine days’ wonder and the last of these transformations—even if she had to gag herself for the future. On the ninth day, she waited for Edgar’s reappearance. But she waited in vain. This time he had disappeared completely. Time passed. Elly became despondent and without hope. She never heard of Edgar again. That is to say, she never heard any real news of him. It is true that 81 [pageend81]her rather dissolute brother claimed to have seen him in a Birmingham pub. The story went that Edgar was in the company of an attractive red-head and that he was knocking back large gins with terrible rapidity. “What struck me as rather peculiar,” said Elly’s brother, “was the way he would put his glass on the counter and stare into the red-head’s face uttering, with, ferocious concentration, endearments like ‘Little bird’, ‘pussy cat’, Tittle mouse’ and so- forth.” But Elly’s brother was not at all a reliable type and she didn’t believe the story. After all, who could believe that an angel would behave like that? HUNGARIAN BOOKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLAND Lajos Zilahy: KRISZTINA ÉS A KIRALY 18/6 Sandor Márai: BÉKE ITHAKÁBAN George Mikes: EGY HIJJÁN HUSZ 18/6 18/6 Lincolns-Prager Publishers Ltd. 3 Kenton Street, London, W.C.1. 82 [pageend82]FORUM ELMER RICE THE SUPREME FREEDOM *) On June 14, 1643, the two houses of the English Parliament enacted a law, which provided that no book, or other publication, “shall from henceforth be printed or put to sale, unless the same be first approved of and licensed by such person or persons as both or either of the said Houses shall appoint for the licensing of the same.” Against this establishment of a censorship of the printed word, the poet, John Milton, prepared a speech addressed to the Houses of Parliament. This speech, entitled Areopagitica—a name derived from the Areopagus, an Athenian hill, upon which in ancient times, a council of elders convened—remains, after three hundred years, perhaps the greatest statement of the case for free speech, that has ever been written. Forceful, fearless, incisive and imbued with eloquence and moral fervor, it is a veritable charter of human liberty, whose principles and arguments are as applicable today as they were in the England of the Stuarts. Perhaps even more applicable, for books were relatively scarce in seventeenth-century England, newspapers were unknown, and so only the educated and well-to-do had access to the printed word. In the intervening years, universal education, accompanied by improved methods of printing, the establishment and *) This essay by the distinguished American playwright, novelist and essayist was written in 1949 but its conclusions and warnings are just as valid as thirteen years ago. 83 [pageend83]growth of the daily newspaper, and the invention and proliferation of new means of communication have made the written word available to almost every member of our society, and have given it a potency unparalleled in history. To those, therefore, who believe that unrestricted freedom of expression is essential to the preservation and development of democracy, it is important that the principles underlying this belief be constantly reaffirmed, and their current application vigilantly scrutinized. Milton’s opposition to censorship is based upon cultural, moral, psychological, and political grounds, and a brief review of his arguments is a useful preliminary to an examination of the present-day state of freedom of expression. A profound student of the classics, and himself one of the great figures in English literature. Milton knew well the importance of books in our cultural heritage and the danger of attempting to stifle the expressions of the human mind and the human spirit. “Books are not absolutely dead things” he says “but do contain a potency of life in them to be as active as that soul was whose progeny they are; nay, they do preserve as in a vial the purest efficacy and extraction of that living intellect that bred them. 1 know they are as lively, and as vigorously productive, as those fabulous dragon’s teeth; and being sown up and down, may chance to spring up armed men. And yet, on the other hand, unless wariness be used, as good almost kill a man as kill a good book. Who kills a man kills a reasonable creature, God’s image; but he who destroys a good book, kills reason itself, kills the image of God, as it were in the eye. Many a man lives a burden to the earth; but a good book is the precious life-blood of a master spirit, embalmed and treasured up on purpose to a life beyond life. ’Tis 84 [pageend84]true, no age can restore a. life, whereof perhaps there is no great loss; and revolutions of ages do not oft recover the loss of a rejected truth, for the want of which whole nations fare the worse. We should be warp therefore, what persecution we raise against the living labours of public men, how we spill that seasoned life- of man, preserved and stored up in books; since we see a kind of homicide may be thus committed, sometimes a martyrdom, and if it extend to the whole impression, a kind of massacre; whereof the execution ends not in the slaying of an elemental life, but strikes at that ethereal and, fifth essence, the breath of reason itself, slays an immortality rather than a life.” But he does not rest his ease there. He goes on to advance moral and philosophical arguments against the suppression of books, pointing out that we cannot know what is good unless we know what is evil, that we can recognize truth only by distinguishing it from falsehood. In terms of which modern psychiatrists might well approve, he tells us that virtue is not attained by shutting our eyes to wickedness but by confronting evil and overcoming it. “Since therefore the knowledge and survey of vice is in this world so necessary to the constituting of human virtue, and the scanning of error to the confirmation of truth, how can we more safely, and, with less danger, scout into the regions of sin and falsity than by reading all manner of tractates and hearing all manner of reason? And this is the benefit which, may be had of books promiscuously read.” Next, his satiric comments on the futility of attempting to alter or improve human nature by repressive measures might be read with profit by all the would-be censors of today. “If we think to regulate printing, thereby to rectify manners,” says Mil85 [pageend85]ton, “we must regulate all recreations and pastimes, all that is delightf ul to man. No music must be heard, no song be set or sung, but what is grave and Doric. There must be licensing dances, that no gesture, motion or deportment be taught our youth but what by their allowance shall be thought honest. . . . Next, what more national corruption . . . than household gluttony?. . . Our garments also should, be referred to the licensing of some more sober workmasters to see them cut into a less wanton garb. Who shall regulate all the mixed, conversation of our youth, male and female together, as is the fashion of this country?. . . Lastly:;, who shall forbid, and separate all idle resort, all evil company?” Finally, lie considers the political aspects of censorship: the need for full and free discussion of all social problems, and the dangers to human freedom inherent both in despotisms and in the encroachments of bureaucracy: “When complaints are freely heard, deeply considered, and speedily reformed, then is the utmost bound, of civil liberty attained that wise men look for.” And upon the abuse of governmental power: “The state shall be my governors, but not my critics; they may be mistaken in the choice of a licensor as easily as this licensor may be mistaken in an author. . . . For though a licensor should happen to be judicious more than ordinary . . . yet his very office and his commission enjoin him to let pass nothing but what is vulgarly received already.” And, by the mere substitution of a few names, we could easily find more than one modern application for these words: “J could recount what I have seen and heard in other countries, where this kind of inquisition terrorizes . . . This was it which had. damped the glory of Italian wits; that nothing had been there written now these many years but flattery and fustian. There it was 86 [pageend86]that I found and visited the famous Galileo, grown old a prisoner to the Inquisition for thinking in astronomy otherwise than the Franciscan and. Dominican I ic en sors thought. ’ ’ When we ponder Milton’s arguments, we do not know whether to marvel more at his wisdom or at the stubborn resistance of humanity to libertarian ideas. For it is a lamentable fact that, three centuries after Milton, the majority of mankind lives under governments that ruthlessly restrict freedom of expression; and even in societies where the very concept of free expression has no acceptance. Indeed, if is only in the democratic countries of the English- speaking world, and of western Europe, that this freedom prevails, both in priciple and, to a greater or less extent in practice. THE SITUATION IN ENGLAND Glance briefly at the state of affairs in England: as far as the publication of books is concerned, Milton’s arguments seem to have won acceptance. There is today no licensing of books, nor any prepublication restriction upon printing. However, the English libel laws are so stringent, that no publisher will run the risk of printing anything that might conceivably reflect unfavorably on any living person. There are also laws against so-called obscenity, which subject offenders to fines and prison terms. So that while there is no official censorship, these laws act as deterrents to publishers and, in effect, constitute a considerable restriction upon freedom of publication. *) In the English theatre'—and it must be borne in mind that Milton’s arguments apply not only to books *) These laws have been substantially modified and to a considerable extent liberalized since 1949. (Editors, Ar e na .) 87 [pageend87]but to all means of expression—there is considerably less freedom; for here an official censorship actually exists. By the Licensing Act of 1737 (passed nearly a century after the Areopagitica), the Lord Chamberlain’s office was given power to license plays for production. This act is still in effect. No play can be “publicly” performed in England, unless it is licensed. This has put a severe limitation upon the English theatre, resulting, for example, in such absurdities as the banning of Shelley’s great tragedy, The Cenci, because it deals with incest, a subject apparently considered unfit, by the Lord Chamberlain’s office, for presentation to the British public. In spite of numerous attacks upon the licensing act by leading figures in English letters and public life, it is still in effect. To some extent, it is circumvented by the device of giving “subscription” performances of prohibited plays. These, it seems, do not constitute “public” performances. This, of course, is mere evasion, and the plain fact is that the British theatre is still subjected to official censorship. In England, radio and television are under the sole jurisdiction of the British Broadcasting Corporation, a quasi-public body. No advertising’ of any kind is permitted upon radio and television programs, and there is no commercial “sponsorship.” The BBC is not only a non-profit-making organization but it does not derive its revenue from the sale of air time, as is the case in America. Consequently, the pressures exerted by advertisers upon the American radio are absent in England. This undoubtedly makes for greater freedom in the selection of program material. But, on the other hand, there is the danger to freedom that always arises from monopolistic control, no matter how enlightened or disinterested. Freedom of expression can best be assured in any channel of communi- 88 [pageend88]cation by diversity of ownership and control. Under monopolistic control, final decisions must always be made by ia few individuals, whose judgment will inevitably be colored by their particular set of opinions and prejudices. It is obvious that when an organization works in close cooperation with the government, there is a real danger that it might be somewhat less than wholly impartial in a time of political crisis. CENSORSHIP IN AMERICA The inquirer into the status of freedom of expression in the United States encounters many difficulties. It is almost impossible to make any statement regarding any of the channels of expression without hedging it about with elaborate explanations and reservations. This is due to a number of contributing factors: the federal framework of our government, with its overlapping jurisdictions of national, state (and sometimes even municipal) authorities; the tripartite division of governmental functions, with the consequent conflicts among the executive, legislative and judicial branches; the difficulties involved in dealing with newly discovered and rapidly expanding forms of communication; the increasing tendency toward industrialization and concentration of ownership of all means of communication; and the influences and pressures—sometimes indefinable and intangible—exerted not only by advertisers, but by numerous groups within a community, organized for the purpose of furthering some special interest. The principle of freedom of expression was brought to these shores by the English colonists of the seventeenth century, as part of their cultural and political baggage. In the early years of the American republic, Congress enacted the First Amendment to the Constitution, which provides that “Congress shall make 89 [pageend89]no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.” Thus, a century and a half after Milton, the American Congress reaffirmed the principle for which he pleaded, making it one of the foundation-stones of our governmental system and public policy. There are few Americans who are not familiar with it; there is almost no public man who does not extol its wisdom and stress the necessity for its strict enforcement. Yet, in spite of the universal acceptance of the free speech principle as part of the American heritage, and an essential constituent of the democratic structure, we find that today, as in Milton’s day, there are large numbers of individuals and of groups who seek (often with success) to place restrictions upon freedom of expression: on moral grounds, on religious grounds— or, to put it another way, from motives of fear, bigotry, opportunism, or self-interest. Milton’s strictures are as applicable to the anti-libertarians of our day as they were to those of his. The fact that our channels of communication are to so great an extent free from restrictions is attributable to the vigilant resistance by public-spirited men and women to attempted encroachments ; and to the spirit of independence that is a happy characteristic of the generality of the American population. BOOKS IN AMERICA What then are the facts concerning freedom of. expression in present day America? In the field of book publication—the subject of Mil ton’s discourse— there are relatively few restrictions. There is no licensing of books; that is to say, no precensorship. Anyone is free to publish what he chooses ; authors who are unable to find a willing publisher can, if 90 [pageend90]they like, publish and -circulate their own writings at relatively small cost. And our libel laws are so much less stringent than England’s that any writer who does not flagrantly distort the truth can say, without fear of penalty, almost anything he wants to say about anyone. However, certain important limitations must be noted. The federal powers to regulate imports and interstate commerce have been used as a pretext for vesting censorial authority in the hands of administrative officials of the Treasury and Post Office Departments: in the case of the former, by denying entry into the United States of books published abroad, and of the latter, by excluding books from the mails, or denying to publications the privilege of cheap, second- class postal rates which, in effect, amounts to censorship by the use of economic -sanctions. There can be little doubt that the exercise of these powers constitutes an abridgment of freedom of expression within the meaning of the First Amendment, as well as a violation of the spirit of the Fourteenth Amendment, which, prohibits the deprivation of life, liberty or property without due process of law. It must be put down to the credit of our courts (particularly the higher ones) that in recent years they have shown a tendency to overrule the findings of administrative officials, and to enforce the free speech principle. In some instances, however, procedural difficulties make it almost impossible to obtain a judical review, or even a fair hearing before the administrative tribunal. Furthermore, outside the limits of federal jurisdiction, there exist, in numerous communities, agencies with authority to seize allegedly objectionable books and to prosecute their publishers. Such authority is usually delegated to, or arrogated by, local police 91 [pageend91]officials, or, as in the case of New York City, to individuals like the late Anthony Comstock or his successor, John S. Sumner, leaders of self-constituted organizations for the “suppression of vice,” that have been endowed with police powers by local ordinance. It would be difficult to find anyone less qualified to exercise powers of censorship than are these police officials and professional moral crusaders, whose livelihood depends upon their zeal in discovering improper books (though, as Milton points out, there is no one who is really qualified for such an office). Thus, in New York, Philadelphia, Boston and other communities, we frequently see the undignified and undemocratic spectacle of police raids upon legitimate bookshops and publishing houses; and of authors of literary repute, and publishers of good standing being subjected to the indignities of public denigration and even of criminal prosecution. The basis of these attacks is usually the alleged obscenity of the hooks in question. The penal codes of most of our states make obscenity a criminal offense. But although nearly all statutory crimes are susceptible of fairly exact definition and measurable by tests that have been well established by centuries of judicial decisions, obscenity lends itself to no such definition. It is no more than an epithet which is definable only in terms of a long chain of synonymous epithets, that eventually lead one back to the point of beginning. It is generally agreed by modern psychologists that the concept of obscenity is entirely subjective, incapable of determination by objective criteria, and varying with time, place, circumstance, and particularly with the psychological conditioning of the individual. It is amazing how hard it is to make the average person accept this fact. Sexual taboos and sexual inhibitions, often associated with 92 [pageend92]unconscious guilt feelings, are so strongly implanted that it is a hardy individual indeed who will admit that his anxiety to protect his neighbor’s morals is but the outward manifestation of his own psychological conflicts. (Milton quotes with approval Saint Paul’s dictum “Unto the pure, all things are pure”; and a modern skeptic has amended this to read “To the pure all things are impure”). Consequently, even well-intentioned libertarians, who, like Voltaire, are prepared to fight to the death for any man’s right to utter any religious or political heresy, will balk at the unqualified application of the free speech principle to matters of sexual or moral behavior. THE AMERICAN THEATRE The American theatre, unlike the English, is free from pre-censorship. Plays are not required to be licensed. The sole determinant of what shall be presented upon the stage is the taste or judgment of the theatrical producer. Since it costs a great deal more to produce a play than it does to publish a book, the manager who assumes the financial risk is, of course, governed largely by his opinion of the play’s potentialities as a box-office attraction. But, as with books, the demand for good plays is usually far in excess of the supply, so that almost any actable play is likely to find its way into the hands of someone who will chance its production. In the so-called non-commerci al theatre—which consists mainly of amateur or subsidized groups—the economic factor is relatively unimportant, and here presumably the chief determinant is the merit of the particular play or its suitability to the capacities of the producing group. However, since most of these groups are in educational institutions or in small communities, with a limited audience, the director or producer is usually 93 [pageend93]governed in His choice of plays by his knowledge of the religious, moral, and political predilections or prejudices of the community, so that this social factor must be taken into account as a determinant. All this, however, does not constitute censorship, but merely represents the normal operation of any enterprise that is dependent upon public support or favor. It should be pointed out, though, that repeated attempts have been made to establish a theatre censorship, particularly in New York, the chief center of professional play production. The defeat of these efforts to restrict freedom of expression in the theatre has been due mainly to the vigilance of organized groups within the theatre: the Dramatists’ Guild, the League of New York Theatres, the Actors’ Equity Association, and other professional unions. In certain communities, notably Boston, police officials or minor political appointees exercise censorial powers and, upon threat of prohibiting the performance of a play, demand excisions or modifications that are based upon some wholly arbitrary standard of propriety. In some instances, the entire play actually is banned. To cite only one striking example: a few years ago Strange Interlude, a play written by Eugene O’Neill, generally recognized as one of the world’s foremost dramatists, and which had been awarded the Pulitzer Prize, was barred from the city of Boston by the police censorship. Thereupon, the producers of the play put up a large tent, just outside the jurisdiction of the municipality, and the eager theatre-goers of Boston flocked by the thousands to see the play performed. In New York, under a law regulating the licensing of theatres, the Commissioner of Licenses has repeatedly brought pressure to bear upon theatre owners who housed plays considered objectionable by some influential minority in the community; and in some 94 [pageend94]instances the theatre owner, fearing a revocation of his license, has compelled the producer of the play to withdraw it. This flagrant abuse of a purely administrative function has been subjected to some court tests, but as yet there has been no really clear determination of the issue. Numerous projects to set up “play juries” or a “voluntary censorship” of the theatre have come to nothing, thanks to the insistence of those professionally engaged in the theatre, upon their constitutional right of freedom of expression. The efforts to impose theatre censorship have been led mainly by ministers of religion. The theatre—for reasons that do not concern us here—has always been the whipping-boy of the clergy. In fact, fulminations against the stage are almost a routine part of certain pulpit performances, and this castigation is practised by the clergy of all denominations: Catholic, Protestant and Jewish. It might be expected that ministers of religion, jealous as they are of the constitutional right to freedom of belief, would also recognize the right of disbelief or of disagreement with their own standards of morality and propriety. This is far from being the case ; the clergyman who insists most fiercely upon the freedom of his pulpit is likely to make the most clamorous demands that the stage be shackled. These attacks upon the theatre are often characterized by a shocking- irresponsibility. A few years ago, a well-known clergyman declared, in a Sunday sermon, that the New York stage was given over entirely to the exhibition of what he called “filth.” This vehement diatribe was reported on the front pages of the Monday morning papers—when news is likely to be scarce anyhow. But when the minister (who had himself been under fire for some rather unorthodox utterances) was pressed for a bill of particulars, he admitted that he had not seen a single play then 95 [pageend95]current upon tlie New York stage! His denunciation was based solely upon a report of one of his female parishioners, in whose judgment he had great confidence. MASS COMMUNICATION The relative freedom of books and plays from restrictive controls or influences is due largely to the fact that their creation and dissemination are still, in the main, matters of individual enterprise. Further, while books and plays make more enduring contributions to the general stream of culture than do the ephemeral products of other forms of expression, they are also far more limited in their distribution. It is an exceptional book or play that can number its audience by the hundreds of thousands ; whereas news- papers and periodicals often number theirs by the millions, and radio programs and motion pictures by the tens of millions. And it is safe to say that those who habitually read books and attend the theatre constitute the most intelligent and most independent stratum of the population: people who understand the importance of civil liberties and are quick to resent any limitation of their right of freedom of choice and opinion. Conditions of book publication and play production, and the place of books and plays in the life of the community have not altered radically since Milton’s day; hence, as we have seen, his arguments are as relevant now as they were then. When we turn to what may be called the media of mass communication, we are confronted by a whole complex of factors undreamed of in Milton’s time, and even not fully understood in our own: so recent and so rapid has been the development of these instruments of expression. Newspapers and periodicals had their beginnings in 96 [pageend96]tlie eighteenth century, but until the end of the nineteenth they too were largely individual enterprises: limited in circulation, and more or less expressive of the opinions of the editor or owner. The twentieth century has radically- altered this situation. The rapidity of territorial expansion and population growth, the invention of power presses, the speeding up of distribution, perhaps most of all, the increasing dependence upon advertising, have combined to mechanize and industrialize the production of newspapers and magazines, and to lessen the element of individual expression. So that while, strictly speaking, there is not, and lias never been an official censorship of the press in the United States, the process of industrialization has given rise to certain economic factors that powerfully influence the policies and contents of newspapers and magazines. Theoretically, anyone may publish a newspaper or magazine and print whatever he may see fit, without governmental interference or control (except for postal regulations, obscenity laws, and so on, already referred to). The great importance of this right cannot be underestimated. It has been repeatedly affirmed by nearly all leaders of public opinion, and reinforced by opinions of the United States Supreme Court, notably those of Justices Holmes and Brandeis. Thanks to the constitutional formulation and judicial enforcement of this wise and liberal public policy, there are in the United States publications that deal with almost every conceivable subject, and express almost every point of view ; a condition wholly unlike that prevailing in countries where the press exists only by grace of the government and reflects only the opinions of those who govern. The charges frequently made by the rigidly controlled press of the Soviet Union that there is no free press in the United States, 97 [pageend97]because tlie machinery of publication is entirely in the hands of a few capitalists, are doubly ludicrous, as anyone who lias even a nodding acquaintance with our Communist, Socialist, labor and liberal publications can testify. However, as has been suggested, the influence of economic factors upon the freedom of the press deserves serious consideration. While everyone has the right to print what he chooses, the machinery of printing and distribution is so complex, and the costs so high., that large scale publication is practically impossible, unless one is well supplied with capital; even small scale publications find it hard io maintain themselves, without continuous subsidies. Secondly, all flourishing publications today are largely supported by advertising revenue. The larger the circulation of the publication, the more attractive it is to the advertiser, and the higher the rate that the publisher can charge. Almost inevitably, therefore, it becomes the aim of the publisher to increase his circulation to the utmost limits possible. To achieve this, it is usually deemed necessary to handle cautiously anything of a highly controversial nature, or anything that might conceivably give offense to a mass audience or run counter to the prejudices or -superstitions of its potential members. Hence the tendency is to put the emphasis upon what is safe, orthodox, and easily apprehended. (The importance of the economic determinant can be strikingly illustrated by contrasting the advertising material in popular magazines with -the literary content. No editor would publish a -story in which even the most oblique reference was made to such, subjects as body odors, constipation and menstruation. Yet, in the columns which adjoin the conventionalized and carefully-edited fiction may be found 98 [pageend98]graphie enticements to the purchase of deodorants, laxatives and sanitary appliances.) Not only the predilections of subscribers but the sensibilities of advertisers themselves must be taken into account. These advertisers, for the most part, are large corporations, whose managers are not inclined to favor far-reaching economic, social and political changes. To disregard this fact might mean the loss of a valuable advertising account. In many cases the tendency, therefore, is to avoid reference to such matters or to “slant” the discussion in the direction the advertisers favor. (Of course, in most cases, newspaper and magazine publishers honestly share the opinions of their advertisers.) Until very recently, for example, it was almost impossible to find in the pages of newspapers of large circulation a fair and objective treatment of any strike or other labor-management dispute. Today, papers like the New York Times, the New York Herald Tribune, and a few others attempt to give honest factual reports of all such controversial matters ; but these are honorable exceptions. But the greatest threat to unrestricted freedom of (be press is the growing tendency toward the industrialization of newspaper publication and toward monopoly ownership. It has been found increasingly profitable to apply mass production techniques to newspaper publication. Except for news of purely local character, most newspapers (especially outside the larger cities) rely almost entirely upon one of the three large press associations: the Associated Press, the United Press, and the International News Service. Furthermore, there is an ever-growing trend to uniformity of content. Feature stories, critical articles, columns of commentary or political analysis, cartoons, comic strips, even editorials, are widely syndicated, with resultant standardization and a loss 99 [pageend99]of that quality of individual expression which for- merly characterized journalism. Indeed, as one travels about the United States, one cannot fail to note a depressing uniformity in the make-up and contents of newspapers. As in other American industries, the process of mechanization has been accompanied by intensification of monopoly ownership. In the last few decades, in spite of the growth of population and of overall circulation figures, the number of newspapers has steadily declined. Small newspapers, like other small businesses, have been unable to compete with their powerful rivals; one by one they have been forced out of business or have been absorbed by their competitors, as witness the hyphenated names of many newspapers. Today American journalism is dominated largely by the great newspaper chains: Hearst, Scripps-Howard, McCormick-Patterson, Gannett, and others. In many cities of considerable size there is only one daily newspaper. Even when there are several, they are likely to be merely units in the great chains, with their policies directed from some remote central office. The small, independent newspaper, expressive of the personality and opinions of its publisher or editor, has disappeared almost entirely. The result is an alarming curtailment of that democratic diversity of expression which is essential to the formation of an enlightened public opinion. RADIO AS A PROBLEM All the pressures and tendencies described are to be found operating, to an even greater degree, in the radio and motion picture fields. These new-born media of expression are creatures of the industrial age; it is not surprising that they conform to the general economic patterns and procedures of big business. 100 [pageend100]What concerns the free speech advocate is not the merits of this or that economic system but the effect which the particular system has upon freedom of expression in these important channels of communication. Indeed, their importance cannot be overestimatedt Radio programs and motion pictures are readily accessible to almost everybody in the community, including young children, in their most impressionable years. It is impossible to calculate the full effect that these forms of expression have in shaping the opinions, emotional attitudes and behavior patterns of a large part of the population. It is therefore extremely important that these channels be kept free from all restraints, in order to afford opportunities for the greatest possible diversity of expression. But this is far from the case. The radio industry, though composed of hundreds of individually owned stations is almost completely under the control of four large networks. These operate in much the same way as do the newspaper chains and syndicates. The effect upon diversity of expression is much the same. The program material is originated in one of several large metropolitan centers and disseminated to the network stations, so that (except again for matters of purely local interest) the station programs have the same characteristics of standardization and uniformity as do the newspapers. Sometimes a town’s only radio station is owned by the town’s only newspaper; sometimes, where a town has a single network station, listeners are unable to tune in on programs originating on other networks. Left to itself, it seems probable that this monopolistic setup of the radio industry would eventually result in a serious restriction upon freedom of expression. But because of a curious physical accident 101 [pageend101]it has been possible for the federal government to counteract these restrictive tendencies. Since the number of persons desiring to operate radio stations is far in excess of the number of available wave-lengths, it was necessary to set up a sort of traffic control of the air. To this end, the Federal Communications Commission was created, with power to allocate wavelengths and grant operating licenses. If there is more than one applicant for a particular wave-length, the conflict is to be resolved by the FCC upon the basis of “public convenience and necessity.” These provisions have enabled the FCC to promulgate regulations requiring radio stations to allot equal air time for the expression of all shades of opinion on controversial public issues. Since failure to comply may result in the revocation of licenses, the station owners must perforce grant this degree of freedom, with as good grace as they can muster. Further, in order to justify the renewal of their licenses, upon the grounds of public convenience and necessity, they have found it expedient to allot a certain amount of air time (mostly at hours not attractive to advertisers) to programs of a cultural or educational nature. There is continual conflict between the FCC and the radio industry, as the one seeks to widen to the area of public discussion and the other to narrow it. Thanks to the vigilance of the FCC, it is possible for the assidous listener to hear a fair presentation of many important social, political and economic problems. (It 'should be noted that, while news coverage is, on the whole, comprehensive, more than one news commentator has been dropped, because his opinions have not coincided with those of the employing station or sponsor.) However, the great bulk of radio programs is given over to what is called “entertainment.” This consists mostly of musical and dramatic performances, cal- 102 [pageend102]ciliated to ensnare the listener’s interest sufficiently to make him attend to the advertising' propaganda which is interspersed at frequent intervals. Music lies somewhat outside the scope of this discussion, hut it should be said in fairness to the radio industry that it does offer a highly diversified program of this largely non- controversial material. Also, upon occasion, tribute is paid to the classics of literature and the drama (subject, of course, to drastic editing and expurgation). But it is “original” material that supplies most of the programmistic fare, and here we find the same restrictive influences that govern the publication of large circulation periodicals. In the periodical field, however, the advertising matter is merely collateral to the contents of the publication. The editor can still exercise a certain amount of choice; whereas, on the air, the advertiser who “sponsors” the program is largely in control of its contents. Advertising is the very spul and essence of radio “entertainment”; the program material is merely the juicy bait that surrounds the hook. Furthermore, it is assumed that the purchaser of a newspaper or magazine can read, so that what is presented comes at least within the bounds of literacy, at no matter how low a level. No such assumption need be made by the sponsors of radio programs. Since the consumption of soap, breakfast foods, and candy bars is almost universal, the shrewd advertiser can lower his sights and aim his sugar- coated advertising' pellets not only at the literate but at those who have never mastered the 'skill of reading, or are yet too young to have acquired it. Anyone who wishes to confirm this statement can readily do so by turning his radio dial at random. The unfortunate result of this domination of radio programs by manufacturers, who are interested only in selling their wares—together with the influence of numerous pres103 [pageend103]sure groups which will be presently discussed—is that it is almost impossible, outside the public discussion field, for anyone to say anything on the air that is fresh, original, provocative, creative, unconventional, or unorthodox. Since the deep and wide-spread influence of the radio is undeniable, these restrictions upon freedom of expression constitute a serious menace to public education and cultural growth; as well, of course, as a severe limitation upon the right of free speech. *) THE MOTION PICTURE Finally, we must consider the motion picture, which is perhaps the most influential of all the forms of communication. Motion pictures have a potential audience that includes not only the entire population of the United States over the age of five but also a large part of the population of the whole world. In fact, the fantastic misconceptions about American life and Américain institutions held thoroughout the world are mainly attributable to American motion pictures, since the great masses of people everywhere have no other source of information (or misinformation) about America. Yet, in spite of the importance of the motion picture in molding public opinion, both here and abroad, it is probably subject to more restrictions upon freedom of expression than any other form of communication. The motion picture industry does not depend upon advertising subsidies, and hence is free from that particular type of commercial pressure ; but other factors are even more effective in restricting freedom. *) Mr. Rice was writing before the spectacular rise of television—but all his remarks apply with equal force to this newest mass medium. (Editors, Ar e n a .) 104 [pageend104]To begin with, it is only in the motion picture field that we find a widespread and firmly established system of official pre-censorship. A number of states (including New York) have long had motion picture licensing boards, vested with discretionary powers which permit them to demand excisions or revisions in films intended for public exhibition, and even to ban films in their entirety. Numerous other states are guided by the decisions of the New York Board. In addition there are a great many local restrictions upon the exhibition of films, determined often by the mere whim of some police official. It would certainly seem that these censorship boards exist in violation of the free speech guarantee of the Constitution. However, in the early yeans of the century, when the motion picture exerted little or no influence upon public opinion, the courts held that it was merely a form of entertainment, not within the meaning of the First Amendment. Though the influence of the motion picture has grown almost beyond belief, the leaders of the motion picture industry (who, on the whole, rather favor censorship because of the immunity the licensing system gives them) have never challenged these court decisions. Recently a dictum by Justice Douglas, in a case involving a collateral issue, indicated strongly that the Supreme Court would take a different view today if the question were squarely presented. It is to be hoped that some motion picture producer can be prevailed upon to take a test case to the Supreme Court. If the court holds that motion pictures do come within the meaning of the First Amendment, there can be little doubt that the censorship boards would have to go out of business. Besides the official censorship boards, the motion picture industry has established its own agency for “voluntary censorship.” This agency (formerly known 105 [pageend105]as the Hays Office and now as the Breen Office) is empowered to enforce a “production code” which arbitrarily excludes certain situations and types of subject matter from motion pictures. Allegedly promulgated in the interests of “decency,” the code goes far beyond limitations upon sexual behavior and deals with a variety of subjects of a sociological, political, moral and religious nature. Almost every motion picture script is submitted to the Breen Office before it goes into production. The agency suggests excisions and revisions, which are usually accepted without question by the producer. Frequently the agency prevails upon producers not to purchase certain story material, even though this material may have been effectively presented to the public in the form of a play, novel or biography. All the agencies that regulate motion pictures are of a restrictive nature. There is no governmental body, as in radio, to ensure the operation of the motion picture industry for the public convenience and necessity. Since the manufacture of motion pictures entails no such technological difficulties as we find in radio, the assumption is that there is no limit to the number of persons who can make motion pictures. This, however, is a mere fiction. The manufacture of motion pictures requires a huge plant and enormous capital resources. Efficiency is increased and profits enlarged by the introduction of industrial methods. So we find in the motion picture field the same tendency toward monopoly we have seen at work in the fields of journalism and radio. The motion picture industry is dominated almost entirely by seven or eight large corporations, themselves controlled by a few individuals. It is this small, powerful group that has sole authority to determine what may or may not be shown on the screen. To make matters worse, most 106 [pageend106]of tlie larger motion picture theatres in the United States are in the hands of one or another of these corporations, so that the monopolistic control extends even to the distribution and exhibition of the product. In these circumstances, it is not surprising that a medium that offers opportunities for almost infinite variety of expression is confined, in the main, to the exhibition of “safe” subjects, treated with strict conformity to popular prejudices and preconceptions, at almost the lowest levels of taste, feelings and intelligence. It is true that a few producers make honest attempts to introduce freshness of theme and originality of treatment into their products: worthy efforts, indicative of the potentialities of the motion picture. But these are rare exceptions to the prevailing banality, timidity, ineptitude, tastelessness and distortion. For this condition, the monopolistic owners of the motion picture industry are entirely to blame. There are in Hollywood many writers, actors and directors with, great creative talents, which they are eager to put to use; but their status is that of salaried employees and they have little or nothing to say. What appears on the screen is decided by their employers who aim to turn out a product that will bring the maximum box office return, without regard to quality, truth, or the public interest. THE PRESSURE GROUPS In this connection, we must glance briefly at the growing influence of “pressure groups” in limiting and restricting freedom of expression, particularly in the radio and motion picture fields. These groups, whether religious, professional, economic or racial, are organized for the legitimate purpose of protecting the special interest of their homogeneous membership. (For example, the Catholic Legion of Decency, the 107 [pageend107]B’ma i B ri th Anti-Defamation League, the American Legion, and the National Association of Manufacturers.) But more and more these groups have pursued their often highly-laudable objectives to the extreme of anything they regard as reflecting unfavorably upon themselves or running counter to their particular beliefs or principles. The effect of this is that a relatively small minority of the population, through its lobbies, political influence, or threat of economic reprisals, often succeeds in denying to the individual bis right to freedom of expression and to the majority its right to access to the greatest possible diversity of expression as a basis for opinion and judgment. A few examples may be cited: the attempt of certain branches of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to prevent the screening of The Birth of a Nation ; the attempt of the Council for Soviet-American Friendship to prevent the exhibition of the film, The Iron Curtain; the apparently successful effort of the New York Board of Rabbis in preventing the licensing of a film based upon Charles Dickens’ Oliver Twist; and the banning of the magazine, The Nation, from the New York public schools because it contained articles that offended the Catholic Church. Mention should also be made of the pressures brought to bear upon the spineless Holywood magnates by the high-handed proceedings of heresy- hunting legislative committees. The restrictive efforts of these minority pressure groups constitute today one of the greatest of all threats to the right of free speech. Not only do motion picture producers and broadcasting companies show an increasing tendency to exclude anything that might be considered derogatory by the members of organized racial and religious groups but there is, particularly in Hollywood, a growing list of “sacred cows.” In 108 [pageend108]newspaper offices this term applies to individuals who, under instruction from the newspaper owner, must never receive unfavorable mention in the columns of the paper. In Hollywood, however, (and on network radio) this proscription runs to whole categories of individuals, including bankers, members of Congress, social workers, law enforcements officers, clergymen, war heroes, and many others. The pressure groups responsible for this state of affairs are often animated by the highest principles and led by public-spirited individuals; but ignoring the clear lesson of history, to the effect that freedom of expression is essential to democracy and that censorship is an entering wedge for totalitarianism, they persist in their demand for immunity from the free play of public discussion. Not only they, but every American would do well to ponder the arguments and the implications of Milton’s Areopagitica, and above all to remember these words, “Give me the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties.” 109 [pageend109]ARGUMENT DIE ZENSUR "Sire, geben Sie Gedankenfreiheit !” Schiller, “Don Carlos”. Es ist begreiflich, dass das II ort “Zensur” besonders bei den Exil schrift steilem schmerzliche Erinnerungen weckt. Die politisch gelenkte Zensur, die keine Konzessionen kennt, ist eine der U rsachen, die ciele Autoren veranlasst hat, ihre Heimat zu verlassen. N un leben sie in f remden Ländern und ringen um den N euaufbau ihrer Existenz, eingeengt durch spärliche Möglichkeiten der Publizierung und gehemmt durch die N ot Wendigkeit, sich in einer Fremdsprache ausdrü- cken zu müssen. Befreit von der Zensur, wollen sie Weiterarbeiten. Diese Situation ins Auge fassend, haben wir die Zensur zum Thema für unser heutiges “Round-table-meeting” gewählt. Bei schriftlichen Debatten fehlt aber gewöhnlich die unmittelbare Kraft und Spontanität, wie sie für persönliche Diskussionen kennzeichnend sind. Und nicht zuletzt geht ihnen der persönliche Charme des Vortragenden ab. Uns bleiben also hier nur die nackten Buchstaben und der Geist, der sie beseelt. Und man könnte, was das Thema, unserer Seance betrifft, geradezu von “abwesenden Geistern” sprechen. Der Geist, den die Exilschriftsteller ausstrahlen, ist ihrer Heimatzensur im höchsten Grade unerwünscht. Diese Zensur verlangt anderes als das, was IIeimatvertriebene schreiben und sagen. Kurz vor seiner Flucht, so erzählte mir ein Fachseh riftsteiler, habe er noch einen Vortrag über das Thema: “Von der Idee bis zum Prospekt” gehal- 110 [pageend110]ten: Am nächsten Tage wurde er ins Parteihaus gerufen. Mit düsterer Miene empfing ihn dort ein Jüngling und erklärte, sein Vortrag com Vortage sei “antikommunistisch” gewesen. Der Kollege war fassungslos. Er versuchte dem jungen Kommunisten dar- zulegen, dass es sich doch lediglich um einen F ach- vortrag gehandelt habe, in dem von Politik keine Rede gewesen sei. Er bedauerte, dies nicht anhand eines Manuskriptes beweisen zu können, da er gewohnt sei, alle seine Referate frei vorzutragen. Sein Gegenüber holte daraufhin ein Bündel Papiere aus dem Schreibtisch und. überreichte es dem Schriftsteller mit der Bemerkung: “Hier haben Sie ihn. Setzen Sie sich und lesen Sie nach, ob es wirklich Ihr Vortrag ist.” Der Kollege überflog den maschinengeschriebenen Text und bestätigte, dass es wortwörtlich sein Vortrag sei. “Jetzt hin ich aber neugierig, wo ich hier etwas gegen den Kommunismus geäussert haben soll,” lag es ihm danach schon als Antwort auf der Zunge. Aber bevor er dazu kam, hatte der Funktionär das Manuskript an sich genommen und darin zu blättern begonnen. Auf jeder Seite tippte er mit dem Finger auf eine Stelle und sagte: “Sehen Sie, hier hätten Sie erwähnen müssen, dass Stalin das und das erklärt hat. . . hier hätten Sie Lenin zitieren sollen. . So ging es Seite um Seite weiter. Und schliesslich: “Haben Sie mich verstanden? Ist Ihnen jetzt, klar, warum Ihr Vortrag gegen, dem Kommunismus gerichtet, war? Sie werden in Z-ukunft nur noch sprechen können, wenn Sie Ihre Vorträge zwecks Zensur vorher bei uns einreichen.” Der Kollege war zutiefst erschüttert. Er hatte das Gefühl, dass er in einem Lande, in dem alles, sogar ein Fachvartrag, in dieser Weise reglementiert, zensiert und doktrinär durchleuchtet wird, nicht länger werde leben können. Am nächten Tage flüchtete er. . . 111 [pageend111]Meine Damen und meine Herren, die Sitzung ist eröffnet. Die erste Frage lautet: 1) Haben Sie persönliche Erfahrungen mit der Zensur gehabt? Wenn ja, welches war Ihr interessantestes Erlebnis ? ZELTITE AVOTINA: Keine persönliche Erfahrun- E. G. KOSTETZKY : Dr. I. BANKOWSKI: gen mit der Zensur gehabt. JANOS BARDI: Als Journalist hinter dem Eisernen Vorhang sammelte ich tagtäglich Erfahrungen mit der Zensur. Das bezeichnendste- war die Begründung, mit der eine Veröffentlichung abgelehnt wurde. Es hiess immer: “Das kann vielleicht im Einzelfalle wahr sein, ist aber nicht typisch.” Und “typisch” war selbstverständlich nur, was der Parteilinie entsprach. Ein ungarischer Literatur-Ideologe (István Király) prägte in diesen Jahren den Satz, der für mich den Gedankengang jeglicher Zensoren am besten widerspiegelt: “Unsere Augen sind nicht nur Werkzeuge, sie -sind auch Hindernisse des Sehens.” Dr. Antonin KRATOCHWIL: Jede Kritik gilt als illegale Tätigkeit gegen dem Staat. Auf solche Autoren warten die Arbeitslager. Ich war Kulturredakteur der “Lidová Obroda” einer christlichen Zeitung in Brünn. Nach meiner Flucht im Jahre 1952 ist die Zeitung nicht mehr erschienen. Über die Praktiken der kommunistischen Zensur, z.B. über das Fotografieren in Bibliotheken und über die Arbeit der speziellen Presseabteilung in Innenministerium (Hlavni správa tiskového dohledu) würde ich ein extra “round-table-meeting” Vorschlägen. Es ist notwendig, dass die nackten Tatsachen vielen Menschen in der westlichen Welt die Augen öffnen sollen. Das ist auch eine der Aufgaben des Exilschriftstellers. 112 [pageend112]2) Wann ist die Anwendung der Zensur begrün- ded? (Pornographie, Kriegsgeheimnisse? etc.) Dr. LANKOWSKI: Meiner Meinung nach ist eine Zensur in Kriegszeiten als selbstverständlich anzusehen. Ebenso halte ich eine Zensur der Jugendliteratur hinsichtlich der Pornographie für angebracht. ZELTITE AVOTINA: Eine Zensur ist in jedem Falle etwas sehr Schlimmes. Wirklich begründet ist die Anwendung der Zensur doch wohl nie! Ich kann mir nicht vorstellen, dass ein Kunstwerk, also ein Werk, das eine wahre Aussage und Offenbarung seines Meisters ist, geschaffen wird um, z.B. Kriegsgeheimnisse preiszugeben. E. G. KOSTETZKY: Ideal ist die Anwendung der Zensur nur begründet, wenn eine einheitliche Gesellschaft sich auf eine übergesellschaftliehe Norm einigt. Praktisch ist sie nur in einer biblischen Gesellschaft (siehe Exodus zwischen Kap. 20 und Kap. 32, die Formulierung der Gebote und ihrer ersten Verletzung). Enter Pornographie versteht man gewöhnlich die Darstellung der intimen Beziehungen zwischen den beiden Geschlechtern “mit der Absicht, nicht eine künstlerische Aussage, sondern lediglich eine aufreizende Wirkung zu erzielen” (Das kluge Alphabet). Diese Formulierung erlaubt allerdings unzählige Varianten der Auslegung. Hier ein Beispiel aus dem georgischen mittelalterlichen Roman “Wisramiani” : “Sie legten sich nieder, noch -steif von der Kälte, und ein warmer, duftender Pelz hüllte sie ein, wie eine Seele ihre beiden Körper. Ihr Lager war erfüllt von Rosen und Geschmeid. Zwischen den beiden war nicht Raum für ein einziges Haar.” Ist das Pornographie oder nicht? 113 [pageend113]Kriegsgeheimnisse müssen in den zuständigen Händen bleiben. JANOS BARDI: Begründet ist die Anwendung der Zensur wohl immer, aber gerechtfertigt ist sie nie. Auch nicht wenn e-s sich um Pornographie oder Kriegsgeheimnisse handelt. Dr. A. KRATOCHWIL: Wenn es sich um ein wirklich künstlerisches Werk handelt, ist die Zensur überflüssig. 3) Kann die Zensur die Entstehung eines Meisterwerkes vereiteln? ZELTITE AVOTINA: Die Entstehung eines Meisterwerkes kann die Zensur nicht verhindern, es sei denn durch den gewaltsamen Tod des Künstlers. Wohl kann die Zensur den Künstler dazu zwingen, eine andere Ausdrucksforni, vielleicht ein Symbol, vielleicht einen anderen Umweg zu suchen. Dias ist dann schon eigentlich eine Selbstzensur. E. G. KOSTETZKY: Die Entstehung eines Meisterwerkes kann man nur dann vereiteln, wenn der Schriftsteller nicht klüger ist als der Zensor. Dr. BAN KOWSKI: Die Zensur kann natürlich die Entstehung eines Meisterwerkes vereiteln. JANOS BARDI: Dass die Zensur die Entstehung eines Meisterwerkes vereiteln könnte, glaube ich nicht. Zu einem Mester- werk gehört ein Meister, und wer ein Meister ist, der wird auch ohne die Hoffnung auf eine baldige Veröffentlichung sein Werk schaffen. 114 [pageend114]Dr. A. KRATOCHWIL: Ein Beispiel ist “Doktor Schiwago” von Boris Pasternak. Dieser Roman war a priori nicht nur in der UDSSR, sondern in allen Satellitenstaaten verboten. Der erste europäische Verleger Feltrinelli weiss am besten, was die kommunistische Partei der UDSSR unternommen hat, um die Veröffentlichung des Romans zu vereiteln. 4) Wo wirkt sielt die Macht der Zensur am ver- nichtensten aus? (In Büchern, Television, im Radio, Film, oder in der Presse?) ZELTITE AVOTINA: Wahrscheinlich in der Presse. E. G. KOSTETZKY: Überall oder nirgends (siehe meine Antwort auf Frage 3). JANOS BARDI: Meiner Meinung nach — in der Presse. Autoren die für die Unsterblichkeit schreiben, haben Zeit, und ihr Werk bleibt ein Meisterwerk für alle Zeiten. Die Presse ist an den Tag gebunden. Was heute nicht erscheint, ist morgen überholt. Die Presse kann von der Zensur umgebracht werden, Dr. BANKOW SKI : In der Presse und in Büchern wirkt sich die Zensur am schlimmsten aus. Dr. A. KRATOCHWIL: An erster Stelle müsste man — meines Erachtens — die Filmzensur anführen. Der Film ist ein dem Gedicht ähnliches Kunstwerk. Schneidet man etwas aus ihm heraus, dann wirkt er wie ein Gedicht, aus dem man einige Verse gestrichen hat. Billy Wilder, der bekannte Hollywoodautor und Regisseur äusserte sich so über die Filmzensur: “Die Filmzensoren nehmen ihre Arbeit meines Erachtens etwas zu ernst. Die meisten 115 [pageend115]erotischen Szenen, die sie herausschneiden lassen, müssen wir ihnen oft zwanzigmal vorfuhren.” An der Kinokrise tragen auch diese kleinlichen Filmzensoren die Schuld. 5) Was halten Sie von der Selbstzensur des Schriftstellers? (Wenn z.B. ein Schriftsteller etwas deshalb nicht schreibt, weil er es f ür unrentabel hält.) ZELT IT E AVOTINA: Ich finde eine Selbstzensur bedeutend angebrachter als das absolute Schweigen. Was hätte mau von einem gänzlich schweigenden Pasternak gehabt? JA NOS BARDI: Ein Schriftsteller, der etwas darum nicht schreibt, weil er weiss, dass es unrentabel ist, ist eben ein Handwerker, (vielleicht ein guter Handwerker), der von seinem Handwerk lebt, aber kein Künstler, kein “Meister”. Hinter dem Eisernen Vorhang gibt es Beispiele genug, die davon zeugen, dass “Meister” zwar von ihrem Handwerk leben, aber vorläufig für ihren Schreibtisch auch Meisterwerke schreiben. Dr. BANKOW SKI: Ein richtiger Schriftsteller übt keine Selbstzensur in dem gefragten Sinne. Wir haben Beispiele dafür, dass die Werke oft erst nach dem Tode des Autors richtig eingeschätzt werden. Dr. A. KRATOCHWIL: Im Western ist Selbstzensur nicht nötig und im Osten, wie ein CSSR-Flüchtling so treffend sagte: “Jeder Schriftsteller hat nicht weit von seinem Kopf einen kleinen Beamten vom Innenministerium.” E. G. KOSTETZKY : Man nimmt allgemein an, dass die aufrichtige Begründung der Selbstzensur nicht in Konjunkturmomenten liegt, sondern im persönlichen Gewissen des 116 [pageend116]Schriftsteller. Da aber die allgemeingültigsten Maximen, z.B. die Nächstenliebe, sich im Einzelnen mehr oder weniger subjektiv äussern, braucht der Start des Gewissens stets eine überpersönliche, ja überirdische Begründung. Konkret könnte solch ein Ausgangspunkt das Christentum sein, wirksam jedoch nur dann, wenn man die identischen ethischen Imperative der anderen Lehren und Praktiken einschliesslich des Schamanentums (siehe Hans Findeisen: “Schamanentum” Kohlhammer Verlag, Stuttgart) berücksichtigt. 6) Wie kann der Schriftsteller am besten gegen die Zensur kämpfen? (Durch Symbol, Allegorie, Diskussion, Protest, oder durch seine Nichtachtung derselben?) ZELTITE AVOTINA: Aus Protest gegen eine Unterdrückung kann man selbstverständlich auch schweigen. Aber ist dem Volk, dessen Schicksal der Künstler teilt, mit dem Schweigen am besten gedient? Ist nicht das, was man nur angedeutet sagen darf, nur auf Umwegen anbringen kann, besser als nur das Unheimliche des Schweigens? Bekämpfen können die direkt Betroffenen die Zensur kaum, aber irgendwie täuschen und umgehen. Dr. BANKOWSKI: Der Kampf gegen die Zensur lässt -sich, meiner Meinung nach, am besten durch Diskussion und Allegorie führen. Dr. A. KRATOCHWIL: Vielleicht durch Symbole, aber gegen die Zensur sind die Schriftsteller meistens machtlos. Jede Zensur hängt mit dem Regierungssystem zusammen. E. G. KOSTETZKY: Der Autor kann die in der Frage erwähnten Mittel und auch noch andere anwenden, je nachdem, worin 117 [pageend117]er sich in der Praxis am stärksten fühlt. In erster Linie erreicht er sein Ziel durch die Qualität seiner Werke. JANOS BARDI: Wie ein Schriftsteller gegen die Zensur kämpfen kann, das hängt vom Niveau des Zensors (und des Schriftstellers) ab. Protest und Diskussionen sind in Diktaturen beinahe unmöglich oder sie bringen den diskutierfreudigen Schriftsteller ins Gefängnis, wenn nicht an den Galgen. In Zeiten, wo die Zensur selbst unsicher wird, können Sj'mbole, Allegorien, Beispiele aus der Geschichte “durchkommen”. Im allgemeinen aber hilft die Täuschung des Zensors nicht viel. Wie oft haben wir erlebt, dass die Täuschung des Zensors zwar gelang, aber das fertige Buch dennoch eingestampft wurde, der fertige Film durfte nie laufen, die einstudierte Theaterpremiere wurde abgesagt. Was eine “gut funktionierende Zensur” sein will ist eben in der Tiefe gestaffelt, wie eine Verteidigungslinie auf dem Schlachtfeld. Der sie im Sturm nehmen will, bekommt nur zu leicht eine Kugel in den Kopf. 7) Kennen Sie Schrift steiler und Werlte, die, der Zensur zum Opfer fielen? ZELTITE AVOTINA: Ein jedes Volk, das die Diktatur erleben musste, hat Schriftsteller aufzuweisen, die man als Opfer der Zensur bezeichnen kann. Ich bin eine Lettin und führe also ein lettisches Beispiel an: Janis Medenis. Schon 1942 hatte er Schwierigkeiten mit der nazistischen Zensur, namentlich vor der Herausgabe seines Gedichtbandes. Nach 1945 wurde er auf der Flucht von den Sowjets gefangen, verhaftet, verurteilt und deportiert. Er hat alle Erniedrigungen, die eine Diktatur aufzwingen kann, erleiden müssen und kehrte todkrank, arbeitsunfähig, nach Riga zurück. Von 33 118 [pageend118]in der Haft und Deportation geschriebenen Gedichten konnte Medenis 11 durch die sowjetische Zensur schleusen. Die übrigen 22, die von der Trostlosigkeit des Erlittenen geprägt sind, hatten keinerlei Aussicht, vor der sowjetischen Zensur zu bestehen. Auf seltsamen Wegen haben sie den Westen erreicht und sind hier in der lettischen Exilpresse veröffentlicht, allerdings nach dem Tode des Dichters im Jahre 1961. Dr. BANKOWSKI: Opfer der Zensur? Das könnte man von allen Schriftstellern und ihren Werken in den kommunistisch regierten Ländern behaupten. Dr. A. KRATOCHWIL: siehe meine Antwort auf Frage 3. E. G. KOSTETZKY: Opfer? Torquato Tasso, indem er sein “Gerusalemme Liberata” ins “Gerusalemme Conquistata” veränderte. Allerdings liegt die Schuld vollständig bei ihm selbst (siehe die Antwort zu Frage 3). JA NOS BARDI: Ich kenne das Schicksal der ungarischen Schriftsteller Tibor Dery, Gvula Hay, Gyula Obersovszky und vieler anderer. Die Werke dieser Schriftsteller sind nur sofern Opfer der Zensur, als sie nicht erscheinen und nicht aufgeführt werden dürften. Die Autoren kann man ins Gefängnis werfen, sollten sie dort jedoch die Folter nicht überstehen, so werden ihre Werke bestimmt weiterleben. 8) Was ist Ihrer Meinung nach der haupsäch- lichste Unterschied, zwischen der Zensur der “Freien-Welt” und die der “Diktaturen”? ZELTITE AVOTINA: Eine Zensur ist immer eine Zensur, ein Zwang, ein Ausdruck der Angst irgendeiner Macht, die um ihren Platz bangt. In der freien Welt sollte es eine Zensur 119 [pageend119]eigentlich nicht gehen. Gibt es sie dennoch, so ist diese Welt ganz einfach — nicht frei! Dr. DANKOWSKI: Die Zensur der “Freien Welt” berücksichtigt das Wohl des Menschen und seine Würde, während die Zensur der “Diktaturen” nur dem Wohle und Nutzen des Regimes dient! Dr. A. KRATOCHWIL: siehe die Antwort auf Frage 1. E. G. KOSTETZKY: Der Unterschied liegt in der Stufe der jeweiligen Bestimmung, was gut und was schlecht ist (siehe die Antwort zu Frage 2). Übrigens ergeben sich Unterschiede dadurch, wieviel Schriftsteller hier oder dort gerade mehr Glück haben. Also ein beinahe schicksalhaftes Moment. JANOS BARDI: Die Zensur der “Freien Welt”? Ich weiss nicht, was ich unter diesem Begriff verstehen soll. Ich kenne die angeblich diktatorische Zensur in Ghana nicht und weiss auch nicht, ob ich diese Art von Ländern zu der “Freien Welt” zählen soll. Ich glaube aber nicht, dass wir in der Bundesrepublik gewisse Er- scheinungen als “Zensur” ansehen sollen. Dass manche hierzulande zum Beispiel mit der Forderung auftreten, man solle Bert Brecht nicht spielen, weil er ein prominenter Kommunist war, empfinde ich schon darum nicht als Zensur, weil diese Auffassung entkräftet wird durch die gegenteilige Meinung anderer und so letzten Endes Brecht ja auch mehr gespielt wird denn je. Diese Auseinandersetzungen bewegen sieh auf der Ebene einer Diskussion. Von einer Zensur kann also hier nicht die Rede sein. Die Zensur hinter dem Eisernen-Vorhang ist ein Verbrechen. * * * Meine Damen und meine Herren, die Seance für 120 [pageend120]die befragten Schriftsteller ist beendet. Für Sie, lieber Leser, beginnt sie erst jetzt. Sicher sind Sie sich mit uns darüber einig, dass schöpferische Arbeit keinerlei Zensur vertragen kann, gleichgültig wer sie ausübt und in welchem Sinne sie gehandhabt wird. Die Zensur ist für den Schriftsteller wie für jeden geistig schöpferischen Menschen überhaupt dasselbe wie Handschellen für den Gefangenen. Gestatten Sie mir also, dass ich unsere Sitzung mit den [Porten des französischen Philosophen Jean Jacques Rousseau schliesse: “Auf seine Freiheit verzichten, heisst, auf seine Menschenwürde, Menschenrechte, selbst auf seine Pflichten verzichten.” K. G. WERNER 121 [pageend121]ANNALS OF EXILE ERNÖ HALÁSZ FERENC MOLNÁR Ten years ago, on April 1, .1952, a man of seventy- four, broken in body and spirit, died in a New York hospital. At the moment of his death Thalia turned her torch to the ground and tears furrowed her blanched face. The torch guttered with soot; instead of the shining flame of life, the darkness of oblivion. The dead man whom Thalia mourned was an Ame- rican citizen but a Hungarian exile writer: Ferenc Molnár. At the tenth anniversary I would like to lift up the torch by the right of forty years of friendship and rekindle the flame to present to the old and new generations the figure, the life, the work of a great Hungarian poet—the shedding of his blood, the joy and sorrow of his heart, the soaring flight of his spirit. To write a penetrating essay that could claim enduring value is impossible not only because of the exigencies of space—but also because the Hungarian history of literature itself still, owes us a worthy biography. I would only like to speak simply about Ferenc Molnár, the journalist, the novelist, the playwright, the master and humble servant of the stage, the human being and exile. Molnár, the journalist Some fragmentary attempts at biography, a few studies of Molnár’s literary works—this is all the history of literature can show; but as far as I know nobody ever wrote about Molnár, the journalist, though 122 [pageend122]any biography or study would be incomplete without this. Not only because it was as a journalist that he entered the world of letters but because he was an excellent newspaperman, he loved this profession to which he kept on returning even when he had achieved world fame. Wanda Bartha—of whom we shall speak later—once wrote: “Molnár prefers journalism even today to play writing.” This was a somewhat exaggerated view but it confirms our claim. Molnár finished high school at the age of seventeen in Budapest, his birthplace and two months later he was already studying law at Geneva University. “I spent two terms there,” he wrote, “in 1895 and 1896. My father took me to Geneva in order to perfect my knowledge of French.” There is no information about the increase in Molnar’s legal knowledge; but his French must have been quickly perfected; he wrote his first article in French and it was published in 1896 by Le Genevois. At the same time he wrote a Hungarian piece about Geneva and sent it to the Budapešti Napló which not only published his first journalistic effort but the editor-in-chief—Joseph Vészi, one of the most outstanding figures in Hungarian journalism—immediately wrote to the young man, urged him to further efforts and, after a few more articles, told him that when he returned to Budapest, he would be glad to give him a job. Thereupon Molnár gave up the study of law and hurried home. At eighteen lie became a staff member of a very distinguished newspaper. Soon he had a more important chance to prove himself. It was the millenary year of Hungary and there were brilliant festivities in the Hungarian capital. One of the great occasions was the ball ar the Ludovika Military Academy honoured by the presence of Emperor Francis Joseph himself. It was the young reporter’s task to provide a colourful piece 123 [pageend123]about it. Two years later Molnar returned to Geneva. An Italian anarchist named Luccheni had assassinated the Empress Elisabeth on the lakeside in September 1898. Vészi sent his young collaborator to cover Luccheni’s trial. Later Molnar joined the old-established Pešti Napló and took part in its daily editorial work; almost every day he also wrote a so-called “croquis”, a humorous short piece. Hereby became the friend of such outstanding journalists as Andor Adorján, Nándor Eré- nyi, Alexander Mester, Andor Miklos, Cornelius Tabori and others. From the Pešti Naplo he transferred to another daily, the Pesti Hirlap for which he wrote a “Sunday Chronicle”. During the first world war he was a war correspondent of Az Est, a popular evening paper; be covered the various fronts and wrote long daily articles—somewhat hampered by the rigid wartime censorship. In 1918 Andor Miklos, one of the most colourful Hungarian newspaper magnates, bought the evening paper Magyarország which was close to- Michael Ká- rolyi, President of Hungary during the short-lived liberal revolution. Miklos reorganized the editorial staff and Molnár became the editor in all but name. I was honoured by his invitation to join the paper. Though Molnár loved to sleep late, he was every morning iat ten at his desk and worked until the paper was put to bed. He was a brilliant editor—full of ideas, new angles, information. He took slips of paper from his coat pocket, with notes about some political, theatrical, social or police event that would provide a story. He gathered these informations during the evening and the night. During his short lunch-break he welcomed visitors—the more the better. “They all bring material for the paper,” he used to say. He was extremely kind to his staff and when the court 124 [pageend124]reporter produced four faultless lines about a servant- girl dissolving match-beads and drinking the nauseous concoction because she was crossed in love, Molnár praised him as if he had turned out the best leader of the week. Béla Kun’s Communist dictatorship killed all bourgeois papers—the Magyarország was also banned. After two decades Molnar’s professional journalistic career came to an end. Molnár, the novelist A great writer of Molnar’s calibre may be criticized even after his death; let us say frankly that Molnár was not a good novelist. This was not his proper medium; he was unable to bring his characters to such splendid life as in his plays; they clearly showed their artificial existence. Most of his novels were short ; his plots would have been better used for short stories. But Molnár was a great and distinguished writer; even in th is genre he created lasting values—he could play this instrument, not his proper one, beautifully and for the delight of his readers. His Coal Thieves is a long short story, perfect of its kind ; deeply human, appealing, extremely moving. It has its place among- the ten best short stories of world literature. In the early days of the Moscowite regime, Hungarian literary criticism (headed by George Lukacs) damned and excommunicated Molnár, his books and plays were banished ; it was forbidden even to mention his name. No one was allowed to say that no Communist writer had presented proletarians with such sympathy and affection as Molnar in his Coal Thieves. When, in the mid-fifties, it was suddenly discovered (or, let us siay, the discovery was permitted) that Molnár was a great writer, the Coal 125 [pageend125]Thieves could only be found in some hidden corner’s of the second-hand bookshops. The Story of a Masterless Boat was a heartfelt gift by Molnar to those whose hearts he wanted to touch. No one could fail to follow with sympathy the tragic story of an unhappy girl in love. Let me quote Andor Adorján, Molnár’s friend, translator of several of his plays into French: “The Story of a Masterless Boat was published as a serial in the review Hét (Week) and I must say it was quite a revelation. I think it was in the Literary Circle of our high school that we read it with, my classmates—but how feverishly, in what a 'religious daze ! From it we learned to know St. Margaret’s Island, the Danube swept softly in our ears, we smelled the sulphur of the medicinal springs, we heard the horn of the horse-drawn tramway and the sirens of the nearby factories. And we saw the lonely boat, being carried by the water, with the love-sick girl inside who was going to die when she realized that she was in love with the same man as her mother. . .” The Boys of Paid Street is one of Molnár’s masterpieces. It is a juvenile book—if we only consider that its characters are fourteen-fifteen year old students whose struggle for the “grund” (the Budapest slang for a play-ground) and the vicissitudes of their secret society (called the “putty club”), forbidden by their schoolmasters, provide the theme of the novel. But it is a classic, fascinating and moving even for adult readers. The boys come to vivid life, we sense their problems, their worries, we are excited about the outcome of the battle for the “grand”, we root for “the boys of Paul Street”, delight in their victory, take part in the ups-and-downs of the “putty club” and our hearts almost break at the death-bed of little Ernö Nemecsek. The fifty or sixty lines in which 126 [pageend126]Ferenc Molnár described how “the most respected captain” moved from the earth to heaven, is an integral part of world literature. Today the boys of Paul Street would probably form a space travel club instead of a “putty club”; yet the tale is by no means out-of-date because its threads are woven from the eternal emotions, joys and sorrows, desires and hopes of the young. It is a book (one of the few) that bears re-reading again and again. Molnár, the dramatist It was Molnar’s plays that made him world famous. 1 lis truly international successes were achieved on the stages of Budapest and San Francisco, Rome and Tokyo. He had to become a playwright, predestined for it not only by his varied talents but also by such an amazing, instinctive knowledge of the stage, of acting, of the combination of words, gestures, facial expressions which few dramatists possess even among the most successful. His first play, “The Doctor” was presented on November 23, 1902 by the Gaiety Theatre of Budapest when lie was twenty-four; his last play called Game of Hearts he wrote in his New York exile. During almost fifty years of his career as a dramatist Molnár wrote forty-one plays, almost one every year. His plays were performed all over the world, “The Devil” was acted in forty-three languages. Molnár not only knew but respected and loved the theatre. He served it—but was also its master, however paradoxically this might sound. He was its obedient servant because he designed his plays to fit the demands and possibilities of the stage; but he was also its master because he exploited it to its utmost limits, enlarging and compressing, decorating or stripping it to its barest essentials, consecrated it as a 127 [pageend127]church or made it descend into hell. He made the play the thing—and was himself a player of amazing virtuosity. This playful mastery was almost sheer magic. Where so many dramatists reached the limits of invention, Molnár continued with still another idea, a brilliant twist—playing with the play, staging his own world on the stage. Yet he never deserted reality; his characters were never reduced to puppets but remained flesh-and-blood human beings. Molnár was inclined to romanticism, he was a poet in the classic sense of the world—and a believer. These qualities determined the development, the framework of his work as a dramatist, these were the inspirations of the themes and plots of his plays, they shaped the characters and actions of his figures. The aims of all his plays, above entertainment or diversion, were rooted in these beliefs: to proclaim the triumph of good over evil, of beauty over ugliness. This intention is echoed by every one of his plays, even if the voice is neither harsh nor strident, prophetic or that of the reformer’s (for this he had neither human nor literary strength)—yet it remains a noble and convincing voice. In all his plays the victory belongs to kindness, honesty, decency; morality, higher ethics, humanity overcome the base intentions, egotism and cunning. In his plays Molnár is always on the side of the underdog and pokes fun at the rich; he lavishes his affections on the simple but pure minds and often satirizes those who consider themselves superior because of their money, rank, or power. The Molnár characters who claim our sympathy are the industrious middle class people, lawyers, shop assistants, servant girls and faithful wives, artists and actors, the fairground ne’er-do-well who, in spite of his crimes, proclaims kindness and love. These are the heroes and 128 [pageend128]not the characters of smug vanity, cold hypocrisy, belonging to the world of pomp and circumstance, leading their empty life on the stage. What Molnár thought of the living models of his characters, he expressed in the preface to his play Panoptikum (Waxworks), addressed to the would-be producer: “This play not only satirizes conceited, haughty and hypocritical European aristocracy of its period but it is also intended to deride those drawing-room plays which fawningly glorified these people as a higher type of human beings—as demigods—throughout half a century.” There is not enough space to take Molnár’s plays one by one and present his genius, his literary accomplishments, his wealth of ideas, his corruscating wit. the liveliness of his dialogues, the brilliant colours of his words and sentences, the delightful humour and the moving sincerity of his prose. Still, a few words must be said about Liliom, Molnar’s best-known and most highly estimated play. Its first performance in Budapest (1909) was, to quote Molnár, “a quiet failure.” It was the tremendous success of its revival that started the play on its journey around the world—which still continues after half a century. What is Liliom? “The life and death of a rascal” says Molnár in the play’s subtitle. But the millions who have seen it, put it in a different way. They say: Liliom, is a hymn of love and kindness, the legend of the deathless love of a little slavey and the fundamental goodness of a poor sinner—something written by a great poet in his most inspired hours. A great poet who believed in his own fairy-tale and who must have wept over his own manuscript.—and smiled at the tender wit of his own characters.. The “vurstli”, the Budapest Town Park’s fun-fiair has disappeared, the hurdy-gurdies are stilled, Liliom 129 [pageend129]and his friends and enemies are gone; but love, affection, kindness endure and that is why Liliom is bound to be resurrected on this or that stage again and again. In Olympia, The Swan, The Waxworks we find, side-by-side with the master of the brilliantly woven plot, the inimitable freshness of invention, the poet who despises the cold, painted world of aristocracy and champions the simple people, proclaims his kinship with them. In his One-Two-Three he satirizes with the skill of a magician the millionaires swollen with false prejudices—this one act play is one of the sharpest satires on capitalism. In The Guardsman, The Marshall and The Play’s The Thing actors impersonate themselves on the stage. Molnár plays with the play itself showing a dazzling bravura few writers possess. The audience is captivated by the brilliant production, under the spell of the twists and turns, carried away by the wit and fun. In his Marshall Molnár not only saves the life of the actor playing a double part but places him on a high pedestal, high above the aristocrat who tries to commit murder in his cowardly jealousy and above his wife who esteems money and rank higher than anything else. In The Play’s The Thing—which Molnár called “an anecdote in three acts”,—he uses this playful “play within the play” to heal the almost broken heart of a young lover, making him happy—and the audience, too. Ferenc Molnár was also an outstanding stage director. In Budapest he always picked his own cast and practically lived with them throughout the rehearsals. These he conducted with immense inventiveness, incredible care, untiring patience. His attention would extend to the smallest detail. The butler’s tie was just as important to him as the grand ball 130 [pageend130]gown of tlie leading lady. He picked himself—sometimes searching a dozen shops—the furniture, pictures, even the cutlery used on the stage. If a bit player spoke his single sentence in the way he wanted, lie was jubilant in his enthusiasm. He loved the theatre and considered the pleasures of playgoing the finest in the world. Molnár, the exile It would be difficult to fix the day or even the year when Molnár became an exile, when he chose it voluntarily, sensing clearly that if he wanted to avoid humiliation, physical and mental suffering, he would have to leave—before forced by political events, totalitarian decrees. His exile did not begin in 1940 when lie arrived in New York but in the early thirties. For years he roamed the different countries and cities of Europe, uneasy and restless. His wife, Lili Darvas, already a distinguished actress, could not accompany him, because—as Molnár wrote: “My wife was tied by her brilliant theatrical career to Berlin and Vienna, putting a distance of hundreds of miles between us.” But Molnár was not a lonely wanderer ; for fifteen years he had a “companion in exile” until she suddenly died in 1947: Wanda Bartha, his secretary, friend, agent, librarian, cook, nurse and (as he called her) “the light of my life.” It would be useless to enumerate chronologically where and how much time the white-haired playwright and his much younger secretary spent together. Venice, San Remo, Nice, Cannes, Paris, Geneva were the more important stations of this pilgrimage. In these cities he met many of his famous friends, spending pleasant hours with them—-they included, to mention only a few, Tristam Bernard, Zacconi, Roberto Briacco, Memo Bassi, Sir Alexander Korda, Charles Laughton and others. 131 [pageend131]Fo t a while Molnár thought of settling in Paris; he applied and received both for himself and Wanda a three year residential permit. “One morning,” he wrote in his book Companion in Exile, “I went to Police Headquarters to pick up these documents, then so vital to a refugee. The deputy police commissioner was extremely nice to me and gave me the papers, saying: ‘France is happy to offer refuge to people like you’.” The news which Molnár and Wanda received from Budapest, Vienna and Berlin, were more and more alarming and grim. The persecution of the Jews in Nazi Germany, the massacre of innocent millions shook them deeply. The dark storm clouds of war were gathering. Molnár asked for an American immigration visa. He w’as unable to wait for it in Paris; he moved to Geneva. At last the visa arrived. Ferenc Molnár set out on the last day of 1939 and arrived on the Rex in Newr York on January 12, 1940 — to spend twelve years as an exile. He never saw Europe again. His wife, Lili Darvas and his old friend Ferenc Göndör met him at the pier. They took him to the Plaza Hotel where Lili Darvas had reserved for him Room 835 on the eighth floor. This became his home—a room and bath, with a closet full of suitcases that remained unopened. Wanda travelled from Geneva to Budapest and joined Molnár in May 1940 in New York. Molnár rented a room for her on the fifteenth floor of the hotel. Molnár never took to exile. When he lived abroad voluntarily or for his wife’s sake, he did not mind spending long spells away from Budapest—but the feeling that he could not return to his country was almost unendurable. Maybe he only talked to Wanda or his wife about it and did not mention it to strangers: homesickness tormented him and he would have 132 [pageend132]been healthier in body and mind if he could have returned. Not to the Budapest of the Communists but the city where he was born, educated, where he achieved his first successes—and failures. He longed for his old clubs, for Margaret Island, for his journalist, writer and actor friends, for the rehearsals at the Gaiety or the Magyar Theatre, for the excitement, the deadly tension of a first night ; for the chance to appear, pale and modest, in answer to the cries for “author!” on the stage and make his bow. Thousands of miles from the Danube, he longed for all this. In the first years of his life in America he frequented many of his friends, attended parties, travelled to New Haven for the try-out of Carousel, the musical version of Liliom. He went on summer holidays, made plans, worked. He was frequently together with Max Reinhardt, his intimate friend, with Sam Jaffe; he met Louis Bromfield, John Steinbeck, Orson Welles, Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo, a number of American actors and actresses who had appeared in his plays, producers and directors and some of his exile Hungarian friends. With Wanda he usually lunched in the small restaurant Mona Lisa on 58th Street where his friends often called on him. In 1943 he suffered his first heart attack; he spent a long time in bed, for the first few days in an oxygen tent. Wanda Und Lili nursed him with loving care. He recovered—but he had changed. He narrowed the circle in which he moved more and more, he had no wish for company—only his wife, Wanda and a few friends remained. He survived Wanda’s tragic death by five years but during them his world was practically restricted to the immediate neighbourhood of the Plaza. He took his meals in a small Italian restaurant; he usually sat alone, only rarely did an old friend turn up. He was a hypochondriac and his 133 [pageend133]health declined steadily; as for his mental state, he wrote: “I am on the verge of melancholia—in the medical sense. . . The frightening and unhappy sunset of my career. . . In my miserable loneliness. . .” These are shattering lines, reflecting a fearful picture. Ferenc Molnár, the brilliant master of the stage, the incomparable magician of wit and invention who made millions laugh, dragged out his days in “miserable loneliness. . . on the verge of melancholia”, far from his country, in a New York hotel room. One must surely curse fate, this stupid cheat ! * * * * Because of his state of health and mental condition Molnár wrote less and less in exile. He was still in Europe when he re-wrote and revised repeatedly his play Miracle Among the Mountains which was published in book form years before its first presentation. In 1936 the Gaiety Theatre of Budapest celebrated with this play its fortieth anniversary but the author was absent from the first night. He also revised his play Delilah which was retitled The Blue Danube in its English translation and was filmed in Hollywood with Mary Astor as its star. The novel Autumn Journey was written in Paris, mostly in a quiet corner of the Café Régence—as he used to work in some Budapest café. In the States he also rewrote his Waxworks; he prepared another version of Miracle Among The Mountains and it was produced in New York but without success. His play The Servant Girl of the King shared the same fate; after the try-out in Baltimore it did not reach New York. His last play, Game of Hearts, a sad proof of his mental decline, remained unperformed. His novel Farewell my Heart was written in his hotel room. It was published in German with the title Lebewohl mein 134 [pageend134]Herz. I have not heard of a Hungarian edition. Molnár’s last work, Companion in Exile (Notes for an Autobiography after appearing in New York, was also published in Budapest in Hungarian and provoked much argument. Some of his critics praised it, others denounced it. But it isn’t really important whether the book is good or bad. It contains data, to be found nowhere else, for a Molnár biography and a study worthy of him, which still remain to be written. There are pages in it which are like the swansong of Ferenc Molnár, the poet—pages in which he erects a memorial to Wanda Bartha, “light of my life”—and these pages make you forget any shortcomings of the book. While writing this brief essay, I recalled again and again the man who has been dead ten years. I saw again the young journalist of the early century with his thick hair, his shining eyeglass, his well-brushed top hat; the dramatist, having achieved his first successes ; the war correspondent in uniform who hated war; the editor at whose side I was so happy to work; the world-famous playwright of the twenties whose hair had grown white, almost trembling in excitement on all his Budapest first nights; and finally, the late afternoon in September 1938, the terrace of a Paris café where we sat together with Molnár talking only about the Nazi outrages, the menace of the approaching* war and of emigrating to America When dusk fell, we shook hands with barely a word. I never saw him again. But as I walked alone towards the Opera, I realized that this writer of genius, this great poet lacked one talent—the talent for happiness. . . 135 [pageend135]GEORGE PÁLOCZI HORVÁTH THE SCIENTISTS OF “THIS PARTICULAR LITTLE COUNTRY” Arthur Koestler . . . was a member of that unpar- donably brilliant Hungarian emigration which has peopled the universities, the publishing houses, the laboratories and the authors’ societies of the West. Why this particular little country should have become, as it were, radioactive and have thrown off these stimulating, if irritant, human particles is unknown. But it did so. (John Strachey : The Strangled Cry, Encounter, London, November 1960.) The pressure in that “particular little country” was terrific. Wedged between powerful Germanic and Slavic masses, enclosed by the huge barriers of a small and difficult language, oppressed by the feeling of an imposed provincial pattern, of being cut off from Europe, her artists and intellectuals always felt frustrated and musclebound. The system of education was responsible for an overproduction of artists and intellectuals who had no opportunities equal to their talents. “Getting out” meant to escape from the straitjackets of this situation. There are doubtlessly many other reasons why Hun- g’ary has become “radioactive” in the sense Mr. Strachey used this word. I personally do not believe that one can make valid generalisations about groups of millions of people, that is, I do not believe that, there are- such things as unchanging “national characteristics”, independent of time and circumstances. I do not believe that “Hungarians” are more or less talented than the members of any other nation. Like 136 [pageend136]all other nations, Hungary is a conglomeration and melting pot of many peoples and nations; even more so. This diaspora of talent, I feel, has nothing to do with “inherited national characteristics.” It must originate in some aspects of the Hungarian pattern. * * * It is typical of Hungarians that they never troubled to compile a list of these “stimulating, if irritant, human particles” their country catapulted into the wide world. I cannot do so here; only give my impression of this phenomenon. At home a great many people had to work, so to speak, below their rank. Actors who should have played leading parts had to be satisfied with tiny roles, writers of stature worked as reporters, and scientists who should have directed their own institutes, taught in middle schools. In my particular school mathematics was taught by Mr. Mikola who presented his subject as such an exciting intellectual adventure, that he seduced many would-be poets. These, abandoning their muse, dedicated their life to mathematics or theoretical physics. Mr. Mikola got his university chair only late in life. But by that time he was responsible for launching on scientific careers a number of young men who played later a very great role in nuclear physics and in the electronic revolution. One of these became known in the West as Johann von Neumann; he worked out the mathematics of electronic computers. He was a last year student at my Budapest school when I entered it. I do not know exactly how many of the Edward Tellers, Szilards and Karmans were Mr. Mikola’s students. But there were many Mikolas in Hungarian schools. It was due to them, that at one time the Scientific Advisory Committee of the American Atomic Energy Board, could 137 [pageend137]continue its discussions in Hungarian if two of the seven members were absent. Many universities of the world have Hungarians among its eminent professors. Most of them left Hungary soon after graduation. The list of the Hungarian Nobel Prize winners gives a clue to the riddle why they did so. The list is not long: Philip Lenard, Physics, 1905 Robert Barany, Medicine, 1914 Richard Zsigmondy, Chemistry, 1925 Albert Szentgyorgyi, Medicine 1937 George Hevesy de Heves, Chemistry, 1943 Dr. G. Bekesy, Medicine, 1961. It is significant that with the single exception of Professor Szentgyorgyi, all of them lived and worked in emigration at the time when they received the Nobel Prize. And Professor Szentgyorgyi himself, was no real exception. He left Hungary soon after graduation, reached his scientific stature in the Netherlands. He returned to Hungary a few years before the Nobel award, and after the second world war he again left Hungary, this time for good, and settled in America. The dates when these men received the Nobel Prize seem to indicate that political systems had very little to do with their emigration. From the Hungary of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, that of Admiral Horthy, scientists emigrated just as regularly as from the Hungary which became a Soviet satellite. It is true that during the Hitler-Stalin era, many scientists left, their countries for political reasons. But from small countries scientists always emigrated in large numbers for the simple reason that at home they could not get the laboratories and finance necessary for their work. * ♦ * 138 [pageend138]Tlie Hungarian atomic scientists, physicists and mathematicians working in the United States, are well known. Dr. E. Teller, for instance, held for years the most important post a scientist can hope to occupy. In Britain at the present, there are a number of Hungarians who have a great international reputation in their respective fields. Professor Michael Polanyi after having accomplished important work in his branch of the natural sciences, built up a second and equally great reputation as a philosopher. Professor Dennis Gabor, a world-authority on electronics, a former collaborator of Max Planck, became a few years ago the first professor of applied electronics. He has his own institute at London University. The economists Thomas Balogh (Oxford) and Nicholas Kaldor (London School of Economics and Political Science) collaborated with Lord Beveridge on the economics of welfare states, and served as economic advisers of many countries in various continents. In sociology the greatest name among Hungarian emigrants was the late Karl Mannheim, who founded the famous Institute of Sociology at the University of Frankfurt. After Hitler’s coming to power, he came to England where he founded the well-known International Library for Sociology, Psychology and Anthropology. He taught at the London School of Economics. Professor Mannheim’s works on the sociology of ideologies and of knowledge, are great contributions to man’s knowledge on these subjects. Among the Hungarian intellectuals working in Switzerland, the best known is professor Karl Kerenyi who left his chair of Classical Philology at Budapest University in 1944, to teach at Basle University and later in Zurich. He is a noted humanist and his correspondence with Thomas Mann on the subject of the creation of myths, caused very wide interest. His 139 [pageend139]works on ancient religions and on mythology, have been translated into many languages. He is the coauthor with C. G. Jung of the “Introduction to a Science of Mythology.” * * * I do not and indeed cannot give an over-all picture, only an impression. Among the pre-1956 Hungarian exiles, I know about men, like Pál Kelemen, the noted historian of art, who works in Latin America but lives in the United States. In Brazil, the land of architects, Madame Paul Rona teaches architecture at the University of Rio de Janeiro. In Paris, Tibor Mende, the well-known authority on India and China, teaches at the Sorbonne. His books—China and Her Shadow; conversations with Mr. Nehru, The Chinese Revolution,—have been published in many languages. Among the exiles of the 1956 revolution, we have Dr. George Berczi, who has his own research team at Melbourne University. With the help of a thirty-five thousand pound grant from the Australian government, Dr. Berczi developed a TV camera small enough to be inserted in the human body as an aid of diagnosing cancer, and to televise operations for teaching of medical students. Endre Snots is a geologist. He now leads the research department of one of France’s large oil companies. He has struck oil in France and is in charge on analysing all earth samples the company gets from its Saharan exploration fields. And other post-1956 refugee, Balint Kiss, a chemist, heads now the Hutchinson Research Laboratory, outside Paris. Professor Francis Valy is on the faculty of the University of Massachussetts. His “Servitudes of International Law”, is a widely used university textbook. He is the author of a massive volume on the Hungarian revolution: “Rift and Revolt in Hun- 140 [pageend140]gary” published in America, Britain and Germany last year. The majority of the post-revolutionary exiles, who left Hungary during the winter of 1956/57, were, between eighteen and twenty-five. The,y have started to work at university institutes, research laboratories, in the literary departments of publishing houses, etc. only a few years ago. In sociology, economics and the other political sciences, their contribution is an intimate knowledge of not only the theory but also of the practice of “Marxism-Leninism”. They and their colleagues whose subject is philosophy or one of the natural sciences, have on initial advantage over the young men who were born and brought up in the normal world of common sense and common decency: they do not take their newly-won freedom of thought and research for granted. For them the absence of dogmatic interference, of constant bullying, is a wonderful gift received from fate. This, and the challenge of a strange environment, the challenge of language difficulties, prompt them to greater efforts. One can only hope that in the decades to come they will produce important contributions to science and philosophy. 141 [pageend141]NOTES AND REVIEWS † LASZLO BEKEFFI Am 22. Januar dieses Jahres wurde ein 71 jähriger Mann auf einem Zürcher Spitalbett durch den unerbitt'ichen Mäher, den er zu Leibzeiten missachtet und verspottet hat, besiegt. Anderthalb Jahre hat der Kampf gedauert, welchem Laszlo Bekeffi — jetzt das erste Mal, aber für ewig — unterlag. Er lacht nicht mehr und bringt auch niemanden mehr zum Lachen, sein Leib ist Staub und Asche, seine Seele wanderte in das Reich des ewigen Geheimnisse. Sein Geist, nicht allein sein Humor hat sein Wesen geformt, sein Geist hat ihm seine Lebensaufgabe vorgezeichnet. Diese Aufgabe war : dienen dem Schönen, dem Guten, der Humanität, der menschlichen Solidarität, geissein das Ruchlose und die Sünde. Hinter dem Scherz und Spott, verbarg sich immer ein tieferer Sinn, das wahre Ziel seiner eigenartigen Kunst. Bekeffis Vater war ein hervorragender Journalist in Szeged, die Mutter eine bedeutende Schauspielerin, er hat somit Feder und schauspielerische Begabung geerbt. Vielleicht wurde er von seinem Engel mit dem göttlichem Geschenk — das nur wenige besitzen — seine Mitmenschen zum Lachen bringen zu können in dem Augenblick seiner Geburt beschert. Tausende und abertausende lachten über ein Wort, eine Geste, eine Grimasse, ein Augenzwinkern von ihm und — es ist keine Uebertreibung — mitunter auch über eine stumme Regungslosigkeit. Den Glossen der bisher ungeschriebenen Geschichte des ungarischen Kabaretts ist es Vorbehalten herauszufinden, wann und wie wurde aus dem Schauspieler Laszlo Bekeffi Conferencier und wie gestaltete er die politische Satire mit Wort, Spiel und Mimik zu den brillantsten Programmstücken der ungarischen Kleinbühne. In dieser Kunstgattung diente er — neben seiner schriftstellerischen Tätigkeit — der Humanität und geisselte die Sünde, da er mit seinem geistreichen 142 [pageend142]Humor nicht nur das Publikum zum Lachen brachte, er führte auch einen Kampf gegen alles Widerwertige, erteilte nach allen Seiten Hiebe und Stiebe. Als Endre Nagy’s Nachfolger politischer Conferencier zu sein, war keine leichte Aufgabe. Diese Kunstgattung hat sein Urheber fast zu einer Vollendung gebracht. Es ist der beste Beweis für Bekeffis Begabung, Einfallreichtum und Geist, das er seinem Meister würdig war. Er stand in schweren Zeiten auf der Bühne, als die Politik Leben und Blut bedeutete. Bekeffi verkündete stets tapfer und ohne Kompromiss seine Ueberzeugung, seinen Geist und Glauben. Er geisselte die Hitler-Schuftherrschaft, widersetzte sich den ungarischen Judengesetzen, den Pfeilkreuzlern und deren Vorläufern. Die Rache hat ihn ereilt : am 16 März 1942 wurde er verhaftet, sodann zum Tode verurteilt, was in der letzten Minute in 12 Jahre Zuchthaus verwandelt wurde. Er schmachtete zunächst in ungarischen Gefängnissen, wurde aber im November 1944 nach Dachau verschleppt. Amerikanische Soldaten haben ihn befreit und in sehr bedenklichen Gesundheitszustand nach der Schweiz gebracht, wo er geheilt wurde. Inzwischen regierte aber in Budapest der von dem Kreml eingesetzte Statthalter Matyas Rakosi. Bekeffi ging nicht nach Hause. Er verachtete die rote Diktatur ebenso, wie die braune. Aus der Schweiz wanderte er nach London, später nach Amerika. Er war dort schriftstellerisch und als Conferencier tätig, Ort, Zeit und Sprache waren aber nicht mehr von seiner Welt. Vor einigen Jahren übersiedelte er nach der Schweiz, krank und gebrochenen Herzens. Irdische Rettung gab es nicht mehr. Seine ein- geascherte sterbliche Hülle wartet auf einem Zürcher Friedhof darauf, einst in der Heimat zu ruhen. Ernö Halasz 143 [pageend143]COMMENT MESSAGE OF SUPPORT FOR THE WRITERS IN EXILE'S MANIFESTO CONCERNING: ‘ARBITRARY MEASURES TAKEN BY COMMUNISTS IN BERLIN' RECEIVED FROM THE VIET-NAM CENTRE 2nd October, 1961. Par le truchement d’un manifeste du Centre P.E.N. des Ecrivains en Exil et des informations de presses, nous, écrivains du Centre P.E.N. du Viêt-Nam, sommes vraiment écœurés devant une nouvelle forme d’exactions et de pressions déployées par PU.R.S.S. à Berlin. L’histoire est là pour prouver que, ni rideaux, ni bastions, ni lignes d’aucune sorte, n’ont jamais pu prétendre emmurer perpétuellement des hommes. Pour ceux qui ne croient qu’à la Force, la grande muraille de Chine doit leur donner une preuve flagrante de la faiblesse et de l’inanité de cette Force même. La situation actuelle de l’Allemagne est, sur certains côtés, analogue à celle de notre Viêt-Nam libre. Une sympathie naturelle et spontanée rend solidaires tous ceux qui souffrent. Aussi, nous nous permettons d’exprimer ici, toute l’admira- tive estime que nous portons à l’Allemagne de l’Ouest, au peuple allemand et aux écrivains allemands. ‘THE TIMES’ WRITES: The Soviet central newspapers have launched a campaign for the reorganization of the book publishing industry. The Government newspaper Izvestia has called for the setting up of a central institution to control all publishing in the Soviet Union. Literaturnaya Gazeta, the organ of the Writers’ Union, also declared a few days ago that : “There is no branch of our economy with so much fortuitousness, disorganization, lack of planning, chaos and stupidity as the book publishing business.” 144 [pageend144]Russia produced six books a head of population over the past year at a cost of 15s. for every man, woman and child. Indeed, Russians claim they publish more books than any other country. However, it is now admitted that very large numbers, worth “hundreds of millions of new roubles”, remain unsold. This is partly due to duplication and the fact that the selection of titles bears little relation to the demand. When the authorities begin to give particular attention to some subject—to agriculture, for instance, during the past year—every publishing house begins to think it its duty to produce a volume on the subject. According to Litcratur- naya Gazeta local publishers try to “respond” to “every campaign, event or decree as if there existed no other publishers in the country”. It is most laudable to encourage agricultural progress, the paper points out. But it says the actual result is an avalanche of very similar books. Poultry Puzzle The encouragement of poultry breeding saw the publication of 225 Eggs from a Hen, 216 Eggs from a Hen, To Obtain 160 Eggs from a Hen, 165 Eggs from Every Hen, &c. The paper states that 122 different books on the subject were published simultaneously in different parts of the country. Luckily one book was What the Poultry Farmer should Read. There are 250 publishing houses that are subordinated to Ministries. But several thousand institutes, bureaus, offices and departments publish without any kind of coordination or specialization as to subject matter. With almost 200 publishers of scientific literature and about 100 dealing with economic subjects—quite apart from the lesser publishers, whom the paper refers to as “amateurs”—there is a great deal of parallelism and duplication. Izvestia illustrated the state of affairs by saying that no sooner had the Soviet State Publishing House brought out H. G. Wells’s Mr. Blettsworthy on Rampole Island in an edition of 100,000 copies than the state publishers of Byelorussia brought it out in a further edition of 100.000. Editions Too Large Another reason for the accumulation of unsold books is the large editions of works which it can be foreseen will sell badly. Literaturnaya Gazeta wrote that big stocks of un145 [pageend145]salable books by all sorts of Ivan Ivanoviches and Petr Petroviches are accumulating because “Ivan Ivanovich or Petr Petrovich have authority or influential friends, or are subservient or simply in need of cash for their daily bread ; and are able to work on publishers and editors, although their books are useless to everyone apart from the authors’’. One example referred to was a volume of aphorisms found in manuscripts of the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries. This was published in an edition of 42,000 copies. It is pointed out that too many Soviet publishers find it pays them to republish old works rather than issue new books. Thus, the publishing house Sovietsky Pisatel is planning to reprint 11 titles, in editions of 100,000 each, in the first quarter of 1962. Over the past nine years 900 titles of poetry and belles-lettres were published in Alma Ata, the capital of Kazakhstan ; but of these only 156 were published for the first time. It is also regretted that it is profitable for publishers to put out books about spies, love and “elegant life abroad”, and also to translate books on which they do not have to pay royalties. EIN PAAR WORTE UEBER DIE ARS HUNGARICA “Kunst- und literarisches Institut — Verlag geflüchteter ungarischer Schriftsteller und Künstler” heisst es im Firmenregister des Wiener Handelsgerichts. Und die ARS HUN- GARICA — “ungarische Kunst” — in ihrer Eigenschaft als Verlags- und Vertriebsbetrieb, entspricht den in ihrem Namen enthaltenen Zielsetzungen restlos. Ihre Tätigkeit übt die ARS HÜNGARICA seit ihrer Gründung im Herbst 1957 ununterbrochen aus. Ihre Mitarbeiter sind ungarische Schriftsteller, Dichter, Maler und Graphiker, die nach der Niederwerfung des Volksauf Standes im deutschsprachigen Raum neue Heimat gefunden haben. Das materielle Ziel dieses Verlags ist, ungarischen Dichtern und Künstlern ein bescheidenes, aber sicheres Fortkommen zu gewährleisten. Dieses Ziel wurde erreicht. Heute leben schon 30 146 [pageend146]Flüchtlingsfamilien, — Intellektuellen, Angestellte, Vertreter, — von der Tätigkeit der ARS HUNGARICA, ja, sogar Oesterreicher und Deutsche werden hier beschäftigt. Aber dieser Verlag, der tatsächlich aus dem Nichts aufgebaut worden ist, hat auch eine andere, eine ideelle Aufgabe zu erfüllen. Diese Aufgabe, in dem Namen enthalten, ist der kommerzielle Vertrieb echter ungarischer Kunst, ungarischer Dichtkunst. Und der Verlag bemüht sich, diesem grossen, mit vielen Schwierigkeiten verbundenen Ziel nahezukommen. Zehn verschiedene Bücher — eine Anthologie, Miniaturen aus der tausendjährigen Geschichte Ungarns, ein Novellenband, der das heutige Leben hinter dem “Eisernen Vorhang” schildert, und Gedichtbände, — sind in deutscher, englischer, französischer und holländischer Sprache erschienen und haben ihren Weg zu dem Leser im Ausland gefunden. Vielleicht einen noch grösseren moralischen und künstlerischen Erfolg konnte die ARS HUNGARICA mit der Herausgabe ungarischer bildender Kunst erzielen. In den vergangenen fünf Jahren sind nicht weniger als 239 Radierungen verschiedener Motive erschienen. Diese Radierungen wurden von ungarischen Graphikern hergestellt, sie sind entweder Kopien der berühmten Werke alter Meister oder eigene Kompositionen. Mihály Munkácsy und Géza Meszöly sind hier ebenso vertreten wie Rembrandt, Dürer, Lippi, oder moderne wie Daumier und Buffet. Diesen Verlag hat Georg Molnar, ein Mitglied des P.E.N. Clubs, ins Leben gerufen. Seiner Energie und seinen langjährigen Erfahrungen — er war Direktor und Inhaber des bekannten Budapester Buchverlags “Magyar Téka”, — ist es zu verdanken, dass dieser Verlag, der mit seiner Tätigkeit in einem Untermietzimmer angefangen hatte, in fremdem Boden Wurzeln fassen und mit Erfolg fortbestehen konnte. Die ARS HUNGARICA hat sich ein neues, ein gewagtes Ziel gesetzt. Sie beabsichtigt, in Zukunft Bücher von Exilschriftstellern, welcher Nationalität immer, herauszubringen. Sie hofft, diese Angabe, wenn auch in bescheidenen Rahmen, so doch aus eigenen Mitteln, ihrer Bestimmung — und man kqnnte schon fast sagen, — ihrer Tradition entsprechend, erfüllen zu können. 147 [pageend147]Endékkônyv a Röt Bizáncról, Válogatott Verseh: GYORGY BALU DY'S SELECTED POEMS. London, Magyar Könyves Céh, 1961. 1. It would be foolish to review an untranslated and possibly untranslateable book in Hungarian for readers who neither speak, nor read the poet’s language by following the conventions of routine reviewing. Therefore I shall take the unusual step of recording thoughts provoked by a reading of Faludy’s poems — however arrogant such action may seem to be ; but : the writer is partly responsible for the thoughts provoked by him—let him, in this instance, be judged by the reaction to the reaction he has created : this is as close as I can bring him to strangers. (“Reviews”, admiration and acknowledgment, he will receive from his compatriots, in his mother-tongue ; and those who have been granted the privilege of understanding the fountain-head of his inspiration, the language, will be able to check whether the official celebration which has already greeted the appearance of this volume, has been adequate.) 2. Language, the pleasure of the spoken and outspoken word is the first source of poetic inspiration. The physical sensation of joy that the tongue experiences by following the strange shapes of pronounced vowel and consonant. The child knows it as he carefully repeats the beauty of sound. Most adults lose the faculty of experiencing it, — by growing away from the simple and intoxicating pleasures of the body. Fa- ludy has remained a child, inebriated by the sound of words which he renders inebriatingly. 3. I should like to know whether Faludy has preserved the child in him by an effort of the will, or if he was fortunate enough not to grow up—as his humdrum contemporaries did in the dull course of official lives. Like a child he is still able to be afraid of death, the shapes of the unknown dark—and, like the child, he cannot relate the fantastic phantasy of annihilation to the prosaic and verifiable agencies of human suffering. All objects turn into miracles when he touches them or speaks of them ; and symbols surround him like pigeons gathering around a hand that scatters grains to them : he is a small figure, obliterated by the aerial fluttering of 148 [pageend148]their wings. Scattering words like corn, he is surrounded by phantoms which rush to feed from his steady palm. That is the way to see him. Severe classical lines in the background, columns, fountains, palaces. At any rate if you are going to paint his portrait. But there is more to it than that. 4 I believe that all great poets must also be great as men. This is a point I cannot prove except by inverting the sense of the statement : Wordsworth, to my mind, might have been a great poet ; that he did not live up to his own promise follows from his betrayal of the man he once had been. I should like to be better acquainted with the man to whom I am devoting these lines : I should like to be a friend of his : 1 am nearly certain that he may be a great man, incapable of the subtleties of adult social treachery : he is such a fine poet. 5. Three poems are enough : there are three locks on the gate which bars entrance to human immortality, (think of Coleridge, Suckling, Carew). Six poems : and you are a giant among immortals. Where does Faludy stand? I am not sure. I am too near to take the measure of the full size of these poems. I am inclined to say four, four-and-a-half, four-and- three-quarters. (I am auctioneering my belief in a man.) The Greeks spoke of the several images that justified their belief in the essential humanity of man with what appears to be necessary frivolity. 6. Faludy’s crowning achievement is the justification of this belief in the humanity of man ; the voice matured in adversity. The brilliant, and occasionally rather superficial technique which was his gift, suddenly and almost miraculously ripened and subordinated itself to expressing Yeats’s “terrible beauty”. (Yeats had no influence on Faludy : the kinship which strikes me so forcibly is natural.) — Except for another Hungarian, Miklós Radnóti, there is no other poet whose early promise I so wholly misjudged in my eager but complacent admiration, and from whom I received so much. (T suspected both of being unable to change and grow.) He has recreated for me what I missed of the trials of my home by his honest response to the years that led to 1956. 7. I am calling his response “honest” ; I dare not speak of courage. I am accustomed to seeking authority for my 149 [pageend149]Statements in dictionaries. Faludy may not measure up to English contemporary definitions of courage. In yesterday’s Observer (22nd October, 1961) John Wain, one of our foremost writers and critics, writing in connexion with C. S. Lewis’s Experiment in Criticism (Cambridge University Press, 1961), makes the following remarks (which we may take as our definition of the word, at least as far as current exchange rates are concerned) : “In putting out this book”—Mr Wain asserts—“which contains a number of sharp challenges to the Cambridge party line, Mr Lewis has shown a courage that can best be appreciated by anyone who has ever spent an evening in the company of youths who have been put through this discipline.”—George Faludy does not know : 1. Cambridge party lines, 2. youths who have been put through the Leavis machine ; George Faludy wrote poems by memorizing them in solitary confinement, by jotting them down on extorted confessions. When called on by the spirits of another discipline, he assumed the sacred role of the poet to call down curses on the ogres rearing across the ugly frontiers of politics. He was ready to put his trust into words. 8. I do not pretend to be able to explain what compels men to speak with the biblical voice of Radnóti and Faludy when these same men would have appeared to the onlooker as the least likely to speak with the voice of true authority before they had been elected by circumstance to declare themselves. However, the choice of chance had to be deserved. They were ready to wait. The voice of solitude which spoke to man once upon a time in the desert today speaks to him in concentration camps and prisons. 9. Crime is the decision of society to punish. The ghost of Villon (whom Faludy regarded fair and attractive game in his youth) reappeared perhaps to him in prison, guided him like that elder brother whom we all seek to save us from the peril of being merely ourselves when writing verses. The name taken in vain becomes the emblem of Faludy’s victory when he has atoned for the vainglory of youth : human shades are more generous than the jealous shades of religion. 10. Faludy is not an original poet ; all the varied traditions of Europe speak up through him, but, in doing so, they speak up for what is good in Europe ; the idea of the indivi150 [pageend150]dual, the idea of the solitary man who is responsible to his own conscience for what he does or does not do. 11. But you are at liberty to say that my definition of what is Essentially European does not stand up to scrutiny. If Goethe’s opinions on the subject survive (and possibly they do, ponderously pragmatic in their unalterable wisdom), they are likely to refer to Faust’s quest for the unattainable. (I have never yet come across opinions that could not be supported by pronouncements of Goethe.) At any rate, according to such Germanic criteria our great Europeans would include figures like Lucretius, Newton, Bernard Shaw,—and Hitler. Strange company indeed,—it would exclude Mozart and Shakespeare. There is knowledge which does not have to be fought for ; which does not seek to explain itself by dark references to the exotic song of strange birds and the heavy scent of flowering trees, transparent tools of the mute mystic; there is human companionship. 12. That you are not alone in being solitary—that is the clue. Accept the solitude of your cell for what it is : one in an endless row. Faludy’s voice belongs to the community of the suppressed. 13. Villon’s persona are more representative than those of Ezra Pound. Villon belonged : never betrayed his characters for personal end. Faludy was also unable to betray his companions (although, in his handling, his companions became, to a certain extent, ideals as well). This is the point where debt, inheritance and poetic outlook fuse. 14. Yet Faludy is a self-centred writer : it is his voice (the emphatic “I” of the poets) that speaks in these verses. Is one justified in identifying his ideals with the persona of Villon? We live in times when concepts, the fictive phantasmagoria of the brain assume the flesh and blood reality of mortal bodies. Ageing like Villon’s whores. 15. Reality describes and circumscribes the unknown. Facts, once accepted as facts, whether they stand up to the test of time or not, determine the context of our thinking. Faludy, whom I have called a poet of traditions, is very much a 20th Century poet in this sense. He is modern because his themes are the major themes of our daily lives. When our children’s children read him they will know what sorts of men we were 151 [pageend151]to take serious interest in the sub-planetary aspects of our humanity. He has defined the murderous phenomena of the century—and in facing up to the abstract concepts, he affirms the continuing reality of the humanity of man. 16. And merely an afterthought : how much easier it is to resist the temptation to betray friends than to remain faithful to the self. Under torture the thought of friendships may save you from treachery—but what is the measure of moral courage that gives you strength to believe in yourself. There is only the very exceptional man who possesses it : Faludy is one them. No t e s : The names I have mentioned in this review are intended to provide points of reference : in charting unknown territory one makes use of geographically defined objects, such as cities, rivers etc. ; I have not made an unconscious selection. Originally I intended to add a translation (mine) of one of Faludy’s poems. To finish off, as it were, in the grand style. On second thoughts I am certain that nothing I could provide could live up to the original’s consummate mastery. J. C. Arkay Szabolcs Vajay: Szente.lt Berek (The Blessed Forest), Amr- rlkai Magyar Kiadó, Munich, 1955. Eleven Kö (Living Stone), Amerikai Magyar Kiadó, Munich, 1958. Láne (Necklace), Magyar Ház, Bruxelles, 1959. The writer in exile has the choice of mastering the language of his new country or he can go on writing in his mother tongue. For writers who emigrated from countries now under communist domination the task to preserve the language,—the language of the past,—is something a thousand times worthwhile. We are all painfully aware of the 152 [pageend152]deterioration and degradation the language goes through in the old country, where the language of copywriters,—trying to tell communist doctrines,—is unsurping the place of the language of poets and writers. And we are also shamefully aware of the deterioration of our mother tongue in emigration. We ourselves misuse it day after day, turning our syntax into the copy of alien tongues and interspersing our talk—if not our writing—with mongrified alien expressions. The writer who writes in his mother tongue and recreates for us the richness and beauty of the language bequeathed to him by the great writers, poets, historians, bards and speakers of the past, brings a great gift indeed. The writer in emigration who writes a language of clarity, balance, music and poetry, a language rich of texture and full of enchantment—deserves the gratitude of his readers. Such a writer is Szabolcs Vajay. A writer who treats his language with such reverence, such love and tenderness deserves to be read for the beautiful language of his books alone. It would be niggardly to insist that the plots of his parables sometimes lack originality, or that sometimes—as at the end of “Living Stone” he tries too hard to drive home a point which is already obvious. These become secondary when instead he gives us a prose which suddenly can leap into sheer poetry. “Láne” (Necklace) is the kaleidoscopic story of an Egyptian necklace drawn up against a colourful historical back- drop. It is the story of various people through the ages whose fate becomes involved with the necklace—a carrier of ill fate. “Eleven kö” (Living Stone) is the story of a stone Cross on a Hungarian roadside. The Cross recalls the fates of people whose lives it has seen to ebb away. Its days are numbered because the communist party secretary has decided that the cross has to be removed to make way for road widening. In its final hours the Cross meditates about the spiritual inter-relation of the stone image of Christ and the idea, the Faith, it represents. “Szentelt Berek” (Blessed Forest) is an anthology of modern world literature. Vajay in his introduction offers these excerpts, translated by him into Hungarian—to his fellow countrymen whose last ten years or more in life have been so uprooted and disturbed that they were not able to keep 153 [pageend153]up their reading and whose image of modern European—and American literature—is consequently out of date. It is an anthology of 16 authors from six countries whose oeuvre has been acknowledged by literary prices and who became best sellers. He introduces each author with a carefully written little essay and the anthology gives a useful introduction into the stream of the most talked-about modern writers. Marianne Blair Albert Vajda: Egy lépés elöre, kettö össze vissza. (One step forward, two in all directions), Otthon Könyvtar, London, 1958. Albert Vajda’s book contains two short stories. The first “One step forward, two in all directions” is a caricature of Soviet colonisation. A peaceful, prosperous, happy island in the Pacific is taken over by the Captain and crew of a Soviet sub-marine. Life is soon shattered, the homes broken up, forced labour and prison camps introduced and the police is given unlimited power. Vajda makes clever use of all three ingredients of a humorist’s arsenal. The words are a pharaphrase of standard soviet phraseology and the pomposity of half-baked clichés is overblown till they explode into absurdity. The characters are stock figures of fun in any country under Soviet occupation where people try to preserve a flicker of their former high spirits. Here they are stereotyped to such an extent that they become irresistibly ridiculous. And finally the situations achieve such a precarious balance between reality and absurdity, that in spite of their bitter core they strike the leader as hilarious. The second story “Isten veled Churchill bácsi” (Good bye Uncle Churchill) is in a completely different vein and is a tender, if somewhat sentimental story of a man’s love trans- fered from the mother to the daughter against the background a warshattered Hungary in 1948. M. B. 154 [pageend154]OUR CONTRIBUTORS La jo s ZILAHY was born 1891 in Nagyszalonta. He served with distinction in the first world war, entered journalism afterwards and with his first play—called “The Sun is Shining”, a warmhearted evocation of Hungarian village life— rose at once to the front rank of Hungarian letters. Since then he has produced a great volume of uniformly distinguished work. Of his novels “Two Prisoners”, “Something Drifts on the Water”, “The Guns Look Back”, “The Dukays” and “The Angry Angel” are perhaps the most outstanding, translated into more than twenty languages. His plays, including the prophetic “The Twelfth Hour”, “The General”, “Musical Clowns” and several others, were performed widely throughout Europe. Zilahy has been also active as an antiNazi publicist, an indefatigable worker for international cultural understanding, editor and humanist. He has written and produced his own films in Hungary and worked in Hollywood. For a short time after the last war he was President of the Soviet-Hungarian Cultural Society but left his country in 1947 and now lives in New York, the most outstanding representative of Hungarian exile literature. The story “But for This” by Mr. Zilahy was called in the original Hungarian “When Did Janos Kovacs Die?” and was an early work, translated into twenty-six languages. It was last reprinted in the volume “The Writer’s Craft” as a classic example of the “Short-Short Story” with the editorial comment : “This touching story actually encompasses all the techniques of the other stories and because of its theme, and since it is virtually a work of art in itself, I would dare to rate it above Chekhov.” Fe r en c MOLNAR (1878-1952) was beyond doubt the most widely known Hungarian playwright of our century, a virtuoso of the stage. His sophisticated and often symbolic language, combined with a polished economy of style, revealed him as a superbly gifted and effective dramatist. Born in Budapest, he led a cosmopolitan life until totalitarianism forced him into his American exile. He was a delightful humorist whose sketches won him early popularity ; an accomplished novelist (“The Hungry City”, “The Boys of Paul Street”, 155 [pageend155]“Andor”, “Column of Steam”, “The story of a masterless boat” etc.) and a keen observer and recorder of urban life. Of his plays (most of which were filmed and practically all performed world-wide) “Liliom”, “The Swan”, “Olympia”, “The Devil”, “Miracle Among the Mountains”, “The Red Mill”, “Harmonia”, “Riviera” are perhaps the most outstanding. His last work was the moving evocation of his secretary, Wanda, in “Companion in Exile”. Ge o r g e MIKES was born in Hungary and came to London in 1938 to represent various Budapest papers. His assignment was for two weeks but he has stayed in England ever since, working as author, journalist and BBC script writer. He became famous as an English humorist with his book “How to be an Alien” which has sold 250,000 copies in England alone and has been translated into over two dozen languages. His other books, almost equally successful, include “How to Scrape Skies”, “Wisdom for Others”, “Milk and Honey”, “East is East”, Ueber Alles”, “Little Cabbages”, “Italy for Beginners”, “Down with Everybody”, “Shakespeare and Myself”, “Eight Humorists”, “How to be Inimitable”, “Tango” and, in more serious vein “A Study in Infamy : The Hungarian Secret Police” and “The Hungarian Revolution”. Mikes is an inveterate traveller, a frequent guest on television, a delightful wit and a contributor to many reviews and newspapers both in England and abroad. El me r RICE, an International Vice President of P.E.N. and one of the most distinguished playwrights of our century, was born in 1892. He graduated from the New York Law School at the age of twenty but soon abandoned law for writing. His first play On Trial (1914) was a murder mystery employing the technique of the motion-picture ‘flash back’ to present scenes described by the trial witnesses. His works for the Morningside Players, a little theatre group, were published in Morningside Plays (1917). In 1923 he had his second great success with The Adding Machine, one of the key plays of modern drama, a satirical fantasy using the technique of Expressionism. Equally successful was Street Scene (1929) which won the Pulitzer Prize and was turned into an opera by Kurt Weill. We, the People (1933), a panoramic view of American life was also a passionate protest against social 156 [pageend156]abuses ; Judgment Day (1934) dealt with the Reichstag Fire trials and was followed by Between Two Worlds (1935), American Landscape (1938), Two on an Island (1940), Flight to the West (1941), Dream Girl (1946) and several others. His novels include A Voyage to Puerilia, a brilliant satire of Hollywood (1930) and Imperial City (1937) a realistic, panoramic novel of New York. He has recently published a study of the modern theatre, based on lectures delivered at Columbia University. Mr. Rice’s essay on censorship, written some years ago, supports strikingly our ‘Argument’ in this issue which is devoted to the same subject. Eu g en RELGIS is a Rumanian writer who lives in Uruguay and is a professor of the University of Montevideo. His many works—acclaimed by Romain Rolland, Stefan Zweig and others—include “Diario de Otofio”, “Mirón el Sordo” (a novel, with a preface by Stefan Zweig), “Las Amistades de Mirón”, “Melodias del Silencio” (prose poems), “Sudamé- rica” (poems), “Sendas en Espiral”, “Doce Capitales”, “Romain Rolland”, “Stefan Zweig, Cazador de Almas”. “El Humanitarismo”, “Los Principios Humanitaristas” (with an introduction by Albert Einstein), “Humanitarismo y Socia- lismo”, “História Sexual de la Humanidad”, “Cosmometa- polis”, “La Columna entre Ruinas”, “El Espiritu Activo”, “Profetas y Poetas” (three volumes of essays), “Albores de Libertad”, “La Literatura, El Arte y La Guerra”, “El Hombre Libre frente a la Barberie Totalitaria”, “Calenda- rio”, “Entre la Guerra y la Paz” etc. K.

Sein soeben vollendeter Roman : “Immer war der Boden heiss” steht vor der Drucklegung. Er n o HALASZ ist in Eger in Ungarn geboren, studierte Rechtswissenschaft an den Universitäten in Eger, Kolozsvár und Budapest. Schon während dieser Zeit übte er eine intensive journalistische und literarische Tätigkeit aus. Während des ersten Weltkieges leistete er als Offizier Militärdienst an der Ostfront. Nach dem Kriege nahm er seine literarische Tätigkeit wieder auf. Er schrieb Romane, Novellen, Bühnenstücke, Verse, und übersetzte Bücher aus der deutschen, französischen und englischen Sprache ins Ungarische. Als Hitlers Truppen Ungarn besetzten wurde er verhaftet und ins Konzentrationslager geschleppt. Nach dem zweiten Weltkrieg wurde er von der damaligen ungarischen Koalitionsregierung in diplomatische Dienste gerufen und wurde Legationsrat an der ungarischen Gesandschaft in Bern. Als die Kommunisten im Jahre 1948 in Ungarn die Macht an sich gerissen haben, demissionierte er und erhielt Asylrecht in der Sweiz. Er lebt auch jetzt in Bern, wo er seine literarische Tätigkeit ausübt. In der letzten Zeiten schrieb er einen Roman und sehr viele Novellen, wie auch Verse. Er arbeitet derzeit an einem Theaterstück, dessen Heldin eine ungarische Emigrantin ist, die in England ihre neue Heimat finden will. Er bereitet auch für den Weinachtsbüchermarkt zwei Bände, die einen umgearbeiteten Roman und seine neueste Novellen enthalten. Al b er t VAJDA was one of Hungary’s best-known humorists, author of stage-plays, sketches, filmscripts and a popular 158 [pageend158]compère of light entertainment. He collaborated regularly with Dénes Kovács, forming the team known collectively as “Vayko”. He came to England in 1956 and since published several books. The first was “How to be a Communist” (written with Kovacs), followed by the “solo performances” : “One Step Forward, Two in Confusion,” “Under Four Eyes with my Eyes” (his tragi-comic experiences while fighting to save his sight) and, more recently: “Gangon aluli házasság” (A pun based on the Hungarian expression for misalliance.) Vajda’s books have been translated into English, German and several other languages; he is also editing a highly successful Hungarian humorous fortnightly called “Fakutya” (Wooden Dog) and is preparing an English humorous review called “Relax”. Sz a bo l c s d e VAJAY, né à Budapest en 1921, issu d’une famille de Transylvanie, fit ses études à l’Université de Genève, puis s'établit, dès 1948, en Amérique latine. Citoyen argentin, il était le Secrétaire général de l’Instituto de Arte Moderno, grande fondation culturelle à Buenos Aires. Déjà pendant les années 1943-46 il avait dirigé un journal de la résistance anti-totalitaire hongroise, puis, en 1952, il fut apellé à la direction de l’hébdomadaire “Hùngaros de Sud- america” (Délamerikai Magyarsâg), fondé en 1929 et doyen de journaux sudaméricains d’expression hongroise. Toujours en qualité de journaliste, il fut accrédité dès 1954 en Europe. Après la chute du régime dictatorial en Argentine il a accédé à la fonction publique internationale, à titre argentin, son poste étant fixé à Paris. — Après avoir publié une série d’essais historiques et artistiques, et une anthologie de littérature contemporaine en langue hongroise, son premier roman “Elevenko” (La pierre qui vit) obtint d’emblée le “Prix Madách”, distinction la plus élevée des lettres hongroises en Occident. Son second roman “Láne” (La Chaîne) a été publié à Bruxelles. Historien par goût, et spécialiste du monde médiéval, il est l’auteur de plusieurs articles et études scientifiques sur la vie et le destin humains aux Xe et Xle siècles. Ses thèmes littéraires brodent, pour la plupart, sur le canevas des connaissances historiques d’un médiéviste. Il est aussi l’interprête en langue hongroise, — et souvent le premier, — d’auteurs comme T. S. Eliot, Pär Lagerquist, 159 [pageend159]Alberto Moravia, St. John-Perse, Juan Ramôn Jimenez, Curzio Malaparte, Jorge Luis Borges, Evelyn Waugh, Manuel Mujica Lainez, William Faulkner, etc. Il réside actuellement à Paris.
