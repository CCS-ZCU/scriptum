It is an occasion to thank all those who helped us accomplish the difficult task of bringing into existence a new specialised periodical in Czech and English versions. The reactions which ACTA has received to date suggest that it is a worthwhile publi- cation for readers both inside Czechoslovakia and elsewhere in the world. So heartfelt thanks must go above all to those who did most to make this possible, namely, the authors at home and abroad, the transla- tors and, of course, the readers, particularly those of you who took out a subscription - which we trust you will renew, using the forms included in this issue. We would also ask you to help widen our circle of readers by recommending ACT A to others. In its second year of publication, ACTA intends to continue the work already initiated. The present di- mensions will be retained but the journal will endeavour to appear on a more regular basis. We hope that our technical difficulties will finally be over- come so that we may concentrate still more fully on our principal task of making the journal a source of vita! information and a forum for discussion of all aspects of the study of Czech and Slovak independent litera ture. A basic condition for such study is the availability of the most exhaustive possible collection of properly indexed unofficial (samizdat) publications. A considerable portion of early material is already available in the Documentation Centre's archives, while the !atest works are being acquired as they appear. The cataloguing of the individua! samizdat series is pressing ahead, as is reflected in the pages of ACT A. The present double-issue includes a complete list of editions published by the pioneer in- dependent publishing series: Edice Petlice ("Padlock Books"). Future issues will continue this work - our long-term aim being a comprehensive catalogue of all samizdat publications, including items from periodi- cals and collections. Whereas the independent literature of the seven- ties and eighties is more or less charted territory by now, the independent writing of the fifties and sixties has yet to be fully explored, in the sense of systematic research. What is needed above all is the acquisition of documents, manuscripts and testimonies, as well as studies on individuals authors or specific issues (e.g. publication bans, the circulation of unpublished manuscripts, the listing and destruction of "undesirable" books, conflicts with the censor, etc.). This also involves the task of collecting and proces- sing the exile writing from 1948 to 1968. In this work, both the Documentation Centre and ACTA rely on external cooperation. We are appealing for any infor- mation connected with all such material, as well as the loan of manuscripts or copies of them, and, if possible, donations of books and journals - including part-collections - anything, in fact, connected with the subject, which you no longer need. You will have the assurance that it will serve a wide range of specia- lists as part of the Documentation Centre archive. Apropos of our collections: the Documentation Centre does not have the means to purchase books published in various languages by Czech and Slovak exile authors. We therefore beg them to bear us in mind and donate us a copy of each of their published works for our archive. After all, it is also in their own interest: international bibliographical handbooks are not always sufficiently reliable and the researchers visiting the Documentation Centre expect to find all such books in our collections. Wc would end on the same note as in our two previous issues with a reminder that the CSDC and ACT A can only hope to tackle their considerable tasks successfully if they receive the help of al! those who appreciate the importance of independent Cze- choslovak culture. [pageend3]CZECH WRITING IN THE CONTEXT OF CONTEMPORARY LITERA TURE The programme of the four-day annual conference of the American Association for the Advancement of Slavie Studies -AAASS, held in Boston in November 1987, included a panel entitled "Czech writing in the context of contemporary literature". At its session on 5th November 1987, papers by Marketa Goetz- Stankiewicz, Jan Vladislav and ] dí Gruša were presented, together with a comment by Paul Wilson. The Jour contributors have kindly made supplemented or revised versions of their papers available for publi- cation in A CT A. Their texts are published in full. FIVE CZECH NOVELS OF THE SEVENTIES A Harmonized Artistic Reckoning with the Past by Marketa Goetz-Stankiewicz Severa! months ago, I fool-hardedly suggested a title for this paper, I was carried away by a rea- der's enthusiasm rather than by common sense. It is not overstating the case to say that the five Czech texts I shall discuss, although comprising some 2,400 pages, are truly universa! in their wealth on many levels. Indeed , outstanding contemporary writers, from Graham Greene to Philip Roth and John Updike, bear witness to this. A few facts: The five writers, Jiří Gruša, Ivan Klíma, Milan Kundera, Josef Škvorecký, Lud- vík Vaculík are now scattered in four cities, dis- tant from each other, each humming in a diffe- rent language. Only Klíma and Vaculík stilJ Jive in Prague, surrounded by the language in which they write, and by the ancient city whose nooks and crannies their texts celebrate in a subdued but intense way. As for the others, Gruša now lives in Bonn, West Germany (though The Que- stionnaire was written when he was still in Prague 2 - indeed, the novel has much to do with the fact that he now lives where he does, surrounded by a language that appears as an alien tongue in the novel itself). Kundera lives in Paris, reading the daily papers in the language of Diderot and Vol- taire and writing for his French translator's ready ear; Škvorecký lives and teaches litera ture in To- ronto, immersed in the motley mixture of "mo- saic" Canadian English and its emigré derivati- ves.1 Another interesting fact: it may be significant that though the five texts were published in diffe- rent countries, all were written at roughly the same time: Ivan Klíma's Judge of Mercy ap- peared in German translation in Hamburg in 1972,2 Gruša's Questionnaire3 in Czech samizdat publication in 1975, Škvorecký's Engineer of Ruman Souls4 in Czech in Toronto in 1977, Kundera's Book of Laughter and Forgetting5 in French in Paris in 1978, and Vaculík's Czech Dreambook6 in Czech samizdat publication in 1980. A third aspect, one that would take detailed study because of its complexity and its significant implications, is that the texts all have strong autobiographical components: the dosely followed pattern of the author's life, including names of friends and others, unveiled and docu- [pageend4]mented, in Vaculík's diary-text; persona! experiences in Kundera's novel; distinct parallels with the author's life in Klíma's and Skvorecký's works; implicit echoes in Gruša's case. Is it that the lives of people in Centra! E urope, which has been called "the soil , pregnant with history ... scene of provocation and irritation to the artist"7 have taken on a fictional aspect? Perhaps, as a consequence, the writer's task has shifted in the sense that his own inventiveness must now apply itself more in- tensely to HOW to relate the enormous pressure of events, and still remain within the boundaries of the truth. But here we should perhaps ask a general question and try to see how these basically unique works are anchored in our general literary culture. What should a contemporary novel be about? How can it cope with the masses of unsolicited and unselected fragments of infor- mation that daily invade our minds? Con- temporary writers have been worrying about this for some time, as we all know. Michel Butor, for example, thinks that "imaginary characters fill the gaps in reality and enlighten us about it" . 8 Doris Lessing muses that some novels are not read in the right way because they "assume a crystallization of information in society which has not yet taken place" .9 Philip Roth , on the other hand, finds that today "actuality is con- tinually outdoing ... [the nove li sťs ] talents," and plays with the idea (taking Norman Mailer as an example) of life becoming "a substitute for fic- tion" . 10 Heinrich Boll worries about the na ture of the modern reader who "has a quality which we do not yet know" . 11 In other words, not only has the story teller run out of plots, but reality has him over a barrel by offering flashier material and, moreover , of- fering it in a more interesting way. But all this is not a new story. Earlier in our cen tury, in 1929 to be exact, a novelist whose world had not yet achieved the maddening complexity it has today, said it in five words: "I am bored with narra- tive. " 12 A nd on she went - Tam speaking of Vir- ginia Woolf- to weave her sensitive tales, letting her own wilful sense of reality shape the fable. H alf a century Jater, after one great and nume- rous smaller wars, some attempted genocides, partial appropriation of the universe, the gra- dual decline of the written word and the drastic rise of the visual, a character in Škvorecký's En- gineer of Human Souls shows a film on her home video which was made by another 'creative' woman not so long after Virginia Woolf had expressed her weariness with tradition. It is the Triumph of the Will by Len i Riefenstahl , a docu- ment of quite another reality, made in 1936. Milan Kundera, born when Woolf made her me- morable statement, describes a scene taking place a dozen years later , in 1948, in which the Old Town Square of Prague is filled with people holding hands and dancing to celebrate what they take to be the beginning of an idyllic time of harmony and happiness for everyone. While the body of a Czech artist who refuses to join the dancers swayed on the gallows below, the crowd , stamping and singing and swaying too, began to rise above the ground "over Wenceslas Square, their ring is the very image of a giant wreath ta- king flight ... " (You may recognize bere a quota- tion from Kundera's Boo k of Laughter and For- getting13). Jiří Gruša, dealing with a similar dance of intoxication with all instincts trained on something better, chase a different image, namely that of a little wasp which , in its search for nourishment, lights on the bleeding wrists of a former henchman who - riding the roller 3 [pageend5]coaster of political changes in Central Europe - has now become a victim led to execution. The wasp , protagonist of the particular incident, loses its meal with the execution and, in search of more nourishment , lights on a cherry cake baked not far away by the narrator's mother to cele- brate the ensuing peace and the victory of good over evil. The year is 1945. When Vaculík des- cribes his hurried walks through the streets of Prague, in the late seventies, inevitable briefcase in band , there are no visible burnings or hangings to be read about. Things have boiled down to the worry whether a certain manuscript will be discovered during an imminent house search; whether a typist who did not get enough sleep and was ruining her health would be able to finish typing a certain collection of stories for samizdat publication. In the Czech Dreambook all has become a matter of documentation. All has become a question of remembering how it was, and giving permanent shape to this memory , to the truth. Before we take a brief look at some samples of the texts, I would like to point out to you a fact that emerges with staggering clarity from each of these five novels: They could be approached with Aristotle, Derrida, Montaigne, Orwell or Cervantes in one's pocket and would yield ample material in the case of each reading, because each of the texts contains - unobtrusively and in varying degrees - a philosophy of art and litera- ture as well as a philosophy of politics and a sy- stem of ethics, in addition to what might be call- ed a philosophy of life. Such a concentrated out- burst of general artistic reckoning in one natio- nal literature is rare and remarkable indeed. The general perspectives of the texts may vary considerably. Kundera pitches his themes of me- mory and laughter against each other in a sort of 4 musical counterpoint, using his characters to il- lustrate these themes ; Gruša sweeps his reader along in a succession of baroque semi-dream images through three centuries and the uphea- vals within and without of World War II; Klíma moves between patterns of private lives in Prague of the 1970's, and confrontations with multi-faced power mechanisms; Škvorecký, setting his novel during the same period in the Canadian scene, lets the patterns of great novels of the past permeate his text, interspersing it with fragments of other lives carried or crushed by political events , so that the two patterns jostle each other throughout the novel; Vaculík tells us every day what he ate, where he went, whom he saw or did not see, what he thought, dreamt and much more than that. Despite the obvious differences in the works there is, however, a basic quality that spills over from one text to another and makes them of one kin. This quality, obvious yet difficult to define, might be thought of as shared ethical questioning on the one band, and, on the other, speculation about human beings' ability to perceive himself in relation to their confusing present but also - and this is important - to their past. It is the theme of recollection (in a post-Prou- stian sense , if I may coin an adage) that looms large in the five novels. In each a different pat- tern emerges from the recollection of facts , drawing symbols and images from this process, filtering them through the sharp lens of the artistic vision , letting, in Nabokov's words, memory "speak"14 or, in Canetti's formulation , salvage the truth out of the past, for "to make it rise again and touch our lives is the poeťs task" 15. To bring the texts slightly doser to you, I have chosen the opening and closing passages of each work for brief comments, although this is [pageend6]like playing the first and last two bars of a sym- phony. Kundera's text begins with a matter-of-fact descriptive passage of a real historical, yet quite absurd incident. The theme of officially suppres- sed memory is condensed in the very first li nes of the novel. But the passage also illustrates the texťs twin theme - laughter. A man wearing an- other man's hat is always funny (remember clowns in a circus?). Six lines after this funny image we are told that a man ( one of the hat wea- rers) has been hanged. The laughter dies in our throats. In the last paragraph of the novel no one wears a hat any longer. We have ended up on a nudist beach. People's physiques have been stripped of overcoats and all the trimmings that go with power and cul ture. The reader is made to gaze at bared paunches and listen to a rambling and trite lecture on freedom. With the last line the oppo- site of a smile sneaks into the text- sadness, dull- ness and listlessness. But these are no longer re- lated to people but to genitals: a ridiculously in- adequate pars pro toto to point out "ecce homo". Klíma's Judge of Mercy opens in the office of Justice Adam Kindl who is reading the lega! file of defendant Karel Kozlík , indicted for murder. Pacing up and down in his office, his hands as restless as his feet, the man of the law has his thoughts wander to his wife's - and probably everyone else's - false image of his real nature, and to his admittedly puritan habits: the no smoking, no drinking, hard work ethic inherited from his father. As the novel proceeds and the reader finds out more about Adam's real character, he also wit- nesses the unfurling of a spiri tual chronicle of the times from the beginning of W orld W ar II to the seventies. Occasionally the text opens up vistas into past centuries, showing how historical events have shaped the character of the nation and political pressures affected Adam's exis- tence and the lives of people around him. The murder case of Karel Kozlík turns out to be the case of his judge, Adam Kindl, as well. The para- graphs of the judicial code seem irrelevant in both cases. The novel ends with Adam's wife Alena waiting in the dar k - in a strange bed in a strange house - for her husband who might or might not return , for a spark of light, for Goďs mercy. Waiting in the dark is indeed the final image of the novel. Prom the lega! document, an upright judge in the chamber of justice, the au- thor has led us to a helpless human being in bed, waiting. The text moves on three levels: the ni- neteen seventies when the main character Adam experiences persona! and political crises (which are somehow connected); Adam's ( and Klíma's own) past, illuminated by particularly significant moments - the return from the concentration camp, the eager grasp for the illusory power of a new political ideology- and , dipped into the fan- tastic visions of subconscious as well as conscious anxiety, moments of Czech history in its colour- fully blood-stained ups and downs. Gruša's text also sets up the theme of retrie- ving the past in the very first paragraph: Jan Kepka reports on his bureaucratic visit to the enterprise GRANIT and the subsequent need to fill in another of many questionnaires. He also imparts to us his decision that he intends to tel1 more than is meant to be known. The fictional receiver of the unsolicited information, "Com- rade" Pavlenda, who implicitly is partly in con- trol of Kepka's fu ture fate, is assailed with a mot- ley tale of the past, solicitously enlightened, ca- joled, asked rhetorical questions. His presence is there throughout the novel - silent, glum, some- 5 [pageend7]how deadly serious as he is told about two broth- ers, an opportunist and a dreamer; about the interchanges of victim and henchman in the course of time; about the fervour of those who feel themselves chosen to administer justice and the unsung devotion of those who bore their children. This torrent of information that brings to the surface all things submerged by persona] or imposed forgetfulness is actually a paradox: after all, the rules of revealing oneself are being followed, an official document is being comple- ted. Only by giving more than was asked for are these rul es broken open and revealed in their re- ductive poverty. By taking literally the powers' assumed right to unveil the most private details of an individual's life, this right is rendered ad absurdum. The fragments of the shattered rules are visible in the last paragraph when the narra- tor recognizes a former abider of rules, reduced to a hollow-eyed robot- a shabby latter-day ver- sion of Kafka's gatekeeper at the gate of the law. The first paragraph of Vaculík's Dreambook also introduces the tension between the diary writer who wants to speak and the powers that be. But while Gruša meets them head on, Vacu- lík mentions them only as an afterthought. Per- haps, he muses about his black mood, his tense state was not due to having slept poorly that night but rather to the particularly unpleasant tone of the most recent interrogation. With this atterthought the whole pattern of the novel is foreshadowed. For, throughout the lengthy text, we hardly read anything about difficulties with the regime. The political events that filter into the diary are the sort that might be mentioned by anyone who listens to the radio at breakfast (for - and this feeling becomes increasingly strong as we move through Vaculík's year - all events on this shrinking globe have become everyone's 6 business - or should say, no one's business?). The last paragraph brings the writer together with his friends and 'colleagues in truth' (Vaculík would probably not li ke this term but it is preferable to the word "dissident", the generally assumed nature of which is implicitly contradicted throughout the book). The colleagues are going to Brno by train. They joke and, contrasted with the dark mood of the first entry, there is knowing laughter in the air. The very last remark gathers up the urge to speak against all odds in one ancient image: the lark will sing when Spring has arrived on the calen- dar, even if it freezes in the process. The poeťs inevitable song finishes this seemingly most dis- passionate and fact-bound account of the truth. Škvorecký's Engineer of Ruman Souls casts both the rainbbw of literature and an eagle's eye on the area that connects as well as divides the old world and the new. The opening paragraph gives us, in Škvorecký's unique prose, the cool clean Ontario landscape, the new college in the "wilderness" already surveyed for a new housing development, the skyline of Toronto and Prague compared, a sharp cursory glance at man's dreams, imposed by a system or private ones and - last but not least - the literary models that imitate as well as shape our lives. Ali these mo- tifs are worked out in a complex theme and va- riation pattern throughout the book. 16 The last passage of the novel is a letter from Lojza, the story-teller's old friend, who cannot spell properly but whose loyalty to his old pal ( despite that fact that the latter is now in trouble with the regime) s urvi ves emigration and all poli- tical changes. Lojza, the innocent pawn of regimes from far right to far left, somehow manages to carry on regardless because, cheer- ful, eager and entirely without strategie motives, [pageend8]he learns a new set of values and with thern a new language every couple of decades. His last letter, dated May 7, 1975, parallels his first one. Each time he is in Carlsbad on a special state-paid holi- day; only he is sent there each time by a different regirne. In 1942 it had been "laid on by ... Reich Protector Rinehard Hydricl1 ... to help the war effort," in 1975 by the workers' recreation ser- vice of the People's Dernocracy. Lojza's letters are high-spirited parodies of serniotic coding, re- presenting two linguistic systems and with these two ideological regimes. Like Václav Havel's Hugo in The Garden Party , Lajza has learned how to use the various lingos and - apart from some minor troubles, such as we all have - lives relatively happily ever after. The Engineer of Human Sou/sis a boo k of vast and as yet largely untapped riches , but its treatrnent of language shaping human beings' awareness of thernselves and their ternporal context is, I think , its crowning achievernent. These different, highly original texts (for each ushers in a new departure in a literary genre) have sornething specific in common, as I said at the outset, though in my remarks I have rather stressed the different ways in which they reflect their authors' genius. The cornrnon ground is the unique subtext - a subtext rooted in reality. On one of his hundreds of errands connected with the publication of independent Czech litera ture, Vaculík rnight pass the house on the Old Town Square, which the narrator of Klírna's Judge of Mercy describes as his childhood home. Vacu- lík's inevitable briefcase, on that particular er- rand, rnight well contain a copy of Škvorecký's Engineer of Ruman Souls or Kundera's Book of Laughter and Forgetting. In that briefcase they might rub shoulders - or pages - with part of Va- culík's own Dreambook in which Gruša's Ques- tionnaire is rnentioned on the very first page, and that again in connection with Škvorecký, who published the Czech edition of the novel in his publishing house in Toronto. The pattern of aspects of the truth that connects these five texts is like a magie net, tugging at readers' conscious- ness and forcing them , whatever their back- ground , to find his bearings again and again as witness to history, as a reader of litera ture, weigher of values, and citizen of a country. Or, to regard it all frorn a different angle, each text probes the complex levels of life in Centra! Europe like a sensitive finger with a different touch . Yet all five throb essentially with the sarne life spirit and belong - to cornplete an irnage which irnposes, itself on the mind with in- sistent urgency- to one single band. NOTES l.

When we discuss the question of human rights, we should also give thought to human duties at the sarne time. When we speak about freedom we should also speak about responsibility. Free- dom and responsibility are two si des of the same coin. The greater the rights we demand on the freedorn side, the greater are our duties on the responsibility side. These frequently forgotten axiorns are applicable to everyone, but doubly so to people of learning, who have occupied a spe- cial role in the community since antiquity. And even if they do not directly strive for power in the community, in a sense they have it regardless. It is power of a particular kind . In generalit oper- ates outside the established power structures, which is probably one of the rnain reasons why the powerful consider this kind of power so dan- gerous even though its resources consist exclusi- 8 11. leh 1endiere nur zu. dem scheinbar Unpolitischen.

In the Czech original a letter from the narrator's friend Lajza precedes the passage with which the translation be- gins. vely of words and ideas. The first representative of such power independent of power structures was undoubtedly Socrates. However, the Athe- nian philosopher was not only an archetype of freedorn but also a paragon of responsibility. His, of course, is the responsibility of the free in- dividua! who is slow to obey another's orders, preferring to heed the voice of conscience. lt is the sort of responsibility which refuses to defer to power, because its touchstone is the truth. In spíte of all the differences resulting from a thousand years of development, that basic situa- tion still applies. Any change there rnay have been consists most likely in the fact that in mo- dem times - i.e. since the last cen tury - the pro- blem has become more generalised and acute for various reasons. On the one band, intellectuals have demanded increasing freedom of thought and creation , and indeed their disciplines - science, philosophy, art and litera ture - have gradually acquired an unprecedented degree of independence; on the other band, society's de- mands on them have also grown , along with the resources which those in power can and do de- [pageend10]ploy, not just to control them but also to exploit them for their own ends. In short, while one side constantly stresses rights and freedom above all, the other chiefly lays claim to duty and responsi- bility. However, intellectuals too have regard for duty and responsibility- and that applies equally to writers, since we are talking about literature. It is an issue to which they repeatedly turn their attention without any need of prompting, and just as often as their mentors , critics and - in some cases - judges, from the other side. Recog- nition of such responsibility is not the question , however. Wha t lies at the heart of the controver- sies that crop up again and again- not to mention the occasional conflicts that flare up and seem to threaten the fu ture of litera ture and its creators- is the old Socratic question: to what is that re- sponsibility owed? Society, including a considerable section of writers themselves, has a tendency to reply to this question with clichés about "service" , parti- cularly service to a "common cause", which can mean all sorts of things. In our country in the last cen tury, but not only there, this cause was con- ceived above all in national terms and frequently in the crudest sense of serving immediate needs which generally fell outside the scope of litera- ture. The poetry of Karel Hynek Mácha was not alone in being ridiculed and expelled from the ranks of "true" literature in the narne of such a programme. Similarly, the works of Božena Němcová were not the only ones whose true di- mensions have rernained largely obscured for the sarne reasons. Over the past hundred years a whole number of similar prograrnrnes have corne and gone in our country, all of which have stressed, more or less overtly and for every possible ideological or political motive, the paramount need for litera- ture to serve. Suffice it to read any text-book of literary history from this angle. However, even though writers themselves often helped to frame and advance thern , this does not alter the fact that these were programmes and aspirations in- troduced into litera ture from outside, and hence without any regard for its intrinsic meaning. At those moments in history when many such programrnes are able to co-exist or compete freely , it represents no great danger. Writers not only have the possibility to choose among them , but they can also reject them all and seek their own way, determining where their responsibility lies according to the dictates of their own cons- cience without this greatly affecting their exis- tence as writers. And even on those occasions when it does lead to conflict with the powers that be, it does not have any serious consequences. The prosecution of Les fleurs du mal not only served to publicise the book, it also encouraged the writer to re-work and improve it ... It is quite a different situation in régimes which proclaim that a particular programme is universally applicable and binding. By accepting it, even sincerely, writers inevitably find them- selves sooner or later in astate of insuperable in- ner conflict or resignation. To reject such a pro- gramme means more or less open confrontation with the régirne and all that that irnplies in terms of radical censorship, eitber in the form of a pu- blishing ban or in the even more extrerne form of sending writers to labour camps or prison. Gra- phic examples of all of this are not hard to find in the history of Czech and Slovak literature over the past forty years . That history is also the history of a whole set of official interpretations of the writer's duties and responsibilities, as conveyed at various confe- 9 [pageend11]rences and congresses by the régime's spokes- men , notably Zhdanov's faithful , though not very gifted pupil, Ladislav Štoll. His interpreta- tion of the writer's duties was little more than a perfunctorily updated version of the tried and tested conceptions of the past: i.e. as before, the writer was responsible to the people, but now the latter was represented by the proletariat, or more precisely its vanguard , the Party, the Party leadership, the Politburo and the General Seere- tary. To put it in a nutshell, in Czechoslovakia at the beginning of the fifties , the chief criterion of all intellectual responsibility was "devotion" to J.V.Stalin. The greatest error of a number of lea- ding Czech poets, therefore, was that their works failed to include "verses in praise of Sta- lin" (L.Štoll , Třicet let bojů za českou socialistic- kou poesii [Thirty years of struggle for Czech so- cialist poetry] Prague 1950, p. 83). This trusty old prescription of writers' duties and responsibilities even survives on the other side of the barricades. One sign of this was the article Critical remarks about the citizens' self- help movement (in the Paris-based emigré jour- nal Sv ědectví vol.17, No.66, p. 263 onward) whose author, writing under the pseudonym Martin Středa , focuses on the significance and mission of our unofficial literature. Though Středa clearly does not share Štoll's political views, his attitudes to literature are just as utili- tarian as those of that erstwhile Party ideologist. The author takes Czech unofficial literature to task for not being "actively revivalist", for lack- ing a "rousing ethos" not to mention a "joint programme, or even a common direction". Středa ascribes it all to the fáct that independent writers give precedence to their "professional prerogatives" , particularly "freedom of expres- sion", and that their "chief need and greatest j oy 10 is putting their own ideas into words" . This last sentence says it all: in Středa ' s view it is clearly the writers' task, nay duty, to put into words someone else's ideas, the ideas of more qualified people - ideologists, perhaps .. . It is clear from this that party bureaucrats are not alone in arrogating the right to determine the duties of our litera ture and the responsibilities of its creators. We therefore have nothing to learn from such people about the trne meaning of the writer's work and responsibility. If we seek more substantial guidance we need to look elsewhere, such as to a philosopher like Jan Patočka who tackled this very problem in his essay The busi- ness of the writer. The essay is one of nine chap- ters about international and Czech issues, inclu- ded in the boo k The meaning of today , which managed to get printed as late as 1969, though it was immediately pul ped. Incidentally, this parti- cular work had to wait till March of this year for actual publication, when it was issued by the exile publishing house Rozmluvy to mark the tenth anniversary of the philosopher's death. The philosopher bases his reflections on the simple, and therefore often neglected fact that the writer's business is first and foremost litera- ture, i .e. the use of writing to convey "literary ex- pression" , whose vehicle is language. This is not, however the language of everyday contact and information such as we encounter in letters, do- cuments or the press. Nor is it the language of concepts and precise definitions commonly used in science and philosophy. Jan Patočka believes in a third way, in "a striving for the meaning of life and an effort to convey it in a natural language". In short, "the writer-artist is not. .. merely someone with imagination and 'ideas' creating literary forms and stories, or incarna- ting ideas and concepts. The writer is a revealer [pageend12]of life and the meaning of life, both in general and particular. " But that is not all. For in Patočka 's view the writer is not just a "revealer of life", he or she is also a keeper, "a custodian ... of the unfragmen- ted, personally attainable meaning of Iife" . This is also why literature cannot be replaced by "any other mental activity, whether science, philoso- phy or religion" . And in the modem world, with its growing "specialisation and individua! frag- mentation", the writer's importance increases in pace with people's growing need "to compensate for this fact and be reminded of life's wholeness and their integral relationship with the uni- verse", precisely because it is litera ture, above all , "which asserts such integrality". The responsibility which devolves from such a concept of literature is quite different from that which is foisted on writers from the outside by ideologists and politicians driven by their own in- terests and objectives. It is a responsibility which derives from literature's intrinsic purpose of seeking to reveal life and recall or assert its integrality. Of course, such a purpose can also embrace everything that goes to makeup life, in- cluding such things as political or other commit- ment, though on the condition, naturally, that within the literary work they remain subordinate to literature's fundamental purpose as described above. In short, writers' responsibility is no more than the responsibility of the free indivi- dua) who is slow to obey another's orders, pre- ferring to heed the voice of conscience. lt is the sort of responsibility which refuses to defer to power, because its touchstone is the truth . Czech parallel literature is able to provide se- veral notable examples of what I mean. They un- doubtedly include the work of Václav Havel, in which the theme of responsibility features cen- trally in various guises. It would be no exaggera- tion to say that it is the main character of many of his plays and the majority of his essays. There is one of his essays that specifically treats the theme of responsibility. It deals with The Czech Dreambook and its author Ludvík Vaculík, and Havel uses the topic to demonstrate not only Va- culík's but also his own understanding of the wri- ter's role in the modem world. In a similarway to Vaculík, Havel regards the starting point for all creative activity to be a persona! and particular life-experience which serves not solely, in Pa- točka ' s words, "to reveal the meaning of Iife, both in general and particular", but also to assert the "wholeness of life" and an "integral rela- tionship with the universe", to which the phjlo- sopher refers in The business of the writer. 2. "In all my writings," Václav Havel explicitly re- called not Jong ago, "my starting point has al- ways been what I know, my own experience of this world I Jive in , my experience of myself. In short, I have always written about what matters to me in this life: what I see, what interests me, what arouses my concern - I shouldn't think I could find any other place to start from. How- ever, it has always been my hope in my writing, that by bearing witness to certain specific expe- riences of the world I will be able to disclose something universa/ly human, specific expe- rience only being a way and a means of saying something about being in general , about people in today's world, about the crisis of modern-day humanity - in other words, those matters that concern us all. " When Václav Havel wrote these lines, he par- ticularly had in mind his writings for the theatre and was addressing himself above all to future 11 [pageend13]producers of his new play Largo Desolato. But he is not solely a playwright, and despite his dis- claimers and his efforts on different occasions to stress that he is no philosopher and that it is not his ambition to "construct some conceptually ri- gid system", there can be no doubt that Václav Havel has become an exponent of unofficial Czech thought: thought based on the specific, persona] experience of someone who has opted for that most demanding of freedoms - the free- dom to live in one's own country and think as one likes. Thus his remarks about the fundamental starting point of his writing not only sum up the underlying characteristic of his theatrical works but also what is a highly persona! feature of the other half of his oeuvre: his essays, the number and importance of which is growing all the time. In the case of an author writing for the theatre like Václav Havel, and living in a country like Czechoslovakia, such a development is only to be expected. In a world where theatre - the so- cial art par excellence- has been unable for years - decades even - to fulfil its prime function of universa! and constantly renewed catharsis, the very raison ď etre of the playwrighťs work is also severely jeopardised. Havel became aware of this danger very early on in his career through his own very bitter personal experience. He had long realised at first hand not only that "theatre, of all the artistic genres, is the most closely tied to a particular time and place", but also that playwrights without a theatre are "something like a bird without a nest; they are cut off from their true home, from the lifeblood of a given so- cial 'here and now' which is the source and desti- nation of their writing, the place where their work first comes to life and becomes itself, from which it draws its life, and without which it could well lose all sense and meaning". 12 There are countries at the present time, inclu- ding Havel's own homeland , where playwrights are being obliged to find other outlets, other ways of speaking out, so as to avoid being con- fined entirely to their own particular, though precarious, instrument-the writing of plays. It is a way of defending the imperilled meaning of their writing and their very raison ď etre, as well as facing up to the difficulties of being silenced artists - a situation all the more arduous for dramatists in view of the na ture of their art. This is undoubtedly one of the reasons why, for years now, Václav Havel has repeatedly turned to the free , open and flexible form of the essay as a means of speaking directly to his public, above all in the circles of Czech and Slovak unofficial culture, but also outside them, and internatio- nally. Heis thereby able to side-step the complex and precarious mechanism which theatre - in common with all the officially admjnistered, con trolled and censored mass media - represen ts under many regimes. Certainly, this does not mean that Havel is turning his back on the theatre. His recent plays: the tragi-comic Largo Desolato and the Faustian Pokoušení (Temptation) prove that the opposite is true, and that, for him , drama continues to be not simply the focus of interest in his life, but his preferred medium for testifying to those matters "which , in one way or another, concern us all". Nor is it true to say that Havel's use of the essay is a recent phenomenon. He exploited the form most successfully as early as the sixties, at the time he was writing his first plays. What is cer- tain , however, is that the number and signifi- cance of his essays rose sharply in the seventies and eighties, as normalisation rolled on. This was also a time when he was gaining increasing experience of the new regime and its unavowed [pageend14]- though increasingly thorough and menacing - endeavours to erase the individual and national identity of the Czechs and Slovaks. It was in that context that a number of Havel's essays acquired a new dimension - often assu- ming manifesto form. His Open Letter to Presi- dent Husák of 1975 ( concerning the country's po- litical entropy) represented an undoubted mile- stone in the history of the Czech spiritual resi- stance of the seventies and prefigured its culmi- nation in the Charter 77 Declaration. And it was only natural that Václav Havel should have been one of the initiators of that Declaration and one of Charter 77's first spokesmen. This too was a natural consequence of his standpoint as some- one who endeavours, through his thinking and writing - in plays and essays alike - to reflect consistently on his own specific and personal ex- perience of the world and of himself. Experience in this sense is neither passive nor automatic; nor is it solely to do with conscious- ness. It is also, and possibly above all, something we call down on ourselves, something which , to a great extent, we prepare for ourselves by ac- cepting or rejecting the world we live in. It is something that binds our conscience. Václav Havel treats trus theme in detail in his important essay The Power of the Powerless , of 1978. At the heart of this wide-ranging pa per he places the question of living in the truth and the higher re- sponsibility of all individuals wherever they are, but above all in those parts of the world where the human identity is most at risk, not only from those in power, but from individual human be- ings themselves. Even in these terms, this is not just another case of abstract ~peculation on a well-worn theme. Above all, it 1~ an urgent testi- mony to a specific experience u l I he world - the sort that almost everyone in CzL·, hoslovakia in the seventies lived through - and continues to live through today. All the author of The Power of the Powerless did was to describe and summa- rise it, in order to show where it was leading and , in certain cases, what commitment it was impos- ing on people - not just those who lived through it, but every one else too. Again the form chosen is the "essay", in the sense of an endeavour, with the help of personal witness, to disclose "some- thing universally human" and say something "about being in general, about people in today's world , and about the crisis of modern-day huma- nity" . Specific experience of the world and specific witness to it are bought at a price, though. This is confirmed also by a glance at Václav Havel's cur- riculum vitae: ostracised as a child for his "class origins" and thus deprived of a proper chance to study; years of harassment which turned into di- rect persecution in the course of normalisation; tried twice on charges brought by the régime and sentenced to a four-and-a-half-year prison term of which he served three years and eight months before being paroled, seriously ill, in February 1983: In countries like present-day Czechoslova- kia , such stories tend to be commonplace rather than the exception and are mainly important for the victim. In Václav Havel's case, however, they have not only deeply marked his life, but also, and above all, his work. This is because they have served, again and again, to renew the author's specific experience of the world and of himself. It is this experience that has ensured that the starting point - and goal - of all his writ- ing (and here I have his essays particularly in mind) is never merely speculative or abstract. On the contrary, even though they are not purely autobiographical, his essays are always very tightly bound up with his persona! experience 13 [pageend15]and they make no bones about it: suffice it to read his Politics and Conscience or Thriller. Though anything but rhetorical , Havel's essays respond in an exceptionally eloquent and urgent - though always specific - fashion to the no less specific, urgent and eloquent challenges of the times we live in. In the part of the world where Václav Havel lives, all such challenges and the responses to them inevitably acquire political overtones. It would be wrong, however, to reduce his essays to this incidental element. Although they under- standably have their origins in the specific cir- cumstances of a particular time and place, and although they naturally react to specific situa- tions whose existence is contingent on a particu- lar regime, Havel's reflections have a much wider significance and their intention is much more profound. In this sense, one could apply to them something that Havel recently wrote about his plays: "Were my plays regarded solely as a description of a particular social or political system, I would feel I had failed as an author; were, on the other band, they regarded simply as a portrayal of humankind or of the world, I would feel I had succeeded. " Basically, the same goes for his essays. Not even in them does the author offer us "solely a description of a particular social or political sys- stem". The essays also consist above all of his continuing reflections "on the burden of being; on people's arduous struggle to protect their own identity from impersonal power which seeks to take it away from them; on the strange contra- diction between people's actual capacities and the role they are obliged to play by reason of their environment, their destiny and their own work; on how easy it is in theory to know how to live one's life, but how difficult it is to do so in 14 practice; on the tragic incapacity of people to understand each other, even when they wish each other the best; on human loneliness, fear and cowardice, etc. etc. - and finally , of course, (and most importantly) on the tragi-comic and absurd dimensions of all these themes". Were we not aware that these comments were written in 1984 for producers of his play Largo Desolato , we might easily take them as a commentary on certain of his essays such as Politics and Con- science written at the beginning of that year. There is a sense in which Havel's plays and es- says constitute two aspects of one and the same "entity". Whereas in the plays these main themes are viewed and treated "from within" as it were and constitute what the author himself has called "a sort of musical reflection on the burden of being", in the essays these themes are viewed and analysed in a more external manner. They resemble a clinical report, which consti- tutes at the same time, an urgent call for moral renewal, for "living in the truth", which he writes about in Power of the Powerless , or for "people to retrieve their humanity and resume their responsibility for the world" and to assert "poli- tics as morality in practice" , with which he deals in Politics and Conscience. It is possible that the appeals that emerge from Havel's reflections may appear to some to be naive, unrealistic and illusory, especially when faced with the state of today's world so poign- antly depicted in his essay Thriller. In all events, the nature of these appeals is such that they could scarcely have visible results in the fore- seeable future , let alone political success. The author of Politics and Conscience is fully aware of this fact, and says as much himself. At the same time he recalls another praven reality that is of outstanding importance, namely, that even [pageend16]in the world as it is now "those apparently po- werless individuals who have the courage to speak the truth out loud and stand body and soul by what they say, and are prepared to pay dearly for doing so , have - astonishingly enough - greater power - however formally disfranchised they are - than thousands of anonymous electors in other circumstances". Towards the end of that essay , Havel cites two such examples: Alexander Solzhenitsyn and Jan Patočka. Other names could easily be added to the list, including Ha- vel's own. Of course, Václav Havel neither is, nor seeks to be a philosopher, constructing "some concep- tually rigid system". He is an author whose thinking and actions are marked by what I would sooner call "iron logic" were it not of such a lively, organic and spiritual kind. But however we describe it, it is clearly something extremely demanding, if not actually implacable. It is something that goads him , again and again, on the basis of his own specific experience of the world and of himself, to engage in specific, per- sona! reflection about it all and to voice his own specific, personal assent or protest - to act accor- ding to his own specific and personal conscience. Broadly speaking, this is how these main themes are linked together in Havel's thinking: at the end of the chain we find the theme of specific, THEIRFATE- A TRA VELLING GHETTO by Jiří Gruša People born on Czech soil at the end of the thir- ties could well sum up their feelings about their li ves as a "travelling ghetto". Losing their past three times over might be another description. person al responsibility, which people bear, but also choose (to their own cost) as their fate. Responsibility as destiny is possibly one of the most typical, individua) and - apparently - per- sona! themes of Havel's thinking. It was expli- citly advanced in the essay in which Havel intro- duces the Western reader to the last novel by Ludvík Vaculík, another writer who has chosen that most demanding of freedoms. It is this very freedom to Jive and think as one likes in one's own country which is the main - albeit unnamed - protagonist of Vaculík's novel The Czech Dreambook. This provides the basis for the por- trait that Havel paints of his friend. However, every portrait, we know, is also a self-portrait, and this is just as trne about Havel's sketch of Vaculík. Though it was certainly not his inten- tion, there can be no doubt that he laid particular stress on those traits that also characterise his own life story: "From this viewpoint , the Czech Dreambook appears as a novel about responsibility, will and fate; about responsibility that is - if one may so put it- stronger than the will; about the tragedy of fate stemming from responsibility; about the futility of all human endeavours to break out of the role that responsibility has imposed; about responsibility as destin y." October 1987 I have in mind, of course, Czech writers - peo- ple who answered various challenges of their vocation in particular ways. I'm not saying that similar situations do not arise elsewhere. I me- rely want to stress that my concern here is very much a persona! one. A lost pastis something we are all acquainted with. There is the classic temps perdu variety, 15 [pageend17]which might be described as the past which did not turn out according to our plans. We could de- note it as a kind of eternal Otherwise - the irre- trievably advancing alienation of our lives. We start off an unadorned pian , we end up an una- dorned fact, or rather, an unadornedfactum, i.e. total reality- though by then its very totality ma- kes it unreal. This is a well-known banality, butone which , since time immemorial, has bothered the heads of ... you've got it: writers. And so as to empha- sise the immemoriality of their role, leťs call them balladeers, singers of sagas, experts at re- counting What Was and bringing it back to life. And why not call them Bards, seeing as the Czechs are very much Celts, deep down? So long as those bards occupied their heads with time past, so long as they created a com- monly shared fiction about the continuation of erstwhile events, there was no fear of their being committed to a ghetto for the rest of their days. They were wanted. With their assistance, other- wise forgotten actions resurfaced from their de- stined oblivion. The bard stood at the rim of Plu- to's pit fishing out past deeds , and then transfor- ming them, through the slow-motion of words, into something memorable. Their extinction was delayed . Past deeds could be censured or praised , the best could be ernulated even. That was an aspect which appealed to the kings of the earth who ruled over present events. They elevated the bards-rnostly sons of the poo- rest classes - and permitted them to sit alongside their thrones. 16 The bards will always find someone desirous to hear his virtues extolled before the com- pany and thereby preserve his valour for all time until everything passes away - light and life together. This man will always be hon- oured and his glory will prevail here below the heavens. This is a loose quotation from an Old English saga which once fascinated me because of the self-assured language of the wizards of words. The bards knew their bounds, though. They never doubted that the present belonged in prin- cipie to the king, who could equally be a priest. They saw no reason why the fu ture should not re- main the realm of the prophet. The main job of our predecessors was the calming of the elements, the taming of wild beasts and the temporary charming of people and spirits. Such tricks could come in very bandy. Take the case of the ancient-Greek bard Arion. When he fell among pirates and was given a last request before his execution (already privileged, you see!) he asked permission to "sing a short song to my lyre" . The pirates were so enchanted by his performance that they were unable to prevent his escape and he sailed away from his captors on the back of a dolphin - the first of a long list of zoological means of transport used by Arion's successors. Even in those idyllic times, bards got themsel- ves slain or exiled en masse (like Ovid , the au- thor of the Arion story). None the less, enforced isolation for them as a species - what might be called a "general quarantine" - was not yet the custom. There was admittedly a sort of separa- tion , as a result of their "know-how", but it was more the separateness of the closed-shop. They were a guild of people who knew how to makeup stories. Theirs was the science of fiction , so to speak. Though they seemingly brought the past alive, they themselves knew full well that past [pageend18]events must have been quite different from the way they were conjured up. They realised , in other words, that every story suffers from the very fact that the teller is not truly lord of time. What they did believe, though, was that the trne Lord of Time - the Dei ty, the gods - had given them this gift of fiction to some divine purpose (hence that age-old pride). Such modesty, which was more or less a mat- ter of policy, lasted - in my part of the world at least - up to the moment when the Arionesque dolphin was superseded by the romantic swan. That was when Richard Wagner seized on the old theme as a basis for his own version of the story about the Barďs power and mission. He al- lows Lohengrin (the Bard in knighťs garb) to "come down to earth", for his bard is not just a knight, but also a demi-god. Having "set his he- art on" a woman he sets off in search for one and naturally has no problem making straight for a lady of royal blood. Discreetly, though unmis- takably, he thus lays claim to an earthly throne. It is only a problem as far as the queen is concer- ned. Goaded on by her mortal subjects' envy for the knighťs divine perfection, the queen is fi- nally driven to violate the precondition of their union . You see, our Orpheus-for this, make no mistake, is the Orphean legend once again - must not be asked certain questions, such as, who he really is, for instance: "Nie sollst du mich befragen! ... " And when his wife does attempt it after all, he is indeed revealed to her, but must immediately turn away for ever. Gradually he is drawn back to the heights whence he came, while she dies grief-stricken. If we compare this version with the original le- gend we can appreciate the transformation that has occurred. Orpheus, remember, is the natural son of the river god and the muse of narrative po- etry, and as such has no claim to divine immorta- lity! The only asset he has to thank his origins for is his song. Only his song is divine, only thanks to his music is he able to penetrate the realm of the shades. Only with its help can he steal his loved one back from the Underworld , on condition - of course - that he does not violate the ritual ta- boo. It was not a matter of not disclosing the di- vine but of even attempting to. I am almost cer- tain that what happened was not due to a lapse on Orpheus' part. I cannot believe that he was j ust taking a peek to see if his loved one was trul y following him. A far more likely explanation is that he wanted (even in those early days!) to have a look into the Gods' kitchen so as to disco- ver how they breathed life into the dead and find out at what point it happened. The punishment for this was cruel but it was inflicted on the real culprit, at least. What chiefly interests us, though, are Lohen- grin's two truly revolutionary postulates: the as- sertion of the right to both a heavenly and an ear- thly throne. The latter-day Bard wants to rule both time and events. But if these rights are to be attained , experts on Time Past have to become experts on Time Fu ture. Having been masters of the science of fiction they must become masters of science-fiction. They must abandon tales of the past for tales of the future . But even that is not sufficient: Will-Be has to give way to Ought- To-Be. Jules Verne rarely fascinates anyone beyond their teens. For fifteen-year-old captains to become Argonauts of Glowing Tomorrows, science-fiction must become fiction science. In other words, the enraptured dreamer with his fu- turistic visions must become an expert on the fu- ture, confidently establishing the means of achieving it. Just imagine, for one moment, Das 17 [pageend19]Kapital written in the style of Marx's poems! It would have inevitably shared their fate . The bards' specialised know-how was starting to go its own way. Their mere ca paci ty to dis- close reality was transformed into the belief that they knew the pian. The guild of tellers of mean- ingful tales about the past turned into an associa- tion of fiction specialists, experts at making gob- bledegook of reality. Their genre consisted in turning the future into an ersatz present. When, at the beginning of this cen tury, my fel- low-countryman Rilke contemplated the death of old kings and their successor-less thrones with a certain nostalgia, it was surprise rather than militancy that caused him to exclaim: "there was nothing until I saw it" (es gab nichts, bevor ich es sah) . Meanwhile however, a certain talented Russian fi-sci-er was already dreaming up a the- sis about how "objective truth" can be objec- tively reflected and transformed into "concrete truth" i.e. into the story ofhow Will becomes Is. Orpheus set off for Olympus instead ofHades. Oddly enough , the world in the meantime had started to be peopled by the shádes of the Under- world . The erstwhile threefold unity of time in an artistic work derived from an acknowledge- ment of three spheres, linked but separate - the past and the underworld which belonged to the bard; the present and the Earth which were re- served for the king; and the future and heaven which were the business of the prophet. It is only since the three-in-one Orpheus, now grown up into prince, prophet and author of myths, com- menced his reign that the world has languished in a timeless vortex. The future is proclaimed to be the present. So the present becomes something lost without re- call, something that we first want to forget and 18 then are obliged to. And the past, to put it bluntly, has been abolished. But wherever the pian and reality are apriori identical, where the possible is declared to be ac- tual - i.e. in some sort of actus purus - the pro- spects of the individua] are illusory. They are no more than a blue-print for lost time. A labyrinth of lost opportunities- lost in advance, an all-em- bracing Disneyland or, more accurately, a make- believe megalopolis. That is what I mean by losing the past twice over. It is the moment when they open the ghetto for bards who are incapable of making the transfor- mation into reigning prophets. It is obvious why: if you sing the old song the new world rocks on its foundations , since it is grounded on the lie- speech of scientistic fiction. Whoever clings to the forbidden or forgotten skill of preserving the past restores the present its rights and allows the future to remain in obscurity - in primeval, my- sterious, life-giving darkness. In the poor-house of glowing tomorrows this is a crime indeed. And of course it is something archetypally Jewish , be- cause any "precise picture of the future" is fun- damentally limited: like a "graven image made unto oneself"; like an idol to which human flesh is sacrificed. Permit me a persona! recollection which is particularly apposite in this connection: An interrogator asks an imprisoned author (after exhausting all the possible and impossible ramifications of the latter's criminal activity - which consists, one might say, of not speaking "their Ianguage") : "Are you a Jew?" The accused is rather taken aback. He knows that the interrogator has already rummaged through all possible information about him so he [pageend20]rnust have corne up with a negative answer to this original variant of the question about the barďs origin. Moreover the aut hor notes a certain reti- cence in the way the question is asked . He therefore parries the question with his own: "What makes you think so?" " Iťs just that you write with a chip on your shoulder, as if everything concerned you. " Everything, the author reflects? Surely not. The fact is that he has only one concern: one single story. Something that no longer seems to exist sornehow. Then he replies sadly: "No, officer, I'm a Slav ... a Slav like your- self." But he notes that he has been already consigned de facto to the ghetto. At the same time a quotation in the leading Slav language springs to the author's mind , words of Tsvetayeva, quite likely engendered by the same experience: "Their own poets J ews." Fine. Even a ghetto is somewhere to live when all is said and done. And it does not necessarily have to be one's final address. But the most im- portant thing in this context is that it is not where you lose your past for the third time. Many of its inhabitants even dream of \ands where the past, the present and the future continue to flow alongside each other and rarely intermingle. It is a dream resembling the myth of a golden age preserved through divine intervention. Same manage to get there, some are even dumped there. Now, at last, comes the unexpected encounter with a phenomenon which we describe tentati- vely as losing one's past for the third time. I refer to the moment when there - outside - you are approached by loca\ wordsmiths who discern in you a colleague- which is more or less true. But since, by and large, they already Jive in a premonition of their potential importance, they will want you to confirm that the project for storming heaven is something far more exalted than the age-old battle with hell. Whaťs more, they want to be told that their discomfort in the natural world is not due to their archetypal cal- ling but - as they put it - the fault of a system aimed directly against them. And woe betide if you stick to your guns! But even this will only be the first time you find yourself at a loss - there is worse to come. In the next round you will encounter the real orga- nisers of the local fiction and it is they who will declare your experience in the ghetto to be your own private trauma, a sort of rnishap which can be situated easily in statistical terms, one which, "objectively" speaking, in no way affects the di- rection they have been taking. In other words , a\though you may have \ost your past twice over it still makes sense to "bring heaven down to earth", because they are the first ones to possess a compass and the requisite weapons. And how- ever patient you may be, the time will come when you'll send them to blazes in no uncertain terms. They will wince, recoil a few paces and from their new standpoint descry at last ... your yellow star. And you yourself will notice it for the first time. You thought you had left it behind in the ghetto. But now you realise you are still wearing it. Your ghetto has somehow been transformed into a sort of circus-wagon in which you trundle round the world. As time passes, you notice that camping with you in the fields outside the town or village are fellow ghetto-members. It even occurs to you to band together with them and set up a jolly circus troupe. It would not be much in demand, admit- 19 [pageend21]tedly, but it could afford some sort of mutual companionship, at least. You won't have much luck , though, because exile means one thing to those who have failed in their attempt to create fiction back home, and something else to those who have been sent aut into the world by the more energetic comrades of the former. And it is something else again to those who in the end have recognised the error of their ways. You are naturally inclined to throw in your lot with men and women whose experience resembles your own, because with them you will share rather more than just the same camp-site or circus-act. You even catch yourself wondering whether they or you do not perhaps represent some kind of new "salt of the earth" , part of some sort of paradoxical divine plan to put a spoke in the wheel of the earth's annihilators: the birth of a new po lis in which the factum will become again what it always was ... But by now you have got into the habit of feeling automatically for your invisible star, and you won't find much difficulty in detecting, even in this idea, the old prophetic syndrome and hence another fiction - a tale told by a minstrel whose wandering days may soon be at an end. However, were you asking about something other than losing one's past three times over, I am stuck for an answer. All I can think of is the name of a particular extinct species of bird - the DIDUS INEPTUS: that ungainly feathered friend which they used to catch with bare hands, i.e. something doomed to extinction. Could it be that those who believe in a process of natural selection which ensures that the bear- ers of the true future do not find themselves in such a hopeless situation are right after all? I can already hear them saying: serves you right, for trying to save the past, because all you are doing 20 is to impede its due extinction. You are not just enemies of tomorrow, your are also your own worst enemies. You have the impertinence to make life even more painful than it naturally is. Anyway the past always returns in the form of re- collection and every recollection is poisoned. Even the most beautiful memory proclaims that "this is no more". He who snatches happiness is the man of the moment (Nietzsche). Or he in whom the "hope principle" works intensely (Bloch). The principie of hope, no less! Living scope for a "concrete utopia", the fu ture now within us! It is only when I hear such talk that I am driven to draw a positive conclusion of sorts after all , though my motive is more malice than any clear idea, of course. My response to the first com- ment is quite simply: Steady on! What if that flightless bird, that evolutionary dead-end is actually the superman that you acknowledged yesterday- stunted, maybe , but still here, for all that. For the fact is that everyone I ever saw try- ing to act according to any of those superman-ish rriaxims always ended up in the ghetto. And to the second of those maxims I am quite immune. Whoever believes they will throw light on the morrow with the help of such dynamite is the worlďs most cheerful demolition expert. In fact he is a master of his craft who enhances his en- joyment of the present by the thought that he has a real opportunity to muck things up for his own children as well. A constant apologist of the "not yet being" syndrome (des Noch-Nicht-Seien- den) he is astounded to think that one might ac- tually mutilate the factum in advance. Anyway, what I have been describing here as "the past" - that which the bard preserves-is not "history" or Geschichte, but instead a net with things stuck in it. The Orpheus of tradition [pageend22]catches things at random. These things tel1 as much about the past as a fish tells about the ocean. But their very randomness reflects life it- self and it unfolds in both directions, both for- ward and back, back to yesterday and forward to tomorrow. A lso sprach ln.eptus: Not a hope principie but a principie of randomness. Nay a passion for the random. It is something a kin to a latter-day amor CZECH WRITING IN THE CONTEXT OF CONTEMPORARY LITERA TURE by Paul Wilson The first thing that struck me on re-reading the papers by Ji ří Gruša and Jan Vladislav was that they both invoke the same notion but each in a very different sense. This difference is clearer in translation, in fact, than in the original: the word in each case is osud in Czech, and in Gruša's es- say, the translator rendered it as "fate", whereas in Vladislav's essay, the same translator called it "destiny". Now in English there's a world of dif- ference in the tone of these two words . "Fate" is heavy with a sense of doom (the Anglo-Saxon word for it), whereas "destiny" is light and opti- mistic, and suggests the fulfilment of promíse. "Fate" implies retrospection; "destiny" looks forward to the future. Fate implies passivity; your destiny is something you go out to meet. I think the translator has made his choice - that is, his distinction between the way the word is used in the two papers- deliberately and well. ln the way Gruša presents his case - if I under- stand him correctly - I detect the perception, common in Centra) Europe, that a writer who comes West will always be misunderstood, that he cannot avoid being dismissed as a spoil-sport fati - love of one's fate - (if a flightless bird can feel such a thing) which is proclaimed: that erstwhile Nietzschean acceptance of the fatum , whatever it might bring. The joyful and even combative cry of: "I want my own story, I have the courage to accept it. " It also implies that time is open-ended, while the future remains dark and impenetrably mysterious. If that all sounds rather odd, what can one ex- pect from such an odd creature? ( or to use that wonderful Czech word, a kazisvět) and possibly even an unsavoury reactionary, by people whose utopias he steps on whenever he speaks or writes from his own experience. Now what Gruša says is all perfectly trne , and I can vouch for it from my own experience, even though I am neither Czech nor a writer in exile. A strange polarization seems to have taken place in people's thinking, and encountering this pola- rization is always, in itself, a shocking and so- mewhat traumatizing experience, especially for people who thought they were leaving it behind when they left Centra! E urope. · Not long ago I heard an interview on the radio with a woman who acts as a one-person advice centre for refugees coming to Canada. Chileans, Tamils, Sikhs, lranians and EI Salvadorians - to all , she ministers around the clock, for no perso- na) gain , dispensing advice, sorting out disputes, intervening with officials on their behalf, giving them marital advice , explaining to them the strange ways of the natives . And then, very sweetly, this kind and very probably well-to-do woman suddenly remarked that she hadn't got "involved" with the Boat People because she felt they should have stayed at home and helped build their own country. The interviewer did not challenge this astonishing and potentially lethal 21 [pageend23]log_ic, p~rhaps because, as Gruša suggests, the att1tude 1s becoming commonplace. ~ ruša's experience, the experience of many exiles , as I learned last winter in E urope, sug- ~ests to me that a mind in the grip of a utopian idea may well secrete something li ke intellectual anti-bodies whose job it is to rush to the scene of any argument and ward off infectious doubts. The notion that victims of communism are trau- matized is one such anti-body. What Gruša sees as fate, or osud, may also be seen as a problem to be addressed. By ascribing ~he human condition to fate, we seem to be say- mg that there is nothing we can do about it. (We know that Gruša is doing something about it, at least; he is now writing in German, and I had rather hoped to hear a report from him on how that was going. Or is his paper j ust that?) If we look more d osely at the selective philanthropy of the woman dispensing advice, and the bitter- ness of the misunderstood and ghettoized writer- in-exile, we may see them as states of being that can be transcended and are therefore not fatal - osudový - at all. I am more and more convinced that - to borrow an insight from Václav Havel's "The Pow~r of the Powerless" - the line dividing the world_ mto East and West is no longer just g_eograph1cal: it runs through people - and a single p~rson, like our philanthropic woman, may be m both worlds at once divided in a sense, against herself. On the ~ne hancl her c~arity in action is an example of precisel~ the kmd of voluntary small-scale work that writers in Czechoslovakia are calling out for in essays and declarations; on the other hand, her ideological selectivity is an example of the kind of involun- tary mentality those same writers attack. Over- coming such schizophrenic divisions here, as 22 there - if that is what the writer chooses to try and do - means seeing both these sides of her at once, and involves one of the writer's most ancient skills: his or her ability to imagine people and their stories whole, in a way that encom- passes and heals these rifts. If we acknowledge the spiritual condition of our charity woman as a genuine problem, we can see, I think , how Gruša's "fate" can become Vla- dislav's "destiny". For writers in the West - whether exile or native - to escape the ghetto in which a narrow view of their vocation will inevit- ably confi ne them, they might try puttino their fate behind them and grasping their destiny in- stead. In H avel's terms, as Vladislav makes clear, this means putting aside all prescriptive and proscriptive notions of literature , listening to the voice of responsibility and following it wherever it leads. A writer's experience of the world does not stop once he or she crosses the border, even a border as absolute as the Iron Curtain . However different this world may be from that one over there, the na ture of his or her responsibility to it does not change either. Havel sitting in prison and ruminating on responsibility can speak just as directly and clearly to Saul Bellow as Saul Bel- low, sitting in his Chicago studio, once spoke to Havel. Vladislav's insight - that responsibility is the hero, the main character of Havel's writing - is a good one. Western literature , we are told , is badly in need of heroes, and this hero of Havel's is as good a place to start as any. Toronto, Novem ber 1987 [pageend24]PATOČKA'S COLLECTED WORKS-DISCUSSION FORUM Erazim Kohák MAKING PATOČKA A V AILABLE TO THE WIDEST READERSHIP I hesitate to comment on a project to which I can contribute little - it seems clear that it will be the people on the spot, the editor of the CSDC and scholars in Prague and Vienna , who will do the bulk of the actual work of preparing a collected edition of the writings of Jan Patočka. Thus I am presenting my comments not to the editors as a topíc for discussion but solely as the gleanings of many years of experience in exile. It seems to me unquestionably important to publish Patočka ' s works not only in translation but in the Czech original as well - and primarily for readers in Czechoslovakia. If Czech thought is not to sink to the level of superficial journa- lism, it is crucially important to make sure that precisely the work of demanding authors like Masaryk, Rádl or Patočka should reach the read- ers, that they read it and reflect on it, speak of it and write about it. However, as Dr. Němec points out, Patočka ' s work for the most part ap- peared either in journals or as samizdat or was never published at all, so that in Czechoslovakia itself it is practically unavailable. Not, to be sure, for the handful of scholars who concern them- selves with it professionally: they manage to find access to the required texts, in Czechoslovakia in the samizdat "Prague Transcriptions", and in the West at the archives in Vienna. The need is to make Patočka' s work available for the broader circles of cultured, thoughtful yet non-professio- nal readers so that Patočka's thought could begin penetrating the consciousness of thinking Czechs. That appears to me as the foremost task of the proposed Collected W orks in Czech- and , I believe, the edition ought to be prepared with that task in mind. In addition, it might be well to bear in mind that it is indeed an exile edition, published with limited means and distributed under difficult conditions. Scholarly works published in exile inevitably do not pay their way and depend on the efforts and the goodwill of a handful of devo- ted individuals. The hundred copies or less that we might succeed in selling - assuming maxima! library orders- cannot begin to cover production costs, not even if all who work on them do so wi- thout compensation, for the good cause. Even less can they be expected to cover the production costs for the three to five hundred copies desti- ned gratis for readers in Czechoslovakia. Porty years in exile cured me of any faith in the mythi- cal "wealthy countrymen" or secret funds that will miraculously step in. We can depend only on the little that we can raise ourselves, and that we must use to maximum effect. Consequently the foremost condition for suc- cess is to avoid all megalomaniac plans con- ceived on the model of various thirty-volume sets of Collected Works of V.I. Lenin, now gathering dust on shelves, and to focus instead on presenting the reader with tightly organised, maximally accessible and relevant volumes. Nor is that simply a matter of our possibilities but also of those of the reader. Exile publishers print for readers, not for libraries. Libraries in Czechoslo- 23 [pageend25]vakia are unlikely to becorne interested in the Collected Works of Jan Patočka in the foreseea- ble future, while abroad I know of perhaps fif- teen libraries altogether that would order such a set in a very minor language. For the reader abroad, assurning an average price of US$ 20 a volume, such a set would represent a major in- vestment that few non-scholars would make. The reader in Czechoslovakia receives the book free , but struggles with even more obstacles of a different nature. As a result, few readers are likely to be interested in the entire set. Thus it would seern to rne wise to assume that the rea- ders will in all likelihood select individua! volurnes according to their persona! interests. Thus it would be well to order the edition so as to make such a choice possible - so that the reader could find, in one accessible volurne, all of Patočka ' s rnost irnportant texts pertaining to a particular topic. Such general considerations lead me to some more specific editorial guidelines. The first, which the authors of both proposals honour, is that the edition needs to be ordered themati- cally. To that, however, I would like to add a se- cond guideline: that the editors need to under- take a further difficult selection and rank the texts by importance, frorn the clearly centra! texts through rnarginal texts and finally supple- mentary texts included for the sake of complete- ness. Since I am keenly aware of the difficulties of exile publishing, I would suggest to the editors that they c9ncentrate in the first place on bring- ing out three or four volurnes of Patočka ' s most important texts dealing with the rnost relevant topics, so that the central core of Patočka ' s thought would becorne swiftly and effectively a part of the reader's consciousness - incidentally 24 also creating interest in subsequent volumes. I naturally hope that those will follow in tirne, but should their appearance be deferred, we would have at least the rnost important part available. All my experience suggests that the best strategy is to start with what is rnost irnportant and rele- vant, and proceed in decreasing order of irnpor- tance rather than chronologically or topically alone. Thus I would suggest publishing three or four volumes of the rnost important materials first, though what the topics of those volumes ought to be is something best estimated by experts in Cze- choslovakia, farniliar with the Czechoslovak si- tuation. If I had to make the decision, I would tend to focus the first volume on Patočka's wri- tings about Masaryk, since that is a topic rele- vant virtually to all Czechs, and not for philoso- phers alone. However, so that the size of the vo- l ume would not become excessive, I would prob- ably differentiate, roughly as Dr. Němec does, between texts dealing specifically with Masaryk and the occasional texts devoted to Czech thought and history in general, which I would leave for a subsequent volume. The very first vo- lume to reach the readers, however, would be a tight, well organised volume of texts devoted to a topic that most Czechs consider most relevant, taking as its therne the first part of Patočka ' s 1938 article, "Myšlenka vzdělanosti a její dnešní aktuálnost" ("The Idea of Cultivation and its Present Relevance"), to be followed at a Jater date by a companion volume of texts focusing on Czech thought and history, the two volurnes to- gether covering the material which Project II (Acta 2/87) gathers under its volume 3, Masaryk, Czech Thought and History. That, though, would wait. For the first four volurnes, designed to present the reader with Pa- [pageend26]točka ' s most important themes and texts in a compact form , I would next recommend the to- pic of persona! philosophy, once again relevant to a broad range of readers. I would select for it the most important of the texts included under the nice title of Project II, Care for the Soul, again choosing only the most important texts to produce a tight, highly readable volume and lea- ving the remainder for later companion volumes. I would suggest devoting the third of the first , introductory cluster of volumes to a representa- tive selection of Patočka ' s most important wri- tings in technical philosophy, focusing on Pa- točka ' s analyses on the transition from Husserl to Heidegger or, in effect, from subjectivism to an a-subjective phenomenology. These writings are far from technical , but they also represent Patočka ' s most significant contribution to the world philosophy of his time as well as the philo- sophical core of his work. Here the late, foreign language texts, such as the Warsaw Lecture and the article "Der Subjektivismus der Husserl- schen ... Phanomenologie" and Czech texts like "The Natural World and Phenomenology" and "Cartesianism and Phenomenology" constitute a core of solid, first rank philosophical work. Using the numbering of Project II, I would re- commend making up the volume out of selec- tions 141, 143, 145, 146,147, 148, 163, 165, 167 and 175, leaving the rest for a supplementary volume. Finally, should it prove feasible to include a fourth vol ume in the initial set of the most impor- tant texts- the Basic Pato čka-I would probably opt for a volume on the topic of Art and Philoso- phy. It is an area in which I lack all expertise, but it has a wide appeal. In the German edition - which Dr. Němec follows in his proposal, Pro- ject I - the editors used it as their first vol ume to attract the attention of German readers to Pa- točka. Here, though , reader interest most de- cide, and scholars in Czechoslovakia know that far better than I can hope to know it. Thus I would suggest deferring to them in the choice of topics. I am , however, totally convinced that the first three or four volumes need to represent a tight, well chosen body of Patočka ' s best and most important writings on the most relevant topics, so that the reader whose interest and/or possibi- lities restricts him or her to those volumes would yet have in hand a solid body of Patočka ' s basic writings - and no less so in case it should prove impossible to publish additional volumes at this time. I am no less convinced that it is crucial that the volumes of the first cluster should be orientated to the reader rather than the scholar. Quite con- cretely, the present Project II includes, in its pro- posed third volume, three versions and two sketches of one and the same lecture devoted to Czech philosophy between the wars. While I can imagine a graduate student writing a dissertation about the differences among versions A, B, and C and their relation to the two sketches, that is surely not a reader's interest. The reader wants to find out about Czech philosophy between the Wars: the duplication of texts simply makes the boo k unwieldy and unreadable. I would strongly recommend selecting one version for inclusion, mentioning the variants, which might some day appear in a supplementary volume, in a foot- note. Similarly, in the case of texts first written in French or German, I would strongly urge inclu- ding, in the first volumes, only a Czech transla- 25 [pageend27]tion. The truth is that the average Czech reader does not such a mastery of those languages as to be able to appreciate the subtleties of the text. For the scholar who does, I would include foot- notes identifying the originals, to appear in a subsequent volume. But in the Basic Patočka vo- lumes a Czech translation appears to be most to the point. That, then , appears to me as the first task: the publication of three or four volumes made up of Patočka's most important texts on topics of greatest relevance. Once these volumes are avail- able to the reader, we can - if we still have the resources - start worrying about the needs of the scholar and the librarian. Here I would suggest, as the second tier, several volumes devoted to writings in which Patočka presents and interprets a particular topíc. I would like to see first of all a volume devoted to ancient philosophy (vol. 8 of Project II) badly needed as a teaching aid, an- other volume devoted to the texts tracing the ge- nesis of modernity (notably articles collected in Aristotle: His Predecessors and Successors) , a vo- l ume of Comeniana and a vol ume of Husserliana. Finally, should available resources permit it, we could set about completing the series with supplementary volumes which would include va- riants, preparatory texts, translations and other background materials to texts included in the first two clusters, as well as a volume of Miscellanea and a vol ume of foreign-language originals which might be of interest to a foreign reader or library not interested in the Czech texts. That, however, is at present no more than a far-fetched contingency. The crucial project, both urgent and possible with available means, is one of the initial three or four vol um es, the Basic Patočka Reader of most important texts on most 26 important topics. If that proves successful, it may well be possible to follow with the second set of volumes devoted to special interests, and, if that succeeds, with a third set of companion volumes, completing a truly Collected Works. These are distant visions. For now, there is the need and the possibility to produce the first three or four volumes - and thus to follow Maurice Sendak's reminder that the best way to get everywhere is to go there one place at a time. NÁRODNÍ POLITIKA COMMENTS The January 1988 issue of the Czech exile monthly Národní politika comments on the dis- cussion of proposals for Patočka's Collected Works (ACTA 1 & 2), particularly Scheme No. II and Jiří Němec ' s reaction to it. Declaring that the question seems to hinge on the fact that Pa- točka wrote a large number of incidental texts "which by now are of only relative value as period material", the commentator supports the view that a selected Patočka reader would be of grea- ter importance "than a complete Patočka for a handful of scholars". Josef Novák COMMENTS ON THE JAN PA TOČKA PROJECT The proposals so far submitted for the publica- tion of Jan Patočka's Collected Works constitute editing plans of a scope unprecedented in the his- tory of the Czech exile community. I welcome these first practical steps. I respect them as the work of qualified specialists who have already [pageend28]been engaged in editing Patočka ' s texts for many years. However, our good wil] should not blind us to the question whether these enthusiastic plans can be fulfilled in practice. My fear is that the dimensions and academic complexity of the task militate against it, leaving aside organisational and financial considera- tions. Similarly, the authors' guidelines are inap- propriate. For instance, in view of the nature and purpose of the Collected Works, I can see no sense in ordering the individua! volumes chrono- logically (ACTA 2). Suchan approach must ine- vitably lead to a Babel in which readers will beto- tally lost. After all one can hardly expect them to decipher the meaning of the Pharaonic vases of abstract philosophy by means of fragments, shards, splinters ... When the publication of Husserl's writings got under way in the early fifties , a thematic ap- proach was adopted and a sequence from the most important texts to those of minor signifi- cance. No wonder, therefore, that it was only just recently that they started editing Husserl's lec- tures, drafts and fragments. Throughout the period the needs of researchers has been catered for, however, by allowing tňem to consult un- published materials whenever necessary. Even taking into account the enormous variety of topics covered by Patočka 's legacy, I still think that we should tackle the project in a manner similar to that adopted by the editors of Husserl's Nachlass. Admittedly this well-tried approach would not make things any easier for a future publisher, but it would result in an organically integrated edi- tion which would seem more rational from the reader's point of view. It would also avoid "finely honed" phenomenological articles of crucial imp- ortance to modem philosophical study appearing alongside impromptu talks. The latter were fre- quently interrupted by questions from the stu- dents, who - as one of them later admitted -fre- quently harped on about "only one or two of the lecture's topics". Be that as it may, an impromptu talk is not as valuable as a treatise to which the author devoted hours of thought before it assumed its final shape- nor could it have. There are many other possible comments one could make from the point of view of practical conside- rations, and not not just regarding the structure of the individua! volumes, but there is neither the time nor the space to record them. However I am convinced that we now have specialists who readily welcome reasoned argu- ment. It would therefore be in our interest to plan a working meeting at which we could approve the most suitable basis for a final lay-out of the indivi- dua! volumes and their content. Only the broa- dest possible co-operation will ensure that Pa- točka ' s writings are published "without omis- sions and subjective interpretative motives". THE EDITORS' RESPONSE The authors of the scheme for Jan Patočka 's Col- lected Works published in the last issue of A CT A - Scheme II - have reacted to some of the contri- butions to the discussion about the publication of the Patočka legacy. They have sent us comments about a number of general problems as well as about certain specific issues, and submitted a re- vised draft for the first two volumes of the Collected Works. We have summarised their points and are printing their revised draft. 27 [pageend29]1. The Scheme for Jan Patočka's Collected Works which was printed in ACTA 2/1987 was above all an attempt to provide a survey of all the available material and order it approximately by topic and individua! volumes. It was no more than a first step, butone we believe to have been vital as a basis for discussion. The Scheme took as its starting point the fact that the work that has been going on for nearly ten years to collate Patočka ' s philosophical le- gacy will not be complete until the collected ma- terial is properly ordered and edited. The Scheme has no intention oftaking the place of the archive. The concept of the Collected Works does not imply for us the need to publjsh everyt- hing the author ever wrote. None the less, the works that have come down to us need to be pre- pared and conceived as a single entity, otherwise one cannot talk about Patočka's works being ready for publication. The goal of these preparations is neither to push some megalomaniacal publishing project, but to create a sound and reliable basis for any fu- ture publication of Patočka. That is why from the outset we have also calculated with the possibility that a standard text prepared in this way could also be published in a smaller print run by means of offset: not as a samizdat edition, however, but as a computer print-out. Work on the entire col- lection could be completed in three years' time. Even as regards our particular Scheme, the purpose of the preparative work was not the pu- blication of a "relevant" or "up-to-date" Pa- točka. People will go on reading Patočka for a long time yet. The point is to avoid having to re- do the same work in our difficult circumstances. In other words, the work and investment which 28 have gone into it need to produce a Jong-term ef- fect. It is necessary to expedite the publication of Patočka ' s works. But this neither means doing it in a hurry or producing something that is purely for present consumption. The important thing is precisely that there should be an accessible and reliable source which the "up-to-date", "rele- vant" collections and popular, journalistic ver- sions of the future will be able to draw on. The idea of two series of Patočka's writings: a "specialist series" and a "readers' series" is one we entertained from the very start. However, we could not see the technical sense of preparing five or six volumes of the most important texts first of all , and then going on to complete the Collected Works. On the contrary, we believe that it is ne- cessary to prepare the standard Collected Works , in the process of which the "readers' edition" will be prepared de facto at one and the same time. The latter could therefore retain the original pa- gination of the standard edition and so share the same index. A reader's edition along these lines could be ready for distribution roughly by 1991. And it could possibly be produced in one go as a five- or six-volume set. In the course of the prepa- rations for the Collected Works and the discus- sion around them, the question of the seťs com- position will have received so much attention as to reduce to the minimum any danger of impo- sing a subjective concept of "how to read Pa- točka " . Maybe in the meantime it will even be possible to find a publisher for such a collection. To start by preparing a multi-volume "rea- der's" collection would only make sense if there was no intention of implementing the broader concept of the Collected Works. From where we are it is clearly impossible for us to assess all the various factors that might affect a deci si on on the [pageend30]matter, but we stick to the view, none the less, that the costs involved in preparing the exhaus- tive text will not be very high and that this work needs doing now, as the starting point for any edi- tion , including the readers' collections which have been mooted. 2. The next phase of work on the Collected Works is to sort the texts by subject-area, read them through in this new order and assess their relative importance and worth before separating the wheat from the chaff. However this task must be tackled as part of the work of actual preparing the individua] volumes, since it is inconceivable with tens of thousands of pages at a time. A rough idea of this second phase of the work can be gained from the revised draft of the two volumes Care for the soul which follow as an appendix. In the Iight of suggestions and comments so far received we would also make the following points: the actual text of the Collected Works will include Patočka ' s foreign-language writings in Czech translation; all duplication will be avo- ided; anything that is not a definitive text or lec- ture, will be assigned to appendices. The length of texts in the appendices can also be reduced if necessary. The 13th volume originally proposed (Miscell- anea) could be dropped by including the impor- tant articles in Vol ume 12 (The History of Philo- sophy) and incorporating the rest in the biblio- graphical data. Even after this re-arrangement the Collected Works would include 12 volumes, albeit clearer and more readable than in the orig- inal Scheme. However, we would wish to retain the chrono- logical arrangement of the Collected Works, come what may. Once the sorting process is com- pleted it will serve even more to point up the va- rious thematic components of Patočka ' s writings. As far as spelling is concerned, we ourselves would favour a deliberate conservatism but in- tend to have detailed consultations with experts after which we shall submit our basic guide-lines for consideration. 3. Erazim Kohák's comments on the arrange- ment logically concentrate on the core of Patočka 's oeuvre i.e. the thematic sections: Ma- saryk, Czech Thought and History; Care for the Soul; Phenomenology; Art and Philosophy. Ho- wever we have serious misgivings about his pro- posal to combine a "relevant" collection with the Collected Works. What might seem at first sight a compellingly pragmatic suggestion is actually ba- sed on the assumption that after the first six or se- ven volumes, publication of the Collected Works would become bogged down. However, if this did not happen we would be confronted with a set headed by four volumes of the most important writings which would catch readers' interest, fol- lowed by a volume on ancient philosophy and one on Comenius. Subsequent volumes would be obliged to return to previous topics, but with less important texts or even miscellanea. Taken over- all such a Collected Works would be even less co- herent than the existing provisional collection. 1t is is hard to estimate the sort of reaction there would be from the readers who had been won to the first volumes. Should the CSDC come to the conclusion that present resources only permit the publication of Patočka 's most important works, we would put forward a proposal for such a selec- tion, taking into account the views of Erazim Ko- hák et al. Such a selection could not constitute an introduction to Patočka ' s Collected Works , ho- 29 [pageend31]wever. These would have to be conceiver' at a Ja- ter date as a separate set with a uniform arrange- ment - and incorporating the texts already edi- ted, of course. 4. There is possibly a way of satisfying all the views expressed in the course of the discussion. This would be initially to publish the central core of Patočka's writings in seven volumes, the con- tents of which would correspond to volumes 1-7 of the Second Draft (see ACTA 2). The length would not be greatly reduced but the arrange- ment would be made more coherent along the li nes of what we have done with the revised. pro- posal for Care for the Soul (Vols. 1 and 2). These- cond section of the collection i.e. volumes on an- cient philosophy, Comenius and the history of philosophy, and, if need be, correspondence and appendices, could come out in a later phase. In this way, readers would gain access to the main body of Patočka's work as soon as possible, with- out there being need to resort to two completely separate sets from the very start. *** Revised draft arrangement of the first two Volu- mes of Patočka's Collected Works: CARE FOR THE SOUL I.

The first instalment would relate solely to the editorial aspect of the project. I do believe that it is necessary to complete as soon as possi- ble the work commenced on preparing the defin- itive text, and gradually to transcribe the indivi- dua! volumes ( on to computer diskette) . In the process a decision could be taken on the volumes which should be given priority with a view to eventual book publication, since the proposed ordering of the volumes need not necessarily tally with their order when it comes to preparing them for publication, or their actual publication in whatever form. This part of the scheme is unlikely to be so costly as to rule out funding. This would give rise to a text which , while be- ing ready for publishing in whatever form , would not demand a prior decision on the form of its ac- tual publication, whether as a printed or duplica- ted edition, and whether in entirety or as a selec- tion . That decision would depend on subsequent discussion and above all on the subsequent re- sources - and if possible, publishers- that can be obtained. But even if it proved impossible to ob- tain the necessary resources for publishing the entire collection in book form, it would still be possible to publish it progressively by the afore- mentioned offset method. This would be one way of seeing that we do not end up with yet an- other unrealized publishing project, of which we already have too many in our litera ture: suffice it to recall the collected writings ofT.G.Masaryk, F.X.Šalda or others. Another argument in favour of this particular solution is the fact that it is the very purpose of the CSDC to support independent literature. In the case of The Collected Works of Jan Patočka, I believe its primary and most important task to [pageend34]beto help ensure that the text is edited ready for publication in a fitting manner. Only when it has been properly prepared can work go ahead on publishing Patočka 's writings in one form or an- other. If the worst comes to the worst, the pre- sent technical resources available mean that they could afford to bring them out in a more restric- ted print-run to satisfy at least the needs of libra- ries, specialists and a narrower circle of readers. NEW BOOKS AND JOURNALS AKAUTMANDOUBLE František Kautman , Masaryk, Šalda, Patočka: situace čes kého národa ve světě, situace soudobého světa (Masaryk, Šalda and Patočk a: the situation of the Czech nation in the world; the situation of the modem world). Samizdat, 129 pp. Undated [1987]. František Kautman is certainly not alone in having reached full literaray maturity at a time when normalisation was excluding him and many others from official culture, when the loss of any opportunity to publish was offering him in exchange the chance to free himself once and for all from worries about the present régime , as well as about censorship and - most importantly -from self-censorship. However he is one of those who grasped this opportunity with a wholeheartedness which is still quite rare in Czech unofficial literature. There are still surprisingly few novels to match his autopsy of the intellectual and ethical Jali of an entire generation of constructors of those pro- verbial "radiant tomorrows", such epic testimo- nies of the author's life and times, as his "novel for Marketka" Mrtvé rameno (Backwater) , for instance. Nevertheless Kautman's novel has yet to find a publisher abroad to bring it out as a printed book. So it is still available only in ex- cerpt form in issue No. 81 (1987) of the Paris- based journal Sv ědectví. Moreover a similar lack of interest has afflicted other prose works by Kautman, including the short-story collection Alternativy (Alternatives) - samizdat, 1978, 552 pp. - and Prolog k románu (Prologue to a novel) which is reviewed elsewhere in this issue. This neglect might partly be explained by the fact that Kautman as a prose-writer tends to be overshadowed by Kautman the critic, literary his- torian , editor, translator and author of many studies of such focal figures of foreign and Cze- choslovak literature as Dostoyevsky, Kafka, Neumann , Šalda, Hostovský, etc. Sadly even these major critical works of earlier and more re- cent periods have yet to arouse suitable interest among exile publishing houses, though they de- finitely merit publication. They include manu- scripts that were actually completed and edited ready for printing at the end of the sixties before being suppressed and circulating only in samiz- dat. I would single out three pioneering mono- graphs, in particular: Dostojevskij - věčný pro- blém člověka (Dostoyevsky - the eternal human problem) of 1977, Svět Franze Kafky (Franz Kaf- ka's World) , of the same year and Polarita na- šeho věku v díle Egona Hostovského (The pola- rity of our times in the work of Egon Hostovský) of 1978, though there are others works in a simi- 33 [pageend35]lar vein that equally merit attention such as the specialised volume K typologii literární kritiky (Typology of literary criticism) which came out in 1976 or his extensive historico-philosophical treatise O českou národní identitu (The search for a Czech national identity) of 1977. These two fields of criticism and the epic are extremely complementary in Kautman's output. It would be bard for readers of Kautman's fiction who are also familiar with his literary studies, particularly the above-mentioned monographs, to ignore the fact that the author's long-standing interest in Dostoyevsky, Kafka and Hostovský was not merely theoretical and historical. It is also the practical interest of a writer seeking his mentors and investigating his own artistic pedi- gree. And those who have had the opportunity of reading Kautman's thoughts on Czech nation- al identity, must very quickly realise when read- ing Backwater, that at the heart of that book is the same problem of identity - how it is im- perilled and lost - but here seen mirrored in the individua! fate of the novel's main character. Kautman's most recent study also continues the argument developed in The Czech National Identity , and its content is summarised in the very title: Masaryk, Šalda and Patočka:the situa- tion of the Czech nation in the world; the situation of the modem world. Though the work was writ- ten in a period when we were celebrating a num- ber of notable anniversaries connected with the book's title figures , it was not Kautman's inten- tion to write a jubilee essay, nor even a celebra- tory piece. Equally he was not concerned about the narrowly specialised aspects of their legacy. His attention focused chiefly on their charac- teristic Czech fate which, as Kautman writes in the introduction , all three "accepted manfully", with all its consequences. "This also serves to de- 34 fine the field of our considerations. In so far as we shall touch on general philosophical princip- les or specific areas in which the three people in question were active, we will only do so in rela- tion to their attitude to the fundamental ques- tions: namely, the destiny of modem humanity , the destiny of our nation in the world , and the destiny of that world. " I leave it to the experts, whether favourable or critical, to make a more detailed appraisal of Kautman's ideas. Ali one may do in a short re- view is draw readers' attention to a work and in- dicate some of its themes. One of the main themes is undoubtedly that of the Czech destiny, already referred to. As Kautman demonstrates, concern for its meaning and the meaning of Czech consciousness occupied an equally impor- tant place in the thinking of Masaryk, Šalda and Patočka , despite all external and intrinsic diffe- rences, and in the case of all three of them , it was part and parcel of a wider concern for the mean- ing of humanity and the fate of the world. On occasions, their solutions tallied , but more often than not they differed. Kautman traces and com- pares the development of their thinking both in the light of the historical , political and social events of their times and in relation to philoso- phical, religious and ethical issues, and creati- vity. He also goes on to trace and discuss the im- plications of the distinctive answers provided by each of the three. However Kautman is at pains to stress that in the case of the two philosophers their researches were to culminate in practical activity, that they were to provide a persona! ex- ample and challenge. Kautman's essay is can be seen above all an attempt to express the signifi- cance of that challenge both for him personally and for the rest of us, now that one or more dec- ades now separates us from their deaths. Jan Vladislav [pageend36]František Kautman. Prolog k románu: z mého života (Pro- logue to a novel: from my life). Edice Kvart, 362 pp. Prague 1979. Henry Miller recalls how he became a Dostoy- evsky addict and was frustrated at not being able to probe his own characters so deeply. Accor- ding to him it was only when he realised that he had far outstripped his idol that he could actually start writing hirnself. Kautman lacks that kind of American arrogance and naivety. Fortunately. A mixture like that would be very suspect in the case of a central European Dostoyevsky expert, to say the least. But in a way his path also started with the father of modem literature. The subject-matter of Prologue to a novel is in- dicated on the very first page. The reader is wamed right away that the book will be about words, no less. "I have remained alone with words. I cannot tel1 if I will manage to reach an understanding with them. There is no risk of my becoming alienated from them . On the contrary, they have never been so close to me as now. I have merged with them and they have penetra- ted rne. They are the last and only things I have left ... " This opening paragraph gives the gist of the book, sketching its purpose. lt indicates the first paradox and the primary obstacle. The unnamed and unnameable protagonist makes no secret of his intention to write a novel. And not just any novel, but a "novel for everyone". But before he can start, he naturally has to get rid of all the words that do not belong in a "novel for everyone". But what can be done with words when "in the end there will be noth- ing but words left", "the word has become the subject-matter", "words fall from the subject rnatter like flaking paint", "I can be rude to anyone I like, because not one single word will fall frorn my lips", "I do not trust issues or the words that express them" , "not wanting to write a novel , giving up the use of words", "I belong to a generation that fought for years so that things should be called by their proper names, even if coded", "words are slippery and sticky- created for love" , "having renounced obedience to al! the lords of the earth, I had to end up in the clut- ches of words". All other concepts to which the author once adhered are subjected to the same merciless analysis. He investigates everything that he once loved as the price he must pay if he is to advance the smallest step. First and foremost, Kautman's story is the story of how a modem novel is bom. He yearns to write a classical novel but the disintegration of traditional forms, which is no more than theine- vitable outcome of his own disillusionment and a reflection of his loss of faith in his beloved words, forces him , almost against his will, to abandon the well-trodden paths of literature and chaose one which is both unfamiliar and untrodden. The author is no bom innovator driven by a need to experiment and break things in order to test out new and unfamiliar forms of expression. His no- stalgia and sorrow at losing the chance to write a well-considered, well-thought-out and coherent novel forms one of the main thernes of the boo k. Being an experienced literary critic, he returns again and again to the problem of the novel. However what appears to be abstract literary theory is not used to show off the author's erudi- tion but solely as the starting point and means for a thorough reappraisal of all established con- cepts. His critical method is even turned against himself. But whereas in the case of others he uses it as a means of understanding, comprehending and grasping hidden meanings and ramifica- tions, in his own case it is used to almost suicidal 35 [pageend37]effect. His well-trained intellect is not employed in dissimulating unpleasant reality by means of interpretations that attenuate, cast doubt and re- duce everything to the same level. Instead it is used like a scalpel in an autopsy. Although the novel is highly autobiographi- cal, as its sub-title suggests, this is not just an- other subjective view or inner portrait of a disil- lusioned and doubting individual. On the con- trary, he subjects himself to merciless analysis from the start. The clash between the critic and the writer is all the more dramatic in that the cri- tic qua critic never previously had the opportu- nity to talk about himself, being obliged through- out his life to hide behind a bland "we" . Though his "I" had been pressed into the service of others whose names return obsessively again and again - setting the rhythm of the book- it could not be entirely stifled. Kautman manages, albeit with regret, to escape the comforting strait- jacket of complicated plot, description , charac- ter, dénouement and even conclusion, but he does not - and nor could he, since honesty pre- vents him - suppress knowledge and experience. Unassuming, though not humble (since humility assumes the existence of an ideal still worthy of veneration), his "I" has finally decided to speak out after a lifetime of being tainted and eroded at the epicentre of words. lts speech is faltering and hesitant as one might expect from an expert on words and an experienced speaker. The only means for him to come to terms with his ever- nagging sense of having botched his life - sub- merged beneath words, slogans, clichés, doc- trines, theories, interpretations and explana- tions - is the one of which he has a perfect mas- tery, i.e. words. His striving after the truth pre- vents him from feigning the coherence or cohe- sion which are crucial elements of the conventio- 36 nal novel. He thereby bridges the gap between the traditional concept and the liberating func- tion of the experimental novel. Prologue to a novel provides convincing proof that a modem , fragmented novel is no mindless provocation, no mere hankering after originality at any price, butan inevitable option as a specific way of coming to terms with a certain life expe- rience which cannot be grasped by any other means. lt is also proof that the problems of the novel cannot be isolated from the most intimate and universa) problems. Although the unknown protagonist never descends to the Jeve! of mere confession, and by maintaining a deliberate de- tachment constantly expresses his doubts about the therapeutic effect of such an approach, his identity becomes clearer all the time. The author liberates himself by deciding to disregard his rea- ders and listeners who had been his supreme judges so far. Heis not driven into the abyss by a thirst for knowledge but by a yearning for under- standing. lt is a need he cannot relinquish al- though he knows far better than anyone else that absolute understanding does not exist because of the infinite number of possible viewpoints. The leitmotif of the Sisyphus myth-which permeates the text in a number of variants - expresses this most clearly. Kautman is not tediously omnis- cient but stimulatingly nescient. Kautman's acquaintance with words is only matched by his knowledge of silence. And re- maining silent. "I would rather remain silent, but to remain silent is to transcend the frontiers of communicativeness. To remain silent is not to bear witness. " "Only those who choose silence understand me, and I share their silence which is as menacing and sterile as a marble statue." In fact Kautman speaks solely in order to fall silent again. He has successfully traversed the narrow [pageend38]and treacherous path that separates tedious con- fession from paltry self-justification, and with- out toppling into plausible interpretations. His guilt is not relative, since he will not let it be so. He speaks to all because he speaks only to him- self. In permanent danger of self-indictment, Kautman demonstrates that a truly thinking per- son , is his or her own severest judge. He treads softly so that the ear-splitting silence may be heard. Amidst such a din even a sentence like: "The purpose of my novel ought to be an attempt to get to the heart of existence pure and simple" does not sound banal because it sums it all up precisely. Silence is the most important element of Prologue to a novel. Inexpressibility and in- communicability are its main characters - cha- racters portrayed in depth - which are the vehi- cles for the book's key messages. In the preface to the Kolyma stories, Siny- avsky wrote: "Vaarlam Shalamov writes as if he were already dead." One might say the same a- bout Kautman were it not for the fact that time plays such a major role in his novel. The dead need not heed time. Kautman is haunted by the lost time of stale words: by time present, which is entirely consumed by words which have no place in a novel for everyone, and by time fu ture - the repository of the words that remain for his plan- ned novel. He inhabits a three-in-one final time - in a defiantly atheistic sense - which slips through his fingers. Kautman manages to keep the distance be- tween himself and the unnameable protagonist to a minimum. The book's groping and probing "I" seeks not forgiveness butan answer- an ans- wer that he knows beforehand does not exist. lt cannot exist. Perhaps it is must not exist even, or it would be the end of the literature which re- mains his first love in spite of everything. Kaut- man forgives his "I" nothing and himself has no interest in forgiveness. Therein lies his greatness and the greatness of the novel whose unpreten- tious title is yet another expression of the author's unrelenting irony. The novel which, at the end of the Prologue, he claims he will prob- ably Jack the strength to write, ends with the full stop after the final word. (In 1972!) It is almost incredible that a novel with one single unnamed character about whom the reader learns almost nothing should achieve the polyphony of Kaut- man's revered Dostoyevsky. After all Kautman himself wrote: "I have eluded justice, both human and divine; I have condemned myself unjustly. I am responsible for a miscarriage of justice against myself. But I cannot put it right as I am the only witness to the deed. I can only call myself to account." Lubomír Martínek A NEW SLOV AK MAGAZINE FRAGMENT. Samizdat magazíne, Nos. 1 & 2. Bratislava 1986/87. The · Bratislava-based samizdat magazine FRAGMENT shares one feature with the jour- nal K which we wrote about in our last issue: it acknowledges Dominik Tatarka as Slovakia's leading writer and moral authority, who has the power to rescue Slovak thought and artistic crea- tion from its present state of isolation and steri- lity. A sign of this is the publication in its first is- sue of a lengthy excerpt from the author's work "Navrávačky" (Recordings) - shortly to be pu- blished by Index, Cologne. A large part of both issues is devoted to selec- tions from contemporary foreign literature. And as part of their conscious effort to open up hori- 37 [pageend39]zons to the outside world , the editors have no qualms about including material translated into Czech. This is encouraging in that it helps keep alive the mutually beneficial tradition of cross- fertilisation between Slovak and Czech litera- ture and emphasises the fact that the struggle for new ideas transcends the frontier between the two languages. In its first two issues, FRAGMENTfocuses on catholic modernism in both Slovak and Czech li- tera ture. The Slov ak school is represented by the banned author Janko Silan, a writer of fine prose and poetry who died recently, and the Czech by Jakub Deml, the supreme exponent of the move- ment whose poetry was held in high esteem by Ivan Krasko among others. As regards foreign literature, FRAGMENT includes examples of writing by a representative of French erotic literature, Georges Bataille, and by the recently deceased Egypto-French sur- realist poet Joyce Mansour. In addition, there is in an interview with William Burroughs, conduc- ted by the English critic B.Gysin, in which that distinguished representative of modem Ameri- can prose speaks about his artistic credo. Each foreign translation is accompanied by back- ground notes on the writer's life and output, as guidance for readers. S peci al mention should be made of Marek Bo- hún's article " Čas sumarizácie" (Time to take stock) dedicated to the memory of three execu- ted members of the Catholic movement, "Biela légia" (The White Legion). The article tells how, towards the end of their lives, three pioneers of Slovak communism, Marek Čulen , Laco Novo- meský and Július Ďuriš had turned away from the ideology whose cause they had served throughout their lives. "One of them (Marek Čulen) took his leave by returning to the Church, the second (Laco Novomeský), turned his back on it as the brother of his class enemy ( the former interior minister of the Slov ak State, A. Mach), and the third ( J úlius Ďuriš) had no de- sire to listen to state employees even after his death. " The remaining space in these two interesting first issues of FRAGMENT is taken up with ex- tensive sections of criticism and articles about art, literature and exhibitions, as well as about musical events. Michal Kubín "PADLOCK BOOKS" 1973-1987 The following material is a first attempt at an in- ventory of Edice Petlice ("Padlock Books"), the earliest series of self-published manuscripts of Czech and Slovak authors. These were authors who, at the beginning of the seventies, had lost their "licences to publish". In other words, either the whole or part of their output was banned from publication by the country's exclu- 38 sively state-run or state-controlled publishing or media institutions. Some of the writers were proscribed for only a time, but in most cases the ban has been permanent. In addition, there are authors of the younger generation who have never had the opportunity to publish. Since the beginning of this most extensive of the self-help publishing initiatives of the seven- [pageend40]ties and eighties, the first part of its title has be- come generally accepted. Other samizdat series started being described this way, and some of the?1 actually incorporated the expression in the1r nai:nes. N~ne t?e less it is still not easy for the outsider to 1magme what Edice Petlice actu- ally is and what it embodies. The_ first news of its existence was published in 1975 ~1multaneously and in identical forrn by the exlle Journals Listy (Vol.V, No.7) and Svědectví (Vol. XIII, No.50) together with a list of the first fifty . Petlice editions. Svědectví subsequently pubhshed tw(_) further, albeit only fragmentary , reports, one m 1979 (Svědectví , No. 58) with a list of Petlice editions numbered from 51 to 145 and the second , a year Jater, in Svědectví No. 61: with a ]jst headed "the fourth half-century". From 1980 onwards there existed only ad-hoc lists, nothing of which was ever published out- side. A complete record of Petlice titles virtually up to the end of 1983 was compiled at one time for the needs of a still unfinished publication a- bout Edice Petlice being prepared under the auspices of the University of Toronto. Inciden- tally, Ji ří Gruša wrote an excellent and exhaus- tive essay for this project, which has yet to be published even in magazine form. In view of this situation , the Centre for Independent Czechos- lovak Literature decided to bring out as soon as possible at Ieast a provisional in ven tory of those titles registered as Petlice editions. There is no point in recounting all the ins and outs of the work involved in preparing what is submitted here. The CSDC's collections provided the basic source of information which was auomented b with original lists and an updated and revised list which Ludvík Vaculík finished compiling at the beg_inning of 1988. It was he also who pains- takmgly procured the missing information about most of the titles lacking from the Centre's own collections. The Centre was assisted in its work of cata- loguing by Xenie Klepikov, Lubomír Martínek and Ruth Tasková. In addition, Ludmila Šeflová helped the work get off the ground by generously making available her own records of those Petlice titles which have been printed abroad both in the original language and translation. She was also an invaluable consultant throughout the work when it came to tackling some sticky bibliogra- phical problems. Jan Vladislav went through the draft and added details about the Kvarteditions. Mine was the task of directing and coordina- ting the work of cataloguing the titles, as well as unifying, supplementing and finalising all thein- dividua! records and notes on a uniform pattern. I also had the job of drafting the explanatory notes and performing the work involved with typesetting the entire list. The Centre is deeply indebted to everyone - not all of whom can be named - whose contribution enabled the ma- terial to be presented in its present form. Re- sponsibility for all omissions and errors - except where they are objectively the result of the pre- sent adverse conditions - rests fairly and squa- rely on my own shoulders. The material presented bere is intended for study purposes and it raises a whole number of q_uestions to which it is unable to supply exhaus- t1ve answers. From doser reading it will be clear why the list is described as provisional and what still remains to be done in the work of recording and researching Edice Petlice. Some of these re- maining tasks are referred to in the explanatory text which accompanies the list. I would recom- mend reading that text immediately after the es- say by Ludvík Vaculík, as a key to the full under- standing of its various components. Vilém Prečan 39 [pageend41]Ludvík Vaculík APADLOCKFOR CASTLE SCHWARZENBERG "I've made a good job of wrapping that for you- it almost seems a waste, really," Lt.Col. Noga declared. He had tied the heavy parcel round with hemp string and even left a loop to make it easier for me to carry. The parcel contained a- bout forty Padlock volumes which the Matura- Martinovský team had taken away with them du- ring a house-search carried out in April 1975 in honour of the Final Act of the Helsinki Confe- rence. The list of confiscated materials was 86 items Jong and included among others two of Sei- ferťs Plague Column, six of Skácel's Fault of the peaches (with illustrations by Vaculka) and two of Gruša's Prayer to Janinka. Now I was getting them back. Among the things returned was item 65: "scrap of paper with a list of Czechoslovak writers of the so-called 'publishing series': Pad- lock Boo ks". Two years later, during a house-search in ho- nour of Charter 77, they once more took away a whole basket of things, most of which they sub- sequently returned, including item No.17: "two sheets - summary of the authors published" . (Appendix 1) My friends and I interpreted this as a positive sign, as an "adjudication" confirming that there were no lega] objections to our "enter- prise". Most of the time, life blazes its own trails and needs no plans or preconceived notions. What was to become a major cultural undertaking star- ted when Ivan Klíma needed to get the manus- cript of his Lepers typed out. To try to save some money, he had it typed in several copies which he 40 then sald to interested parties. There turned out to be more of them than there were copies. It was just at the moment that Československý spisova- tel (the Writers' Union publishing house , trans.) sent me back my Guinea Pigs. So I took a leaf out of Klíma's book. Those original copies were A4 format and at first were just stapled together. But it struck me that they could just as easily be properly finished , bound editions. They might even start a boo k series ... I thought up a name for them: it was an acro- nym of the instruction "Výslovný zákaz dalšího opisování rukopisu" (Further copying of this manuscript expressly forbidden) making the Czech word VZDOR ( defiance). But I didn't tel1 anyone, in case they laughed at me - especially Klíma. lt was only Jater that I came up with the improved and more poignant title of Petlice (Padlock) . I naturally made my Guinea Pigs title No. 1 of the series. lt was subsequently tran- scribed at Ieast ten times. I took care that there should be no reason for the project to be accused of "speculation" or profiteering. My practice was therefore to "seli" copies of manuscripts to their authors and interested parties "at cost" sole- ly to pay for paper, typing and binding. Thety- pists were paid the going rate for editorial assi- stance. And since the product was openly marked as a manuscript and bore the author's signature, I thought nothing could be held against it. I didn't even think of it as "samizdat" of any kind, partly because it is a word I don't like. I used to present the authors with a bili for services rendered: they could buy their work for such and such an amount. (Appendix 2) I got a lot of fun out of that enterprise. I dreamed of expanding it to draw in all the coun- try's major authors. And although "expressly forbidden", the copying and re-copying of their [pageend42]works would expand aut of all known propor- tions. I didn't give a thought to exile publishers- I didn't know anything about them , in fact. The snag was that I knew al most no major au- thors! For even though ill-informed observers list me as one of the "leading group" of famous and influential authors of the '67-'69 period, I personally knew very few of them at the time. With my two little books, and better known for a certain speech and one longer article, I felt my- self a bit of an outsider. I had an abstract rever- ence for the writing community, but my actual experience of that world rather put me off it. To this day I don't know Mňačko, or Lustig, and I wasn't a pal of Ptáčník 's or Sotola's. I didn't know Skácel or Mikulášek. I had exchanged scarcely half a dozen words with Procházka or Březovský. I could tel1 Trefulka and Uhde apart only because of their diametrically contrasting fi- &ures. I wouldn't have recognised Otčenášek or Rezáč if I'd seen them on the street or even in a photograph. In those days I was not one of Ko- houťs visitors - or Dan ěk ' s . Figures like Drda and Aškenázy I only knew from a distance. I thought Neff was already dead and Olbracht still alive. The only thing I knew about Pilař was where I could find him. Jiří Hájek was known to me only from the rude things people said about him . I had certainly never met Skála or Závada- ar if I had, it was only because I hadn't recog- nised them . As for Majerová ( or do I mean Gla- zarová?) , I had been at some meeting she atten- ded ( or was it Glazarová?). For years I took Kříž and Kryštofek to be somebody else. Still less <lid I know any of the suppressed writers of the opposition. It was only via Petlice that I was to come doser to writers like Havel, Gruša or Ka- beš. My first conversations with Seifert, Patočka and Černý were about Petlice, and it almost scared meto discover how seriously Černý took the project. Petlice took meto people who were poles apart, such as Třešňák and General Sacher. Through negotiations about manu- scripts, I came to know Pecka and Kautman Čivrný and Bedřich Fučík , Urbánek and Dva: řák, Topol and Landovský and Professor Komárková. They were among the first, Radim Palouš is among the most recent. The fact is that before Petlice I had met few major writers- and not even any "Majors", for that matter. In the course of my rounds, I was obliged to enter previously unknown territory, such as the Slavia Café, where I encountered Kolář Hiršal Pechar and Vladislav. Vladislav turned ~ut to b~ a gen i al and encouraging competitor. He had his own cottage industry: Edice Kvart (Quarto Boo ks). I had some of his ti tles copied under the Petlice i°:print, including all of Kolář ' s things. When , w1th Vladislav's assistance, I came to make the first complete list of the works pre- sented by Petlice, we agreed that for fu ture refe- rence and guidance for scholars, the list should also include works that were not transcribed un- de~ P_etlice auspices. Generally speaking, as that act1v1t_y branched out, it also became necessary to reg1ster those works that had been copied out and distributed by the authors themselves. This explains the presence on the list of various titles by Jiří Ruml, for instance. The Moravian Reader collections, published in Brno, were listed in or- der to draw the attention of fu ture literary histo- r!a_ns to their exi_stence. We were simply in no po- s1t10n to transcnbe everything. Petlice's first and chief copyist was Zdena Er- teltová , who had just lost her job. She was a trained librarian and straight away she wanted to play at doing things scientifically -establishing a card-index, keeping a bibliography and what 4 1 [pageend43]have you. It seemed a trifle ludicrous to me at the time, but it would come in handy now. Anyway, the secret police brought an end to all that when they started to turn their beady eyes in our direc- tion . At the height of its activity, Petlice had six copyists typing out stuff at the same time. But subsidiary "manufactories" also sprang up, one of them in Brno. I preferred not to know any- thing about them; we merely exchanged books. So as to keep tabs on the work and production standards, I worded the copyright differently for each of the copyists; the only names l'11 reveal here are Otka Bednářová and Mirka Rektori- sová. The "V.z.d.o.r. " wording was restricted to the original copyist. If the sentence started with the word Autor, it had been typed personally by the author. One boo k I regard as a great amateur achievement - though it was professionally im- maculate - was Hanzelka's Ceylon - paradise without angels (No. 48); in the process I came to know Mirek Zikmund as well. I would point out that the original identification code is no longer a reliable guide because the books were subse- quently copied out by anyone who felt like it, and often the code was copied as well. Next to Zdena Erteltová, it was Otka Bedná- řová who made the greatest contribution. She even bound her own work! ln my opinion her subsequent prosecution was in revenge for Pet- lice. I am not very familiar with the case of Jiří Gruntorád, but he suffered chiefly for having had his own Petlice "manufactory". The assault on Petlice was directed not against the authors but against the copyists, binders and organisers. There was the case ofMrs Šinoglová of Znojmo , for instance, who was convicted of copying out Trefulka and Vaculík, while the latter were ig- nored by the court. Zdena Erteltová really ought 42 to find time to write about her experiences in some form. There was the occasion when I was warned that the Tomas bookbinders had instruc- tions to report any orders they received for bind- ing typescript. To test whether it was trne, I tried submitting them some of the thinner volumes; it was something of Kantůrková's. They were con- fiscated. Manuscripts started piling up in my various hidey holes. Kvart could afford to smile: Vladislav bound his editions himself and he af- fably offered to teach me how; but there was no comparison between his monthly output and mine ... ! The newly-created Edice Expedice series had also found an independent method of manufacture, and Mr.Havel , its director, made things a bit easier for himself by signing the books on behalf of their authors. Various élite bibliophile series also came into existence, in which the individua! edition was a work of art in itself: those series went above all for the "goodies" that were in circulation. At Petlice it continued to be a case of worka- day service and necessity , but we still managed to get Edvard Valenta's by then illegible signa- ture on his boo k I lived with a multi-millionaire. In the process Jiří Gruša and I were to discover that Valenta had yet another remaining manu- script. Was it complete? Mrs Valenta gave me the novel - One more life - to read. Who was to assess its worth? What sort of work was it? lt was certainly interesting enough to merit a decision by some future publisher or critic. lt was there- fore necessary to do something to keep it in exis- tence and publicise it. lt came out in Petlice with an editorial comment and some extracts from letters, in which the author had initially voiced doubts about his work before convincing himself of its worth. lt was a mistake on the part of Index [pageend44]publishers to publish the work without these ad- ditions, because it left itself and the author open to needless criticism. Our concern was to preserve people's memo- ries for posterity and this led us to such authors as Vilém Sacher (Bloody Easter, No. 114) or the Prague baker Antonín Vais (Birth and downfall of an exploiter, No. 320). This is why the list also includes Chronicle of my life (No. 249) by the one time Lord Mayor of Brno, Podsedník. We did not manage to get this work transcribed, so the original manuscript exists in the care of some unknown person in Brno. Věra Hájková-Du- xová (No.350) wrote her memoirs solely for her children's benefit. But I was taken by the una- dorned and informative way she wrote about such hackneyed subjects as the war and the con- centration camps, and it has since become one of the basic source materials for the study of that period. Ail of a sudden Petlice started being talked a- bout abroad. A copy of a book published by Sixty-Eight Publishers bearing the Petlice im- print came into my hands. The imprint was a fac- simile of a New Year's card which, for two or three years running, I had sent to Petlice authors with the wish that the coming year would provide the key to the padlock. (Appendix 3) My wish first came true in the case of Šotola, for whom the doors of a publishing house were opened in return for some concession by the author. Then came the turn of Holub, Hrabal , Seifert, etc. My attitude to those concessions was ... - neither one way or the other. Change had to come about somehow! It was precisely Petlice's mission to break through the wall of silence. The authori- ties tempted writers away from Petlice with vague promises and veiled threats, such as in the case of Hamšík and Ptáčník. There was the occa- sion when I went to collect a manuscript from Branald and he told me he was involved in some negotiations somewhere: the manuscript was published elsewhere very soon afterwards. When Petlice editions started making their appearance abroad, it was not j ust other authors who took note, but also and above all the State Security. They started behaving worse than ever. One autumn - it was either in '75 or '76, I can't be sure - the police gave me three options: I could leave the country, give up Petlice, or. .. The third, very uncouth option was to become a reality in J anuary 1977. It is something I have yet to write about. For years I had heard: "Give up Petlice and you can write what you like." Those were the days when I would hide my accounts in the form of secret notes in a crack in the wall beneath the window-sill . (Appendix 4) Meanwhile, Petlice was pushing me in the op- posite direction: it was demanding more and more. It was taking up all my time, and I was broke. I wasn't even managing to read others' manuscripts and work on them. And one ought not get the impression that there are many wri- ters who are willing to take a careful pencil to a colleague's manuscript and correct the typing er- rors and punctuation. There were always several titles in the process of copying, binding or in bags ready for the stampede. By this time there were also large sums involved. Customers reserved copies by paying me as much as thousands of crowns in advance. This money circulated in the form of material and labour. There was always as much to do as in any publishing-house - photos and graphic illustrations, special kinds of binding - and, when the services of the state book-bin- ders were no longer available, sticking wall-pa- per covers on the books. Nobody edited the manuscripts, and apart from a few exceptions, 43 [pageend45]not even the authors were willing to correct the second or third copies. Only Gruša used to check the manuscripts which he obtained and brought me. And he would also set them out ready for the copyist. He did this for Pištora and also for Ge- neral Sacher. In those days, Sergej Machonin would bring me work edited and properly laid out. So did Jan Vladislav. I remember once bring- ing a certain author a parcel of copies of his manuscript and asking him to take them to the binders' himself. "Why me?" he replied, taken aback. That made me realise what a daft situa- tion I was in. People actually thought I was being paid for what I did . The news once reached me that Petlice had been discussed at a meeting of some internatio- nal publishers' association or other, and that I'd been awarded a prize of 10,000 marks. A police interrogation followed swiftly (unlike the money): "So you run a publishing-house, do you?! " I protested that it was nothing to do with me and I wrote to the association thanking them but explaining that Petlice was not a publishing- house but a defensive activity on the part of silenced authors. It turned out to have been a mistake, and there was no prize. Later, in 1979, I think-though I can't be abso- lutely sure - Petlice really was awarded the Jan Palach Prize. I dreaded the consequences, but was overjoyed. My irnrnediate reaction was that it was for me. And then it gradually dawned on rne that it was not intended that way at all. After consulting two other people, I divided the 120,000 crowns into three parts. I sent one to Brno, the second I gave to a man who knew a lot more than I did about the various non-Petlice publishing activities (which by then included va- rious periodicals and annuals in the fields of his- tory, law, political econorny, etc.). With the re- 44 maining third we were able to award a " Petlice Prize" that year. I gave ten thousand crowns to a young man who was extremely active as a writer and organiser-and greatly in need offunds. Five thousand went into the "typewriter fund": be- cause we needed to buy some of the copyists new typewriters, several of which are still in the ar- chives of the Interior Ministry. In addition, I used the money to make up for a running deficit which, despite my absurd meticulousness, was inevitably created through lost books, vagaries of the postal services, police intervention and book-keeping errors. There were several thou- sand crowns left over after all this and I am pleased to have the chance to "account" for that rnoney publicly at last. Even as I write this, it occurs to me that I was intending to pay a few hundred crowns out as a bonus to the copyists - and I dread to think that I didn't in the end. It was probably in that year of 1979 that I star- ted to wind up the business as it then was. After discussions with friends , we spread the news that Petlice would continue to exist, but that respon- sibility for it would be gradually transferred to the authors thernselves - if they felt like assu- rning it. However, a centra I register would conti- nue to be kept. Anyone wanting to be included would have to subrnit copies of their work for the record. That explains why, from item 200 on- wards, there was a fall in the number of titles re- corded for a given year. This does not rnean that fewer works were written, only that we no longer knew about them all . Nor does it mean that we recorded works irrespective of their literary or documentary value. So what was and is Petlice? From the outset, it was intended as a means of helping preserve ma- nuscripts: by protecting and propagating them; by telling interested parties, particularly specia- [pageend46]lists, about new writings by well-known authors and about the new writing talents on the horizon. In these respects, Petlice differed from Kvart and Edice Expedice, which - from what I understood - sought only to serve a particular circle of rea- ders and had their own specific "publishing poli- cies". Petlice has provided source material for fu- ture study of our epoch, and not just its litera- ture. It has collected material for the purpose of future literary critics and historians, and for re- gular publication - when things get better. But most importantly, Petlice provided authors with an incentive and gave them a delivery date, not to mention some form of contact with critics and readers. What conceivably was its most valuable contribution, however, was something I never suspected at the outset: namely, that it would publicise our authors abroad and bring what was on offer here to the notice of Czech and foreign publishers there. It has come to my notice that a special survey is being prepared about how Czech and Slovak literature found its way a- broad. (I say Czech and Slovak, but tbe latter did not need our help to such an extent - for all I know. But it would be a good idea if someone qualified were to look into that aspect as well.) I see that the Documentation Centre's collec- tions.do not include all the titles in the Petlice list. Onll''the authors themselves can help fill the gaps. Not even I ever had them all. The missing ones are in the archives of the Ministry of the In- terior. I am confident that both collections will be successfully amalgamated one day. When Jiří Lederer - an avid collector of Petlice - was leaving Czechoslovakia, he gave me ten thou- sand crowns to send him books. How? Most of them he never received, even though I delivered them to the agreed address. The remaining two thousand crowns became part of the "working capital". Nowadays I assist Petlice only in so far as I am able and as the fancy takes me. This par- ticularly means in areas where I have a more per- sona! interest or where there is no one else to do the job. Its future development depends on the authors. * During my last house-search they took away every scrap of typescript save for Seiferťs Plague Column with Bauch's illustrations. I have dub- bed this boo k "the pretty prostitute". I once star- ted to write a piece about her, but the title caught their eye and I never finished it. The "pretty pro- stitute" is the one that the police pull in every time there is a raid but always have to release afterwards. And then she can ply her trade once more. I therefore "opened a file on her" (Appendix 5) which is what saved her on that occasion. When the investigator picked up the book, opened it and read what I had written , he just frowned and handed it back grudgingly. Some time later, lega) proceedings were initia- ted to decide whether they would return my con- fiscated property, or whether it would be forfei- ted. Such proceedings are always meant to take place. Most of the time they never do and the stuff just goes on gathering dust, as mine had for fifteen years - unlawfully ( as usu al). I made damned sure I was well and truly briefed. Some of the stuff I decided to relinquish outright. Some of it I considered imrnune from confisca- tion. And as for the remainder, I prepared a de- tailed plea, with explanations, persuasive argu- ments and a few lessons, as well as an emotional appeal to the jury. One of the books which was definitely unconfiscable according to law was a typescript of Seifert's Umbrella from Piccadilly: I took with meto the court a copy of the officially printed edition which had just been published! 45 [pageend47]In the Prosecutor's seat was an ... -I mean , a per- son of the female sex, whom someone less cir- cumspect would describe as an ugly old so-and- so. About ten times in the course of the procee- dings - in which she showed absolutely no inter- est - she took out a mirror and fiddled with her nondescript hair. When I held up the printed copy of Umbrella from Piccadilly, she said something like: "Printed materials are unobjec- tionable, but this one here is typewritten. " They didn't return me a thing - not even the inverted commas at the end. And the Supreme Court upheld the judgement. Rather than swearing, I consoled myself with the thought: Cuius regio, eius stupiditas. Appendices to the article by L. Vaculík are reprinted on pp. 46 and 103-106. CD L.

In those caseš where the record was compiled not on the basis of ori- ginaÍ Petlice editions but on other materials from our collec- tions this is indicated in the annotation. Where the serial number of a title is preceded by one or three asterisks (*E P, ***EP) this indicates that it is not available in any form in the Centre's collections. lnformation about these titles was obtained either from Ludvík Vacul ík or in exceptional cases from the authors themselves. Where items are mar- ked with a single asterisk (*EP), it indicates that we man- aged to obtain a complete description. lf there are three asterisks (**':'EP), it means that not even Ludvík Vaculík was able to ascertain more than the name of the author and the title. In those cases where Petlice editions were published in association with the Kvart series, or where they were origi- nally published as Kvart titles, the serial number is fo llowed by the letters KV (EP ... /KV). There are several places on the list where more than one bibliographical record is given for a single Petlice title. This either means that two distinct Petlice editions exist or that authors themselves arranged for a duplicate edition, and it was thought useful to draw attention to it (such as in the case of revised versions, instalment editions, variations in size, the inclusion of iJlustrations, etc.) . In compiling the individua! descriptions we adhered to customary bibliographical practice, while bearing in mind the peculiarities of samizdat publishing. We hope that bib- liographers will have understanding for the minor devia- tions from international rules which we considered expe- dient in some cases (e.g. not limiting headings to a single word, especially in the case of collections). The records were compiled on the basis of the edition as a whole, and not from the information on the title page alone. Particularly important for the description were the notes on the back of the title page; in Petlice books these are usually: (1) the date of publication, i.e. the year when the samizdat copy was made, and (2) details of copyright or al- ternatively, the so-called "copyright formula" characteri- stic of Petlice editions. Authors publishing in Petlice have considered it impor- tant for the date of completion of the manuscript to be recor- ded - usually on the title page - in cases when it differs from the "date of publication" . (This applies al most universally in samizdat publication. ) We have respected this practice throughout. The year of the m anu scrip ťs completion is given in round brackets in the title area- the fi rst part of the description preceding the oblique stroke (/) - immediately after the title or sub-title, in those cases where it differs from the date given in the publication area which indicates the year of publication. The place of publication is seldom given in Petlice edi- tions and accordingly the publication area in the bibliogra- phical record starts with the initials "S.I." (sine loco) . There is also, of course, nothing to record in that part of the publi- cation area normally reserved for the "name of publisher", so the colon is followed immediately by the "date of publi- cation" (i.e. when it was made public) taken either from the book itself or from the list verified by Ludvík Vaculík . In the physical description area the number of pages is followed by the dimensions of the publication. In most ca- ses this is AS (140mm x 210mm - with variations due to the binding technique). Less commonly it is A4 (210mm x 297mm). "Quarto" designates the format that results when an A4 sheet is shortened to make a square: the editions thus marked usually measure 210mm x 200-210mm. In all other cases the actual dimensions are specified. "Ill." denotes il- lustrations, such as photographs, the author's portrait, lino- cuts, etc. Where "ill. " is followed by a name in square brackets, this is the name of the artist or photographer. We have not recorded other data relevant to samizdat publishing, such as the type of binding, the signature of the author, compiler or publisher, and other details about the technical presentation of individua] editions (although they are recorded in the Documentation Centre's own catalo- gues) . With one exception they were all typescript editions, the exception being EP 146 which was reproduced calligra- phically. No other means of reproduction apart from the typewriter was used in any other case. The physical description is followed, in most cases, by an abbreviation consisting of the initial letters of the tongue- in-cheek "copyright formulae" mentioned earlier. As Lud- vík Vaculík explains in his introduction, the first of these was "V.z.d.o.r." (from the formula Výslovný zákaz dalšího 101 [pageend103]opisování rukopisu (further copying of thjs manuscript ex- pressly forbidden) . However with his inimitable sense of humour, Vaculík subsequently invented almost two dozen variants which more or less paraphrase the original mes- sage, from "J .d.o.z." = Jakékoliv další opisování zakázáno (Any further copying prohibited) to J.p.r.t.o. v.t.p.s.n. = Jakékoli písemné rozšiřování textů obsažených v této publi- kaci se nedovoluje (Ali written dissemjnation of texts con- tained in this publication is forbidden) . In some cases a par- ticular "workshop" is indicated by the words "Copied for friends by ... " or similar, which we reproduce in full. Where necessary, the strictly bibliographical data - i.e. pagination, illustrations, and the copyright formula - are followed on a new line by the titles of individua! sections of the work with, in most instances, page references (in round brackets) , and in certain cases the date when the individua! sections of the manuscript were completed, where this dif- fers from the publication date of the entire work. Additions were made to the bibliographical record only in the case of editions which have not appeared in print since, or which are not well known. However it was impossible to give de- tails of the contents of albums, almanachs and feuilleton collections. In the case of such works we restricted our- selves to recording in the notes as part of the annotations the number of contributions and authors. The annotations, which in principie are printed in square brackets on a new line, complete the description of each se- parate samizdat title. They consist of the briefest possible description of the work ( usually only the literary genre) to- gether with information on significant facts about the cir- cumstances of its creation or publication , and, where rele- vant, references to other related Petlice titles. Wherever the nature of an edition is evident from its sub-title no fur- ther description was thought necessary in the annotation. One would expect the annotation also to include details of a particular title's subsequent re-publication in samizdat. This was not possible, however, as computer records have yet to be made of all the Documentation's Centre's collec- tions. In all events, the recording of all existing copies is an impossible task. II. The annotated bibliographical record of the original sa- mizdat edition is followed, where applicable, by bibliogra- phical records of printed editions ofthe work, both in its ori- 102 ginal language and in translation . These details are printed in smaller type. The order in which these records are listed is based on considerations both of language and date of pu- blication. Publications in the original language are listed first, irrespective of chronology. Bibliographical entries of titles published by exile publish- ing houses were compiled from the computer record of the CSDC catalogue and checked against the records kept by Ludmila Šeflová. As far as published translations are con- cerned , for the most part we had no option but to rely on Ludmila Šeflová's records since the translations section of the Documentation Centre library is still rather limited. As regards exile journals, it was only possible to scan the major periodicals such as Proměny, Rozmluvy, Studie and Svědectví, and then only cursorily. (It is a well-known fact that nowhere in the world is any bibliographical record kept of articles in Czech and Slovak magazines published abroad) . For reasons of space, the bibliographical record of titles published in print does not repeat the heading, so that each record starts with the title area. The Latin expression I dem is used to indicate that the title area and the "statement of responsibility" area are identical with the bibliographical record preceding it. Regrettably, only in exceptional instances it was possible to provide notes about publications in print. It would doubtless be extremely useful to literary historians if the notes indicated the extent to which the printed version cor- respond to the original samizdat edition, or what relation they bear to each other. However this would mean creating a complete collection of printed translations. In the case of theatre, TV and radio plays, it would cer- tainly make sense to include the date and place of the first performance as well. This also will have to remain a deside- ratum for the time being until all data has been filed on the computer. There is one matter that requires a separate explanation, namely, the question of the serial numbers used in the Pet- lice catalogue. The numbers on the list, from EP 001 to EP 367 do not actually appear in any of the editions, in the same way that none of them is marked as "Edice Petlice" or "Petlice" . (Other samizdat series, such as Expedice and Česká expedice add their "imprint" to their editions to- [pageend104]gether with the a serial number which is assigned to a title even before work starts on copying the manuscript.) was finalised in the course of telephone conversations with Ludvík Vaculík in February this year. * Ali earlier lists of Petlice boo ks were compiled retrospec- tively, a year or more after their publication. For this rea- son, the listed order does not always tally exactly with the actual order of publication. Only Ludvík Vaculík is in a po- sition to provide a reliable account of how it was done. Concerning the translation of the Petlice list for the Eng- The list of titles numbered 201-367 was compiled as a def- initive version especially for this present publication and lish version of ACTA, please note that only the entry for the original samizdat edition and the annotations in square brackets are translated; bibliographical records of printed editions are given in the original language . c U DV iK VACU L I K VcL :TRZN I 21 - 170 00 PRAHA 7 V Pra ze dne Pan / paní/ Věc: vyú č továni _____ autorského honor áře Vážený / á/ pane /paní/ I Na základě naší doho~ provedli jsme předběžnou prezentaci Vašeho díla před jeho řádným přiměřeným zveřejněním v neurčené bu- doucnosti a ve smyslu nouzových přátelských zvyklosti nahrazujících suspendované slušné předpisy podáváme Vám tímto vyúčtováni Vašeho autorsKého honoráře: A.

Code initiated on 7th January 1977 under Art.160, para .1 of the Pena I Code ITISRULED that in accordance with Art.80 para.l of the Pena! Code, the following property confiscated during a house-search on 6th January 1977 is being returned to Ludvík VACULÍK, b. 23.7.1926 in Brumov, residing at Veletržní 21 , Prague 7. 1) Item No. 31 - two pieces: -one linen-bound manuscript ofTHE PLAGUE COLUMN by J .SEIFERT - one manuscript: THE HOOFS by L. V A CULÍK in a black binder together with loose pages - related to the said manuscript (second page) Also returned to Ludvík Vaculík was a black suitcase lent during the house-search for the purpose of transporting the documents. Grounds: During the house-search carried out on 6.1.1977 at the home of Ludvík V A CULÍK, the above-mentioned articles were among property confiscated in accordance with Art. 99 of the Penal Code and recorded in the relevant sec- tion of the report of the house-search. Investigation has shown that this property is clearly not needed for the en- quiry, nor does it have any immediate bearing on the matter under investigation. Conditions are accordingly fulfilled for its return . Other written material impounded during the search is currently being assessed pending a decision on it. It is therefore ruled as per action taken. Note: Appeals against this ruling may be lodged within three days of notification. (Art.80 para.3 of the Pena!

This independent initiati ve is worth y of mention, at the very least. The organizers would also undoubtedly welcome a response from authors living abroad. We are printing the text of the leaflet in full. We are pleased to announce announce the open- ing of a competition for a one-off prize in honour of the eminent Russian Christian philosopher Vladimir Soloviev and in conjuction with the millenial celebrations of the coming of the Christian faith to Russia. The competition is open to anyone submitting by 20th June this year an essay, poem, dissertation or musical work connected with the theme of "Russia and Chris- tianity" which may be interpreted broadly or monographically. Essays or dissertations should not exceed 20 typewritten pages. Those submit- ting poetry or musical composition may chaose any form they please. It is assumed that literary works will be submitted in the Czech or Slovak languages. The winner ofthe competition will be awarded a prize of 3,000 Czech crowns on 30th June and, if possible, their work will be publis- hed. Indeed we are not excluding the possibility of publishing all contributions in the form of an album, or in some other way. The aim of the competition is to promote crea- tive spiritual activity in conjunction with this mo- mentous anniversary in Russian and European history, which is all the more significant at a time when efforts in favour of moral and social renewal in the Eastern European countries are growing in amplitude. All contributions sent or preferably delivered in person to the competi- tion organisers will be carefully assessed and the result will be announced on 27th June 1988.
