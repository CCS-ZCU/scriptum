SOKOL HALL TELEPHONE *15- 3*7-2033 CALIF 94401 PENINSULA INFORMATION 415- W-5015 Ročník-Volume XVII June-July, 1985 Číslo-Number 6 Strana-1 XIX SOKOL USA SLET All of the Mass Calisthenics to be performed at the 1983 Pittsburg Slet include narrations. Soon several of our San Francisco Sokol members will be departing for the Slet, and they have been drilling every Friday evening learning the Calisthenic Drill in order to participate. We feel that by publishing these narrations, we can all share in a small way the Slet Experience. Junior Calisthenic Narration: This great Sokol event is a tine of celebration; a time to enjoy and demonstrate all that we have accomplished. We, the Sokols of North America, pledge to remain faithful to the ideals of Tyrs. We will continue to work toward the goals of freedom, fitness, and fraternity. We accept and cherish these Sokol ideals which have been passed on to us. Ne promise to carry them in our hearts and minds; for these qualities will truly prepare us for our future endeavors. Senior Calisthenic Narration: Today, Sokol exists only in countries of the free world. No longer can we return to the land of our forefathers to participate in Sokol. Instead, we can only pay tribute to what began in Czechoslovakia 121 years ago. From America, home of the free, we will continue to honor the birthplace of Sokol; for we know that the Sokol idea, although surpressed, will never die there. Today, we Sokols assembled here in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania proudly pay tribute to Czechoslovakia, the birthplace of Sokol. We will celebrate our Nation's birthday on the week-end of the Slet, and it is a wonderful idea to include a pledge to our Sokol Ideals. [pageend1]Strana Page 2 Sokol San Francisco Věstník June-July, 198J Educational Corner SOKOL - The Sokol body is an educational organization. Its aim is to train and preserve the nation in physical, mental and moral strength. It concerns itself with both body and mind never losing sight of the two. The Chief means of attaining the desired goal is physical training. The Sokol system of physical training is built upon the following principals: A harmonious development of the organs of movement, a full utilization of all the organs and all vital capacities; correct muscular coordination which is to be attained by control of the muscular system. The Sokol physical training aims at beauty of movement, and endeavors to cultivate physical beauty.. The physical training aims at effects from an intellectual point of view, for it is regarded by the Sokol as inseparable from the physical. It is designed to sharpen the senses, to cultivate the power of memory and correct judgment, to teach skill, readiness, presence of mind, to cultivate courage. Sokol physical training includes regard for the moral side, for moral duties are the foundation of a moral character. It is a matter of cultivating moral qualities which may be acquired directly by physical drills, such as self-control, stamina, courage, and perseverance. These moral duties are, for example: self-command, punctuality, reliability, and regard for others. Therefore, equality, freedom, discipline and morality are the first important elements of the Sokol idea. The second, is the endeavor to work for the welfare of the Sokol. Such work to be done voluntarily, of their own free will, submitting themselves to all that the Sokol asks of them - mainly self-discipline which should be displayed by all. The training, therefore, teaches individuals their duties not only to themselves, but also toward the nation as a whole—and to all mankind. Sokol So. Omaha - I AM THE NATION I was born on July 4, 1776, and the Declaration of Independence is my birth certificate. The bloodlines of the world run in my veins, because I offered freedom to the oppressed. I am many things, and many people. I am the nation. I am 195 million living souls — and the ghost of millions who have lived and died for me. I am Nathan Hale and Paul Revere. I stood at Lexington and fired the shot heard around the world. I am Washington, Jefferson and Patrick Henry. I am John Paul Jones, the Green Mountain Boys and Davy Crockett. I am Lee and Grant and Abe Lincoln. I remember the Alamo, the Maine and Pearl Harbor. When freedom called I answered and stayed until it was over, over there. I left my heroic dead in Flanders Fields, on the rock of Corregidor, on the bleak slopes of Korea and in the steaming jungle of Viet Nam. I am the Brooklyn Bridge, the wheat lands of Kansas and the granite hills of Vermont. I am the cornfields of the Virginias and Pennsylvania. I am Independence Hall, the Monitor and the Merrimac. I am big. I sprawl from the Atlantic to the Pacific .. . my arms reach out to embrace Alaska and Hawaii ... 3 million square miles throbbing with industry. I am more than 5 million farms. I am forest, field, mountain and desert. I am quiet villages — and cities that never sleep. You can look at me and see Ben Franklin walking down the streets of Philadelphia with his breadloaf under his arm. You can see Betsy Ross with her needle. You can see the lights of Christmas, and hear the strains of "auld Lang Syne” as the calendar turns. I am Babe Ruth and the World Series, I am 130,000 schools and colleges, and 320,000 churches where my people worship God as they think best. I am a ballot dropped in a box,| the roar of a crowd in a stadium and the voice of the choir in a cathedral. I am an editorial in a newspaper and a letter to a Congressman. I am Eli Whitney and Stephen Foster. I am Tom Edison, Albert Einstein and Billy Graham. I am Horace Greeley, Will Rogers and the Wright brothers. I am George Washington Carver, Daniel Webster and Jonas Salk. I am Longfellow, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Walt Whitman and Thomas Paine. Yes, I am the nation, and these are the things that I am. I was conceived in freedom and, God willing, in freedom I will spend the rest of my days. May I possess always the integrity, the courage and the strength to keep myself unshackled, to remain a citadel of freedom and a beacon of hope to the world. This is my wish, my goal, my prayer in this year of 1973 ---- one hundred and ninety-seven years after I was born. Reprinted from "The Volunteer" [pageend2]June-July, 198? Sokol San Franc,isco Věstník______ Strana Page 3 EDITORIAL President's message as delivered at the St. Louis Sokol Anniversary meeting in February, 1983. This is my message to you - Sokol Needs You - There is no hidden meaning, no pearls of wisdom. Simply - Sokol cannot exist without you ~ its members and your involvement and committment to its ideals. Too often we diffuse the responsibility of committee work oh'. He'll do it'. It's easier to say I can't, I don't have the time than I'll give it a try'. We are in the midst of the "ME" generation - we all cry for fulfillment, satisfaction of our ego, growth in our own idividualism, nourishing our self image and spirit - but is this pursuit of "ME" compatible with the Sokol spirit of togetherness, responsibility, brotherhood and fraternalism. I dare say - it is not harmonious with the ideals of our Sokol founders. We must lay aside our own pleasures and bend to the call of our Sokol organization. Our unit cannot remain at a standstill, it must take its rightful place among the progressive viable units in the ASO. Let us give something of value that other units can admire, cherish and imitate. Will we give into apathy, selfishness, disinterest and complacency? Brothers and Sisters - take up the challenge while building the future for our younger generations - we are preserving the past which has witnessed the devotion and dedication of many tired hands - at Sokol functions - picnics, gym exhibitions, dances, Sokol classes. Let these tired hands rest. I am addressing you on whom the future calls, Sokol needs you. Congratulations to all past and present Sokols who valiantly and tirelessly contribute month after month, year after year, and yes generation after generation of service. My appeal is to those who call themselves Sokols but do not really live the motto, who only pay lip service to our Sokol banner, who use but never repay. Many privileges prevail.... Those privileges demand responsibility. Response to committees is lost, once it was thought to be a rare privilege and real vote of confidence to be named to a committee, but unfortunately we've lost that pride, now we call it drudgery, one more meeting to attend, one more dance to give, one more job to get out of the way. The decision to participate lies with you. Turn not your backs on that which our forefathers carved out for us. Take your place along side Fuegner, Tyrš, Erben, Prochaska. Attend meetings, join our committees, attend classes, grow as a real Sokol, in brotherhood, fraternalism, and cooperation. Sokol Needs You and Wants You'. You have an important place in it's future. Ku předu'. Ku Předu'. Spatky Ni Krok'. Nazdar - by Stephen Jerabek, President, Sokol St. Louis ..... Among the privileges listed were free camping facilities, a spacious ball park, a beautiful pool, the use of an excellent hall and gym. BOY - don't I wish we could list just a small part of those privileges for our Sokol Unit. PERHAPS we could if we all tried to do as Br. Jerabek of Sokol St. Louis suggests.

SAD NEWS "We were saddened to learn last week of the death of one of our most valuable members. Someone Else. Someone Else's passing creates a vacancy that will be hard to fill. Else has been with us for many years and every one of those years, Someone Else did far more than a normal person's share of the work Whenever leadership was mentioned, this wonderful person was looked to for inspiration as well as results. “Someone Else can work with that group.' Whenever there was a job to do, one name was on everyone's list. 'Someone Else will do it.' It was common knowledge that Someone Else was always the one the organization relied upon to support a particular project. Everyone just assumed that Someone Else would provide what was needed. Someone Else was a wonderful person — sometimes appearing superhuman, but a person can only do so much. Were the truth known, everyone expected too much of Someone Else. Now Someone Else is gone. We wonder what we are going to do? Someone Else left a wonderful example to follow, but who is going to follow it? WHO is going to do the things that Someone Else did? When you have a chance to participate in the Association's activities, REMEMBER— we cannot depend on Someone Else any more."

Have you ever tried to teach a Sokol Gym class in that same room? Isn't it time to move the card tables and pool tables into that Club Room, and move the apparatus out? We could do it IF we had a nice, big, new gymnasium. SOKOL BROTHERS AND SISTERS - THINK ABOUT IT!!! Your vacation is a good time to TAKE TIME for reflection. Askyourself theBig Three: (1) What are my goals? (2) Is my job taking me toward them? (3) What else can I do? It's the "what else" question that causesus worry because, in times of high unemployment, changing jobs may not be an option. Perhaps a business of your oWn is the best way to achieve your goals—one you can develop gradually without leaving the security of your present job. That’s howyour Amway distributor answered his own "what else"... why don't you ask him how it's working out! * * * * Tuck small, soft items inside your shoes, tl en pack the shoes opposite the hancle of the suitcase to prevent thei. shining when the suitcase is carried. » At the time President Sister Duffey asked me to help out by doing the Sokol Vestnik this month, I thought I was just doing Br. Bursik a favor by taking one responsibility off his mind. Now that I have heard the sad news of his death, I sit here before the typewriter trying to think of words to express our sincerest sympathy to all of the family. Dear Sisters, you MUST know that we all extend our condolences and reach out to you with our love. MEM To oister Bess Walker, we extend our deepest sympathy at the death of her son, John Walker. Fold clothing so that one garment is cushioned in the folds of another or line the folds with tissue paper to prevent wrinkling. Roll lingerie, sleepwear, and sweaters; then put them at the bottom of the suitcase near the middle.

[pageend6]Continuing the History of Sokol By the fatal shooting at Sarajevo, the seedling planted by Tyra ripened towards harvesting. The minute Austria attacked the brotherly Serbian nation, even the simplest among the Sokol's ranks realized his proper position. The fifty years of Sokol training and upbringing towards democracy and active patriotism was manifested in the spontaneous decisions of rank and file individuals without any commands or directions from above. The Sokol brothers joined their military units wearing Sokol badges and documents and determined not to shoot the enemy, but to desert at the earliest opportunity and join the real allies. Brother Smutný, president of the Sokol in Paris, was sitting the day of the assassination watching the performance of the French gymnasts. When the news of the assassination was announced the French minister sitting next to Smutný asked him whs* will the Sokols do in case of war. He received a quick ready reply:"We will go with France." And as a matter of fact the first day when war was declared the total male membership of the Paris Unit joined the voluntary ranks with the Sokol banner carried at the head of the marchers. Professor T.G. Masaryk was well aware of the Sokol tbi r>- king while deciding on open struggle against Austria. His first step led him to Dr. Scheiner, president of the Czech Sokol Organization, and he declared, "I am figuring first of all with Sokols. 1 know them and am depending on them." In response to this Dr. Scheiner offered immediately the total assistance of all Sokols, and even some of his and the Sokol's monetary funds. Later in his memoirs Masaryk recalled that this offer was the first monetary contribution to the resistance. In the ensuing resistance both Masaryk and Beneá continued to maintain their Sokol contacts, at that time the only means of keeping in touch with Czechs and their friends abroad. This applied especially to the French gymnasts who knew us from the previous Sokol visits and Slots and who performed most valuable services during the revolution. Likewise in the United States the Sokol units and individual Sokol workers stood at all times at the head of the resistance movement, among those who supported our struggle financially. The resistance at home went hand in hand simultaneously with the resistance in foreign lands. In the Sokol units, by now deprived of most of their younger men, it was the older brothers and sisters who maintained the gymnastic activity. They knew that by so doing they were training the youth in anti-Au- strian spirit, and were able to perpetuate among its members their resistance against the government. Where they were unable to speak out they resorted to expressing their spirit of resistance by Pospisil's revolutionary songs. Since at that time there was no radio broadcasting, the Sokols kept busy rewriting end distributing anti-Austrian fliers and reports about Masaryk's activities in foreign lands. Brother Slavomir Kratochvíl of Přerov was executed by a firing squad for his role in this activity. This open behaviour of the Sokols did not escape the attention of the Austrian authorities. The Moravian governor Bleyleben pointed out to the ministry of interior that the ^°“ kols were the most dangerous element within the monarchy and Continued on next page [pageend7]Continued from previous page — that it was working toward the defeat and destruction of the government. Many of the Sokols were imprisoned, among them Dr.Scheiner at the very moment when he was preparing to flee from the country. The authorities made a direct demand upon the Sokol to issue a public declaration condemning Professor Masaryk’s activity and the entire resistance. When the Sokol executive committee refused to obey this order, the Czech Sokol community was dissolved November 24, 19^5 and its official publication "Věstník sokolský1* was forced to discontinue. But the Sokol activity continued. The Unit^ were not dissolved thanks to the wise suggestions of the ČOS officials that the Sokol halls be used as military hospitals. By this foresight the Sokol halls escaped confiscation, and our wounded soldiers found therein friendly, kind surroundings. Thus the army hospitals became valuable connection between the battle front and the resistance at home. Brother Jan Pelikan took over privately to replace the discontinued "Věstník" by his own publication "Tělocvičný obzor". The foremost leaders in the organization even though deprived of their official roles, persecuted by repeated searches and interrogations in their homes, continued to visit the district committees meetings. Thus they were able to disseminate suggestions for various anticipated events. Brilliant testimony was given to the Sokol in the dissolution proclamation of the Austrian minister of the interior. In this document he stated that the Czech Sokol Organization was suspected of associating with the American Sokol, and further that " ... before the War it supported brotherly attitudes towards Russia and Serbia, the consequences of which can first be clearly evident during the war with these two countries." The verdict ended with the declaration that the continued existence of the Czech Sokol Community is seen as obviously dangerous to the monarchy. The Sokol and the Sokol ideal were expressed most convincingly in the formation of the legions. (5) The first such voluntary unit was the "Na Zdar" company with members of the Paris Sokol forming its very core. One half of these Sokols together with their commander and standard-bearer met their deaths fighting side by side with the French just as they had always pledged to do during the Slets . On all the battle fronts the Sokols were gaining volunteers and were organizing and training the legions . In Italy this situation went so far that the prisoners first formed Sokol units before joining the foreign legions. Thus they were able to give the legions a firm dependable foundation. The Sokol gave the legions the spirit. Masaryk himself testifies to this saying, "In addition to the Hussite and Taborite traditions, it was the Sokol ideal that led us on, the Sokol discipline and order which the individuals knew so well and to which they yielded so readily and which became their second nature. This Sokol spirit penetrated into the victorious army." Among those who affirmed the genuineness of their Sokol ideal by sacrificing their lives, are many examples of heroism which dare not be forgotten.
