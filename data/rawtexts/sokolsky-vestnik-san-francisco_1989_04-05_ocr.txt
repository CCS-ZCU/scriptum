SOKOLSKY VĚSTNÍK Bulletin of Gymnastic Association Sokol San Francisco 847 North San Mateo Drive San Mateo, CA 94401 Sokol Hall: 415-347-2033 VOLUME XXIII - JULY, AUGUST, SEPT., OCT., 1989 - ISSUES 4 A 5 CELEBRATING OUR 85TH YEAR — FOUNDED 1904 - 1989 EXCERPTS OF REMARKS BY ROMAN L. HRUŠKA JUNE 22 1989 - XVII SOKOL SLET OMAHA, NEBRASKA ! Your Excellency Governor Orr Brother Basta, President of ASO Members and Friends of Sokols At the request of Co-Chairmen Gary Masek and Walt Bures, it is my privilege to extend greetings to participants and visitors of the Seventeenth American Sokol Slet. The Omaha community is highly favored and happy to be its host., For Victoria and myself, it brings stirring recollections of similar occasions which extend over four decadess Chicago, Berwyn, St. Louis, Los Angeles, Mew York, and Washington. We are proud that Omaha is now added to the list. When the Sokol Idea was organized 1E5 years ago, Bohemia was a vassal state of an autocratic and oppressive empire. For some three centuries starting about the year 1300, it had been a mighty, independent, powerful and advanced nations. Founds of Sokol subscribed to the fact that a nation is its people. They envisioned an organization to develop the strength and spirit of the country's population. Not only in personal physical strength, but also mentally, morally, and spirititually;...and to abide by these quantities in their daily lives. The idea was to make those people qualitifed and worthy of freedom and liberty.

It is fully applicable to our Republic. Iwo hundred years ago, we gained our independence. Our founders clearly recognized that a nation is it s people. rhey started out with the words: "WE the People.... etc. do ordain and publish this Constitution." T h e t h r u s t o f t h o s e w o r d s i s f o r c e f u 1 a n d that a Nation is its people. Further, opening words: WE THE PEOPLE, all of us words to say: demanding:...They mean when we consider these should dedicate those I, as one of WE the People, have the personal duty and respo ns ibi 1ity of developing and maintaining myself in such fashion as will advance the goals of our Const itut ion: freedom, liberty, just i ce for each and e v e r y o n e o f u s — prese n t a n d f u t u r e .. Sokol stands as one of the many fine, voluntary organizations in our nation which seeks to do its part. Pres ident Basta, to you and your fellow officers, to the uni ts and their leaders — our best wishes to all for the future. NA ZDAR! SOKOL. SLET REPORT The thrill is always there! Four members from Sokol San Francisco participated in the Sokol Slet held in Omaha, Nebraska this June, and once again it was a memorable occasion. We see our Sokol friends perhaps once every four years? sometimes even less often than that, but still we remain Sokol brothers and sisters through the years. We had a great crowd and each group who participated seemed to get a greater crowd response than the previous group. The Indian Club drill was spectacular, and of course the precious children, juniors, and ...... .EVERYONE ............. .. . SPECTACULAR..............!!! Marla Meier joined the Mass Calisthenics with Sokol members from Fresno and Los Angeles. Mary Frances Meier did the drill with the folks from Florida, and Blanche Duffey and Helen Mikus drilled with yet another group. BUT it was the whole effect of all participants doing their part to make the Slet so wonderful. The Banquet was wonderful and the Czech Festival was interesting and entertaining. The Sock Hop was a success, and even the weather added to the excitement by lighting up the sky with lightning ’fireworks’ and tremendous 'booms’ of thunder. ror those of us from California it was quite thrilling. For local people it was relief from the drought. Now that sounds familiar doesn't it? ANYONE FOR FRANCE IN 1990? [pageend2]SOKOL SAN FRANCISCO VĚSTNÍK JULY-AUGUST, SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER PAGE 3 Editor’s Note: The article below appeared on the front page of our most recent ASO Věstník, We are reprinting it with the most ardent hope that our Sokol members and friends will take the message it conveys to heart.. During the past Few months harmful rumors and personal attacks have been prevalant. This is causing heartache and failure when what we are s t r i v in g for is s urv i v a 1 o f o u r un i t a nd gro w t h in the future through continued support from our faithful few to additional support from our old members and hopefully new members. Other Sokol Units throughout the USA are taking in new members every month. The opportunity for Sokol growth exists. We must all work together as true Sokol Brothers and Sisters., We must give future members something to look forward to in their life with Sokol. Sokol is a way of life. Practice it every day! The Sokol Spirit As one season moves into the next, we move in to the future confident that the future is ours to shape, to influence, to command. We want to be Sokol champions in every sense of the word, to champion the cause of freedom, justice, and equality for all. We search our consciousness to speak words of honest praise for our brothers and sisters instead of whispers of unfounded criticism, and vow to always rejoice in their accomplishments on their journey to reach for the higher self. We ask, "Can I, this day and each day hereafter, be a model of positive aspirations through positive thinking and ask my brothers and sisters, "How can I help you reach your goal'?!” A single act of kindness can move mountains.

His father was a very hard-worker but it was his mother who was the true pillar of strength giving the whole family moral support during the crucial vimes of depression in the new dawn of the Czechoslovak Republic.

His activities were plentiful with regular gymnastic attendance, dancing the Česka Beseda, dinner- dances, volleyball, Slets, picnics, stage shows, and more. One of his most cherished and proud activity was the annual Chevron picnic which gave him the opportunity to bring together all of his friends and Sokol members. For 28 years, without interruption, Jarka conducted these memorable picnics. In his heart, he was giving us the feeling of our "Old Country so that w» could enjoy and'refresh the customs and traditions we grew up with and the love of freedom for which all of us sacrificed so m u c h . Jarka loved travelling and the tragedy struck when Jarka and Jindra were returning home to California after four months in Europe and Africa.'

SOKOL NEW YORK NEWSLETTER Editorial June, 1989 I have been a member of Sokol New York for four years. Since I joined Sokol, I learned about Sokol, about Sokol history and Sokol tradition. Knowing abut Sokol made me experience many things that I wouldnever had dreamed of. Through these four years, ± met many people and made many friends. Today I know that these friends I have met will be my friends forever, and they are my Sokol family. J y I learned discipline and physical and mental awareness. Through this I believe I am a better person. Sokol inspired and helped me so much that it will help me to succeed at the University of Syracuse, where I intend to study. Not only did it help me with my school and outlook on life, but Sokol introduced me to people of Czechoslovak origin and also people from different parts of the country, different color and creed. I wanted to be a gymnast, and Mike suggested I join Sokol. I have fulfilled my ambition, and acceptance of myself and others. I am a proud Sokol member, and I will continue with the dedication, because I want to help others too. I shall volunteer my time to instruct and inspire new members, because this comes from my heart. I am entering the University of Syracuse and thank Sokol for making me aware of myself in my personal and academic endeavors. Thank vou. Nazdar!

We remember Shirley Temple as the "Little Darling of America" and everybody’s sweetheart in the 1940s. Since those days she has become seriously interested in politics — Richard Nixon appointed her Representative to the United Nations and she has served as Ambassador in Ghana. She now returns to Czechoslovakia as Ambassador appointed by President Bush. A few years ago some of us had the opportunity of meeting her at a ceremony in Golden Gate Park at the Masaryk Monument, and we found her to be charming and delightful. She still holds a warm spot in OUR hearts, and make no mistake, she has a very warm spot in HER heart for Czechoslovakia and its people. ■ EUROPE Chronicle Wire Services Banned playwright Vaclav Havel, a symbol of dissent in Czechoslovakia, was paroled for good behavior yesterday midway through an eight-month jail sentence. Havel’s arrest during demonstrations in January prompted protests in the West and among Hungarian, Polish and Soviet intellectuals. It marked the beginning of a ci ■. kdown on dissent that conflicted with reforms under way elsewhere m the Soviet bloc. Havel was sentenced February 22 to nine months on charges of incitement and obstructing a police officer. In March, an appeals court reduced the sentence to eight months, dropping the obstruction charge. Jiri Wolf, a leader of the Charter 77 human rights movement, who spent six years in prison for subversion. also was freed yesterday. Wolf ba<i parole and served his full term Polka: A Reader's Impassioned Response A San Francisco man who wishes to remain anonymous has written to Personals about a recent item describing Polish American outrage at a recent Coors beer ad in which the polka was bashed. The polka, says the complainant, is from Czechoslovakia. “Polka has nothing in common with Poland!” The origins of the dance: “Anna Slezák, a farm servant at Elbs- teinitz near Prague, invented the polka about 1830. The room in ’ which she was accustomed to dance being of small dimensions, the movements of her feet were short, and so the dance, that is, the half dance.” The reader goes on to note that the Czech word “pulka” means half, a fact confirmed by the Czechoslovakian Embassy yesterday. “Why Poland—Polka?” he asks. “Barrel-polka is from Czech composer!” Hold on there, sir. Webster’s Third New International Dictionary says that the word “polka” is derived from the feminine of the word Polak, which means Pole. The derivation of “polka dot” is still, however, a mystery. An Unlikely Hobby In a Strange Place Czechoslovakia, of all places, is the world's capital of chewing and bubble gum wrapper collectors. The London Independent estimates that there are 25,000 to 30,000 col lectors out of a population of 15.6 million. The Czechs are such avid collectors that the world’s gum makers consider them pests because they mail tom of requests for mint-condi- Hon u rappers. Czechs Confiscate Dissidents' Passports Vienna Czechoslovak authorities confiscated tne passports of more than 20 dissidents, including former Foreign Minister Jiri Hajek, who said on a Scandinavian visit that reform in his country is too slow, emigre sources said yesterday. Hajek served as foreign minister during the 1968 “Prague Spring” reform period that was crushed by Soviet troops. . . , . „ 1 Associated Press [pageend8]SOKOL.. SAN FRANCISCO VESTNIK JULY-AUGUST, SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER PAGE 9 Sister Bevc attended the recent Slet in Omaha although she did not participate in the calisthenics. She did participate with us in Vienna, and through 80 some odd years been active in Sokol commuting all the way from Napa to learn the drills. LADISLAV J. BEVC V městě Ventura v Kalifornii ve Spojených státech opustil v úterý 29. listopadu 1988 navždy naši sokolskou rodinu vzácný a ušlechtilý člověk, zasloužilý dlouholetý představitel sokolstva, čestný starosta Jugoslávského Sokola ve svobodném světě, bratr Ladislav J. Bevc. Bratr Bevc se dožil požehnaného věku 98 let; narodil 8. srpna 1890 ve Skoji- canu na Krškem Polju v Slovinsku, studoval na reálce a na vysoké škole technické v Lublani, kde r. 1913 dosáhl titulu stavebního inženýra. První světovou válku prožil na bojištích v Rusku, ve Francii a v Itálii, po válce byl jugoslávskou vládou pověřen vypracováním plánu a dohledem nad provedením výstavby silniční sítě nového jugoslávského státu. Bratr Ladislav J. Bevc s manželkou v listopadu 1985. Byl uznávaným odborníkem ve stavebnictví, přednášel v tomto oboru na technické fakultě lublaňské university, byl předsedou sdružení inženýrů a architektů, předsedou stavebního odboru města Lublaně, předsedou spolku stavebních akademiků, předsedou družstva pro postavení pomníku králi Petru 1., a předsedou družstva pro postavení pomníku králi Alexandru I. Ve své veřejné činnosti byl m.j. členem předsednictva Slovinské demokratické strany, předsedou Aeroklubu a předsedou sdružení záložních důstojníků. V Sokole působil od svého mládí; v lublaňské jednotě "Tábor" byl členem výboru, v r. 1929 byl zvolen starostou jednoty jímž byl až do r. 1941, kdy nacistická okupace ukončila sokolskou činnost v Jugoslávii. Od r. 1929 byl členem předsednictva Sokolské župy Lublaňské, v r. 1930 zvolen župním vzdělavatelem, v r. 1936 župním místostarostou a v r. 1939 byl zvolen do vrcholného orgánu jihoslovanského sokolstva, do výboru Svazu Sokola Království Jugoslávie. Zasloužil se o vybudování krásné sokolovny jednoty "Tábor" v Lublani, pro níž vypracoval návrh a podrobné plány a na jejíž stavbu dohlížel. Budova slouží ještě dnes, více než 60 let po její výstavbě, svému účelu a patří k okrasným budovám města. Po obsazení Jugoslávie nacisty, působil významně v odboji proti okupantům, byl důstojníkem v "Sokolské legii", jež byla součástí jugoslávské armády vedené gen. Drago Mihajlovičem a která bojovala s německými a italskými okupanty, musela ale také čelit komunistickým partyzánským oddílům; v té době redigoval také ilegální sokolský časopis "Naprej zastava Slave". Vzletech 1942-1944 byl, v hodnosti majora, členem vojenského velitelství města Lublaně a pak, do konce války, velitelem jugoslávské odbojové armády pro oblast Slovinska. Continued on Page 10 [pageend9]SOKOL 3AN FRANCISCO VESTNIK J ULY-AUGUST, SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER PAGE iq 1 Bevc - Continued from Page -9- Po válce komunisté nedovolili obnovu Sokola v Jugoslávii, ostře pronásledovali bývalé sokolské činovníky, zejména příslušníky "Sokolské legie", a bratr Bevc byl jedním z terčů jejich nenávisti vůči představitelům demokratických organizací. Byl zatčen a odsouzen k trestu smrti, podařilo se mu však uniknout do Itálie, kde prožil několik let v uprchlických táborech. Když se' podařilo také jeho manželce Ivance (rovněž nadšené sokolce a župní náčelnici ve Splitu) opustit Jugoslávii, emigrovali do Spojených států, do Kalifornie, kde byl bratr Bevc zaměstnán u stavební firmy Basalt Rock Co. Inc. v městě Napa. V Americe pokračoval bratr Bevc ve své veřejné činnosti a v úsilí o obnovu svobody a demokracie v Jugoslávii; od r. 1950 byl předsedou Slovinské demokratické strany v zahraničí. Ihned po příchodu do Spojených států navázal styk s bývalými činovníky Sokola v Americe, v Argentině a v dalších zemích a zahájil s nimi přípravy k ustavení organizace jugoslávského sokolstva v zahraničí. Výsledkem těchto snah bylo v r. 1965 založení 'Jugoslávského Sokola ve svobodném světě1; v prvních letech, kdy hlavní činovníci této organizace byli v Argentině, byl členem předsednictva, v r. 1975, když většina činovníků sídlila již v USA, byl zvolen starostou. V této funkci vedl delegaci svobodného Jugoslávského sokolstva na IV. sletu Cs. sokolstva v zahraničí r. 1976 v Curychu a r. 1982 na V.-Jubilejním sletu ve Vídni; vedl svobodné jugoslávské sokolstvo také na sletech amerického sokolstva, Americké obce sokolské a Slovenské tělocvičné jednoty Sokol v USA. Rozvíjel také bohatou činnost publikační četnými články a úvahami zejména ve věstníku Jugoslávského Sokola ve svobodném světě a napsal také několik článků do našeho věstníku. Když koncem roku 1985 počal churavět, požádal o zproštění ze své starostenské funkce; za své zásluhy byl zvolen čestným starostou Jugoslávského Sokola ve svobodném světě. Bratr Bevc byl nadšeným vyznavačem Tyršovy sokolské myšlenky a upřímným zastáncem vzájemnosti slovanských národů, zejména přátelství mezi národy Jugoslávie a Československa. Stál proto také v popředí snah o vytvoření Svazu sokolstva ve svobodném světě; když byl 1. ledna 1980 svaz ustaven, byl zvolen jeho místostarostou, v letech 1985-1987 byl jeho starostou. Předsednictvo Ústředí čs. sokolstva v zahraničí v uznání jeho celoživotní práce pro Sokol v Jugoslávii a v zahraničí, udělilo mu v r. 1987 medaili Ústředí, kterou na zasedání Svazu sokolstva ve svobodném světě na XX. sletu Slovenské tělocvičné jednoty Sokol v USA ve Washingtonu, převzala tam za něj jeho manželka, sestra Ivanka Bevcová. Bratr Bevc si této pocty velmi vážil a před svou smrtí vyslovil přání, aby medaile byla položena na jeho srdce a byla s ním pochována. V bratru Bevcovi ztratil Sokol vzácného pokračovatele díla, které v Jugoslávii představovali vzácní vedoucí činovníci svobodného jugoslávského Sokola v čele s bratrem Ganglem, a který se svou vynikající činností čestně zařadil mezi pokračovatele jejich odkazu v zahraničí spolu s bratry Jazbecem, Mačusem, Grdjicem a Drčarem. Odešel v něm dobrý a ušlechtilý člověk, statečný bojovník za svobodu a demokracii, náš upřímný sokolský bratr, který zůstane trvale zapsán v dějinách jugoslávského Sokola a v srdcích všech věrných sokolů a který svou vytrvalou prací a neochvějnou věrností myšlenkám Tyrše a Fugnera zajistil, že v znovu svobodné demokratické Jugoslávii bude také opět obnovena bratrská organizace Jugoslávského sokolstva.

Every fibre of my being was alive, my blood was at a white heat. It was a warm, but dark, summer night. The sulphurous, dead air of the last few days had finally rolled itself up into black clouds. The stormy wind had whipped them before it earlier in the evening, then the mighty tempest burst its fury, a heavy shower came crashing down and the storm and rain lasted late into the night. I was sitting under the wooden arcade of the hotel called “At the Sign of the Three Lilies” near the Strahov Gate. It was a small inn, which in those times always had more numerous visitors on Sundays when, in the main room the cadets and corporals used to enjoy themselves dancing to the strains of a piano. Today it was Sunday. I sat under the arcades at a table close to the window, all alone. The mighty peals of thunder roared almost in constant succession, the downpour beat upon the tile roof above me, the water 86 AT THE SIGN OF THE THREE LILIES 87 drizzling in splattering streams to the ground, while the piano inside the main room had only brief intervals of rest, ever bursting into sound anew. At times I looked through the open doer at the whirling, laughing couples, and again I would gaze out into the dark garden. Sometimes when a brighter streak of lightning flashed I could see near the garden wall at the end of the arcade white piles of human bones. Formerly there had been a small burying-ground here and this very week they had dug up the skeletons from it in order to rebury them elsewhere. The ground was still torn up and the graves were open. However, I was able to remain at my table only a little while each time. Often I would arise and approach for a moment the wide-open door of the main saloon to have a closer look at the dancers. Each time I was attracted by a lovely girl of about eighteen years of age. Of slender figure, of full warm outlines, with loose black hair, cut just to the neck, an oval, smooth face, and bright eyes, she was indeed a beautiful young girl. Her eyes enchanted me. Liquid clear they were, as mysterious as the calm surface of water, yet so restless, recalling to you at once the words, “Sooner will a fire be satiated with wood and the sea with water than a beautiful-eyed maid will be satiated with men!” She danced almost constantly. But well she observed that she had attracted my gaze. Whenever she danced past the door in which I stood she would 88 CZECHOSLOVAK STORIES fasten her eyes on me, and as she danced on further into the hall I saw and felt that at every turn she bent her eye on me. I did not notice her talking to anyone during the course of the evening. Again I stood there. Our eyes met immediately, although the girl stood in the very last row. The quadrille was nearing its close, the fifth round was just being finished, when another girl entered the hall, all out of breath and dripping wet. She forced her way to the girl with the beautiful eyes. The musicians were just striking up the sixth set. While the first chain was being formed, the new-comer whispered something to the girl with the lovely eyes and the latter nodded her head silently. The sixth set lasted somewhat longer, a brisk young cadet calling the changes. WLen it came to an end, the beautiful girl glanced once more towards the door leading into the garden, then went to the front door of the hall. I could see her as she slipped out, covering her head with her outer garments and then she vanished. I went and sat down again at my place. The storm began anew as if it had not even begun to show its fury. The wind howled with renewed strength, the lightnings flashed. I listened shiveringly, but thought only of the girl, of those wondrous eyes of hers. To go home now was not, of course, to be even seriously thought of. After a quarter of an hour I again glanced towards the door of the dancing-hall. There again stood the AT THE SIGN OF THE THREE LILIES 89 girl with the enchanting eyes. She was arranging her wet garments, drying her damp hair, while some older girl companion helped her. “Why did you go home in such foul weather?” she asked. “My sister came for me.” I heard her voice for the first time. It was silkily soft and musical. “Did something happen at Lome?” “My mother just died.” My whole body quivered. The lovely eyed girl turned and stepped outside into the solitude. She stood near me, her eyes rested on mine. I felt her fingers close to my trembling hand. I seized her hand—it was so soft and tender. Silently I drew the girl farther and farther into the arcade and she followed freely. The storm had now reached its height. The wind lushed like a surging flood, heaven and earth roared, above our heads the thunders rolled, and all around us it was as if the dead were shrieking from their graves. She pressed close to me. I felt her damp clothing clinging to my breast. I felt her soft body, her warm glowing breath—I felt that I must drink out that depraved soul from the very depths of her being!

We found it to be most interesting and informative, and can't help but wonder why Sokol San Francisco does not make an effort to arouse more interest in Sokol through publicity such as this in our local newspapers and T.V. Any suggestions and/or volunteers? International Competition Spotlights Czech-Omaha Culture By Jane A. Kelley F OR the first time in a 124-year history, Omaha will host an interna- ---------tional Czech Slet (sports competition) this June. As the Czech Festival, a cultural celebration, opens in conjunction with the Slet, Omahans will be reminded of how extensively Czechs have influenced Omaha over the years. From the career of former Senator Roman Hruška to the Olympic medals of gymnast Jim Hartung, Czechs continue to leave a distinctive mark. The fact that Omaha attracted the Siet is in part a tribute to the size and contribution of the Czech community locally. Held every four- years, the Czech slet is the "Olympics” for Sokol-trained gymnasts from America, Canada and Europe. About 1,1)00 athletes and about 4,000 out-state visitors are expected to participate this June in Omaha. The event is sponsored by the American Sokol oiganization and hosted by all Sokol organizations in Omaha. Both the Slet and Sokols are forbidden by the Communist government of Czechoslovakia because of their original puipose — to promote the patriotism, freedom and physical fitness of a nation forced to face many invading countries and dictatorships. When the original Czech immigrant arrived in Omaha during the late 1800s, they brought with them a passion for religious and political freedom. Their Sokol organizations helped them organize and adjust to their new country, as well as preserve Czech language, music, dance, theatre, arts, gymnastics and more. Today, Omaha’s Sokols still offer Czech language training dance troupes that perform in traditional native costume and gymnasts who have ranked among the world’s best: Jim Har- tung, Phil Cahoy, Chuck Chemelka, John Kocourek — to name a few. . "The So^oi program (of gymnastics) started tn 1862 in Czechoslovakia and in 1865 in tiie -S.; explains Bug Benak, gymnast instruc- Jor who also senes as director of the Western * strict of Sokol along with his wife Sandra. ‘‘The founders combined ancient Greek philosophies and sports with the German gymnastics system ... One of the things we try to do (at Sokol), besides gymnastics training, is to impress ideals on our your people. We begin pretty early — 7, 8, 9 and 10 year olds. We have what we call Sokol quizzes where they hear little lectures concerning the kinds of things Sokol is about.” Hundreds of gymnastic students, ages 3 to adult, have been trained by Omaha's Sokol organizations. The young athletes can compete in local, district, national and international Sokol events as part of the group's regular program. Qualified S to 18 year olds can also compete in the U.S. Gymnastics Federation Program which opens doors to competitions with private gymnastics clubs, state meets, national competitions and gymnastics scholarships at various universities. To U.S. citizens of Czech descent. Omaha represents more than gymnastics, however. Though current population figures by nationality are difficult to develop, older population records show that Czechs were the largest nationality in Omaha in the 1930s with 3,947 native Czechs and 7,000 residents of Czech descent. A population study conducted just 10 years earlier ranked Omaha as the fifth largest Czech community in the nation. Traces of Czech culture in agriculture, architecture, commerce, the professions, journalism and politics can still be seen in todays Omaha.

The architecture of business buildings and homes show a Czech influence in the area once known as “Bohemian Tbwn” (between 10th and 16th Streets and between Pierce and Center Streets) and in “Brno” (between 10th and 13th Streets, south of Riverview Park). These Czech neighborhoods developed during the first influx of immigrants and later when packing plants in South Omaha w ere at a production peak. And in Lincoln, the Czech immigrant farmer is celebrated in a sculpture on the pinnacle of the Nebraska State Capitol Building. Besides the Sokols, several other Czech organizations contribute to the social and economic life of this area. Some of them are: The Czech Culture Club helps preserve the Czech language and culture. They show films, exhibit art and sene as the custodians of the Serpan Library of Czech literature from the late nineteenth century, as accumulated by the first Czech consul to the U.S. Nebraska Czeclis, Inc. is an umbrella organization that coordinates activities for all Czech- American organizations in Nebraska. They work to solve problems that might arise between the groups and develop programs that will mutually benefit all the organizations. In recent years, Nebraska Czechs, Inc. has conducted a Czech Queen competition, drawing contestants from more and more states each year. The Western Fraternal Life Association is a fraternal organization, with individual lodges involved in local civic programs, fellowship and other activities. acquisition of land. Most of them reached the Great Plains in time to receive free land offered by the Homestead Act. Known as one of the most organized nationalities to immigrate to America, the Czechs were an asset to the development and growth of their communities because of their skills, education, thrift, hard-working nature and readiness to assimilate into the American culture. About half of the early Czech immigrants reportedly became farmers. Others were factory workers, printers, electricians, welders, cigar makers and other tradesmen essential to the development of early Omaha. First and second generation Czech-Americans entered almost every other available occupation so now descendants range from doctors and lawyers to clergy and artists. Many Czech names can be found among the list of Omaha’s prominent business leaders, past and present. The first person of Bohemian birth to settle in Omaha was Ed Rosewater who came in 1863. The editor of the Omaha Bee, he went to great lengths to advertise the Nebraska territory to other Czechs. By 1872 he had published 17 newspapers, 61 books and several pamphlets. Omaha w'as known nationally for its Czech language publications. Writing in Ethnicity on the Great Plains, Bruce Garver, chairman of the History Department at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, recalls Omaha’s Czech journalist Jan Rosicky who “built his National Printing Company (Narodni tisKarna) into the largest Czech-language publishing house west of Chicago and won recognition as the leading Czech freethinker in the Western United States.” Garver notes that besides the many newspa- Czech language and literature is also being preserved by universities, such as the Universit}' of Nebraska at Omaha’s non-profit language program and the University' of Nebraska at Lincoln language program and collection of Czech manuscripts and publications — one of the most important collections in North America. The original Czech immigrants were drawn to Nebraska and the other Great Plains states by a desire for religious and political freedom along with a wish for a better life through the pers Rosicky published and distributed inside and outside of Nebraska, he emphasized the publication of material on practical subjects. Rosicky’s weekly Hospodar (The Husbandman) reached a circulation of almost 30,000, making it the world’s largest Czech-language newspaper devoted primarily to agriculture. Tbday Omahans of Czech descent have fully blended into America’s melting pot culture. However, the legacy of Czech culture and philosophy continues to offer progress and pleasure to Greater Omaha.© and [pageend14]OKOL SAN FRANCISCO VESTNIK JULY-AUGUST, SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER P Ai EDUCATIONAL CORNER — HISTORICAL DATES & FACTS OF JUNE 1, 1862 2, 1905 2, 6, 1934 1861 9, 14, 1369 1798 Unfurling of the banner of the Prague Sokol Unit designed by Josef es.

It wasn’t on the main road. It wasn’t on any general map or in any guidebook. Today Lidice is immortal. Accused of sheltering the men who eliminated Reinhard (The Hangman) Heidrich, it was destroyed by the Nazis on June 10, 1942. Its 200 men were shot, its 120 women sent to concentration camps, and its children shipped to “educational” institutions. The town was then burned to the ground and all its records—of births, marriages, and deaths—destroyed. This to pay for its unyielding courage, loyalty and resistance to tyranny. Lidice, however, did not die, as the Nazis boasted. On July 12, 1942, it was resurrected in name and in spirit here in the very heart of America. It became Lidice in Illinois, a new community for 100 defense workers and their families. Thus Lidice, U.S.A, answers the Nazi boast as a challenge to all efforts to destroy the love of freedom in the heart of civilized man. Here in Lidice, now Crest Hill, U.S.A, burns the Light of Liberty, a perpetual flame in a memorial dedicated to the martyrs of Lidice, Czechoslovakia, and to the defenders of liberty everywhere.
